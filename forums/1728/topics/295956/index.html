            <div class='col-md body'>I first came across the Sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's Fundamental Vows when I got my hands on a comic adapted version of it. Nothing is being changed from the original sutra, after having compared it with the sutra version.<br><br>One section from the sutra saddens me greatly, when I think about myself and others who have committed or will commit in the future in our dharma-ending age. I could not stop myself from weeping silently after reading the highlighted parts of the section...<br><br><a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap6.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap6.html</a><br><br>This following section is as follows from the above link:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">.."Furthermore, O Samantavipula, if, in the future, any evil people, together with evil deities or evil demons, should observe that a good man or a good woman takes refuge in worship and praises and pays obeisance to the image of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, and if they should act wrongly to ridicule and slander him or her, asserting such action to have no merit or virtue or benefit, and if these same evil people either laugh with their teeth exposed or object behind his or her back or persuade others to object together, or if there is any objection whatsoever by one person or by many people,<br><br>or if such a person or people have <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">even just one single thought of ridicule or slander</span></strong>-such scorners shall, as their retribution for this ridicule and slander, fall into Avici Hell and <span style="color: blue;"><strong>remain there until the Nirvana of one thousand Buddhas in the Bhadrakalpa, constantly receiving extremely severe punishment.</strong></span><br><br>In addition, even that kalpa will have to elapse before such scorners will be able to enter even the path of hungry ghosts. Another thousand kalpas will have to elapse before they can enter the path of animals.<br><br>Finally, still another thousand kalpas will have to elapse before they will be able to enter the path of human beings. However, even as human beings, they are bound to be poor, indigent, low and mean, deficient in some bodily organs and severely knotted mentally by evil karma so that they will surely always continue to fall onto one evil path of existence or another.<br><br>"So you see, O Samatavipula, it is bad enough to ridicule and slander others' donations and sincere worship; <span style="color: blue;"><strong>but it is much worse, indeed, to breed other wicked views that seek to bring about the destruction of the Buddhadharma.</strong></span></span><br><br>After reading it, I ask myself many times the same question: In that case, should we continue to spread and propagate this sutra? I know the answer is yes, cos the Buddha already instructed all Bodhisattvas and heavenly beings to aid in widespread propagation of this sutra. But what about fellow humans to fellow humans? Should we completely avoid mentioning this sutra or this section to fellow Buddhists who have yet heard of it or to members of the public who ask specifically for clarification on this section for fear they might even flash such demeaning thoughts in their mind without both his and my knowledge?<br><br>Since the Buddha mentioned it, it should be true that such scorners exist among both members of public and Buddhists, especially in our Dharma-Ending age. It could be members of other religions, it could be free-thinkers or atheists, it could also be fellow Buddhists who out of ignorance, commit the slandering thought or deed carelessly or deliberately.<br><br>Is there no salvation or hope for them?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we talk about dharma, we must see the conditions of that person. I think most open minded people are OK with it -- if you tell a commoner out there to chant ksitigarbha bodhisattva, unless he has ideas against buddhism, he probably will not give rise to such unwholesome thoughts.<br><br>That said, I have also mentioned:<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=293230&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=293230&amp;page=0</a><br><br><blockquote>I agree teachings should be open to all. However, I believe sometimes the purpose of keeping teachings restricted is not for the sake of restricting who can listen to the dharma, but rather, the teachings should be imparted under learned, experienced and qualified guidance lest one be misled. Just like the topic of meditation -- it is really advisable to learn meditation under a qualified teacher who can point out the right instructions to you and correct you so that you may practice correctly.<br><br>We should also be careful what knowledge we reveal to others. Just like the teachings of Emptiness should only be explained to those with the conditions to accept it.. I think it is somewhere in the Bodhisattva precepts or something, not to explain Emptiness to someone not ready to hear it. Not because he may not understand it yet (because if he don't understand we can still gradually explain to him), but because if the teachings are spoken and people grow aversion towards that teachings or cannot accept them, then this has a detrimental effect by preventing them from seeing the truth.<br><br>Not only I create obscuration for others, I create very bad karma for myself. I have personally experienced such things before and regretted speaking to persons without the right conditions. For this deed I was also 'abmonished' by Thusness. Sometimes it's better to stay silent and not speak the dharma. Therefore, 'Condition' is very very important.<br><br>AndrewPKYap should know -- he visit the other forum that I mentioned and should have witnessed what happened there.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Managed to find an answer about the selected verse above from this translated sutra of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's original vows done by the Buddhist Text Translation Society in U.S.A.<br><br>Excerpts of following answer by Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua, Chairman of the Certification Board of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, U.S.A.<br><br><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"..Are the periods of time mentioned in this passage definitely fixed: that is, will such person really have to spend a thousand aeons as hungry ghosts and as many among the animals?<br><br>These various retributions were made clear by Sakyamuni Buddha and are certain. There are, however, mitigating circumstances.<br><br>A hungry ghost who resolves his thoughts on compassion and acts as a protector for someone who is cultivating is an example. Ghosts may also see someone cultivating and decide to undertake the practice of bowing to the Buddhas. Because such ghosts plant good roots while they are still suffering for their offenses, they may escape some time in the realm of ghosts, and be reborn as animals or even as humans.<br><br>..People who come to realise that their poverty, low stature, and handicaps are a result of not having respected Earth Store Bodhisattva and of having slandered the Triple Jewel may change their ways. They may undertake the practice of vegetarianism and recitation of the Buddha's name, or they may even leave home to become bhikkhus. Such persons will not necessarily have to return to the states of woe.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Although Buddha dharma contains principles, it is totally alive, not fixed and dead; therefore it is necessary to look at each particular case to see what special conditions there may be. If someone guilty of offenses repents and reforms his conduct, it is not certain that he will have to fall into the states of woe."</span></span></blockquote>But it is not stated at all or in details what one needs to do in order to know that his/her repentance has completely cleansed the tremendously long and painful karma resulting from slandering/teasing/laughing at Ksitgarbha Bodhisattva's followers.<br><br>I suppose that still means there is not no hope at all for such people except to wait for the complete pay-off of their heavy karma.<br><br></div>

In fact, in Buddhist teachings, who's the first and last is not really of much importance. All Buddhas share the same dharma body and time is spoken by Buddhas so that sentient beings like humans can have a reference point when reading and trying to understand sutras.<br><br>It's true that Ksitigarbha bodhisattva did not "live" in hell.  All Bodhisattvas, Buddhas to be and Buddhas appear in countless forms to help all sentient beings. They can allow themselves to 'split' into countless manifestations to help any sentient being in suffering. SO there is no fixed place for them to be or not to be. But Ksitigarbha bodhisattva has great compassion for beings who are suffering the most in Hell, the worst realm among the 3 evil realms.<br><br>I mentioned Amitabha Buddha cos his name happens to represent 'infinite light and inexhaustible lifespan'.<br><br>One of Amitabha Buddha's vows is: "If I become a Buddha, the light from my body shall reach all corners of the countless Buddha-worlds of the Ten Directions. There will not be a place that my light cannot reach. If there is a corner or place where my light cannot shine into, I shall not attain Buddhahood."<br><br>'Light' in Buddhism represent wisdom and to me, it represents hope, warmth and complete deliverance from all suffering.<br><br></div>

As you go deeper into it, your understanding will improve as time goes by.<br><br>Anyway, it is really good to ask questions to clear any doubts cos enlightened beings have a clearer understanding in the essence of the teaching.

Actually I worry more for myself, cos I think my thoughts about certain Buddhist sutras are rather, you know, blasphemous or slanderous. Furthermore, my personal life experiences tells me that if I cannot tahan the so-called challenges in my life, I don't think I can' tahan punishment in hell after death.<br><br>But thanks for your encouragement, isis. I really appreciate your concern and advice.</div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>Karma is not fixed and it is too early to say that you will go to hell.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Don't think too much which can lead to ceaseless worry and unnecessarily speculation. Don't create stress for yourself.<br><br>Why not go into the four noble truth and the eightfold path, the very basic of buddhism? Personally the four noble truth really convince me why i should be a buddhist.<br><br>If you are not comfortable with these thought, can try repentance.</div>
