            <div class='col-md body'>Much of fengshui is common sense.  But fengshui is not limited to just geomancy or wind and water only. It interlocks with chinese astrology, the 3 calendar systems, some amount of social philosophy and astronomy in the 7 dipper stars.<br><br>There are traditional and contemporary practices (e.g. San He, water dragon and flying stars). And consist of both Yin and Yang mansion.<br><br>Not everyone is qualified to practise fengshui even with the right knowledge.

            <div class='col-md body'>The question most people ask is whether Buddhism accepts or rejects astrology. Strictly speaking, the Buddha did not make any direct pronouncement on this subject because as in many other cases, he stated that discussions on matters such as these do not pertain to spiritual development. Buddhism, unlike some other religions, does not condemn astrology and people are free to use the knowledge they can get from it to make their lives more meaningful. However, if we study the BuddhaÂ’s teaching carefully we will come to accept that a <strong>proper and intelligent understanding of astrology can be a useful tool. </strong><br><br>But astrology cannot automatically solve all your problems. You must do that yourself. Just like a doctor who can discover the nature of disease, an astrologer can only show certain aspects of your life and character. After that it is left to you adjust your way of life. Of course, the task will be made easier, knowing what it is you are up against. Some people are too dependent on astrology. They run to the astrologer everytime something happens or even if they have a dream. Remember, even today astrology is very much an imperfect science and even the best astrologers can make serious mistakes. Use astrology intelligently, just as you would use any tool which would make your life more comfortable and more enjoyable. Above all beware of fake astrologers who are out to cheat you by telling you not the truth, but what you want to hear.<br><br>Do not expect good luck to come to you or be handed to you easily without any effort on your part. If you want to reap the harvest, you must sow the seed and it must be the right seed. Remember, <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large">Â“Opportunity knocks at the door, but never break the lock to gain entranceÂ”.</span></span></span><br><br><strong>BUDDHISM AND ASTROLOGY By Ven.
