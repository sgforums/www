[/I]<br><br>1. Mahastamaprata is a ten bhumi great Bodhisattva who was accompanied by fifty-two Bodhisattvas. Here we can take the 52 Bodhisattvas as representation of the 52 stages of Bodhisattva development required before one attain the final stage, which is nearest to becoming a Buddha. The 52 stages are taught in the Avatamsaka sutra, which last Chapter 40, that of Bodhisattva Samantaprabha's Ten Vows also form a part of the Pureland School of thought. One can know the many levels of Bodhisattvas and Arhats there are in the Western Pureland of Amitabha, and the long path of a Bodhisattva towards supreme Buddhahood.<br>2. The Bodhisattva said that he remembers a Buddha Limitless Light from many eons ago. He has the penetration of recalling without hindrance affairs of eons past, much like a Buddha already. In fact, I think he and Bodhisattva Kuan Yin are actually Buddhas enlightened who manifest a Bodhisattva body to liberate and teach sentient beings in the ten directions.<br>3. How long is an eon? The Buddha Shayamuni gave analogy of rubbing a silk cloth one every hundred years over a mountain as high and big as Mount Himalaya. And when that mountain has been ground to fine dust on the earth, the single eon is still not complete yet.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During that same eon, there were twelve successive Thus Come Ones, the last of whom was called Light Surpassing the Sun and the Moon Buddha. Those Buddhas taught me the Buddha-recitation Samadhi:<br><br>1. During the same eon, which as we have defined above, is an incalculable long period of time, there arose twelve Supremely Enlightened Buddhas one after another. It is said that in a auspicious eon between 4 to 1000 Buddhas could appear in the world to again re-discover the Dharma after the Buddhadharma before it has completely disappeared. Our eons has Shakyamuni Buddha as the fourth.<br><br>2. Why did the sutra mentioned twelve Buddhas, and not 7 or 14 within an eon? The intent is simple and could be taken to remind us of the twelve realms of mental habits which are all illusive and empty. Realizing the 12 realms as empty of any own being could set us free from suffering. What are the 12 realms we should know? There are the six sense organs and its corresponding sense-objects, eg. the eye and the eye-objects are two realms. After we realize the emptiness of the 12 realms, we will be liberated and enlightened. Thus, the meaning of the last Buddha to appear called Light-Surpassing the Sun and Moon Buddha. Sun and Moon representing the dispelling of all darkness as when the sun rises in the east to reveal all clarity. The six sense organs and its correpsonding sense-objects (12 realms) is a powerful tool or method for attaining liberation. One should seek to study more and understand these twelve realms.<br><br>3. All these 12 Buddhas, not just one or a few, taught the Buddha-recitation Samadhi of achieving enlightenment. If this method is not all important, these past Buddhas would not need to teach them. Thus the significance of Pureland school teachings given to the Buddha-Recitation Samadhi. What then, is this samadhi and how do we cultivate it?<br><br>To be continued .....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Suppose there are two people, one of whom always remembers the other, while the other has entirely forgotten about the first one. Even if these two people were to meet or see each other, it would be the same as not meeting or seeing each other. On the other hand, if two people develop intense memories for one another, then in life after life, they will be together like an object and its shadow, and they will never be separated.<br><br>1. Here the Bodhisattva Great Strength details the principle or theory of this Buddha-Recitation method. This requirement is for two people to be intensely remembering or mindful of each other. If only the Buddhas is mindful of us, and we go about thinking wandering thought instead of practicing mindfulness of Buddhas, even if the Buddhas are standing before us, we will never ever feel their presence let alone see them in dreams and images. In reality, the one who always remebers us are the Buddhas. Both must be of the same frequency to tune in clearly.<br><br>The Thus Come Ones of the ten directions are tenderly mindful of living beings just like a mother remembering her son. But if the son runs away, of what use is the motherÂ’s concern? However, if the son remembers his mother in the same way that the mother remembers her son, then in life after life mother and son will never be far apart.<br><br>1. The Bodhisattva gives and example to draw out the finer points. The Thus Come Ones (another name for Buddhas) of the ten directions are always tenderly remembering living beings like us. It is important that we note the Bodhisattva said "the Buddhas of the ten directions", not just one Buddha, such as Amitabha or Medicine Buddha, or Many-Jeweled Buddha, etc. So, all Buddhas look upon us like a mother remembering her sons.<br>2. If the son runs away means that living beings are not cultivating the Buddhas' teachings and instead runs after sense pleasures of body, speech, and mind. However, if we living beings practice mindfulness of Buddhas, any one Buddha or Buddhas, or the Dharmas, we are in the same manner way, the Buddhas of the ten directions are remembering us. With the two remembering one another always, in life and life we will never be apart. After this life we will be born in Purelands of Buddhas of our choice. Naturally, I would expect one who remembers Amitabha to be born in his Western Pureland.<br>3. This key point in this two paragraphs is to constantly be mindful of Buddhas. How are we to be mindful? Chanting the Buddha name, reciting the sutras and studying the Buddhadharma, visualization of the Buddha Purelands of many jewels and precious trees, ponds and flowing waters. These are activities all being mindful of the Buddhas.<br><br>To be continued ....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the causal ground, I used mindfulness of the Buddha to be patient with the non-arising of both beings and dharmas. Now in this world I gather in all those who are mindful of the Buddha, and I bring them back to the Pure Land.<br><br>1. When the Bodhisattva Great Strength was still on the causal ground, like where we are now unenlighten and practicing the Path, he used Mindfulness of the Buddha, as taught to him by the past 12 Buddhas as the principal method to gain enlightenment. Of course we know from this sutra taht this was many eons ago.<br><br>2. "To be patient with the non-arising of both beings and dharmas" mean not following thoughts or/and sensations of forms and marks of tangible objects that have arisen through the use of the six sense organs and its accompanying sense-objects. "dharmas" are the myriads phenomena arising from feelings, perceptions, mental formations and consciousness. Example, when the eye (organ) sees a living person (eye-object), the mind quickly recalls the Buddha through chanting or saying aloud or in silent, before the consciousness of this person could even arise. Therefore, there is no discrimination of whether the person is a female or male form, pretty or ugly, fat or slim, etc. The eye-consciousness (18 realms) of the sense object cease to arise and where one does not follow along with thoughts of it. This is called returning the dharma or delusion to its source. This is untying the knots of delusion. This is "to be patient with the non-arsing of both beings and dharmas."<br><br>3. Then the Bodhisattva said, in this world (possible also in the worlds of the ten directions because the assembly that gathered there at the beginning of the Dharma talk were from all over the great trichilicosm. The Bodhisattva was then talking to the great assembly although addressing the Buddha), I gather in all those who are mindful of the Buddha, and bring them back to the Pureland. Does this Pureland mean the Western Pureland of Amitabha Buddha? Possibly yes, and also the Pureland of your choice. This sutra section does not say anything about vow and desire to be reborn into Pureland. It emphasizes Mindfulness of Buddha as a skill to cross over to the other shore, of Buddha Purelands where one will eventually become enlightened through the fragrance and lights of being close to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas.<br><br>To be continued .....<br><br></div>
