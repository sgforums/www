              <h1>Addiction<br></h1>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>Events happen, deeds are done, 
              but there is no individual doer thereof.</em><br> <br> --The Buddha</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>Choice implies 
              consciousness--a high degree of consciousness. Without it, you have no 
              choice.</em><br> <br> --Eckhart Tolle</p>
              <p class="tdtextindent"><em>Your suffering is your own 
              activity. It is something that you are doing moment to moment. It is a 
              completely voluntary activity…all you are doing is pinching yourself. 
              When you realize that, you just take your hand away.</em><br> <br> --Adi Da</p>
              <p>People frequently ask me questions regarding addiction. In
               a sense, addiction <em>is </em> our basic human problem. It doesn't 
              have to be addiction to alcohol and drugs. I would define addiction as 
              any habitual behavior that feels out of control, compulsive, and 
              destructive. Most people are addicted to painful ways of thinking. Some 
              people have an addictive relationship to normally healthy activities 
              such as eating or sex. As a society, we in the United States are 
              addicted to oil. But whatever the behavior or substance, the basic 
              underlying mechanism is something that probably every human being has 
              experienced in some form.</p>
              <p>Addiction seeks pleasure, pain relief, escape from 
              suffering, numbness or excitement. Avoiding pain and seeking pleasure 
              are conditioned survival functions that make perfect sense in a certain 
              practical context.  But in human beings, these basic survival instincts 
              can become seriously misdirected in ways that are extremely destructive.
               The more we seek pleasure and run from pain in compulsive and 
              destructive ways, the more painful it gets. Momentary highs are followed
               by devastating lows. The solution to this downward spiral is to stop 
              indulging in the addictive substance or activity.</p>
              <p>Can we choose to do this? Many people ask me if “no self” 
              and “no choice” means there is nothing anyone can do to end an addictive
               pattern. People wonder if trying to stop smoking or drinking violates 
              some basic tenet of Advaita or radical nonduality. If everything is 
              perfect as it is, and if there is no self and no free will, then who 
              would want or be able to change anything and why would they want to?   
              This is a misunderstanding of Advaita and nonduality.</p>
              <p>Change is the very nature of life and your actions and 
              abilities and desires and insights are part of how totality is 
              functioning. In one sense, it's absolutely true that everything is 
              perfect just as it is, including addiction, and yet, it's equally true 
              that we have a natural desire to wake up from entrancement and 
              suffering.</p>
              <p>Conceptually, as a description of reality, we can say that
               everything that happens is the result of infinite causes and conditions
               and that there is no independent executive calling the shots -- in this
               sense, we speak of there being no self and no choice. But the bodymind <em>can </em> learn or be trained in all kinds of ways so that it has more 
              choices, better choices, more control, more refined control, more 
              possibilities, or however you want to put it.  A skilled athlete has 
              more choices, more control, more possibilities for how to move her body 
              than someone without that training and practice.  A skilled writer has 
              more choices, more control, more possibilities for how to express 
              himself clearly in words than someone who is illiterate. And in the same
               way, it is possible to learn skills in recovery programs or in therapy 
              or in meditation or wherever that give us more choices, more 
              possibilities, and more ability to respond constructively rather than 
              destructively to certain feelings, urges, discomforts and upsets. We can
               become aware of how we are pinching ourselves – how we are doing our 
              suffering – and in seeing that, quite naturally, we stop. </p>
              <p>Yes, in the larger sense, <em>all </em> of this learning 
              happens out of infinite causes and conditions and could not be otherwise
               in any moment than exactly how it is. No independent executive is 
              "doing" any of this. But still, it <em>can </em> happen (when it can). 
              So although there is no choice in one sense, you still have to play the 
              game. There <em>is </em> a power <em>right here </em> that acts and <em>you
               are that. </em></p>
              <p>Whatever life moves us to do to refine and enhance the 
              functioning of the bodymind is wonderful. I'm very grateful that I'm not
               still drinking myself to death, smoking several packs of cigarettes a 
              day, and flying into uncontrollable rages as I was forty years ago. It 
              certainly seems that psychotherapy, meditation, martial arts training, 
              and various forms of awareness work had something to do with bringing 
              about that transformation. So there is nothing wrong with so-called 
              "self-improvement." The problem comes when we think there is a self to 
              improve, or when we fall into the erroneous presumption that there is an
               executive at the helm who can accomplish this task on command, or when 
              we assume that there is any single recipe for transformation that always
               works, because when we believe those ideas, it becomes a set up for 
              guilt, shame, blame, frustration, despair or self-righteousness.  </p>
              <p>There are many approaches to working with addiction. The 
              best path for another may not be the best path for you, and what looks 
              like failure may be the perfect unfolding. Whether an addiction stops or
               continues, it cannot be otherwise in any moment than how it is. When 
              you really see that there is no separation anywhere and no independent 
              self, then nothing that happens is taken personally anymore. This is a 
              huge relief, and for this liberating realization, I recommend <a href="http://www.joantollifson.com/books.html">my own 
              books</a> and also the books on my <a href="http://www.joantollifson.com/recommend.html">recommended
               book list</a> by Darryl Bailey, Leo Hartong, Tony Parsons, Sailor Bob 
              Adamson, Nathan Gill, Wayne Liquorman, Chuck Hillig, Jeff Foster, Gary 
              Crowley and Karl Renz. The most effective way of undoing addiction that I
               know of is non-judgmental, open awareness of what is happening right 
              now in this moment without seeking a result or trying to change it in 
              any way – simply seeing it clearly. For more on that kind of approach, I
               would recommend my books, all of which talk extensively about 
              addiction, and also my article on <a href="http://www.joantollifson.com/writing6.html">“Meditation
               and Inquiry,”</a> one of the outpourings on this website, where I talk 
              about how an addictive thought pattern was dissolved through meditation 
              and awareness. Also for more on this kind of approach, I would recommend
               a number of the other authors on my recommended book list such as Toni 
              Packer, Eckhart Tolle, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Anthony deMello, Gangaji, Joko 
              Beck, Pema Chodron, Cheri Huber, Thich Nhat Hanh, Claude Anshin Thomas, 
              J. Krishnamurti and Mary O'Malley. And I'll say more about that kind of 
              approach later in this article as well. In addition, and in a somewhat 
              different vein, I recommend the excellent chapter on addiction in a book
               called <em>The Guru Papers</em>, which is also on my recommended book 
              list.</p>
              <p>There are many recovery programs available such as <a href="http://www.aa.org/">AA</a> and other Twelve Step 
              programs, <a href="http://www.smartrecovery.org/">Smart 
              Recovery</a>, and many others that you can find through the internet. 
              Although I do not agree with many of his ideas and opinions, I got some 
              valuable insights from reading Jack Trimpey's book, <em>Rational 
              Recovery.</em> In particular, I found his AVRT (Addictive Voice 
              Recognition Technique) quite useful, and <em>some</em> of his thinking 
              about addiction and his challenges to the recovery movement are 
              provocative and interesting, but his fanatical dogmatism and right-wing 
              views on many issues are totally abhorrent to me. Mindfulness-based 
              cognitive therapy (<a href="http://www.mbct.com/">MBCT</a>),
               Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (<a href="http://www.stevenchayes.com/">Steven C. Hayes</a>),
               other forms of psychotherapy, meditation, yoga, changes in diet, and 
              somatic awareness work such as Feldenkrais can all be helpful in 
              recovery. The support of a recovery group, a therapist, or a true friend
               can be very important. But there is no one right way, so don't assume 
              anyone else knows what's best for you.</p>
              <p>Most in the addiction recovery world believe that total 
              and permanent abstinence is the only real solution to addiction, but in 
              the case of some addictions, such as overeating, complete abstinence 
              from the addictive substance is not an option. I sobered up in 1973 from
               alcoholic drinking by working with a therapist who believed that 
              permanent abstinence was not always necessary. I was completely 
              alcohol-free for almost a year, then with the permission of my 
              therapist, I tried drinking again in moderation. I got drunk a few times
               early on in this process, but for most of the next thirty years I 
              rarely ever drank and never in excess. Years went by between one beer 
              and the next, most of my friends were non-drinkers, I rarely had any 
              desire to drink and no desire to drink excessively. This recovery model 
              seemed successful. Then after thirty years, I began drinking again in a 
              way that felt addictive. The amount I was drinking and the frequency of 
              it were very mild compared to the kind of wild drinking I had done 
              thirty years earlier, but I could still feel that it was addictive and, 
              for me, dangerous and unhealthy. For several years, I simply watched it 
              with awareness until a clear decision emerged not to drink at all 
              anymore. This decision came from beyond the mind, not from some exertion
               of will-power. I now recommend complete and permanent abstinence 
              whenever possible as the safest and most reliable cure for addiction. 
              That may not be the only route or the best route for everyone, but 
              trying to do something in moderation that has previously been addictive 
              can definitely be dangerous, like playing with fire, and it <em>can</em> invite self-deception, denial and setbacks. For one thing, it keeps the
               desire and the possibility alive. It keeps the door open. It takes 
              self-awareness and honesty not to pull the wool over your own eyes.</p>
              <p>However you recover from an addiction, be aware that old 
              habits may recur and that addiction is a powerful force. Even after 
              decades of being free from an addiction, it can return, as I discovered.
               Anything that goes away can come back, and anything that comes, can go 
              away again. Don't ever assume otherwise. This is true not only for 
              things like drinking and smoking, but it applies to addictive thought 
              patterns and emotions as well, and it is why I often say that there is 
              no permanently enlightened person. The wisest people I know don't define
               themselves and they remain open to being surprised.</p>
              <p>If you're not ready or able yet to stop the addiction 
              completely, or if moderation is your aim and not total abstinence, then I
               would suggest giving careful, non-judgmental, open attention to the 
              addictive activity whenever it occurs. This is what I did when I found 
              myself drinking again in an addictive way, so let's take drinking as an 
              example. Pay attention to the first impulse for a drink -- what triggers
               it, how does it happen, what does it feel like, what goes on -- what is
               this urge itself actually like – what thoughts are showing up, what 
              mental images, how does it feel in the body -- and then the whole 
              process of "deciding" whether to give in and indulge, how does that 
              unfold, what are your thoughts telling you -- and then buying the 
              bottle, opening it up, pouring the drink -- what does each moment in 
              this process feel like in the body – and then the first sip, what is 
              that like – and how do you feel after one drink -- what is pleasurable 
              about it, what isn't – what moves you to have a second drink, what <em>is </em> this urge, do you really want another drink or is something else 
              going on – how do you feel after that second drink -- simply paying 
              attention and observing. You'll learn a lot. There are no "right" or 
              "wrong" answers to these questions, and the answers may be different at 
              different moments. It's all about paying attention, being aware of your 
              thoughts, feeling sensations, discovering what is <em>actually</em> going on every step of the way.  When you realize that you are pinching 
              yourself, and when you see how it happens – what the allurement is, how 
              it seduces you, how you do it, how it hurts – naturally, you stop.</p>
              <p>The more the light of awareness shines on these habitual 
              mechanisms, and the more clarity there is about how they work,  the more
               choice and the more possibility there is. The urge for a drink may 
              still arise, but it may be possible not to go with it.   And when it 
              isn't possible, then you drink. And you notice what that's like. Maybe 
              over time drinking happens less and less, and maybe alcoholic drinking 
              falls away completely at some point. Maybe at some point a clear 
              decision and intention to stop emerges, as it did for me.</p>
              <p>And if sobriety doesn't happen and drinking continues, 
              then it could not be otherwise. Whatever happens in each moment is the 
              result of infinite causes and conditions. Everything is the way it is 
              because the whole universe is the way it is. Some bodyminds have more 
              stormy weather than other bodyminds, just as different cities have 
              different weather conditions. We each contain the whole universe, the 
              saint and the sinner. There is no one to blame because everything is the
               cause and the effect of everything else. But don't think that this <em>description</em> of reality means that there is nothing to do, or that everything won't 
              change in the next moment.</p>
              <p>There is often tremendous social pressure to indulge in 
              addictive behaviors. People who are indulging tend to prefer the company
               of others who are also indulging. It often takes real courage to be the
               only one in a group who is not indulging in something. One reason I 
              have decided to completely and permanently stop drinking is that I want 
              to be supportive to others who are trying to live without drinking. But 
              that doesn't mean I think everyone should renounce alcohol. There are 
              some spiritual teachers who encourage everyone, addicted or not, to 
              totally renounce alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, television, movies that 
              contain violence, caffeine, sugar, meat, and the list goes on. This kind
               of renunciation and purity may lead to real clarity and well-being, and
               it may be truly beneficial, but it <em>can</em> also become a 
              self-righteous form of puritanical control and perfectionism, which is 
              often the flip side of addiction. Different ways of living may be 
              appropriate and beneficial at different times in our lives. There is no 
              single way that is right for everyone all the time. Follow your heart, 
              not the crowd.</p>
              <p>It is indeed very liberating to realize that addiction and
               the freedom from addiction are not personal faults or achievements, and
               that whatever is showing up could not be otherwise in this moment than 
              exactly how it is. This is the understanding of radical nonduality. But 
              don't mix up the relative and the absolute or confuse descriptions with 
              prescriptions. Although unicity is all there is, and everything is the 
              cause and the effect of everything else, you are not separate from 
              unicity. Don't get stuck in concepts and beliefs about “no self” and “no
               choice.” As one satsang teacher very wisely put it, don't hang yourself
               in an Advaitic noose.   If you're pinching yourself, by all means stop 
              (if you can). You may think life without the addiction will be 
              unbearable, but my experience is that the truth is exactly the opposite.</p>
