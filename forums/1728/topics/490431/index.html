              of thoughts. On the contrary, I would say that meditation helps us to
              creatively engage with our thoughts and not fixate on them. When people say
              they cannot concentrate, I say, “No, no, no! You are concentrating—too much on
              any one thought!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is interesting in meditation to notice all the different places where
              our thoughts lead us—what distracts us and what occupies our minds. It is
              important to notice these things in meditation because these will be the same
              things that occupy our minds in daily life. As we become more familiar with our
              thoughts in meditation, we will see how repetitive our thoughts are. We often
              think very similar things over and over again and it is actually rare to have
              what I would call a creative, original thought.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>What I recommend is to follow the breath, or let sounds be the object of
              your concentration [see here], or try body-awareness meditation. Then ask
              yourself, Where did I go? When I was distracted, what did I do? And then you
              can see that you have many different types of thoughts, which generally fall
              into three categories: light, intense, and habitual.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Often we try to work with our thoughts only when they reach a high level
              of intensity. By then I would say it is too late, because they are already so
              strong and so powerful that it is very hard to work with them. The only thing
              we can do when we are really caught in heavy, obsessive thoughts is to realize
              the cause—maybe something happened and you are upset. Just be careful not to
              feed the intensity. I think that meditation practices can help here. For
              example, when coming back to the breath time after time, if you’re really
              obsessive then you’ll eventually notice, “Oh, I’m obsessive.” Then try to come
              back to the breath just a little bit, just for a few seconds. Then keep coming
              back. This may not remove the intensity of the thoughts completely, but at least
              their intensity will diminish, and generally the thoughts won’t last as long.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As we meditate, we become more aware of the habitual nature of our
              thoughts. I think of this level as consisting of the mental grooves that our
              thoughts habitually follow. Meditation helps us break free of these habitual
              patterns and unleash the original and creative power of thought.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Daydreaming is an important mental habit to be aware of. Daydreaming can
              be very frustrating. If you have a tendency to daydream in daily life, then you
              will often compare what you experience in your life to what happened in your
              daydream, where everything went according to plan. Daydreams are seductive.
              It’s like a film where we are the actor, the scriptwriter, the director, the
              producer. We even sell the popcorn. It can be wonderful, we can tweak whatever
              we like and do whatever we want—but then we have to come back to reality, where
              things don’t always go our way. I think we need to know when we are
              daydreaming— not in order to judge but to come back to the moment and say, “Oh,
              I’m lost in a daydream.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I remember when I was a nun and was meditating ten hours a day. Instead
              of meditating, though, I would daydream about it! I would daydream about going
              to a hermitage, practicing very hard, becoming awakened, and saving everybody.
              When I realized this was not meditation, I went back to truly cultivating my
              practice. I was then able to restore the mental energy I spent daydreaming to
              its original purpose: creative imagination. When I write a book, I don’t
              daydream about writing a book. I just think: What about this? What about that?
              When I go to write, I become very imaginative and creative. I bring it all back
              to creative imagination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Light mental patterning is natural, and it is the easiest level to work
              with. A live brain is active, constantly firing and thinking of something. We
              will have aimless trains of thoughts, weird association of ideas, shopping
              lists or light planning. These are interesting in that due to their lightness,
              we can play with them more easily and also laugh at them as we recognize
              certain motifs and see how unnecessary they are. I can see a “preparing
              luggage” loop. Since I recognized this loop, I only indulge in it near to the
              time of departure and not for very long. Having become aware of it, I find it
              pointless, as I know that I am quite able to do my luggage quickly and
              efficiently.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We need to recognize light mental patterning,
              because under certain circumstances we move quickly from light to habitual to
              intense and we find ourselves in the grip of an obsession, which just started
              as a faint wisp of thought in the mind. We do not need to be afraid of our
              mind. We can go on a journey of discovery and experiment. Then we are able to
              play with our mental processes and develop our mental ability in wisdom and
              compassion.</span></p>
