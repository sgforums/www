              <p>By the way a Vajrayana friend of mine said don't rush first -- one should observe the guru for a while first, like a few months or even 1 or 2 years and seeing that the criteria of a good guru is met before choosing the guru. I think this is a good advice, and is in line with advice given in traditional texts.</p>
              <p>Here's something useful I found:</p>
              <div class="postcontent">The spiritual friend as a ordinary being</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>This
                      kind of teacher is the one, who has been explained most elaborately by
                      Gampopa in this text Jewel Ornament of Liberation (Snow Lion, by
                      Gampopa, translated by Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen Ripoche).</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The
                      reason, why he goes so much into details is because this is the kind of
                      teacher who is relevant for us. That is why it is also very important
                      for us to know, how this teacher should be, what the actual
                      characteristic of a qualified teacher is. The best kind of ordinary
                      teacher has :</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>8 qualities</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br> 4 qualities</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br> 2 qualities minimum</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The eight qualities are:</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The
                      first quality is that the teacher should be somebody who himself has
                      taken the Bodhisattva vow and who is practising according to his
                      promise, somebody who is not himself against the Bodhisattva training.
                      What the Bodhisattva training exactly consists of will be explained
                      later.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The second quality is that the teacher should be somebody who
                      himself has received the teaching of the Bodhisattva path and he has to
                      be able to instruct the disciples in the Bodhisattva training.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The
                      third quality is that he should have some experience and practise.
                      These first three qualities refer to what kind of qualities a teacher
                      should have developed in his mind. The next five refer to the qualities
                      who are needed while he is teaching disciples.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The fourth quality is
                      that he should only be concerned about how he can benefit his students
                      while teaching. He should not think about how he can get money from the
                      disciples, get a good name or control the students. He should only be
                      motivated by the thought of benefiting others.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The fifth quality is
                      that when he is teaching, he should have the capacity to teach with
                      confidence, that he does not loose his courage and that he has the
                      ability to give the complete teaching. This is referring especially to
                      the teaching about the emptiness. He has to be able to transmit the
                      teachings in a powerful way without being afraid of it.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The sixth
                      quality is patience or acceptance. He should be able to take any kind
                      of hardship in his function. If it is very cold, hot or if he is
                      hungry, he should be able to take it and not let it disturb his
                      activity. He should have the patience not to get tired of all kinds of
                      questions he will be asked.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The seventh quality is motivation. He
                      should never get tired of teaching others. If the disciples are quite
                      impulsive or behaving in a bad way he should not give up or loose his
                      motivation. Ex.: If some students do not like him or his work anymore,
                      if they are criticising him, it should not turn him away from teaching,
                      instead he should put even more effort in improving his own teaching.
                      This means especially if one has some disciples who turned against one,
                      at that moment the teacher should not feel sad about it, but should
                      make wishes and try to think that one would be able to help this person
                      at an other time. If one is directly confronted one can have a
                      discussion.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The eighth quality is that during the teachings one
                      should only talk in a meaningful and straight way about what ever one
                      is teaching, one should not waste the time by talking nonsense, but
                      stick to the important teachings. He has to make sure that what he says
                      has some effect on the students, that it will help them to understand
                      what one is talking about.<br><br>(These teachings are based on the Alankarika-Sutra).<br><br>The teacher himself should have studied a lot and know properly the different Mahayana texts and Sutras.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The
                      teacher should be able to clarify doubts and questions of the students.
                      He should have patience, be willing to listen to the questions of the
                      students and have the capacity to give satisfying and in this way
                      clarifying answers.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The teachings, lets say about the disadvantages
                      of Samsara and the advantages of Nirvana, should not only be empty
                      words. He should somehow have some understanding of what he is talking
                      about and not just repeat the words without knowing what it means. The
                      teacher himself also should live in accordance with what he teaches and
                      not act totally different. His motivation should be only to benefit his
                      students.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The teacher should be able to explain clearly about the
                      relative and the ultimate teachings, the emptiness, and to transmit an
                      understanding of what this means.<br>The teacher with the two qualities while teaching the Mahayana-path.<br>He himself must have taken the bodhisattva-vow<br>And have compassion to teach other beings</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Basically
                      he should know for himself what he teaches. If he teaches, for example,
                      the Ngondro, he should know the Ngondro himself.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>For the students
                      it is important to examine his teacher to make sure that he is
                      qualified, because if he is not, one risks to go the wrong way on the
                      path. The student also should know about the background of the teacher,
                      where he comes from and what he has done so far. The Lama always will
                      say nice things and his pupils will always say nice things about him,
                      so one has to check.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Example: In the 12th century Kublai Khan
                      invited Sakya Pandita to come and to be his teacher. But for the first
                      three years he did not ask him for teaching. He only kept him there,
                      gave him food and treated him very nicely as his guest. He was kind of
                      checking him Then after three years he decided that he could be his
                      teacher. Because of that function Sakya Pandita was the first Lama to
                      get the position of king in Tibet. When the emperor finally came to
                      Sakya Pandita and requested him to teach, he said: OK, but I have to
                      examine you. So another three years Sakya Pandita examined, whether he
                      was a proper student. After these six years it was established that
                      Kublai Khan was the student and Sakya Pandita was his teacher. He gave
                      him teachings. However, he did not live so long and before he died, he
                      told the Kublai Khan, that Jamgon Pakpa, his nephew, should be his
                      teacher. So Jamgon Pakpa became the king of Tibet.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Definitely one
                      should examine the teacher or one might go a wrong way. One of the
                      reasons that it is so important is that once you decided for a teacher,
                      then you have to follow his Dharma instructions. You must listen to his
                      teachings and practise what he is instructing you. Otherwise you won't
                      get any results on your path.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>A question might occur to some people
                      who did not examine their teacher and then found out that he was not
                      completely OK: What to do? If that is the case, then the best thing is
                      to leave it in neutral. The student should not think that the teacher
                      is bad or good, without judging too much one should leave it in neutral
                      and keep a certain distance.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Example: Just when a bee has taken the
                      honey from a flower then whatever he got he can use. In the same way:
                      If we have received some Dharma teachings from a teacher and then find
                      out that he is not acting according to the Dharma, something is not
                      completely OK, then we should just leave it by that and keep a distance
                      from him. But whatever Dharma we received, this is something beneficial
                      and we can use it.<br>The means of attending</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>In the text follow
                      instructions on how to attend a qualified teacher. Acting according to
                      these instructions will definitely help the student to develop quicker
                      on the path. His qualities will develop.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>There are three different ways of attending the teacher.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Through respect and service</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Traditionally
                      respect to the teacher is shown by prostrating to him before he gives
                      Dharma teachings. If for instance the students are already present, as
                      a sign of respect, they get up when the teacher comes in.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>This is
                      more a traditional and cultural thing. But what is not cultural and
                      what is the most important is that one has mentally respect towards the
                      teacher. And that one respectfully regards the teacher. This must be
                      the attitude towards the teacher. Of course one has to be flexible with
                      that and one should also know and see what kind of situation it is.
                      Sometimes the Lama teaches in a huge hall somewhere in the world. If
                      the teacher comes in and all the students jump up and start to
                      prostrate, the other people who are not involved, might think that they
                      descended from another planet. That would be more harmful than useful.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The
                      Buddha himself tells directly that one should show respect according to
                      where one is (country, tradition). So this is very relative.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>For
                      instance, even at the time of the Buddha there were different customs.
                      In some parts of India it was respectful to let the most respectable
                      person go first and the others followed. In other parts, the other
                      people had to go in front of him. But what is not conditioned by
                      customs and tradition is the mental attitude. There it is important to
                      have respect.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Another thing that is not depending on culture is that
                      the student need to feel that can never get enough teachings. When you
                      have listened to teachings you should not think that you have heard
                      enough. You should be always open to go deeper while receiving more
                      teachings. But of course when the teacher is always teaching the same,
                      it is OK if you think, I heard it before, so right now I do not have to
                      hear it again.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Since the Buddha's teachings are so vast and so
                      profound that not one single teacher can know everything. Then in order
                      to get the information of Buddhist teachings, it is good to receive
                      them from different teachers. If one teacher knows everything it is
                      enough.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Example: There was a very high master and scholar in Tibet, Jamyang Khyentse in the 19th century who attended 150 teachers.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Through aspiration and veneration</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The
                      second aspect of the first way of attending the teacher is to serve him
                      in the way that if he needs something (food, clothes, etc.), one can
                      provide him with what can be helpful. One should be willing to do it
                      whenever necessary.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>Through practise and endeavour regarding the practice Milarepa is used as an example.</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>The benefit - as stated in the Gandavyuhasutra</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>To attend a qualified teacher in the right way will give a lot of positive results and benefit:</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>You will not fall back into lower existences</div>
              <div class="postcontent"><br>You will not get into bad company, not get a bad teacher or be influenced by negative people</div>
