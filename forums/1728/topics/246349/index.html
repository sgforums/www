Thank you all.<br>[/b]</blockquote>I applaud your effort to post this, in the spirit of Vegetarianism.  There are now loads of alternatives, which has made eating meat a plain wants rather than needs.  This is why 14th Dalai Lama, 17th Karmapa and Mahayan great practitioners has public advocated vegetarianism, and emphasised the importance of to cultivating compassion towards all sentient beings.  Like you, I firmly believed that the death place of an an animal should be in the while, not in our abbatoir.  Be it cruel killing or not, the animals were petrified when they see the knife that will slit their throat, and it is plain human selfishness that we are putting them through these ordeal.<br><br></div>

Such a large scale killing will result in heavy collective karma and can cause many disasters. It is also a cause of so many wars around the world. The animals we kill may return to fight with us in war in the future.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi CP25, you are definitely a compassionate person becos you truly understand the meaning of not eating meat. Pls continue to cultivate such quality of compassion.<br><br>Hi Sunny6110, of cos as Buddhists we believe in Ying guo bao ying; which is exactly why we should stop all killings. Eating meat is indirectly or directly one of the actions of killing. When we are eating the animals, yes, we can say it is the animals' ying guo bao ying; but while eating them, we ourselves are also planting a cause for our own ying guo bao ying in the future ( can be in this lifetime thru illness or diseases like mad cow disease, bird flu, various virus etc.)<br><br>We can only say that it is very difficult for a meat eater to change his diet to  become a vegetarain overnight. But we should try, albeit slowly, as what Buddha has taught some of his diciples before. Cultivate compassion at the same time, and we will one day refuse meat completely naturally.<br><br>My way is to start with giving up one type of meat at a time. Eg. stop eating beef first ( which many chinese have already been doing but maybe for superstitious reasons), then stop eating mutton, then ducks, then goose, and so on; create you own list. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Or another way is to reduce your consumption of meat in quantity by eating one chicken wing or pork rib less, then two less, then three , then eat just one only, and finally none of it.<br><br>It depends on the individual how long one can succeed in giving up meat. But as Budddhists, I think we should try. Many Vajrayana monks have also stop eating meat.<br><br>Finally, we shouldn't ridicule one that refuse to eat meat, nor should we condemn one that does. The main reason for not eating animals must to due to compassion for all living things. And compassion must come with wisdom.<br></div>

Remember these animals like chicks; pigs etc have motherly protection and love since young, just like you.  What will you feel if you were the mother, seeing your kid being taken away to become the delicacy of another?<br><br>Buddha once said, all sentient beings, be it animals, ghosts, are our parents before.  They may not be in this life, but they were many lives back.  Eating them is equivalent of eating your beloved parents.<br><br>You may think it's hard to give up meat, but when you thought of the animals crying for help or struggling to live on, it'll never be too hard to give up the plate of meat in front of you.<br><br>Some may say they eat 5 clean meat.  A venerable once told me that only meat from animals that died from sickness or accident, or if the meat arrived at your table by mistake, could be classified as 5 clean meat, not meat that comes directly from the abattoirs or slaughterhouses because the supply is directly correlated to the demand.<br><br></div>

Sometimes spirits inhabit trees, known as tree spirits, but that is another matter. Plants by themselves do not have consciousness.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Moderator (An Eternal Now), Coolbluewater and Cycle,<br><br>Thanks alot. You guys truly speak words of wisdom, and have supported vegetarianism with excellent and powerful statements.<br><br>Let's all continue to spread the awareness and reality of the animals' suffering to all we know. And hopefully that day will come whereby everyone on this earth turns vegetarian, and all beings live in supreme harmony with one another, in accordance with mother nature.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
