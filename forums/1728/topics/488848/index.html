              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.2pt; text-align: justify;">I can’t say that I am a big fan of the institution of the Pope,
              but then since I’m not Catholic, my opinion about the Bishops of Rome doesn’t
              count for much. I can say that I am glad to see the new guy, Francis, making
              efforts to drag his church into the 21st Century. You may have heard about his
              recent statements on climate change. What you may not know is that it is more
              than just a few remarks, it’s a 192-page document called an encyclical, which
              is a papal letter sent to all bishops of the Roman Catholic Church. In this
              document leaked to the public, he says climate change is real, he argues for a
              new, positive relationship between religion and science, and he criticizes
              those who are skeptical about climate change for being in “denial.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">And, in what I think is a major step, he says that Christians have
              misinterpreted the Bible. According to Francis, the book of Genesis lays out
              “three fundamental and closely intertwined relationships: with God, with our
              neighbour and with the earth itself.” He says that these relationships have
              been broken and states “This rupture is sin,” which has “distorted our mandate
              to ‘have dominion’ over the earth. It’s too bad he didn’t reject the notion of
              “dominion.” If he had, it would have been truly revolutionary.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The so-called dominion mandate has been the focal point of
              criticism of the Christian approach to the environmental ethics. The critique
              is that it has enabled humans to view the earth as merely a tool for human
              needs. This notion of dominion created the Industrial Revolution and resulted
              in the wholesale devastation of our planet. There is nothing inherently wrong
              about using nature, but abusing it is another matter. The Industrial Revolution
              changed the world, but it would have been better if the changes had occurred in
              a more responsible manner.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">I’d like to mention (and you knew I would) that the view of
              Eastern philosophy is completely opposite. Western religious philosophy
              established a dualism in separating human life from nature, and as you know,
              Buddhism and Taoism are based on non-dualism. In ancient Buddhist texts, there
              are very few instances where the intrinsic value of nature is directly
              addressed. However, the oneness of “man” and nature has been a major theme in
              Taoism from its earliest beginnings.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">For the Taoist sage, the environment has always been in an
              intimate relationship with wisdom or what we Buddhist’s call enlightenment. The
              highest wisdom is the penetrating insight of the interdependency of all things,
              and this inter-connectedness is expressed in the sage’s identification between
              his true nature and nature itself. T’ien-t’ai Buddhism went even further when
              Chih-i declared that there is nothing in the entire universe that is not within
              the mind.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">We don’t have dominion over the land, it is not our inheritance,
              or something we bequeath to our children. We participate in nature. We share
              the land. We are its caretakers only in the sense that we take care of each
              other.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">One writer I’ve read says that the passage I quote below is Chuang
              Tzu’s attempt to “undermine the whole metaphysical debate: how can one know
              what is natural and what is human? How can one possible justify the claim that
              humans are part of nature or the contrary claim that they are not?”* To me, it
              is a bit simpler. Chuang Tzu is pointing to the non-dual nature of reality. On
              one hand, we know that things are physically separate, but on the other,
              everything is equal and one.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 19.2pt; background: lightskyblue;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">One who knows what nature is, and
              knows what it is that is human, has reached the peak of wisdom. Whoever knows
              about nature and humanity what nature does lives a life grounded in nature . .
              . However, there is a difficulty. Knowing is dependent on objects, but the
              objects of knowledge are transient and therefore uncertain. How can one know
              what we call nature is not really human, and what is human is not is not really
              nature?”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-indent: 24.0pt; line-height: 19.2pt; background: lightskyblue;"><span style='font-size: 11.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #555555;'>from Chapter Six “The Great and
              Honorable Teacher”</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19.2pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">So, now the Pope has joined the chorus of those who call for
              urgent action on climate change. I wish he had gone further, but a small step
              in the right direction is better than nothing. Someone over at Fox News called
              him a Marxist and the “most dangerous man on earth.” Sorry deadhead, the most
              dangerous are those who just don’t get it, who refuse to understand the earth
              is a giant, living organism and we humans are the cancer threatening its
              existence – our existence.</span></p>
