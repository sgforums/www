              meditation “practice” for a reason. Any form of practice consists of doing
              something over and over again and failing at it over and over again. Through
              this process, we gradually build the capacities that make it possible to do
              what we are practicing. There is nothing special about meditation: like
              anything else, it’s a collection of skills.</span></p>

              confusion about meditation results from the fact that the different processes
              involved tend to get lumped together without clear differentiation. It's as if
              in learning how to play the flute, we didn’t distinguish between blowing a
              long, sustained tone and a full round one, or between the skills of tonguing
              and fingering.</span></p>

              to meditation, some people are able to sit still without tension in their
              bodies; others are able to track the coming and going of the breath; yet others
              are able to open to everything they experience; and still others excel in clear
              and sharp focus, in visualization, and so on. There are many ways to practice
              meditation, but all of them involve a number of separate skills.</span></p>

              athletic or artistic endeavors, if we are serious about meditation, we spend a
              lot of time training in these basic skills. We don't train in all the necessary
              skills at the same time; we train one, then another. It's repetitious and not
              particularly exciting. But as we acquire competency and proficiency in each, we
              become capable of combining them in increasingly complex ways. Then things
              start to get interesting.</span></p>

              we can’t expect success in every attempt. We are training, and because we know
              we are training, we need to be willing to learn from our failures. Every
              failure reveals what we lack in precision, strength, flexibility, resiliency,
              stamina, or dexterity.</span></p>

              comes together. We become capable of holding sustained notes with good tone so
              that we can play the slower passages. Our fingers develop the flexibility and
              dexterity to handle the faster, more complex sections.</span></p>

              power in Beethoven, but miss the nuance in Satie’s subtle duets with silence.
              And that’s just how it is.</span></p>

              neurological states that have entered the spiritual marketplace may be helpful
              in developing and refining certain abilities. But it makes about as much sense
              to reduce meditation progress to such measurements as it does to reduce music
              to how long we can hold a sustained note or how quickly we can play a certain
              scale.</span></p>

              mindfulness, for instance. It has attracted a lot of attention recently, but in
              terms of meditation skills, it's just one of many. If we regard the mind as a
              musical instrument, then mindfulness involves simply learning how to play in
              tune. That’s very important—if we can't play in tune, nothing we play sounds
              good and other people probably won't want to play music with us—but even after
              mastering playing in tune, we still have to learn how to play actual melodies,
              to make real music. Mindfulness may be great for baroque, but when we discover
              the blues we find a whole new set of skills to learn. The same holds for
              meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Then comes the
              question of commitment. Again, the similarities with music are striking. If we
              practice half an hour a day on a musical instrument, we will slowly learn how
              to play it. If we practice an hour or several hours a day, our skills will
              develop more quickly. On the other hand, if we practice too much, we may burn
              out and be unable to learn at all. Thus, as with many other aspects of life,
              balance is important.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>But why
              practice at all?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>While there are
              well-documented benefits to meditation, approaching meditation for its
              particular benefits is very much like exercising to stay fit. It becomes a
              task, another thing to do. This is not the best approach. Frequently, it
              results in a not-so-subtle form of resentment that undermines the equanimity
              and ease necessary for effective practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";     '>Although
              meditation is now most frequently presented as something “good for us,” it is
              closer to an art form. Difficult and challenging, it requires a complex set of
              skills. And it takes time and effort to learn, let alone master.</span></p>

              parallels with music are interesting: we may sometimes resent the many hours
              we’ve had to put into practice, but the enjoyment we experience in playing
              music brings pleasure to us and to others throughout our lives.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Thank you very much on your great share! Just as a kinetic personality engages meditation with mindful movement (or, non-movement) someone more visual-spatial may enjoy mindful journalling with meditation, and to each his own, may all benefit from mindful practice!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.wildmind.org/background/journal"><strong><span style="font-size: 18.0pt; font-family: Times;   ">Keeping a meditation journal</span></strong></a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Mindfulness is about knowing where we are (being in the moment) and also
              about maintaining an awareness of where we have been (reflection) and where we
              are going (having goals). A meditation journal can help us with all of those
              areas of awareness, helping us to have a more unified awareness of ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">We may make efforts to be in the moment while we’re
              meditating – to be aware of our experience as it unfolds in the eternal moment
              and allowing our own inner beauty to manifest. Or perhaps we become a habitually
              vague in our practice, and spend a lot of our time drifting in thought, making
              insufficient effort to bring ourselves back to our current experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times;   ">The benefits of meditation journals</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Keeping a meditation journal helps us have a more
              definite sense of what is actually going on. When we sit down after meditation
              and take a few minutes to journal what we’ve been experiencing, it makes it
              pretty obvious how effective we’ve really been. If we examine our experience,
              honestly and with a desire to learn, then we become much more aware of what our
              meditation practice actually is. We can become more aware of our weaknesses and
              our strengths, and have a much more penetrating understanding of what we need
              to be working on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">A journal also allows us to look back at our
              experience as it has changed over a period of time. We can review several days,
              weeks, or months of our practice and learn about the patterns that our
              consciousness follows. Perhaps we’ll discover that we are lazier than we
              thought, or perhaps that we try too hard, or perhaps even that we fluctuate in
              our efforts. We may discover that there are particular distractions that are
              much more common that we had recalled. We commonly also discover – especially
              when we’re feeling a little down – that our meditation practice has been more
              effective and enjoyable than we had remembered.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">And our journaling can help us to set goals. It’s
              not that we try to pin down our experience before it happens – that’s rarely if
              ever going to work and it’s more likely to result in frustration than in any
              progress in our meditation practice. Instead what we’re trying to do in setting
              goals is to develop a stronger sense of where we want to go in our meditation
              practice. Through looking back at our past experience we can see what we need
              to work on. Perhaps it’s forgiveness or patience that we need to develop.
              Perhaps it’s more persistence. Or more calmness. Whatever changes we want to
              make, having clear goals will help us attain them. Our goals become the
              magnetic north pole that allows us to navigate through our experience in order
              to get where we want to go.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times;   ">Types of meditation journals</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">I know that some people use checklist style
              journals, with lists of distractions and positive factors that can be checked
              off. The advantage of this is that you can do your journaling very quickly, and
              that you have ready made categories to help you analyses your experience. But
              I’m not fond of this kind of journaling. To me it seems to pigeonhole our
              experience and leads to a superficial understanding of what’s going on in our
              practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">I prefer a more unstructured form of journal, where
              you can write freely about your experience. In this style of journal a blank or
              lined notebook will do. There are a few brief formalities that precede any entry
              – the date, the name of the meditation practice, and how long you meditated
              for. Then you can write more generally about how the practice went – what
              distractions you had, what you did about them; what positive factors (like
              calmness, patience, concentration, etc) that were present and what you did to
              strengthen them. You can write about factors in your life that had an effect on
              your practice – things like lack of sleep, or a particularly busy day, or that
              you felt refreshed after a day’s hiking with a friend.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">When you start keeping a meditation journal, your
              entries can be quite brief. It’s better to start with the intention of writing
              brief entries and then finding that you want to write more expansively than it
              is to set out to write detailed journal entries and then feel you’ve failed
              because you only have time to jot down a few notes. Something like the
              following can be very helpful:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Mindfulness of Breathing. 25 minutes. Had a hard
              time staying focused. Nodded off to sleep a few times — hadn’t had enough
              sleep. Felt a bit despondent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Something like that (and this is a fictional entry)
              only takes moments to write, but can be very useful. In the moment of writing
              there may be the recollection that feeling despondent reveals the presence of
              some kind of unhelpful assumption about how your meditation <em>should</em> go.
              And that can help you to remember, in future meditations, to go more easy on
              yourself and to accept lapses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Something like this can be helpful too:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Metta Bhavana. 40 minutes. Started off feeling very
              irritable. Stayed with the practice and ended up feeling calm and relaxed. Had
              only planned to sit for 30 minutes but sat on for a while.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">This helps to reinforce in the mind that progress
              is possible. And when you encounter one of those doubt-ridden days when you
              think nothing ever goes right in your life, you have concrete evidence to the
              contrary. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Remember that your journal is a tool, not a
              literary document. You’re writing it in order to help you gain more perspective
              on your practice, not so that you’ll impress future generations with your
              talent as a writer. If you get drawn into thinking that you need to write
              meticulous and artful prose, you’ll probably find that you don’t get very far.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Extended journaling</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">All of my online students keep an online journal
              where they write down what’s going on in their practice. These are more
              extended accounts that might vary from a paragraph or two to several hundred
              words. How feasible this is depends a lot on how fluent and confident you are
              as a writer, and on how much time you have available. For brief periods, such
              as being on retreat or attending a class, it’s worth making the extra effort to
              journal in this way. For most people, this isn’t going to be feasible in the
              long run.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">I read my students’ journal entries and can give
              them very specific feedback and encouragement. Most of them find this to be
              very useful, but unfortunately not everyone can get a teacher to read over
              their journals and make comments. You can gain some of the same benefits, however,
              just by rereading your own comments over a period of time and reflecting on
              them. It’s an excellent practice once a week to read over all of your journal
              entries for that week and to see what trends you notice. This helps you
              appreciate change and to stand back from your day-to-day experience so that you
              can learn from having an overview.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">Double entry journaling</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">A further refinement of this approach is “double
              entry” journaling. In this method you leave every second page blank in your
              journal – you only write on the right hand page. Then when you do your weekly
              review of your journal you can make notes on the left hand page. Those notes
              might include further reflections on some aspect of your experience, or may
              pick out particularly significant things that you have learned. Or they might
              simply summarize what you’ve written on the opposite page so that you can look
              back over an even longer period – perhaps three or six months – and can quickly
              review your major trends and learning experiences over that time without having
              to read each journal entry in full. Those notes also “flag” particularly
              significant experiences and observations so that you can easily find and reread
              them in detail later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Times;   ">When journaling creeps into your meditation
              practice</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">One last piece of advice. When you decide to keep a
              meditation journal, you’ll almost inevitably find that your meditation becomes
              a rehearsal for the journal entry that follows! You’ll find yourself thinking
              about what you’re going to write, rather than just getting on with the
              practice. I see this as a form of <a href="http://www.wildmind.org/tag/doubt"><span style="color: blue;">the hindrance of doubt</span></a>, because we’re trying to
              find reassurance and security in getting our journal entry “right.” So simply
              smile whenever you recognize that your doubt is manifesting in this way, let go
              of the thoughts, and then return to the practice without self-recrimination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Times;  ">In short, journaling helps to connect past,
              present, and future, so that our life seems more of an integrated whole rather
              than an assortment of disparate experiences. This helps us to develop more
              integration, or integrity – a sense of continuity of experience over time. </span></p>
