              <p>This is an interesting post, sinweiy.  I never thought there were so many athletes who are vegetarians/vegans. </p>
              <p>I am a vegetarian myself and did not find any dietary issues so far.  I suppose it is an issue to some who are not and even some may criticise others with their choice of a vege diet.  Sometimes, I cannot understand why some people may even feel offended with food choices made by others. It could be a reflection of their insecurity, inferiority complex?? </p>
              <p>Actually, vegetarians are not superior beings.  It's just a preferred diet and a choice made due to personal beliefs.  It's a personal thing.  If everyone can achieve enlightenment just by being a vegetarian, it would be easy, wouldn't it?  That way, cows are all enlightened too?  Too simplistic, isn't it?</p>

              <p>A moderator moderates - not ban, chop, cut.  If a post is vulgar, state so and give the poster a warning. Let others know what the poster has done and deserved.</p>
              <p>In an online PUBLIC forum, the whole purpose is to allow anyone, anywhere to participate by way of contributing, exchanging, debating, agreeing, disagreeing a point, a fact, a discourse, a theory, a view, a comment, a suggestion, etc.</p>
              <p>If you want conformity, uniformity, like-kinds, like-minded, exclusivity, same skin colour, nationality or belief - then start a PRIVATE forum and all of you can say to each other the same thing.</p>
              <p>I find it 'immature' that I was asked if I am a Buddhist, living here or understand only English.  And this from a forum whose participants should know the dhamma better than others!  Buddha didn't ask if one was a Buddhist before engaging in a discourse with that person or ask where he came from before answering questions.</p>

              <p>No one will ask those questions if your views are not vast difference from what Buddha had taught. Besides your views are non Buddhist,  you insisted that you are correct. That arouse my curiosity where you are from.</p>
