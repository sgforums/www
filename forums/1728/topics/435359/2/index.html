              <p>No one will ask those questions if your views are not vast difference from what Buddha had taught. Besides your views are non Buddhist,  you insisted that you are correct. That arouse my curiosity where you are from.</p>

              <p>I would say my views are different from yours, not from the Buddha.  Don't put words the way you like it.  Which part of the Noble Truths did I have 'vast difference' from the Buddha's.</p>
              <p>Don't let conjectures blind your faith.  Every time I put up a statement, I take the trouble to go into the origin and no one had disputed those factual materials.</p>
              <p>I am correct only when you are wrong. If you are with me, you won't see that.  You start your position with a prejudice when you don't like a statement like "Buddhism began as a philosophy ...." you start to create aversion - the poison in you.</p>

              to assert that you already knew the Noble Truths.  Not only

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>You said you did but
              you never mentioned you came across the Four Noble Truths, a post
              by AEN, which gave the 'complete' work. I assert that you did not
              read the thread and if you did it was selective.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span>If indeed you read
              the thread, you will have notice that I made no reply or comment to
              AEN’s post of 15 Jul 9:49PM.<span> </span> That means
              my understanding of the Noble Truth does not differ.<span> </span> Neither was my interpretation, if any.<span> </span> I have said that the 4NTs are profound but they
              are not beyond understanding nor require ‘experiential
              realization’.<span> </span> A British backpacker I
              met in Laos told me he completely understood the 4NTs when he read

              <p>1) i see you are only interested in getting people to answer your questions, and total disregard my requests.</p>
              <p>2) i see you are using a post by AEN to make assertions that i did not read the thread and that i was selective. this is an assumption. this is not about what is written in the other thread. im asking for you to share with me here.</p>
              <p>3) no reply or comment infers no difference in understanding? please write your understanding in your own words. "i completely understood the Four Noble Truths" speaks nothing about the actual understanding.</p>
              <p>4) pls do not suggest anything based on assumptions. my requests have been straightforward. an intellectual regurgitation of the Four Noble Truths was not what i asked, i wanted you to share with us your insights to the Four Noble Truths.</p>
              <p>if you can't write your own understanding, what do you understand?</p>
              <p>actually other than for entertainment value, there is really no real need for me to engage you in any discussion at all. </p>
              <p>with this, i wish you all the best in your practice and may the cloud of delusion dissipates in the light of the awakened mind.</p>

              <p>I did not analyse the status of your spirituality.  I asked if you know what spirituality is.</p>
