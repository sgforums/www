              <p>1) i see you are only interested in getting people to answer your questions, and total disregard my requests.</p>
              <p>2) i see you are using a post by AEN to make assertions that i did not read the thread and that i was selective. this is an assumption. this is not about what is written in the other thread. im asking for you to share with me here.</p>
              <p>3) no reply or comment infers no difference in understanding? please write your understanding in your own words. "i completely understood the Four Noble Truths" speaks nothing about the actual understanding.</p>
              <p>4) pls do not suggest anything based on assumptions. my requests have been straightforward. an intellectual regurgitation of the Four Noble Truths was not what i asked, i wanted you to share with us your insights to the Four Noble Truths.</p>
              <p>if you can't write your own understanding, what do you understand?</p>
              <p>actually other than for entertainment value, there is really no real need for me to engage you in any discussion at all. </p>
              <p>with this, i wish you all the best in your practice and may the cloud of delusion dissipates in the light of the awakened mind.</p>

              <p>I have not disregarded your question.  If so, I won't be making replies.</p>
              <p>I need to establish your background on the Noble Truths.  You are no novice here in this forum.  And you avoided answering the assertions I made.</p>
              <p>If you have read thru the thread I asked you to, you will have come to know my understanding of the 4NTs vis-a-vis a particular theme (at least) - that Buddhism began as a philosophy.</p>
              <p>I am suggesting that you are not upfront.<span> </span> You are trying to fish something under an altruistic net.</p>
              <p>If my understanding of the 4NTs does not differ from someone who has made the post, do I have to repeat it?  Let say your understanding of quantum physics is the same as one who had made the post, do you need to repeat what the poster write?  Unless your understanding is different, then you might want to clarify or state why you differ.</p>
              <p>In my many posts, I differ with some views and I defend why I differ vigoroulsy!</p>

              <p>Only allergic to soy?  Then the other beans and nuts would be a good source of protein too.  I wonder if you may be able to tolerate tempeh and miso, which is fermented soy.  Sometimes you may be allergic to the actual thing, but if the item comes fermented, you may not actually face problems.</p>
              <p>Some long-term vegetarians regularly use chlorella and spirulina as another source of protein, and it's also rich in minerals and B vitamins.</p>
              <p>Actually, green veges also have protein.  Eat lots of those for fibre and minerals.  Don't think you can survive on your usual one or two stalks of <em>kai lan</em> or <em>cai xin</em> if you actually turn full veg.  You'll need to increase the intake of veges and fruits  ;)</p>
              <p>The occasional glass of milk will help too.  (depends how strict you want to be)</p>

              <p>Bodhidharma:</p>
              <p><strong>To find a Buddha all you have to do is see your nature.
                                      Your nature is the Buddha. And the Buddha is the person who’s free:
                                      free of plans, free of cares. If you don’t see your nature and run
                                      around all day looking somewhere else, you’ll never find a buddha.
                                      The truth is there’s nothing to find. But to reach such an
                                      understanding you need a teacher and you need to struggle to make
                                      yourself understand. Life and death are important. Don’t suffer
                                      them in vain.</strong> <strong><br> <br> There’s no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have
                                      mountains of jewels and as many servants as there are grains of
                                      sand along the Ganges, you see them when your eyes are open. But
                                      what about when your eyes are shut? You should realize then that
                                      everything you see is like a dream or illusion.</strong> <strong><br> <br> If you don’t find a teacher soon, you’ll live this life in vain.
                                      It’s true, you have the buddha-nature. But the help of a teacher
                                      you’ll never know it. Only one person in a million becomes
                                      enlightened without a teacher’s help. If, though, by the
                                      conjunction of conditions, someone understands what the Buddha
                                      meant, that person doesn’t need a teacher. Such a person has a
                                      natural awareness superior to anything taught. But unless you’re so
                                      blessed, study hard, and by means of instruction you’ll
                                      understand.</strong></p>

              </span></span></p><p>can also eat Banana. Banana also have a little bit of B12.</p>
              <p>The best benefit of banana is that it can fight depression, as it contains tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin known to make you relax, improve your mood and generally make you feel happier.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;"><br></span></strong><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">Nutritional Benefits</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Bananas have very high content of potassium, a mineral that is essential to the normal muscular function, in both voluntary muscles (e.g. the arms and hands) and involuntary muscles (e.g. the heart and intestines). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">They are also a good source of dietary fiber, and low in saturated fat and cholesterol. This is also one of the few fruits which contain the entire range of vitamin B—thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), folic acid (B6) and very little B5 and B12.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Compared to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrates, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice all the other vitamins and minerals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Along with all the above, bananas also contain ample amounts of copper (to prevent graying hair), chromium, fluoride, manganese, selenium (to prevent pigmentation) and zinc. It's really an amazing fruit! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Thank God for bananas. </span><span style="font-family: Wingdings; font-size: small;">J</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">Health Benefits</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Bananas have been known to alleviate a number of short and long term conditions. When taken consistently over time, it has also been reported to cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40%!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Banana consumption has been reported to be effective in overcoming or preventing many illnesses and conditions. Here is a mention of only a few of them:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Anemia: </strong>Bananas provide iron which is essential for the production of hemoglobin, myoglobin and many enzymes essential for the formation of red blood cells.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Blood Pressure: </strong>A recent study has revealed that "two bananas a day will keep blood pressure at bay". This is definitely a cheaper and definitely a much healthier alternative to expensive drugs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Brain Food:</strong> Research has shown that students eating banana at breakfast, break and lunch are more alert in the class. The potassium in banana boost their brain power, assisting much in their learning ability.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Constipation: </strong>The pectin content in bananas is water-absorbent, creating the necessary bulk in easing constipation. Definitely a healthier choice over laxatives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Diarrhea:</strong> Eat a ripe banana. It normalizes colonic functions in the large intestine by absorbing large amounts of water and helps regulate proper bowel movements. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Energy:</strong> The carbohydrates content in bananas is used as fuel for your muscles. Eating bananas is a good energy booster for athletes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Heartburn:</strong> Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana to counteract the stomach acidity for a soothing relief.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Morning Sickness: </strong>Snacking on bananas frequently helps to keep your blood sugar levels up, thus preventing the nauseous feeling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Mosquito bites:</strong> When stung by a mosquito, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. It is amazingly effective at reducing swelling and itchiness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Muscle Cramps:</strong> A deficiency in potassium can cause muscular cramps and greater susceptibility to injury. Make bananas a regular part of your diet if you exercise a lot, both for an energy boost and to prevent cramps and injuries.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> The vitamins B6 and B12, and the potassium-magnesium combination found in bananas has a profound effect in helping the body recover from nicotine withdrawal of one who is trying to quit smoking.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Stomach Ulcer: </strong>This is the only fruit that a chronic ulcer sufferer can eat without causing distress to the stomach. It neutralizes the over-acidity of the gastric juices and reduces the irritation of the ulcer by coating the stomach lining. Ripe bananas relieve acute symptoms and promote the healing process.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Stress: </strong>When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, causing the body potassium levels to be reduced. By snacking on the potassium-packed banana, it helps to rebalance the vital mineral, and helps normalize the heartbeat. This in turn sends oxygen to the brain and regulates the body's water balance.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">Consumption Tips</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Eat bananas when they just about ripe. This is the time when the carbohydrate content is less than when it gets fully ripe. Unripened bananas do not taste as good and may be difficult to digest. Keep raw bananas at room temperature so that it will ripen naturally.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">We cannot juice bananas, but I am covering bananas in this juicing site because of its superior benefits. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">The closest we get to juicing bananas is by blending them with a blender together with other juices, making rich, creamy and yummy smoothies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Other fruits and vegetables with high content of potassium:</strong> oranges, avocados, spinach, celery and turnips.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">Caution</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">While bananas may be wonderful in countering all the above, be <strong>moderate</strong> on your banana consumption. Extremely high intake of potassium (eating bananas by the bunches everyday) may cause cardiac arrest (where the heart suddenly stops).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Too much iron can cause unhealthy iron deposits in the body, which can lead to production of free radicals. Overdoses can cause bleeding from the stomach or intestines, a drop in blood pressure, liver damage and reduced resistance to infections.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Bananas must not be consumed by those who are suffering from kidney failure because of its high potassium content.</span></p>

              <p>Yeah . recently I read more and more about this issue . that being vegetarian does not affect someone's strength . althou vegetarians are divided into many categories there are vegetarians . vegans . et cetera .</p>
              <p>yet it was mentioned that vegans (someone who do not partake milk or eggs . basically nothing from animals) should supplement their diet with B12 vitamin because 100% abstain from meat means cut off supply of B12 . please advice .</p>
              <p>Great list of gret peoples :) cheers !</p>

              <p>Hey I just wanna share . I have my own forum . and I also join more than one forum . and from what I know . moderators <strong>can</strong> delete or edit/modify a post or the whole thread if needed . and if the admin set the option to available then it is for the mods to use such function granted to them . admin can also set the "move posts/threads" option for moderators to move lost threads to the more suitable discussion zone .</p>
              <p>Example . someone posted "LJiao" or "ChaoCB" or "Chinamen are all docs"</p>
              <p>Moderators can edit or delete such posts . same case happen when someone is showing disrespect to other posters . or thread owner in this case I presume . the key is inter-personal acts/behaviours . cheers :)</p>
