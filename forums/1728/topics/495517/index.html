              </p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Before Americans turned to Buddhism for life hacks, they
              treated it like a dangerous cult</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ryan Anningson March 15, 2018 Quartz</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In January 1902, Reverend Clarence Edgar Rice warned
              Americans of a religion that “both in theory and practice…degrades women,” practices
              “crass brutality” towards animals, and “goes hand-in-hand with vice…that
              blushes not at unspeakable practices.” Even more terrifying, this “cruel” and
              “pessimistic” tradition was making inroads in the United States through both
              immigration and the conversion of American citizens. Similarly, American
              newspapers during the Progressive Era warned of “the religion of gloom and
              melancholy,” being spread by debaucherous “priests of unutterable cruelty [who]
              traffick in human flesh.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What was this terrible creed, with its awful priests? It was
              Buddhism—a tradition today often heralded in popular culture as the path to
              everything from a better professional career to world peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Within a century, Buddhism in America has gone from being
              frequently portrayed as a “dangerous cult” to becoming the prime spiritual
              practice of the business elite. Americans now generally view Buddhism
              favorably, according to Pew Research Center, while Canadians view Buddhism in
              equal favorability with Christianity, according to an Angus Reid poll.
              Mindfulness is taught in schools, and Buddhism is presented as a sort-of
              spiritual science. How can our views of Buddhism have changed so much in so
              little time?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The racist roots of
              portraying Buddhism as “cruel” and “pessimistic”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The historical period in which Reverend Rice was warning
              Americans about the evils of Buddhism is sometimes described as the “Yellow
              Peril.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">American books and newspaper articles at the time warned of
              the “clash of civilizations” developing between “uncivilized” Asian and
              “civilized” White culture, suggesting Asians would eventually rise up to
              overthrow The West. Politicians enacted exclusionary laws: In 1882, President
              Chester A. Arthur signed the Chinese Exclusion Act, barring all Chinese
              immigrants; decades later the Johnson-Reed Act, Asian Exclusion Act, and
              National Origins Act cut off Asian immigration, and limited all non-Northern
              European immigrants to almost nil.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The “proof” that helped justify racist rhetoric and pass
              eugenics-based domestic policy often involved race sciences like phrenology. In
              the United States, many “top” scientists, like G. Stanley Hall, argued that
              races could be scientifically hierarchized, with “greater” and “lesser” races.
              This pseudo-science gave scientific credence to the fear of outsiders that
              Americans felt, and suggested that Asians were biologically barbarous and
              animalistic, while their religion lacked morality and created a sort-of
              brainwashed horde.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">All of this contributed to American characterizations of
              Buddhism—which was associated with a disparaged and “scientifically” inferior
              racial group—as a violent, scary religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How Buddhists used the
              language of race sciences to adapt their pitch for Americans</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When religious people, and therefore their religion, move to
              a new area through immigration and missionary expansion, religions must adapt
              and change for their new surroundings; this fact has been repeated for
              millennia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the late 1800s, Buddhism was the subject of a cultural fad
              in the United States, with magazine coverage, social groups, and travel
              journals all discussing Buddhist religion, culture, and art. But the doctrines
              of the religion failed to mesh with American religious culture, being portrayed
              as a pessimistic tradition of annihilation. Buddhist leaders looked for ways to
              adapt their presentation and create ways of explaining the religion that were
              more amenable to American sensibilities. Part of this task was divesting the
              notion of pessimism that had troubled the tradition in the past.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Beginning around the turn of the 20th Century, Buddhism
              underwent a publishing revolution, creating hundreds of English-language
              magazines, journals, and pamphlets to help spread Buddhism in the United States
              and Canada.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In previous encounters between The West and the Buddhist world,
              Western authors often criticized Buddhism as a religious tradition without a
              god, or an agnostic worldview. In early-20th Century America, a religion
              without a creator god was not socially acceptable. Therefore, Buddhist
              publications beginning in the 1900s argued that Buddhism had a god, but that
              God was simply understood differently than the Christian monotheistic God. In
              fact, they argued that the Buddhist notion of god was beyond a singular being,
              including both existence and non-existence, suggesting that the Buddhist “god”
              was superior to Christian monotheism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When Buddhism entered the United States, the most modern and
              agreed upon “sciences” were race sciences, and Buddhist religious thinkers and
              missionaries were quick to pick up on this point. They borrowed its language to
              promote their religion. Similarly to how The West had presented a (quack)
              scientific explanation for their superiority, Buddhist publications used the
              language of race science to explain their spirituality. They even used the writings
              of C.G. Jung, who famously wrote of the “Eastern Mind” versus the “Western
              Mind” to argue for their own religious superiority; Jung said that Asians were
              more inherently spiritual, while Westerners were logical, and Buddhists wrote
              extensively about how they needed to teach spirituality to Americans, who had
              lost it to crass materialism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism was not presented as a religion of science, but as
              science itself; even mindfulness meditation, once the purview of only the most
              advanced monastic meditators, is presented in America as “beyond the Buddha,”
              harkening to a pre-historic mental spirituality. The idea of Buddhist
              spirituality resulting in “this-worldly” benefit is certainly nothing new, but
              the mystification of Buddhist doctrines, combined with the promotion of
              mindfulness meditation as being beyond the Buddhist religion and connected to
              science, all combined in 20th Century America to help fuel the current
              proliferation of mindfulness. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even today, comparisons of Buddhism and science are commonplace,
              with neuroscientists, psychologists, and physicists paying attention to
              Buddhist doctrines and practices, such as mindfulness. Historically, Western
              academics wrote about comparisons of Buddhism and science as far back as the
              19th Century, while Buddhists themselves promoted their religion as scientific
              even at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During the Victorian Era (1837-1901), the Buddha was viewed
              as an ethical reformer, comparable to Jesus, despite Western views on Asians
              and Buddhism more broadly. In other words, just like today, for a religion to
              be “scientific” was a major benefit in American religious culture, but between
              1900 and 1940, science in America was heavily racialized and colored by a false
              hierarchy of superiority and inferiority. Within the global network of
              colonialism, Asians used their religion to promote their own superiority in the
              face of being labelled inferior; they promoted Buddhism as superior to Western
              culture and religion, and as the very basis for scientific development.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The rise of mindfulness</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Throughout the 20th Century, especially following World War
              II, religious ideas became more diffuse in American culture, creating what is
              often called the “marketplace of religions.” Ironically, as American religious
              leaders increasingly feared secularization, they became increasingly involved
              in extra-church activities, successfully liberalizing American religious
              culture but diminishing their own necessity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meanwhile, Buddhists promoted meditation practice across the
              West. Perhaps the most famous singular voices in this discussion begin with the
              Burmese monk Ledi Sayadaw (1846-1923) and layman S.N.Goenka (1924-2013). Ledi
              Sayadaw saw the incoming colonialism of the British as a way to promote
              meditation techniques to the laity, even though the practice was normally only
              undertaken by advanced monastics. Sayadaw claimed that a nation of mindfulness
              could overcome colonial powers. Following Sayadaw’s example, Burmese layman
              S.N. Goenka has helped to fund over 310 meditation centres across 94 countries,
              promoting a form of mindfulness for lay people that makes little to no mention
              of the Buddhist religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Modern meditation teachers commonly present mindfulness as
              being beyond even the Buddha himself, a spiritual-scientific technique beyond
              any one historical period or religion. The mystification of Buddhism in many
              ways becomes complete in modern mindfulness. Placing Buddhism within the
              marketplace of American religion, de-coupled from its own doctrines and
              practices, this process completes many of the foundational writings of
              Buddhists published in the early 20th Century. This is not to suggest that
              there are not benefits within modern mindfulness, but merely that it includes a
              much longer and fraught history than many of today’s modern mindfulness
              teachers recognize. Buddhism underwent a process of mysticization so it could
              become all things to all people and was justified by scientific comparisons,
              which is a process that continues in modern mindfulness today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism did not find success in America due to a singular
              figure or institution; in fact, with the success of mindfulness in American
              culture, practice is sometimes removed from the religion itself and placed
              directly into the marketplace. Buddhists themselves once promoted their
              religion this way to counter the nationalism and xenophobia of America. They
              used the language of race sciences to promote Buddhism as superior, and
              mysticized the doctrines of the tradition to be applicable to American views,
              resulting in the de-coupling of meditation practice and the religion itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Is mindfulness
              appropriation?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mindfulness, as dispersed in American culture today, is
              sometimes regarded as a form of cultural appropriation, taking Buddhism outside
              of its cultural and religious context.<strong></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In a certain way, this is very true; mindfulness for better
              sex is an obvious example of the removal of context from a meditation tradition
              associated with celibate religious monastics. At the same time, Asian Buddhists
              actively promoted this presentation of mindfulness dating back nearly a
              century, in order to prove that their own religious tradition was not the
              inferior corruption, as suggested by academics, popular culture, and even
              pseudo-science. Skillful means (upaya) is an important concept in Buddhism,
              which means adjusting the teachings of Buddhism to suit the audience in a given
              situation, but by doing so, the student would be lead to the ultimate Truth of
              the religion. The idea of mysticizing doctrines and the reinterpretation of
              practices is written directly into the religious tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In other words, although Buddhists of the early 20th Century,
              and even today, may not recognize, or even necessarily agree with, all of the
              manifestations of modern mindfulness, and other Buddhist ideas, it is certainly
              true that Asian Buddhists played an active role in this promotion. However, it
              should be recognized that these developments took place in an area and time
              that was heavily racialized, and actively antagonistic to Asians and Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I believe that this type of historical study can help us to
              find answers, or at least new perspectives, to issues that face us today.
              Rather than facing the next perceived “incoming threat” with suspicion, and
              even isolationism, and eventual internment, we can look to the history of
              Buddhism in America to see how to include outside groups. Today, the suggestion
              that Buddhism is a “dangerous cult” is largely laughable in the United States,
              but a century ago, this was “common knowledge.” We can use our past experiences
              to help us with today’s problems because we have been through this before.
              Tracing Buddhism’s history from “cruel joke,” as a newspaper once called it, to
              modern mindfulness can help us to see exactly that.</span></p>
