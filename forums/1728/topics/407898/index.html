              <p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the <a class="mosinfopop" style="cursor: help; border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000;"> Blessed One</a> was living at SÄ�vatthÄ« in Jeta’s Grove, AnÄ�thapiá¹‡á¸�ika’s Park. There he addressed the <a class="mosinfopop" style="cursor: help; border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000;"> bhikkhus</a> thus: “Bhikkhus.” â€• “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>
              <p>2. “Here, bhikkhus, a <a class="mosinfopop" style="cursor: help; border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000;"> bhikkhu</a> makes a declaration of final knowledge thus: ‘I understand: Birth is 
              destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been 
              done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’</p>
              <p>3. “That bhikkhu’s words should neither be approved nor disapproved. 
              Without approving or disapproving, a question should be put thus: 
              ‘Friend, there are four kinds of expression rightly proclaimed by the 
              Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. What
               four? Telling the seen as it is seen; telling the heard as it is heard;
               telling the sensed as it is sensed; telling the cognized as it is 
              cognized. These, friend, are the four kinds of expression rightly 
              proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully
               enlightened. How does the venerable one know, how does he see, 
              regarding these four kinds of expression, so that through not clinging 
              his mind is liberated from the taints?’</p>
              <p>4. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed, who has 
              lived the holy life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, 
              reached the true goal, destroyed the fetters of being, and is completely
               liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of his answer:</p>
              <p>“‘Friends, regarding the seen I abide unattracted, unrepelled, 
              independent, detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers. 
              Regarding the heard...Regarding the sensed...Regarding the cognized I 
              abide unattracted, unrepelled, independent, detached, free, dissociated,
               with a mind rid of barriers. It is by knowing thus, seeing thus, 
              regarding these four kinds of expression, that through not clinging my 
              mind is liberated from the taints.’</p>
              <p>5. “Saying ‘good’, one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s words. Having done so, a further question may be put thus:</p>
              <p>“‘Friend, there are these five aggregates affected by clinging, 
              rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished 
              and fully enlightened. What five? They are the material form aggregate 
              affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the 
              perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate 
              affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by 
              clinging. These, friend, are the five aggregates affected by clinging, 
              rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished 
              and fully enlightened. How does the venerable one know, how does he see,
               regarding these five aggregates affected by clinging, so that through 
              not clinging his mind is liberated from the taints?’</p>
              <p>6. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed...and is 
              completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of his 
              answer:</p>
              <p>“‘Friends, having known material form to be feeble, fading away, and 
              comfortless, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving up, 
              and relinquishing of attraction and clinging regarding material form, of
               mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying tendencies regarding 
              material form, I have understood that my mind is liberated.</p>
              <p>“‘Friends, having known feeling...Having known perception...Having 
              known formations...Having known consciousness to be feeble, fading away,
               and comfortless, with the destruction, fading away, cessation, giving 
              up, and relinquishing of attraction and clinging regarding 
              consciousness, of mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying 
              tendencies regarding consciousness, I have understood that my mind is 
              liberated.</p>
              <p>“‘It is by knowing thus, seeing thus, regarding these five aggregates
               affected by clinging, that through not clinging my mind is liberated 
              from the taints.’</p>
              <p>7. “Saying ‘good’, one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s words. Having done so, a further question may be put thus:</p>
              <p>“‘Friend, there are these six elements rightly proclaimed by the 
              Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. What
               six? They are the earth element, the water element, the fire element, 
              the air element, the space element, and the consciousness element. 
              These, friend, are the six elements rightly proclaimed by the Blessed 
              One who knows and sees, accomplished and fully enlightened. How does the
               venerable one know, how does he see, regarding these six elements, so 
              that through not clinging his mind is liberated from the taints?’</p>
              <p>8. “Bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is one with taints destroyed...and is 
              completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of his 
              answer:</p>
              <p>“‘Friends, I have treated the earth element as not self, with no self
               based on the earth element. And with the destruction, fading away, 
              cessation, giving up, and relinquishing of attraction and clinging based
               on the earth element, of mental standpoints, adherences, and underlying
               tendencies based on the earth element, I have understood that my mind 
              is liberated.</p>
              <p>“‘Friends, I have treated the water element...the fire element...the

              that through not clinging my mind is liberated from the taints.’</p>
              <p>9. “Saying ‘good’, one may delight and rejoice in that bhikkhu’s words. Having done so, a further question may be put thus:</p>
              <p>“‘But, friend, there are these six internal and external bases 
              rightly proclaimed by the Blessed One who knows and sees, accomplished

              completely liberated through final knowledge, this is the nature of his 
              answer:</p>
              <p>“‘Friends, formerly when I lived the home life I was ignorant. Then the TathÄ�gata or his disciple taught me the <a class="mosinfopop" style="cursor: help; border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000;"> Dhamma</a>.
               On hearing the Dhamma I acquired faith in the TathÄ�gata. Possessing 
              that faith, I considered thus: “Household life is crowded and dusty; 
              life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy while living in a home to 
              lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose
               I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth 
              from the home life into homelessness.” On a later occasion, abandoning a
               small or a large fortune, abandoning a small or a large circle of 
              relations, I shaved off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and 
              went forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>
              <p>13-17. “‘Having thus gone forth and possessing the bhikkhus’ training and way of life...(<em>as <a class="mosinfopop" style="cursor: help; border-bottom: 1px dotted #000000;"> Sutta</a> 51, </em><em>§§</em><em>14-19</em>)...I purified my mind from doubt.</p>
              <p>18. “‘Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of 
              the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, 
              secluded from unwholesome states, I entered upon and abided in the first
               jhÄ�na, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with 
              rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. With the stilling of applied and
               sustained thought, I entered upon and abided in the second jhÄ�na...With
               the fading away as well of rapture...I entered upon and abided in the 
              third jhÄ�na...With the abandoning of pleasure and pain...I entered upon 
              and abided in the fourth jhÄ�na, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and 
              purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.</p>
              <p>19. “‘When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, 
              unblemished, rid of imperfections, malleable, wieldy, steady, and 
              attained to imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the 
              destruction of the taints. I directly knew as it actually is: “This is 
              suffering”...“This is the origin of suffering”...“This is the cessation 
              of suffering”...“This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.”
               I directly knew as it actually is: “These are the taints”...“This is 
              the origin of the taints”...“This is the cessation of the 
              taints”...“This is the way leading to the cessation of the taints.”</p>
              <p>20. “‘When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint 
              of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of 
              ignorance. When it was liberated there came the knowledge: “It is 
              liberated.” I directly knew: “Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
               lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to 
              any state of being.”</p>
              <p>“‘It is by knowing thus, seeing thus, friends, that in regard to this
               body with its consciousness and all external signs, I-making, 
              mine-making, and the underlying tendency to conceit have been eradicated
               in me.’</p>
              <p>21. “Saying ‘good,’ bhikkhus, one may delight and rejoice in that 
              bhikkhu’s words. Having done so, one should say to him: ‘It is a gain 
              for us, friend, it is a great gain for us, friend, that we see such a 
              companion in the holy life as the venerable one.’”</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</p>
