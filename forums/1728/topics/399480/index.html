              <p><strong>DESCRIPTION OF EVENTS</strong></p>
              <p>Note: The preregistration deadline for all events is July 
              22</p>
              <p><a name="7/29"></a><strong>July 29:</strong> Preliminary 
              Teachings on Deity Yoga Practice, with His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon 
              Chetsang Rinpoche</p>
              <p>Deity Yoga consists of two parts, the creation phase and 
              the completion phase. The creation phase, or the visualization of the 
              deity, can first of all be a practice of shamata (calm abiding), as one 
              trains in the single-pointed meditation on the deity. This purifies our 
              habitual identification with the body, the grasping to the body as 
              existing substantially. When we practice Deity Yoga we grow familiar 
              with who we really are. We come to understand that our mind actually has
               the nature of the deity-that the deity has arisen from the mind. 
              Furthermore, all phenomena have arisen from this mind and are therefore 
              divine by nature. Both samsara and nirvana have arisen from the mind and
               do not exist beyond it. In order to realize this, we engage in Deity 
              Yoga. The creation phase purifies our grasping at the body and the 
              belief in its reality. It purifies the existence of birth, as the 
              creation of the deity directly relates to the way in which a being is 
              born. The comp letion phase is also called the dissolution stage, as the
               entire visualization dissolves. This relates directly to the death 
              process in which the elements and thoughts dissolve one by one until one
               reaches the empty dharmakaya. Death and the completion stage are quite 
              similar. The practice of the completion phase purifies the existence of 
              death.</p>

              <p>Cakrasamvara is the principal yidam (meditation deity) of 
              all the Kagyu lineages. In the old tantras that were brought from India 
              it is said that this deity is the utmost essence of all the deities and 
              all the tantras. The reason we do this practice is to purify the 
              habitual tendencies of samsara and to purify all obscurations. We are 
              also purifying the imprints of the birth process. When we engage in the 
              creation stage practice of Cakrasamvara, the practice that utilizes 
              bliss as the method, we come to an understanding of the wisdom of bliss 
              and emptiness. This is called the illustrative wisdom, depending on 
              which we realize the actual nature of wisdom, which is Mahamudra</p>
              <p>Cakrasamvara emanated from the Buddha Vajradhara and was 
              the treasured yidam (meditation deity) of Lord Jigten Sumgon, the 
              founder of the Drikung Kagyu lineage, and is considered to be the chief 
              yidam within the Drikung Kagyu lineage. The general lineage derives from
               Vajradhara down to Tilopa, Naropa, Marpa, Milarepa, Gampopa, and Phagmo
               Drupa, and the tradition of practicing Cakrasamvara was established by 
              Ga Lotsawa, a contemporary of Phagmo Drupa.</p>
              <p>Drupon Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche provided the following 
              information about His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche and 
              Cakrasamvara: "His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoche has a very
               strong connection to Cakrasamvara, with the lineage going back to Lord 
              Jigten Sumgon, Phagmo Drupa, and so forth, as indicated above. 
              Cakrasamvara was the primary yidam deity for them all. Throughout 40 
              royal successions up until the present Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang 
              Rinpoche, all masters and lineage holders of the Drikung Kagyu lineage 
              have practiced Cakrasamvara as their main deity. In addition, most of 
              the eighty great Indian mahasiddas and all past Kagyu masters have 
              attained the highest accomplishment through depending on Cakrasamvara. 
              His Holiness Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinopche has accomplished the 
              traditional Cakrasamvara retreat and considers him to be his primary 
              deity.</p>
              <p>"For practitioners of the Drikung Kagyu lineage, it is 
              most important and very precious to have the good fortune to receive the
               empowerment of Cakramsavara from His Holiness. The lineage of this 
              practice has been sustained uninterruptedly, utterly pure and without 
              samaya breakage, and thus its blessings have not vanished. Whoever is 
              able to receive the Cakrasamvara empowerment from His Holiness will 
              receive the blessings of this immaculate and powerful lineage and should
               consider themselves extraordinarily fortunate. Along with His Eminence 
              Garchen Rinpoche, I am very happy to be able to welcome His Holiness 
              Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rincpohe to The Garchen Institute and encourage
               you not to miss this precious opportunity to make this very rare 
              connection."</p>
              <p>Directions : <br><br>Note: Please plan to arrive before 8 p.m.<br><br>From Phoenix, drive north on I-17 (toward Flagstaff), take the Cordes Junction exit and drive west on Highway 69 toward Prescott. You will pass through Prescott Valley and then, on the outskirts of Prescott, stay in the far right lane and take the turnoff (to the right or north) to Highway 89 to Chino Valley.<br><br>http://www.garchen.net/images/map-interstate.gif<br><br>Drive north on Highway 89 about 15 miles to Chino Valley, and stay in the right-hand lane. Continue on Highway 89 through the stop light by a large Safeway store. Watch for the Stockman's Bank on your right, then a small blue triangular “County Road 70” sign , then a green “Perkinsville Road” sign — turn right (east) onto Perkinsville Road.<br><br>http://www.garchen.net/images/map-chinovalley.gif<br><br>Drive east on Perkinsville Road for 9.5 miles — the road is paved for about the first 3 miles, and then turns to a gravel road. Drive carefully and slowly (do not exceed the speed limit, as town police regularly patrol this road), watching for free-roaming cattle and antelope. At about 9.25 miles you will see a farm house with a windmill on your right. Keep driving about another quarter mile on Perkinsville Road, and you will see our gate on your right. Our gate is green metal and has a white sign saying "Garchen Buddhist Institute.” The sign on the gate is hard to read at night, but it has a reflective-tape border that glows bright blue at night, making it easy to locate after sundown. Turn right into our unpaved driveway and follow it about 1/2 mile to the visitors’ parking lot. You will pass a house on your left before going up the hill to the parking lot. From the parking lot walk up the path to the temple and office. For handicapped access or deliveries, drive through the parking lot and take the first right, which leads to handicapped parking, the temple, stupa, office, and dining room/kitchen.<br><br>CAMPERS:<br><br>1. Setting up camp: Please check in at the registration desk in the Support Building by the temple for instructions on where to set up camp.<br><br>2. Cooking: NO FIRES or FLAME will be allowed - you should therefore order the onsite meals, or plan for meals requiring no cooking.<br><br>3. Rain or Snow: You should also be prepared for rain (or, in winter, snow) accompanied by strong wind.<br><br>4. Facilities Provided: Showers and toilets are available at the Support Building. A solar shower and water faucet are located near the camping area. (You should bring water containers/jugs.)<br><br>5. Food Storage/Garbage Disposal: To prevent wildlife from being attracted to the camping area - including the possibility of black bears or mountain lions, and the higher possibility of wild pigs, bob cats, and rodents:<br><br>    a) Do NOT store foods in your tent, not even cough drops or other items with food or attractive scents.<br><br>    b) Do NOT let food-garbage remain in your tent or camp area overnight.<br><br>http://www.garchen.net/eventguide.html</p>
