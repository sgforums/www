              Unite to Condemn China Over Expulsions of Tibetans</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">EDWARD WONG FEB. 27, 2017
              New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              half-dozen United Nations experts who investigate human rights abuses have
              taken the rare step of banding together to condemn China for expulsions of
              monks and nuns from major religious enclaves in a Tibetan region.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a sharply worded statement, the experts expressed alarm about “severe
              restrictions of religious freedom” in the area.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Most
              of the expulsions mentioned by the experts have taken place at Larung Gar, the
              world’s largest Buddhist institute and one of the most influential centers of
              learning in the Tibetan world. Officials have been demolishing some of the
              homes of the 20,000 monks and nuns living around the institute, in a high
              valley in Sichuan Province.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              statement also cited accusations of evictions at Yachen Gar, sometimes known as
              Yarchen Gar, an enclave largely of nuns that is also in Sichuan and has a
              population of about 10,000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“While
              we do not wish to prejudge the accuracy of these allegations, grave concern is
              expressed over the serious repression of the Buddhist Tibetans’ cultural and
              religious practices and learning in Larung Gar and Yachen Gar,” the statement
              said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              was signed by six of the United Nations experts, or special rapporteurs, who
              come from various countries. They each specialize in a single aspect of human
              rights, including cultural rights, sustainable environment and peaceful
              assembly. It is unusual for so many of them to collaborate in this manner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              statement was sent to the Chinese government in November, but was made public
              only in recent days, before the start of this year’s session of the United
              Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva. The session began Monday and is
              scheduled to end on March 24.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              United Nations experts have asked Beijing to address the reports of evictions
              and demolitions. The release of the statement before the session in Geneva puts
              more pressure on China to explain the actions taking place at the two Tibetan
              Buddhist institutions. China says matters related to Tibet are internal
              affairs, but Chinese officials in Beijing have privately expressed some concern
              over outside perceptions of the demolitions and evictions at Larung Gar and
              related Western news coverage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              the summer, Chinese officials began deporting monks and nuns living at Larung
              Gar who were not registered residents of Garze, the prefecture where the
              institution is. Since then, hundreds of clergy members have been forced out,
              and workers have demolished small homes clustered along the valley walls. One
              day last fall, I watched workers tearing and cutting apart wooden homes,
              sometimes using a chain saw.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Official
              reports have said the demolition is part of a project to improve safety in the
              area because people live in such tight quarters there. In 2014, a fire
              destroyed about 100 homes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Residents
              said the government planned to bring the population down to 5,000 from 20,000
              by next year. The government evicted many clergy members once before, in 2001,
              but people returned. The encampment was founded in 1980 near the town of Sertar
              by Jigme Phuntsok, a charismatic lama, and is now run by two abbots. Those
              abbots have not protested the demolitions or evictions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              United Nations experts said in the statement that while they awaited China’s
              response, they “urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to halt the
              alleged violations and prevent their reoccurrence.”</span></p>
