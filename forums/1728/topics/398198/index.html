              <p>Hi Snowing,</p>
              <p>I dun recite the Da Bei Zhou, so i can't say for sure. But most probably, there is no restriction. However, reciting mantras depends on each person's situation.  For instance, the Da Bei Zhou invokes many dharma protectors and so forth, whether this may create certain feedbacks or not is very hard to say. Why dun u tell us what time u r chanting and if there have been any problems n so forth...</p>
              <p>But if this is juz general question, i think juz do it during normal waking hours and in your home shd be alright and very meritorious.</p>

              <p>I chant Earth Store Bodhisattvas sutra almost every day. I am so diligent in chanting this sutra is because there was once my loved one was ill (doctors said the illness cannot be cured because it is in the genes) but recovered (90% cured) after my friend asked me to chant Earth Store Bodhisattvas sutra and transfer the merits to him.</p>
              <p>Till today, I am still chanting this sutra everyday.</p>
              <p>Last time I also dared not to chant, I thought it is for the deceased only. It was not long ago, I heard many Buddhists told me that this sutra is not just for the deceased but also for the living (é˜´é˜³ä¸¤åˆ©ï¼‰ã€‚</p>
              <p>I also like to know is it ok to chant at home ? AEN or anybody who knows.</p>

              <p>I heard of this before... but version is a little different.. It's more of don't chant at night at home because it will attract spirit to the house. I heard that some chants are meant to for both living and the dead so that they can receive enlightenment.</p>

              <p><br>i dun think so.  You can't be not sincere if you chant the whole sutra and dedicate to all beings...especially if you do everyday but during practice, if one is diligent and doing correctly, one's creditors will come, sometimes that is the case... it is not juz some wandering spirit but someone you owe from the past. In that case, one have to slowly resolve through repentance and dedication of merit, slowly as one practise on, one will be able to go through it and come out stronger. </p>
              <p>This is something everyone has to face.  We did wrong things in past and now we have to face it.  Dun face it through dharma way, have to pay in much more difficult way, right?  Debts always have to pay back!</p>
              <p>Believe in Buddha's words. Dun juz believe what you hear from others... for example, i heard once, some master said, dun keep this sutra in your house because it will invite in spirits... please read what is said in this sutra, sutra said if you keep this sutra in the house, there will be protection, not harm.</p>
              <p>Esp. now alot of problems to do with natural disasters, i have very strong faith if one practises Earth Store Bodhisattva well, one will not need to worry too much about natural disasters. This is not juz me saying, other peoples' experience also prove....Eg, Meng Can old monk also said something about this in his commentary.</p>

              <p>Interesting you said that, because when I was 9 I used to play Heart Sutra casette every night. Then I moved into a very ulu house for 9 months (temporary rent cos we're moving to somewhere else), I could sense it was haunted.
                          During one time when I was playing heart sutra casette, I clearly saw a hand not mine, a ghostly hand coming up from below and it seemed to me that it needed something.</p>
              <p>I was totally freaked out at that time. But my mom knew that the ghosts wanted us to dedicate merits to them, so we did that. My mom mentioned seeing something (can't remember what) when we left that house it seems that the ghosts were thanking us.</p>

              <p>I chant Earth Store Bodhisattvas sutra almost every day. I am so diligent in chanting this sutra is because there was once my loved one was ill (doctors said the illness cannot be cured because it is in the genes) but recovered (90% cured) after my friend asked me to chant Earth Store Bodhisattvas sutra and transfer the merits to him.</p>

              <p>Interesting you said that, because when I was 9 I used to play Heart Sutra casette every night. Then I moved into a very ulu house for 9 months (temporary rent cos we're moving to somewhere else), I could sense it was haunted. During one time when I was playing heart sutra casette, I clearly saw a hand not mine, a ghostly hand coming up from below and it seemed to me that it needed something.</p>
              <p>I was totally freaked out at that time. But my mom knew that the ghosts wanted us to dedicate merits to them, so we did that. My mom mentioned seeing something (can't remember what) when we left that house it seems that the ghosts were thanking us.</p>

              <p>Hmmm ... whether one can or cannot chant certain sutra in house is rather subjective. In fact, my buddhist peers did pinpoint to her Shifu that Earth Store Bodhisattvas promise in his sutra that he will protect the place from spirits disturbance. However, the problem lie not the Bodhisattvas promise but the layperson own merits and vows. Example when a spirit tries to get the layperson attention through disturbance or sighting to request for help. The layperson may freak out as he may not be able to discern the  spirit request. That person may in turn blame the Bodhisattvas for not being able to fufill his promise. However, have the layperson forgotten since the moment he wanted to recite this sutra, he has begin on a Earth Store Bodhisattvas journey to be like him.</p>
              <p>Famous vows</p>
              <p>1)  <strong>If I do not go to hell to help them there, who else will go?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2)  if the hell is not yet empty, I vow not to become a Buddha.</strong></p>
              <p>Welll, according to her, it is ok to recite in the temple during the mass recitation due to the vast triple gem merits. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, I have another friend who really like and chant Earth Store Bodhisattva Sutra on a regular basis at his room even when in Australia. Nothing has happened to him. So it is a matter of individualistic choice. I think proper Buddhist foundation is the key. Right understanding. Perhaps my buddhist peer's foundation was not strong therefore her shifu advise in that manner.

              <p><strong>DEDICATION OF MERITS </strong>is skillful means of sharing of one joyful acts with our loved ones. in fact, I have this experience with my dead brother.

              <p>In Jan this year, I dreamt about him. I went to this place when half naked people are hangup in pole like manner. They are suffering being link up like a chain.

My brother appear and his bowl was full. He told me that there was this friend who will always bring food for him to eat. Subsequently, he said that from certain days onwards we can prepare a  dizhu -åœ°ä¸»ç¥žaltar in a particular spot in the kitchen area to make offering to him which we did as per instructed.</p>
              <p>I was very taken back by the dream. After much recollection, I realised that the so called friend might have been a manifestation of bodhisattva. During each recitation we dedicate the merits with this Lotus Sutra Chpter 25, Kuan Yin verse to him.</p>
