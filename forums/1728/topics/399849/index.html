              <p>I believe the story. There are many things written in the scripture which sound unbelievable and I doubted them before but I experienced them or saw them with my eyes so I believe everything is being said.</p>
              <p>The first time I read Buddha proclaimed ," I alone am the World-Honored One." The first thought that came to my mind was why Buddha was so arrogant. Later I realised that the "I alone am" was referring to every individual self (each one of us). Meaning everybody is their own master. No one can help us to heaven or push us to hell.</p>

              <p><strong>I Alone Am The World 
                              Honoured One</strong></p>
              <p>by Ven Jue Xing from å�ƒæ±Ÿæœˆå½± (2)</p>
              <p>(loose translation by me)</p>
              <p>The founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni Buddha, was born as a
                              prince. On the first day of his birth, he stepped on lotus flowers
                              and walked seven steps, with one finger pointing to the sky and one
                              finger pointing towards the earth, he said "Above the skies and
                              below the earth, I alone Am the World Honoured One." "I alone Am the World Honoured One", what does this mean? Why did the Buddha
                              say this? Many times people have this question/doubt.</p>
              <p>Actually, what the Buddha referred to as 'I' is not the ordinary
                              sentient beings' egoic mind consciousness, much less is it a 'self'
                              that wants to be a religious leader. It is because the Buddha has
                              been awakened for many lifetimes and kalpas ago, and has already
                              achieved 'No Self', and continued to practice till present that he
                              was able to attain the fruition of Buddhahood. Otherwise, the 'I'
                              in 'I Alone Am The World Honoured One' would be just the ordinary
                              sentient being's me-form, me-clinging. Why then did the Buddha said
                              "I"?</p>
              <p>This is because what the Buddha referred to as "I" is actually
                              taking himself as a presentation: He is the Buddha, the Buddha is
                              Awareness, this Awareness fully pervades all space and dharma
                              realms. Everything that is sentient or insentient is a part of it,
                              every sentient beings in the universe rely on Awareness for
                              survival, and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the three times
                              achieve liberation through realising Awareness. Thereafter, they
                              rely on Awareness's marvellous functions to walk the Bodhisattva
                              path, saving all sentient beings. Therefore it is said, "Above the
                              skies and below the earth, <strong>Awareness</strong> alone Is the
                              World Honoured One." And the reason for the Buddha's action is to
                              show that every human being has the essence of Awareness in its
                              completeness right from the beginning, and he wishes to awaken our
                              Awareness.</p>
              <p>The Lotus Sutra states:</p>
              <p><strong>“Shariputra, what is meant by ‘All Buddhas, World
                              Honored Ones, appear in the world only because of the causes and
                              conditions of the one great matter?’ The Buddhas, the World Honored
                              Ones, appear in the world because they wish to lead living beings
                              to open the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas and gain purity.
                              They appear in the world because they wish to demonstrate to all
                              living beings the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas. They appear
                              in the world because they wish to lead living beings to awaken to
                              the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas. They appear in the world
                              because they wish to lead living beings to enter into the Path of
                              the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“Shariputra, these are the causes and conditions of the
                              one great matter for which all the Buddhas appear in the
                              world.”</strong></p>
              <p>Therefore, Buddha took birth in our world to enable sentient
                              beings to <em><strong>open the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas
                              and gain purity,</strong> <strong>demonstrate to all living beings
                              the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas,</strong> <strong>lead
                              living beings to awaken to the knowledge and vision of the
                              Buddhas,</strong> <strong>enter into the Path of the knowledge and
                              vision of the Buddhas.</strong></em> Therefore Buddha wants to open
                              the way of Awareness, enabling sentient beings to realise the
                              Essence of Awareness.</p>
              <p>All sentient beings rely on Awareness for survival, it is
                              because they have the Essence of Awareness that they are able to be
                              aware, feel, or know. However it is because sentient beings lost
                              sight of the Essence of Awareness that they are unable to become
                              self-aware, this is called "lost in sentient beings", or otherwise 
                          known
                              as ignorance. Whereas, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have first
                              realised Awareness, and it is because they realised Awareness, and
                              relied on Awareness in cultivation, that they achieved liberation
                              from all habitual energies and karmas of sentient beings, and
                              thereby accomplish the Fruit of Buddhahood. In the universe, other
                              than Awareness, all phenomena are only illusory forms and arising
                              due to the aggregation of causes and conditions, and when the
                              causes and conditions separate the phenomena ceases. They do not
                              have any real or eternal essence, and therefore the Buddha once
                              being born into this world declared to the world that above the
                              skies and below the earth, other than Awareness, all are
                              conditioned arising and conditioned ceasing, impermanent and
                              illusory forms, therefore "Awareness Alone IS the World Honoured
                              One." - for it is Eternal.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Buddhists should have right understanding and right
                              view. The purpose of practicing Buddhism is not for other matters.
                              Regardless of which dharma door you practice, it is for the purpose
                              of Awareness/Awakening. Only with Awakening, opening wisdom,
                              seeking liberation, can it be the correct aim. We must never attend
                              to trifles and neglect the essentials, not knowing self-awareness and
                              seeking the outside, else it would be to proceed in the opposite
                              directions of the aims of Buddhist practice.</p>
