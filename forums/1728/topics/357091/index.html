              <p>Which websites? And how can Ksitigarbha sutra be fake? That's nonsense if you ask me.</p>
              <p>There are also those who claim Shurangama Sutra is fake though it is a great sutra full of wisdom only a highly enlightened being such as Buddha is able to expound, and as Ven Hsuan Hua said:</p>
              <p><em><br>"Most scholars say the Shurangama Sutra is false and claim that it
                  was not spoken by the Buddha. They say they have various pieces of
                  evidence and documents to support their claim. This is all because they
                  fear the Shurangama Sutra and have no way to deal with the principles
                  in the Shurangama Sutra. What they fear most in the Shurangama Sutra
                  are the Four Clear Instructions on Purity. The Four Clear Instructions
                  on Purity serve as a demon-spotting mirror. All the demons, goblins,
                  ghosts, and weird creatures are reflected in their true form.
                  Furthermore, the section on the Fifty Skandha-demons exposes the
                  celestial demons and externalists to the bone, enabling people to
                  recognize their demonic appearance. Anyone who can memorize the
                  Shurangama Sutra is a true disciple of the Buddha.</em>"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course if you ask some Theravadins, all Mahayana sutras are fake since they only recognise their own canon.</p>

              <p>From Skysitter in E-Sangha:</p>
              <p>There is a note from Patriarch Lien Chi ("Lotus Pond") of Ming Dynasty,
              "The third volumn, Notes under the Bamboo Window") about 70% into the
              book -- (sorry, my own transcription here...)<br><br>"Falsified sutras on Parents merits impossible to repay,<br><br>There
              are two falsified sutras withe titles as Parents merits so heavey that
              is impossible to repay. The contents are not exactly the same, but both
              claimed to be translated by famous masters. Two good friends of mine
              pay to publish, one of each. These two freinds are honest and descent
              people, and happy to encourage people to treat parents well, so they
              overlooked the question of authenrity.<br><br>Some may argue that as
              long as they encourage people to do good, why bother with authenrity.
              My answer is that you may see one good, I see two harms.<br><br>The one positive point is that the book indeed encourage people to treat their parents well.<br><br>However,
              they may cause two harms. For people who don't believe in Dharma, they
              can point to the book and say: how can people believe in this kind of
              silly talks. They would refuse to open their mind to other great sutras.<br><br>For
              people who believe in Dharma, they read the silly theory and they may
              say: "for people who criticize Buddhism, they might have a point here.
              Maybe I should pay more attention to what they have to say."<br><br>It
              does morer harms than help. Besides, there are many authetic sutras on
              treating parents with respect and they are well known. Why stick with
              the quetionable books?"</p>

              <p><br>I don't know where he mentioned this. But not only western medicine works. TCM works too. So it is up to individual to decide which is the best medicine for himself.</p>
              <p>Instead look into what worked for them and what suits them. Buddhism is about the Middle Way. If one falls into either extreme, one is not following the path</p>

              <div style="font-style: italic;"><br></div>
              <p>Actually,
              according to a ST report a few years back, the number of true Buddhists
              (those taken refuge in the triple gems -- buddha, dharma, sangha... as
              well as attending dharma classes and activities, etc) are rising
              (though I still feel more can be done). Along with Christians. These
              two are the only religions in Singapore that are seeing a rise in
              followers.<br> <br> But it is just that the number of real Buddhists in the first place is very small.<br> <br> You need to be able to differentiate Buddhists from the Chinese Folk
              Practitioners and Taoists. This is often mistaken with Buddhism. This
              particular group of religious practice is dwindling, while the number
              of Buddhists and Christians are increasing.<br> <br> Based on government surveys, figures on Buddhism in 1980 shown that 27%
              of Singaporeans are Buddhists, up to 31.2% in 1990 and 42.5% in 2000.
              Of course though, not all of them are really 'true Buddhists'.<br> <br> BTW Buddhism is rising especially fast in Western countries, and
              Christianity is losing its foothold there. In Asia, the opposite is
              happening -- Christianity is gaining strength and in some places
              Buddhism is losing out. But Buddhism is still pretty strong in many of
              the Asian nations.<br> <br> Lastly the reason you may be hearing more from the Christians is
              because Christians tend to be more evangelical in spreading their
              beliefs to others. Buddhism by nature is not aggressive on this point.
              It does not place so much emphasis on converting people. It wants
              people to investigate for themselves whether it is beneficial and
              practical to them -- rather than telling them to accept the teachings
              by blind faith. <br> <br> Another reason might be because the number of Buddhist youths are still
              not that a lot -- there are quite a number, but I guess still not that
              much. Megachurches environment and those cell groups might be somehow
              more attractive to the youths, coupled with strong evangelical effort.
              Buddhism somehow attracts more of the middle age category, I think. But
              there are signs that Buddhism is making an attempt to catch up on
              getting the youths by having activities, cell groups, camps etc (though
              again, imho more can be done) BTW, I just turned 19.</p>

              <p>Yes, I share such views, generally. You can consider me Mahayanist. I still practice meditation: 30 minutes to 1 hour everyday if possible.</p>
              <p>But equal emphasis must be placed in practicing meditatively in everyday lives.</p>
              <p>The point is: there is no need for seclusion to practice. (though I'm not against people going for retreats if they can make it) Everyone can gain enlightenment, even laymen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. not all Theravadin teachings are impractical, actually. Depends on the teacher. I'm sure there are many good Theravada teachers who teach dharma in a way that remain relevant to our daily lives.</p>

                  <p><br> I pay heartfelt homage to you, Lokesvara; You have true compassion extending 
                          to all.<br> To those who in every coming and going have seen that each thing is inherently 
                          void, and thus can devote both their time and their efforts with one aim in 
                          mind - "Let me benefit all!"</p>
                  <p>To such foremost Gurus and you, Lokesvara, All- seeing protector, with utmost

                          my thoughts, words and deeds.</p>
                  <p>The Fully Enlightened Victorious Buddhas, from whom all true pleasure and 
                          benefits derive, have reached their attainment by following Dharma and leading 
                          their lives through this noblest of paths.<br> To live by the Dharma depends on full knowledge of how we must practise and 
                          what we must do, thus I´ll attempt now a brief explanation of what is 
                          the practise of all Buddhas` Sons.</p>
                  <p>(1)<br> This sound human body endowed with full leisure and excellent vessel is rare 
                          to be found.<br> Since now we have obtained one in no way deficient, let`s work night and day 
                          without veering off course to take a cross the ocean and free from samsara 
                          not only ourselves but all others as well.<br> First listen, think hard, then do much meditation - the Sons of the Buddhas 
                          all practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(2)<br> Remaining too long in one place our attraction to loved ones upsets us, we 
                          are tossed in its wake.<br> The flames of our anger towards thus who annoy us consume what good merit 
                          we have gained in the past.<br> The darkness of closed-minded thought dims our outlook, we loose vivid sight 
                          of what is right and what is wrong.<br> We must give up our home and set forth from our country - the Sons of the 
                          Buddhas all practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(3)<br> Withdrawing completely from things that excite us, our mental disturbances 
                          slowly decline.<br> And ridding our mind of directionless wandering, attention on virtue will 
                          surely increase.<br> As wisdom shines clearer, the world comes in focus, our confidence grows in 
                          the Dharma we have learned.<br> Live all alone far away in seclusion - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise 
                          this way.<br> (4)<br> Regardless of how long spent living together, good friends and relations must 
                          some day depart.<br> Our wealth and possessions collected with effort are left fare behind at the 
                          end of our life.<br> Our mind, but a guest in our body`s great guest house, must vacate one day 
                          and travel beyond.<br> Cast away thoughts that concern but this lifetime - the Sons of the Buddhas 
                          all practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(5)<br> From staying together with friends who misguide us, our hatred, desires and 
                          ignorance grow.<br> With little time left to continue our studies, we don`t think of Dharma; we 
                          meditate less.<br> Our love and compassion for all sentient beings are lost and forgotten while

                          this way.</p>
                  <p>(6)<br> When placing ourself in the hands of the Guru, we are turning sincerely for 
                          guidance to someone<br> Whose competence both in the scriptures and practice expands like the moon 
                          growing full.<br> We will then solve all our problems, dispel our delusion, if we place our 
                          full confidence solely in him - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise this 
                          way.</p>
                  <p>(7)<br> The gods of this world are not free yet from sorrow, for caught in samsara, 
                          some day they must fall.<br> If they are bound as we are, how can they protect us?<br> How can someone in prison free anyone else?<br> But Buddha, his teachings and those who live by them are free to give comfort 
                          - the y will not let us down.<br> Go to the Three Jewels of Refuge for shelter - the Sons of the Buddhas all 
                          practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(8)<br> Buddha has said that the grief past endurance of creatures whose lives contain 
                          nothing but pain <br> is unfortunate fruit of the wrongs they have committed against other beings 
                          in lifetime gone by.<br> Not wishing to suffer from horrible torment, not flinching if even our life 
                          is at stake, <br> turn from all actions that harm other beings - the Sons of the Buddhas all 
                          practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(9)<br> Like the dew that remains for a moment or two on the tips of the grass and 
                          then melts with the dawn,<br> The pleasures we find in the course in our lives last only an instant, they 
                          cannot endure;<br> While the freedom we gain becoming a Buddha is a blissful attainment not subject

                  <p>(10)<br> In each incarnation, through all of our lives, we have been cared for by others 
                          with motherly love.<br> While these mothers of ours are still lost in samsara, how cruel to ignore 
                          them and free but ourself!<br> To save other beings, though countless in number, to free from their sorrow 
                          these mothers of old,<br> Produce Bodhichitta, the wish to be Buddha - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise

                  <p>(11)<br> All of our sufferings, without an exception, derive from the wish to please 
                          but ourselves;<br> While the thoughts and the actions that benefit others conceive and give birth 
                          to supreme Buddhahood.<br> Thus in exchange for our selfish desires and shameful neglect of our suffering 
                          kin,<br> Replace thoughts of self with concern for all others - the Sons of the Buddhas

                          not possess,<br> Some unfortunate person has stolen our riches or lets others rob us and idly 
                          stands by;<br> Then out of compassion and with no attachment, to him we must dedicate all

                          tormented mind,<br> Then mercifully wishing for him not to suffer further misfortune because of 
                          his state,<br> Selflessly take on the effects of his actions - the Sons of the Buddhas all

                          being the truth;<br> Yet out of our wish for the one who has maligned us to conquer his trouble 
                          and gain peace of mind,<br> Praise all his virtues and treat him with kindness - the Sons of the Buddhas

                          flaws we still have;<br> Then not getting angry or being defensive, just listening in silence and heeding 
                          his words,<br> Bow in respect to this man as our teacher - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise

                          suffered from the wrongs they had done,<br> Never lose courage to take pain from others - the Sons of the Buddhas all

                          the great God of Wealth,<br> Yet seeing full well that this fruit of samsara, though fortunate, still has 
                          no essence at all,<br> Cast out what pride we might have in these glories - the Sons of the Buddhas

                          plague us still more,<br> So seeing this action is not the solution, let us muster the forces of mercy

                  <p>(21)<br> Indulging in objects our senses run after and drinking salt water are one 
                          and the same:<br> The more we partake, for our own satisfaction, the more our desire and thirst 
                          for them grow.<br> Then when we conceive a compulsive attraction towards whatever object our

                  <p>(22)<br> Whatever appears to be truly existent is merely what mind in delusion creates;<br> This mind of ours also is from the beginning devoid of an essence inherently

                  <p>(24)<br> The various ills in our life that we suffer resemble the death of our son 
                          in a dream;<br> To hold as the truth what is merely illusion is needless exhaustion of body 
                          and mind.<br> For this very reason, when faced with unpleasant conditions that normally 
                          cause us much grief,<br> Approach them as if they were only illusion - the Sons of the Buddhas all

                  <p>(25)<br> The beings who strive to be Fully Enlightened would give up their body pursuing 
                          this aim:<br> With this peerless example, what need is the mention of gifts we should make 
                          of the objects we own.<br> Without any hope of return for our kindness, not considering even the merit 
                          to be gained,<br> Engage in the practice of generous giving - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise

                  <p>(26)<br> If lacking strict moral control of our conduct we haven`t been able to reach 
                          our own goal,<br> How can we fulfil all the wishes of others?<br> Undisciplined effort is surely absurd!<br> We first must renounce our attachment to pleasure which binds us so tightly 
                          to samsara´s wheel,<br> Then protect all our vows of sworn moral behaviour - the Sons of the Buddhas

                          are mines of great wealth.<br> For this very reason, abandon resentment and anger directed towards those

                          not stray from their goal,<br> Then how much more energy must be expended by those of us working for everyone´s 
                          sake;<br> Enlightenment calls for the most perserverance - the Sons of the Buddhas all

                          base.<br> Thus surpassing the four formless states of absorption we must work to achieve 
                          single-minded control<br> And the full concentration of deep meditation - the Sons of the Buddhas all

                  <p>(30)<br> Perfection of Charity, patience and morals, absorbtion and effort alone won´t 
                          suffice;<br> Without the Perfection of Wisdom these five are unable to bring to full Buddhahood.<br> With the methods of pure Bodhicitta develop the wisdom to see that the actor, 
                          the act,<br> And the acted upon lack inherent existence - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise

                  <p>(31)<br> Without making efforts to analyse clearly delusions we have and mistakes we 
                          commit,<br> Then even though outwardly practicing Dharma, we still may perform many non-Dharmic 
                          deeds.<br> For this very reason, let us try to examine mistakes and delusions, the faults 
                          we possess,<br> Then afterwards try to remove them completely - the Sons of the Buddhas all 
                          practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(32)<br> While speaking of others, the force of delusion may cause us to dwell on the 
                          flaws they possess;<br> Should those we find fault with be Bodhisattvas, our own reputation will suffer 
                          instead.<br> So avoid the mistake of disparaging others who have entered upon Mahayana´s 
                          great path;<br> Only the faults that we have should we mention - the Sons of the Buddhas all 
                          practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(33)<br> Domestic disputes with our friends and relations, to gain their respect or 
                          the things we feel due,<br> Will leave us unable to listen to Dharma: unable to study or meditate well.<br> Since danger is found in the homes of our patrons, as well as in those of 
                          our family and friends,<br> Abandon attachment we have these households - the Sons of the Buddhas all 
                          practise this way.</p>
                  <p>(34)<br> The words of abuse that we utter in anger cause others much pain by disturbing 
                          their mind.<br> And we who are striving to be Bodhisattvas will find that our practise will 
                          surely decline.<br> So seeing the faults that arise from harsh language, which those who must 
                          hear find unpleasant and rude,<br> Abandon abuse directed towards others - the Sons of the Buddhas all practise 
                          this way.</p>
                  <p>(35)<br> Defiled types of actions will soon become habits as we grow accustomed to 
                          base states of mind;<br> Strenuous effort will then be required for the force of opponents to counter 
                          these stains.<br> So armed with the weapons of alertness and memory, attack such defilements 
                          as lust on first sight;<br> Remove these obstructions that hinder our progress - the Sons of the Buddhas

                          fully the state of our mind.<br> Then always possessing alertness and memory, which keep us in focus and ready 
                          to serve,<br> We must work for the welfare of all sentient beings - the Sons of the Buddhas

                  <p>(37)<br> All merits we gain from the efforts we are making to put into practice these 
                          virtuous ways,<br> Which we do for the sake of removing the suffering endured by the limitless 
                          mothers we have had,<br> We must dedicate purely for them to be Buddhas, with the wisdom which sees 
                          that both they and ourself<br> As well as this merit all lack true existence - the Sons of the Buddhas all 
                          practise this way.</p>
                  <p>By carefully following all of the teachings my most holy Gurus have imparted 
                          to me <br> Concerning the meanings of sutra and tantra explained by the Buddhas and masters 
                          of old<br> I have written this work on the practises numbering thirty and seven of all 
                          Buddhas´ Sons<br> To benefit those who desire to follow the path that all Sons of Buddhas must 
                          tread.</p>
                  <p>Because of my poor intellectual powers and the meagre amount of training 
                          I have had,<br> I have not been able to write polished verses in metre and style which would 
                          please those with skill;<br> But as I have relied on the words of the sutras and all that my most holy 
                          Gurus have taught,<br> I am certain that this is without any errors; this truly is what Buddhas`s 
                          Sons have all done.</p>
                  <p>However because the extent and the depth of the great waves of conduct of 
                          all Buddha`s Sons<br> Are hard to be fathomed by someone of limited power of intellect as is myself,<br> There are bound to be faults, contradictions and many such flaws; so most 
                          holy Gurus, I beg your indulgence,<br> Be patient with all the shortcomings I have.</p>
                  <p>With pure Bodhicitta of ultimate Voidness, yet relative nature of mercy 
                          and love,<br> And passive absorption an blissful release, may all sentient beings,<br> receiving the merit amassed by the effort I have made in this work,<br> Soon reach your attainment, O great Lokesvara, All-seeing protector with love 
                          for us all.</p>

              <p>I see that it's basically the same as in Theravada - perfection of Ten Paramitas. ( if not mistaken there are 6 listed in Mahayana, just a way of classification).</p>
              <p>How does one  become a boddhisatta according to Mahayana? What I mean here is , to be confirmed as a Boddhisatta.</p>
              <p>TQ for your answer.</p>

              <p>LOL. I could tell from your posts that you are inclined towards
              Mahayana ideals.</p>
              <p>In a fast paced society like singapore, I can imagine it's a
              little bit difficult to practice the Theravada ideals, perhaps this
              is the reason it's not popular in Singapore besides the chinese
              cultural heritage?</p>
              <p>Can you let me know the Boddhisatta ideals in Mahayana? I am not
              sure if you already know, Boddhisatta ideal is inside the Theravada
              too.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>this statement is wrong ... Bodhisatta ideal is not inside any of the Nikaya</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bodhisatta is the seeking of salvation of all sentient beings and eventually to Perfect Buddha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Theravada sutta only talks up to realisation of sunyata and towards arhatship</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but arhatship not equal to Buddhahood</p>
              <p>arhat still have to get rid of the habitual action proceed towards the Perfection of one thing that is NOT found in all the Nikayas - Skilled Means</p>
              <p>If Arhat equal to Buddhahood , then Sariputta ,Maugdalyana are Buddhas ..</p>
              <p>Remember when you chant the Puja its always say</p>
              <p>Homage to the Perfected One , the Exalted one ,the Perfect Buddha</p>
