              <p>You sure you heard "monks"?</p>
              <p>These are the rules of Shaolin... I don't know if it applies to Myanmar monks. Myanmar monks, coming from the Theravada tradition, has a stricter set of rules. In any case, no monks can deal with weapons such as guns. Also, Shaolin monks do not use weapons in actual fighting. Read on and find out.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.taijicommunity.com/OurCommunity/Articles/2003/102003-ShaolinTemple-Part2.html">http://www.taijicommunity.com/OurCommunity/Articles/2003/102003-ShaolinTemple-Part2.html</a></p>
              <p>...It is not surprising that the staff was selected
                                              as the core weapon for the Shaolin monks. As Buddhists, the
                                              monks were not supposed to have anything to do with weapons,
                                              but they could legitimately possess a staff as an aid to
                                              walking or a carrying pole. The Brahmajala-sutra (the Sutra
                                              of Brahma’s net) is a Mahayana work containing ten
                                              major and forty-eight minor rules of discipline and morality.
                                              The first rule forbids killing, which would seem to deny
                                              any form of martial activity to the monks. However, the Brahmajala-sutra
                                              also commands all Buddhists to save all living things from
                                              death and suffering. For example, the 16th precept commands
                                              all followers of the Buddha to give up their flesh to feed
                                              starving tigers, wolves, lions, and hungry ghosts. It was
                                              also expected that all devout Buddhists would protect the
                                              trinity of the Buddha, Sangha (priesthood), and Dharma (teachings).
                                              Protecting Buddhist temples, libraries and priests against
                                              bandits, rebels, and invaders would necessitate the use of
                                              force, which in the circumstances soon becomes viewed as
                                              justified (Cook, p.17). The development of warrior monks
                                              was not limited to the Shaolin Temple, Japanese temples also
                                              recruited bands of sohei, and Tibetan monasteries had their
                                              own bands of warrior monks who maintained order and protected
                                          the monasteries from intruders...</p>

              <h5>Overview</h5>
              <p>Shaolin were Buddhists, mainly. This really did not allow them to
                          use weaponry against other living beings; not just against people or
                          anything living, but no items which primary function is to kill living
                          beings! Yet they trained with weapons! How could this be?</p>
              <p>Shaolin main aim was to achieve enlightenment, preferably in the
                          current lifetime as Lord Buddha did. This requires prolonged periods of
                          meditation, preferably between 2 to 6 hours daily. Unfortunately, this
                          amount of inactivity can cause the Organs, Circulation and general
                          health to worsen and ultimately collapse. To prevent this, internal Chi
                          (life force/energy) had to be strengthened in order to fill your body's
                          reservoir of postnatal Jing (Life Force)! To be able to do this, three
                          types of exercise were developed, that originally were one; Kung Fu,
                          Tai Chi and Chi Kung.</p>
              <p>Yet, as the saying goes, 'the capitol is far away', meaning that
                          safety was always an issue. Even though they were not able to use
                          weapons against others, they trained weaponry to understand it and to
                          be able to counter it bare hand. And that is the major reason for
                          Shaolin Weaponry training.</p>
              <p>Although they trained with Weapons, and became very proficient
                          averaging 4 hours of training a day for 20 years or so (which would
                          equal 40 years of training 2 hours each day or 4 hours every other
                          day). yet, to stay fit and to have variety, they developed many
                          interesting aspects of physical training. It is speculated that each
                          Monk would be proficient in 18 weapons (not all the same 18) some
                          specializing further in Projectile, flexible or hidden weapons to be
                          able to recognize and counter these bare handed. But even the best
                          sometimes need some 'tools' and the Shaolin developed non- weapons as
                          these tools.</p>
              <p>Some of the more famous of these are;</p>

              <p>Over the many years, many weapons have been picked up and called
                          Shaolin. But in reality not that would cut, kill or cripple would be
                          used. Everyday items, commonly available or usually around would be
                          favored. In recent years the Bench has come to prominence (in modern
                          day stool, chair or such). Yet, traditionally, everyday items like a
                          Sash, Pen and Chop Sticks could be effectively used as weapons of
                          defence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, why the Yin/Yang Symbol for the Weaponry Symbols? because
                          there are two halves to Shaolin Weaponry training, the simple is to
                          Learn to use and be proficient with the weapons; the second to lay the
                          weapon aside and be able to effectively, safely and without causing
                          harm, disarm the weapon wielder and stop them from hurting anyone!</p>
