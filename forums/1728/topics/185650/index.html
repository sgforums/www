The Lord replied: "The essence of meditation and the Law is pure, established according to its manifestation and not by arduous inquiry. 51)(2)<br>Among purified, pure, best Bodhisattvas (2) *1 will preach(3) the excellent Suvarnabhasa, king of sutras, very profound on hearing and profound on examination. It has been blessed by the Buddhas in the four directions, by Aksobhyaraja in the east, in the south by RatnaÂ¬ketu, in the west by Amitabha, in the north by Dundubhisvara.<br><br>I will proclaim this blessing, the excellent, auspicious confession, whose aim is the ruin of all evils, producing the destruction of all evils, conÂ¬ferring every blessing, ruining every misfortune, the basis of omniÂ¬science, thoroughly adorned with every splendour.<br><br>For those beings whose senses are defective, whose life is expended or failing, beset bymisfortune, their faces averted from the gods, hated by dear, beloved people, oppressed in such places as households, or at variance with one another, tormented by the destruction of their property, (3) both in grief and trouble, and in poverty, likewise in the plight of fear, in the affliction of planet or asterism, in the violent grip of demons, one (who) sees an evil dream full of grief and trouble should listen to (this) excellent sutra, when he has bathed well and is pure. For those who hear this sutra, the profound Buddha-region, with pure minds and good intentions, adorned with clean garments, and for all beings such most severe misfortunes are forever extinguished by the splendour of this sutra for the world-protectors themselves together with their minÂ¬isters and army chiefs will provide protection for them with countless millions of Yaksas.</div>
