            <div class='col-md body'>Chance on an article at <a href="http://www.serve.com/~cmtan/buddhism/Misc/noself.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.serve.com/~cmtan/buddhism/Misc/noself.html</a><br><br>Do not believe just because someone have told you. Examine and investigate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>SELF AND NO-SELF<br>-Tan Chade Meng<br>(This article explores the very difficult question of "no-self". It is one of my favourites among all the articles I've written.)<br><br>I'm a Research Engineer by profession and the bulk of my work is in the areas of Neural networks and Computer vision. I have also recently developed an interest in Artificial Life (Alife). I approach the issue of "self" both from what little I've learned from my work and what little I've learned as a meditator.<br><br>In my line of research, I find it useful to think of "intelligence" as an "emergent" quality. Perhaps an example will illustrate this idea. Take the example of a flock of birds flying in one direction. The amazing thing about the flock is that it's always organized in a "V" shape, which can be proven to be the most energy-efficient formation (The bird in front generates air movements that lessens the load of the birds behind. When the front bird gets tired, some bird from behind takes over). Another amazing thing is that when the flock meets an obstacle, such as a tall building, it finds a perfect way to split apart and reform again once the obstacle is passed.<br><br>Flock behaviour can be described as an "intelligent" behaviour. One observing the flock might be tempted to conclude that there is an overall intelligence controlling the behaviour of individual birds. But then again, it's obvious that there is no bird in overall control.<br><br>Here's the fun part. It can be shown in simulations that all each bird does is to follow a simple algorithm. Each bird notes only the position of birds immediately surrounding it and puts itself in a position according to what its sees. From such simple behaviours of individual birds, an intelligent overall flock behaviour *emerges*!<br><br>This is what I mean when I say that "intelligence" is "emergent". There is no "central soul" of intelligence, and each element (bird) follows only simple behaviours. But working together, an intelligent behaviour emerges and becomes apparent. Similar emergence of intelligence can be observed in ant behaviour.<br><br>This model of intelligence is extremely attractive to me because I feel that it matches perfectly what I feel the Buddha taught about "self". Based on my knowledge as a AI researcher and my experience as a meditator, I see the "self" as an emergent quality.<br><br>The "self" emerges from the synergism (working together) of the 6 senses. The 6 senses, as defined by the Buddha, are the traditional 5 (sight, smell, touch, sound and taste) and the mind (there are also very practical reasons why the mind is classified as a "sense", but I'll leave this to another discussion). Each sense is formed by the aggregation of the 5 Aggregates. They are body (the sense organ itself), sensation (in my language, activation of sensual inputs), consciousness (the system responding to the presence of input activation), perception (processing of the input to give a symbolic output) and mental formations (post-processing of the output).<br><br>The 5 Aggregates interact to emerge a working sense, and the 6 senses interact to emerge a "self".<br><br>To me, it's a very beautiful idea. There is no "soul", no "essence of self that exists independently of and outside of the Aggregates", yet from this web of interaction, "self" emerges. And this "self" is very real, even though it isn't at all.<br><br>Perhaps it's useful to compare this to "team spirit". When a group of people come together to play basketball, the members interact to emerge the feeling of "team spirit". This quality can be felt by the members and is observable by other people. But there is no "central essence" of "team spirit". It's gone as soon as the team disbands.<br><br>It is therefore correct to say that "*I* feel this way", "*I* am responsible for this and this", "*I* achieved Sotapana-ship", "*I* love so and so", etc. It is also correct to say that "There is no *I*, no *self*. Just the Aggregates and the senses". To me, there are no contradictions, only a very beautiful realization that only a highly Enlightened one could have discovered.<br><br>To me, this is not just an intellectual idea. In my own meditations, I can identify very closely with what I described above. One who abides in Mindfulness and Concentration observes how each sense contributes to his feeling of "self-ness". He observes that he is not any of his senses. He obseves how his senses and aggregates makes him. He realizes self, and no-self. It's a very powerful discovery.<br></div>

So what we percieve as mass is actually energy no different from light or radiation.<br><br>So now we come down all the way to "energy" as the most basic of the building blocks. You cannot say that "energy" is inherently empty because as far as we know, energy is not made up of other components. All the school children knows that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only changes from one form to another.<br>.</blockquote>i think emptiness is a bit miss presentated here. energy always under go a state of fluctuation, and doesn't just stay still. even when we look at the table or chair, the atoms are always in vibrations. it is due to this fluctuation and constant motion that we said that they are inherently 'empty'.<br><br>Buddha actually go further to explain that energy are in the form of abstract earth, abstract waters, abstract air and abstract heat. They are so tiny and so abstract, that they cannot be discerned by any human sense organs or scientific instruments. Only the Buddhas can discern them. The four basic abstract elements should not be mistken as the ordinary earth, water, heat and wind. They are energies.<br><blockquote>Basic Abstract Elements  Characteristics<br>(1) Abstract earth (pathavi) To harden and to soften<br>(2) Abstract water (apo) To flow and to paste<br>(3) Abstract Air (vayo) To expand and to contract<br>(4) Abstract heat (tejo) To heat and to cool </blockquote>ref:<br><a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/articles/cosmos1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/articles/cosmos1.htm</a><br><br>furthermore the fluctuation are due to mental fabrication.

We hold on to self-limiting concepts about ourselves, believing that mistakes made in the past have become permanent aspects of our personality</strong>. These <strong>"permanent faults"</strong> become the basis of low self-esteem and even self-hatred, obscuring our potential to be pure, perfect and free -- an enlightened being. All this arises from ignorant misperception.<br><br>You see Mr Casino my pal...we tend to cherish our<strong> sense of self</strong>, <strong>as if it were the center of the universe.</strong> <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Out of this strong self-centeredness, we develop desire and attachment for people and things that make us happy and support our sense of I, we have aversion and fear towards people and things that disturb us or threaten our sense of I, and we are indifferent towards whoever or whatever neither helps nor harms us. Believing all these people and objects to also exist in a real, permanent, independent way further intensifies our attitudes of attachment and aversion. These attitudes disturb our mind and motivate us to create negative actions or karma, such as harming our enemies, and lying or stealing to benefit ourselves and our loved ones, and this karma is the cause of suffering and problems in the future</span>.</span> <strong>Self-grasping ignorance </strong>is also the main factor that keeps us circling in samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth.<br><br><strong>That is why we should be concerned about our tendency to see things as truly or inherently existent, and why we should learn to perceive things in their correct way, as empty of inherent existence, or, as it says in the verse, as "illusory".</strong> Perhaps a simple way to understand this is by thinking of the analogy of a rainbow. Due to certain conditions in the atmosphere and the play of sunlight and moisture, a rainbow appears in the sky. Although it looks so real we would like to touch it, it is insubstantial, momentary and completely dependent on causes and conditions. It exists for a while and then disappears. Everything else, all conditioned phenomena -- animate and inanimate -- can be compared to a rainbow. Although most things last longer than a rainbow, the way they exist is similar: they arise due to the coming together of different causes and conditions, exist for a while, and then, again due to causes and conditions, they go out of existence. So, like a rainbow, they are illusory, empty of permanent, independent, substantial existence.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

We hold on to self-limiting concepts about ourselves, believing that mistakes made in the past have become permanent aspects of our personality</strong>. These <strong>"permanent faults"</strong> become the basis of low self-esteem and even self-hatred, obscuring our potential to be pure, perfect and free -- an enlightened being. All this arises from ignorant misperception.<br><br>You see Mr Casino my pal...we tend to cherish our<strong> sense of self</strong>, <strong>as if it were the center of the universe.</strong> <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Out of this strong self-centeredness, we develop desire and attachment for people and things that make us happy and support our sense of I, we have aversion and fear towards people and things that disturb us or threaten our sense of I, and we are indifferent towards whoever or whatever neither helps nor harms us. Believing all these people and objects to also exist in a real, permanent, independent way further intensifies our attitudes of attachment and aversion. These attitudes disturb our mind and motivate us to create negative actions or karma, such as harming our enemies, and lying or stealing to benefit ourselves and our loved ones, and this karma is the cause of suffering and problems in the future</span>.</span> <strong>Self-grasping ignorance </strong>is also the main factor that keeps us circling in samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth.<br><br><strong>That is why we should be concerned about our tendency to see things as truly or inherently existent, and why we should learn to perceive things in their correct way, as empty of inherent existence, or, as it says in the verse, as "illusory".</strong> Perhaps a simple way to understand this is by thinking of the analogy of a rainbow. Due to certain conditions in the atmosphere and the play of sunlight and moisture, a rainbow appears in the sky. Although it looks so real we would like to touch it, it is insubstantial, momentary and completely dependent on causes and conditions. It exists for a while and then disappears. Everything else, all conditioned phenomena -- animate and inanimate -- can be compared to a rainbow. Although most things last longer than a rainbow, the way they exist is similar: they arise due to the coming together of different causes and conditions, exist for a while, and then, again due to causes and conditions, they go out of existence. So, like a rainbow, they are illusory, empty of permanent, independent, substantial existence.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> [/b]</blockquote>cos of the above  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The concept of "emptiness" can be seen in daily life.<br><br>For example, you fulk an exam.

In Buddhism, Emptiness is so important because without realising emptiness we cannot be liberated from sufferings and vexations - the world of Samsara. By realising emptiness we can be liberated in this lifetime.<br><br>For example, by realising the empty nature of phenomena, our minds will be cleansed of its defilements and fetters. We will not be attached to greed and hatred, and our ignorance will be dispelled (i.e ignorance of the nature of existence, attachment to self).<br><br>If someone insults you, by seeing the empty nature of phenomena, you do not feel insulted because you are not attached to ego, and you do not feel 'threatened' - but sees this insult as 'conditioned arising' - 'empty'. That is why when the Buddha got insulted, he remained completely calm, seeing it merely as conditioned arising. He did not feel angry at the person at all, and the person left eventually, ashamed. This is just one example, in life I'm sure there are a lot of situations where the wisdom of emptiness will be put to good use, and in fact, we must be mindful every moment in our lives.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For example, say you're hit on the head by somebody wielding a stick. Instead of being angry with that person, you should think, "If I'm going to get angry I should get angry with the object that causes the pain. That means I should be angry with the stick. But the stick itself is not responsible for my pain; it's under the control of the person wielding it and has none of its own. However, the person hitting me with the stick also has no control; he's forced to do it by his deluded mind. How can I get angry with him?</span><br><br>Now, even the verse I quoted previously from Heart Sutra can have a direct impact on life -<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">O Shariputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness. They do not appear nor disappear, are not tainted nor pure, do not increase nor decrease. - Heart Sutra</span><br><br>In life, many people are often caught up and attached to gain and loss. Just like gamblers. This cause a lot of sufferings, and if a person practise the dharma and sees phenomena as empty of inherent existence, he will not be caught up by gain and loss, as gain and loss is illusory and empty.<br><br><blockquote>Religious or not most people realise that they live for only some decades but they still live their lives as if they are going to live forever.</blockquote>Buddhists are different for we emphasize on the impermanence of life, and practise mindfulness of every moment to a point whereby we are not even affected if our life is to go in an instant, for example in a Tsunami.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">One day, Buddha questioned a number of his students,<br><br>"How long can a human life be certain?"<br>One of the students answered, "For a few days."<br>Buddha replied, "No, you have not yet understood life."<br>Buddha then repeated,<br><br>"How long can a human life be certain?"<br>Another student answered, "For a meal."<br>Again, Buddha replied, "No, you have not understood life either."<br>Buddha repeated one third time,<br><br>"How long can a human life be certain?"<br>A third student answered, "Only for a breath."<br>Buddha praised, "Great!

I would say: such a person has not really understood Emptiness but thinks of Emptiness in terms of nihilism. Emptiness is not nihilism, it means that things are empty of inherent existence, and is <strong>conditioned arising</strong>. By 'eating, drinking and be merry and neglect family', he is escaping from reality. Even though the world is empty of inherent existence, but we cannot escape the laws of causality. Otherwise Buddha would not have taught about karma.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no3c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no3c.htm</a><br><br><strong>'All phenomena arise by the aggregation of causes and conditions; all phenomena cease by the dispersion of causes and conditions.' How do we apply this Law of Causality?</strong><br><br>Using the family to illustrate the Law of Causality, a family is established as a result of the aggregation of causes and conditions. Since the family has already been brought about by these various causes and conditions, we should therefore live peacefully and joyfully as a family. Fulfilling this positive causality for the family will leave us with no regrets in the future.<br><br>We shouldn't reckon presume that 'all forms are empty' (Buddhist philosophy that all things and phenomena are empty because they don't have an independent nature of their own.); you are 'empty', I am also 'empty' and we are all 'empty', and so we don't care about anything. This is wrong. Since all things result from aggregations of causes and conditions we must make good use of these causes and conditions.<br><br>As another example, it is only because I am here to give a Dharma talk that this bouquet of flowers has been prepared. Therefore, we should place these flowers nicely on the table so that people can appreciate them. If while we are admiring the flowers, a person comes by and declares, "Sigh, all phenomena arising from causes and conditions are empty. What use is there in having such a beautiful bouquet of flowers?" He then removes it and throws it away. This person may not be of sound mind, because by now you know about the Law of Causality, and you say that the flowers are empty. But, you are still physically here. You, as a 'person' have not emptied away! So how could you say that the flowers are empty? Therefore, you should diligently learn and practise what the Buddha taught, and cultivate. First of all empty the sentient being (i.e. the arising and ceasing of thoughts and feelings) within you, and then you will not find that things in the world are contradictory.<br><br>So from this, we see how that which is seemingly contradictory in the world, stems from failure to properly grasp the principles. Because when the principles have not been correctly understood, there cannot be coherence in their application to matters of the world. This leads to lack of roundedness and harmony in the way we deal with things.</blockquote></div>
