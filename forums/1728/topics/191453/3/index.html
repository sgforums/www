But don't forget that at the very basic level you have wave energy see 2nd page 19 May 2006 Â· 02:11 PM</blockquote>Exerpt from <a href="http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/emptiness.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/emptiness.html</a><br><br><strong>The emptiness of matter.</strong><br><br>The ancient Greeks believed that matter is composed of indivisible small elements with certain characteristics, such as the characteristics of earth, water, air, and fire. They called these elements atoms and they held that atoms were solid and fundamental, like microscopic billiard balls. Ernest Rutherford invalidated the billiard ball theory by conducting an experiment, which suggested that atoms have an internal structure. He established that atoms have a nucleus containing most of its mass and that electrons orbit the nucleus. Moreover, he established that the nucleus of an atom is only about one ten-thousandth of the diameter of the atom itself, which means that 99.99% of the atom's volume consists of empty space. This is the first manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter. Not long after Rutherford's discovery, physicists found out that the nucleus of an atom likewise has an internal structure and that the protons and neutrons making up the nucleus are composed of even smaller particles, which they named quarks after a poem of James Joyce. Interestingly, quarks are hypothesised as geometrical points in space, which implies that atoms are essentially empty. This is the second manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter.<br><br>The terms "quarks" and "points in space" still suggest something solid, since they can be imagined as irreducible mass particles. Yet, quantum field theory does away even with this finer concept of solidity by explaining particles in the terms of field properties. Quantum electrodynamics (QED) has produced an amazingly successful theory of matter by combining quantum theory, classical field theory, and relativity. No discrepancies between the predictions of QED and experimental observation have ever been found. According to QED, subatomic particles are indistinguishable from fields, whereas fields are basically properties of space. In this view, a particle is a temporary local densification of a field, which is conditioned by the properties of the surrounding space. Ergo, matter is not different from space. This is the third manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter.<br><br>An important class of phenomena in the subatomic world is defined by the various interactions between particles. In fact, there is no clear distinction between the notions of phenomena, particles, and interactions, although interactions can be described clearly in mathematical terms. For example, there are interactions between free electrons by means of photons that result in an observed repelling force. There are also interactions between the quarks of a nucleon by means of mesons, interactions between the neighbouring neutrons or protons, interactions between nucleus and electrons, and interactions between the atoms of molecules. The phenomena themselves -the nucleon, the nucleus, the atom, the molecule- are sufficiently described by these interactions, meaning by the respective equations, which implies that interactions and phenomena are interchangeable terms. Interestingly, the interrelations of quantum physics do not describe actual existence. Instead they predict the potential for existence. A manifest particle, such as an electron, cannot be described in terms of classical mechanics. It exists as a multitude of superposed "scenarios", of which one or another manifests only when it is observed, i.e. upon measurement. Therefore, matter does not inherently exist. It exists only as interrelations of "empty" phenomena whose properties are determined by observation. This is the fourth manifestation of emptiness at the subtle level of matter.</div>

So what we percieve as mass is actually energy no different from light or radiation.<br><br>So now we come down all the way to "energy" as the most basic of the building blocks. You cannot say that "energy" is inherently empty because as far as we know, energy is not made up of other components.

But the label is also a conditioned arising, not because it is already inherently called a 'sun' or the 'sun' will be called a 'sun' for eternity. You call it 'sun' because the conditions are met. Therefore everything is conditioned and empty of inherent existence. It is not independantly arisen, it is not an independant entity but based upon various conditions.<br><br>Since the sun is empty of inherent existence,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">O Shariputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness.

It is a constantly changing object, that is all.</blockquote>All are conditioned arising, and even our imputed labels which are based on our mental perceptions are also conditioned arising. The perception, for example, is dependant on our 5 sense consciousness which is dependant on the presence of the sense-object and the sense organs. But neither can the inherent existence/essence be found within the object upon analysis. Therefore the essence/inherent existence of the object are neither found in mental perceptions nor physicality.<br><br>Does mere seeing come first, or perceiving the conditions to be an object comes first? Although when it comes upon analysis, it seems clear that 'mere seeing' comes first before we say 'there - the chair is there', in real life we often perceive in a mode that we think that there really is an object existing itself there, and we grasp on the mental appearance of this object to be true, thereby missing the reality of what is.</div>
