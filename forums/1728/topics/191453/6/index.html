The large international membership of the World Buddhist Sangha Council is clear evidence. There are a growing number of internet sites that offer information about Buddhism. Many companies produce music, videos, and multi-media educational material on Buddhism. Buddhism has even influenced pop culture and permeated into the psyche of the masses. In Singapore too, Buddhism has not only retained its relevance, but is gaining popularly. Between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of Singaporeans above 15 years old who are Buddhists increased from 31% to 43%, the largest increase amongst all major religions. <span style="color: green;">Dharma talks in Singapore are now also conducted in English, to reach out to young Singaporeans, including professionals.</span> <strong>Devotees today do not just visit the temples to pray. They are eager to delve deeper into the Buddhist scriptures and reflect upon their philosophical and spiritual significance.</strong><br><br>Pls oso read <span style="color: darkred;">Buddhism's draw is no longer as a folk religion</span><br><br><a href="http://www.yayapapayaz.com/comm/20050520_st_buddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yayapapayaz.com/comm/20050520_st_buddhism.htm</a></div>

They will come back and tell me that people still have to eat (emptiness is form.)<br><br>So you see, they have a point, while form is emptiness, emptiness is form. People still need to go on with their lives and not simply say, "kong kong, sen3 me4 dou shi4 kong."<br><br>How does one apply this saying in real life?</div></blockquote>MmmMmmMm usually when we say winning and losing is an illusion cos either winning and losing gives lasting happiness.<br><br>Winning gives momentary happiness but after squander winning lot away. what happiness are there left ? A win does not mean constant winning. it is easier to get upset if u place happiness on top of external things as top priority. which is so easy affected.<br><br>ThrilL and pleasure in gambling?.

BUT life does not goes the way u want loh... esp in gambling where it depends on luck.<br><br>Addicated Gamblers are selfish. They are attached to (love-of- thrill ,pleasure, anger (must win back the money or not appeased) etc etc desire ) that they fail to see their actions affecting their love ones. this Obession/attachement to their desire blinded their mind.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Let me give another example, maybe Platform shoes was hot in 1960s then lose its fashion fad... then become popular again in the 90s and now it may be resurfacing again as a fashion fad... However, it is still about Platform shoes (Platforms shoes are still Platform shoes ) but the motivation for this fashion fad, people's attitude towards the shoes and design/type of the platform  change along with time.<br><br>Every designs, idea and people are inter-related/ inter-play with one another to affected the direction of fashion trend which affect platform shoes.<br><br>ur questions: Is a constantly changing object an object?<br><br>Emptiness does not deny the existence of each and every thing, but it denies the existence of a fixed unchanging self behind each and every thing.<br><br>.<br><br></div>

Knowledge is one thing, understanding is another. If there is understanding one can adjust oneÂ’s life according to changing circumstances based on the knowledge one has. We may have met learned people who know many things but are not realistic because their egoism, their selfishness, their anger, their hatred do not allow them to gain unbiased mental attitudes and peace of mind. When it is necessary to compromise, we must know how to compromise. When it is necessary to tolerate, we must know how to tolerate. When it is necessary to stand firm we must stand firm, with dignity.<br><br>As i have said inorder  to have a better understanding,attend dharma talk lor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tot u practice meditation before. what they teach?<br><br>i think for any methods (be it breathing, recitation, visualisation of image, contemplation of thoughts etcs), if one can get the mind from wandering about, it's a successful method.<br>they are in the end to tame the mind ie 'still' the mind.<br><br>they used an analogy of the senses:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"A crocodile, bird, dog, fox, monkey and snake were tied together with a rope and then were let go. Six creatures of very different natures. Each animal will try to go back to its own lair by its own method. The snake will seek a covering of grass, the crocodile will seek water, the bird will want to fly in the air, the dog will seek a village, the fox the solitude ledge and the monkey will seek the trees of a forest. That the animals are connected by one rope, the strongest at any one time will drag the rest. Man is tempted in different ways by the desires of his 6 senses eyes, ears, nose, touch, tongue or taste and mind and is controlled by the predominate desire. If the creatures are all tied to a post they will try to get free until they are tired out and then will lie down by the post. Just like this, if people will train and control the mind there will no further trouble from the other 5 senses. Once the mind is under control peace can be found." </span><br><br>/\<br></div>
