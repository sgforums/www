              <p>Have you liberated animals before ? The Fang Sheng ritual of seeking blessings for your health.</p>
              <p>I have attended Fang Sheng activities with the chanting to help the animals to take refuge in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha so that in the next life they are reborn, they have affinity with Buddha.  (sowing a dharma seed for them while they are in the animal realm).</p>
              <p>What  i want to share are the sweet experiences i had with the animals.</p>
              <p>The birds will fly back to my door and window. They will chirp and sing songs.</p>
              <p>One pair of sweet yellow birds (from Indonesia) became a couple and they flew back to my window together and peep in at me while i was doing my praying.</p>
              <p>I know these yellow birds (small like sparrows) because they are rare.</p>
              <p>Even the bird seller will not allow me to release the birds in front of his shop because he told me they will fly back to the shop.</p>
              <p>When you release the birds, they seem to show their gratitude by seeking you out.</p>
              <p>It's a joy to see the birds re-appearing in front of your house occasionally and chirp their songs to you.</p>

              <p>While releasing fishes back to the sea, i have similar sweet memories.</p>
              <p>There was this fish who just swarm round and round in a circle and refused to swim away after i released it into the sea. The other fishes from the same pail had already disappeared without a sign when i poured them into the sea.</p>
              <p>I had to wave and asked it to go , shouting from the jetty before it turned , looked at me and then with a swing of its tail, dipped into the sea and disappeared.</p>
              <p>At that moment, i felt the gratitude of this particular fish. As if it was a "human" and could express its thanks in its own way.</p>
              <p>During the chanting of the refuge taking for the animals, they will usually quietened down and seem to listen.  The sparrows in a huge cage will stop making noises and flapping around in the cage, the fishes stopped to swim frantically in the tanks and the animals hear our praying for them.</p>
              <p>Any body with any nice experience to share in their liberation of animals ?</p>

              <p>can always check with the bird's seller. Are the birds captured in the wild.  If they are, they can survive in Singapore's mild weather.</p>
              <p>I ask one additional question, are the birds being captured for fang sheng purpose or just randomly.  I don't want to buy birds from professional catcher who waits to capture the birds from fang sheng area ( which happen in thailand / india ) .</p>
              <p>Any way if the birds are from other countries, they can't be captured again in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Same goes for the fishes, you can always check with the sellers the species of fishes that can survive in their own motherland (sea).</p>

              <p><br>Both types.   If you release on your own , you can take the effort to help the animals to take refuge in front of your altar. Just a few phrases only, not difficult to read.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i just release them without the refuge ritual.  I am just happy to see them free again. ^^</p>

                      Actually animals do have ç�µæ€§çš„ã€‚A few months' ago, I was playing the amituofo song in my bedroom while doing my homework around 5pm+, a å…«å“¥/Javan Myna flew into my bedroom window and stood there listened to the song. I was quite surprised and quickly recorded down as video using my iphone. The bird stood on my window panel until it fell alseep. So I just on my amituofo song non stop for the bird to listen. The next morning around 7am, the bird then flew away and left me lots of bird shit to clear on my window panel. Hahaha </p>
                      
                      
                          
                       <p>
                      å…«å“¥/Javan Myna can be frequently seen near coffeeshop as they always like to steal the
                      left-over food. They are always on high alert and will fly away if the customers or cleaners come near them. When I took the video of the å…«å“¥/Javan Myna near the window, at about less than 20cm away, it wasnt scare of me at all. Guess the bird was very engrossed in listening to the amituofo song. Hope the bird will reborn in western paradise soon. </p>

              <p>i read this story of a poor old worker in Taiwan who can only afford to buy these shellfishes to release . He will cycle all the way after work to release them into the sea. For years, he can only afford to buy a small bag of these cockles to release.</p>

              <p>Actually animals do have ç�µæ€§çš„ã€‚A few months' ago, I was playing the amituofo song in my bedroom while doing my homework around 5pm+, a å…«å“¥/Javan Myna flew into my bedroom window and stood there listened to the song. I was quite surprised and quickly recorded down as video using my iphone. The bird stood on my window panel until it fell alseep. So I just on my amituofo song non stop for the bird to listen. The next morning around 7am, the bird then flew away and left me lots of bird shit to clear on my window panel. Hahaha</p>
              <p>å…«å“¥/Javan Myna can be frequently seen near coffeeshop as they always like to steal the left-over food. They are always on high alert and will fly away if the customers or cleaners come near them. When I took the video of the å…«å“¥/Javan Myna near the window, at about less than 20cm away, it wasnt scare of me at all. Guess the bird was very engrossed in listening to the amituofo song. Hope the bird will reborn in western paradise soon.</p>

              <p>last time one bird is just $1.5 - $2.  Now one bird can be $5 or $10 depending on the shop.</p>
              <p>if you buy a tortoise to release, it can cost you up to $100 for a big one.  Big one can survive easier on its own than the tiny one, you see.</p>
              <p>A fish can cost you $10 or more. </p>
              <p>Relatively, hum is more affordable.</p>
