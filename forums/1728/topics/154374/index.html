            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg" rel="nofollow">www.jenchen.org.sg</a><br><br><strong>Returning to the Quintessence of Buddha</strong><br><br>All of us have a Â“transient-invisible-body (Antara-bhava)Â”. While we are alive this is called Â“mind-consciousnessÂ”. It is commonly referred to as the Â“soulÂ”. When we are asleep, this mind-consciousness does not sleep. Instead, it combs through the past records that are stored in the eighth mind-consciousness (All of us have eight consciousness. In addition to the six sense-consciousness, namely, eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind, there are the seventh [Klista-mano-vijnana] and eighth [Alaya-vijnana] mind-consciousness. The eighth consciousness is the planting field of the mind. The seeds of all our encounters, both virtuous and evil, of our aeons of many past lives are planted here. The seventh mind-consciousness gives rise to the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”.) When a person is dead, his six sense-organs, namely, the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind stop functioning. His sense of sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch and perception also cease to function. Thereafter, the seventh mind-consciousness no longer resides in the body. It leaves the body and begins to search for the right conditions for rebirth to the next life. (At this stage, the mind-consciousness is called a Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”. It is an intermediate existence between death and rebirth to the next life.) The right conditions of rebirth are found within a period of 49 days, on each of the seven cycles of the seventh day after the person has passed away ( i.e. 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, Â… 49th day).<br><br>It is for this reason that dharma practices are made at seven daysÂ’ interval during these 49 days to transfer merits to the deceased. These dharma practices should be preceded by a well cultivated Buddhist teacher in order to help to guide and elevate the deceased to liberation or to a virtuous realm in his next life.<br><br>The only way to understand the principle of birth and death is by cultivating the Great Dharma (Dharma of the Origin of Great Wisdom (????). Practitioners of the Pure Land Sect who cultivate by reciting the name of the Buddha still have this Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ” for rebirth to take place in the Western Pure Land where they are reborn by means of the lotus flower. However, each individual arrives at the Western Pure Land with their own degree of cultivation and merit. At the highest level they immediately become awakened to the Buddha. If it is at the low level, one needs to cultivate for a very long time before his wisdom blossoms and he awakens to his Buddha-nature and realizes non-arising of the mind.<br>In contrast, when we are cultivating the Great Dharma, during meditation we extinguish this transient-invisible-body. By the non-arising (and therefore non-cessation) of the mind the sentient being inside you no longer exists. We thereby awake our own Buddha-nature. At this point the transient-invisible-body is extinguished by the brightness of Buddha-nature. This is because the transient-invisible-body gathers darkness, and when we have awakened our Buddha-nature, brightness will manifest and the transient-invisible-body naturally disappears.<br><br>The human beingÂ’s seventh mind-consciousness is the Â“IÂ”. Because of Â“IÂ”, it gives rise to Â“myÂ”. Because of Â“meÂ”, it gives rise to self-attachment, followed by attachment of perception such as Â“I like it this way Â…Â” or Â“I like it that way Â…Â” In the end, people become attached to everything, be it right or wrong. This is the root cause of distress and suffering. Â“IgnoranceÂ” means darkness and without brightness. People lose their temper because of ignorance. If we investigate the reason for being angry, at the beginning most people will blame it on others. On further investigation, we will discover that the anger stems from self-ignorance. When we have understood this principle, we will realize that these are due to this Â“IÂ” (seventh mind-consciousness, transient-invisible body). Therefore if we allow it (the ignorance) to further develop and lead according to the wishes of this Â“IÂ”, we will certainly descend to a lower realm of life, because the root of this Â“IÂ” is ignorance.<br><br>Originally, sentient beings and the quintessence of Buddha were the same in pureness and brightness. However, when the conditions for the initiation of ignorance begin to fan like the wind, it eventually produces ignorance. The ignorance becomes more serious as it gathers momentum and leads to the transmigration in the Six Realms. Ignorance, just like the wind, is invisible and one may not be able to touch them, yet it packs with power so immense that it can destroy houses and uproot trees.<br><br>In the beginning when sentient beings started to transmigrate in the Six Realms, they were in the realm of Heaven. Then, they descended to the Human realm. Human beings have seven types of emotion and six types of lust and because of these they continually commit negative karma. These led them to descend to the realm of Asura. Why is the realm of Asura considered to be a good realm? It is because even heavenly beings can be inflicted by ignorance, causing them to fight among themselves. The more aggressive fighters eventually descend to the realm of Asura.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When we cultivate the Great Dharma, we spontaneously become as bright as the quintessence of all BuddhaÂ’s of the past, present and future. Lay-Buddhists live at home and have their own families, but they still need to cultivate diligently. We must cultivate to the stage where we do not transmigrate in the six realms when we die. When we practise the Great Dharma, we spontaneously transform our seventh mind-consciousness or Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ” into light. That light is the same as the quintessence of Buddha. When we stop breathing, our breath actually diffuses into space and becomes an integral part of space. Thus, if we are skilful in practising the Great Dharma, we do not have the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”. It is transformed into brightness and returned to the quintessence of Buddha of the Dharma World. This brightness is not the sunlight. It is also not the brightness of a lamp, but the quintessence of Buddha (known as ?? [Ji-Guang] in Mandarin).<br><br>When our mind is completely pure, devoid of arising and ceasing of thoughts, it naturally produces brightness. Our brightness is the same as that of all BuddhaÂ’s and BodhisattvaÂ’s. At that point in time, we should not ask, Â“Where am I going?Â” It is because sentient beings have this habit of self attachment, the moment thoughts pertaining to the self arise, such as Â“Where am I?Â”, or Â“What is happening to my possessions?Â” arise, it produces the transient-invisible-body again and transmigration will take place<br><br>When our brightness merges with the brightness of Buddha, we become a Â“greater selfÂ” in the quintessence of the universe and no longer the Â“little selfÂ” of an ordinary being. The quintessence of Buddha is the real self, whereas the self of an ordinary being is false.<br><br>When we speak of learning Buddhism to find our true nature, it is referring to this greater self. When we accomplished this greater self in this way, regardless of any Buddha and in any world, whether the Buddha is Amitabha Buddha, Bhaisajya Buddha or any other Buddha, we are also a part of the Buddha.<br><br>When we are adept in the practice of the Great Dharma, a favourable condition spontaneously emerges at the point of death and transports us to the Ji-Guang Pure Land (????). However, if the mind is not pure and a thought arises, for example, the thought of an unfinished task, then the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ” appears again and will transmigrate in one of the Six Realms of existence.<br><br>This Saha world is a world full of suffering. When the human body dies, the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ” appears, it is called the karma life. When we cultivate the Great Dharma and attain a pure mind, we spontaneously arrive at the shore of liberation. This is called wisdom life.<br><br>When we understand this principle, we should treasure the dharma and practice diligently. Whether it is wealth, property, fame or gains, they are not real. If everyone cultivates the Great Dharma, then there is no division for we all become one.<br><br>The Ji-Guang Pure Land (????) gives rise to the world of Buddha. It is not something that can be borne of the human mind. It is not an ordinary world as we know it. If we cultivate well, we will fore-know the hour (the time) of our death.<br><br>Notes:<br><br>[1] Quintessence: purest form or manifestation of some quality etc, highly refined extract.<br><br>Â© Copyright 2002.Jen Chen Buddhism Centre<br>Designed by DCS Solutions Ltd</div>
