                  evangelist of love</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">TIM FUNK </span><span class="creditline" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">The Charlotte Observer </span><span class="grd" style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;">October 14, 2015</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">At nearly 97 years old, Billy
                  Graham has a new book out.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">The cover of "Where I Am:
                  Heaven, Eternity and Our Life Beyond" features the face of Graham in his
                  grandfatherly years, when the Charlotte, N.C.-born evangelist appeared to
                  mellow, emphasize God's love and even offer what some interpreted as an
                  inclusive vision of the afterlife. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">But on many of the 259 pages of
                  Graham's 33rd book, the words about heaven and especially hell echo his
                  hard-line sermons from the 1950s, when he stressed God's judgment, man's sin
                  and the lies of the devil.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">One Billy Graham scholar said the
                  book reads like it was written not by Graham but by his son, Franklin, an
                  evangelist who has a combative style.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">But Franklin Graham, in an
                  interview with the Observer, said his father is the author: "It's all him.
                  Nothing in the book was written that's not in his words." </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">In "Where I Am," heaven
                  is reserved for Christians who commit their lives to Jesus and hell is real and
                  delivers fiery punishment or worse.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"Hell is a place of sorrow
                  and unrest, a place of wailing and a furnace of fire," the book says.
                  "And it is where many will spend eternity. If you accept any part of the
                  Bible, you are forced to accept the reality of hell, the place for punishment
                  for those who reject Christ."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">'IT WAS ON HIS HEART' </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Franklin Graham acknowledged that
                  his father "stressed certain things more than others" during
                  different times in his life. But he said Billy Graham "never backed away
                  from" the message in the Gospel of John that belief in Jesus' divinity is
                  necessary to get to heaven.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Graham added that his father
                  originally wanted his latest book to focus entirely on hell.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"Maybe this was a burden,
                  that he felt he didn't preach (about hell) strong enough in his latter years. I
                  don't know," the younger Graham said. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Franklin Graham, who is outspoken
                  these days in his condemnation of Islam and same-sex marriage, wrote the
                  foreword to "Where I Am." And his former longtime secretary, Donna
                  Lee Toney, helped write the book with Billy Graham.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Graham's son said he didn't write
                  any of the book - "I don't have time for it" - and that his role in
                  the project "was to encourage Daddy to do it 'cause it was on his
                  heart."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">But some Billy Graham scholars
                  say the book echoes the stands and style of Franklin Graham rather than his
                  famous father.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"It (is) clearly, indisputably
                  Franklin," said Grant Wacker, a professor emeritus at Duke Divinity School
                  who authored "America's Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a
                  Nation," a well-reviewed study/biography released last year. "Over
                  the course of (Billy) Graham's career, he talked less and less about hell until
                  the end (of his career), when he barely mentioned it."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">The reason? "He wanted to
                  bring people to Christ, not scare them away," said Wacker, who added that
                  Graham had stopped talking about a literal hell of fire and referred to it as a
                  state of being separated from God.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">CHANGE IN TONE </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Though there is plenty in
                  "Where I Am" about God's love and forgiveness, its tone is harsher
                  overall than the one Graham projected in the latter years of his public
                  ministry.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">In 2005, as Graham was preparing
                  for his final crusade, in New York, CNN's Larry King asked him whether Jews,
                  Muslims and other non-Christians would go to heaven.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"That's in God's hands. I
                  can't be the judge," Graham said.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">King followed up by asking Graham
                  how he felt when he saw Christian leaders on TV saying "you are condemned.
                  You will live in hell if you do not accept Jesus Christ."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">In his response, Graham said such
                  leaders had a right to speak and what they said was "true to a certain
                  extent." But he told King that he drew a distinction between himself and
                  such fire-and-brimstone preachers.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"That's not my
                  calling," Graham said. "My call is to preach the love of God and the
                  forgiveness of God and the fact that he does forgive us. That's what the cross
                  is all about, what the Resurrection is about. That's the Gospel. And you can
                  get off in all kinds of different side trails. In my earlier ministry, I did
                  the same. But as I got older, I guess I became more mellow and more forgiving
                  and more loving."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Years before that, in 1997,
                  Graham went even further during an appearance on TV evangelist Robert
                  Schuller's show, "The Hour of Power." Graham said some non-Christians
                  around the world are saved even though they may not even know the name of
                  Jesus.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"Whether they come from the Muslim
                  world or the Buddhist world or the Christian world or the nonbelieving world,
                  they are members of the body of Christ because they've been called by
                  God," he said. "They may not even know the name of Jesus, but they
                  know in their hearts that they need something that they don't have and they
                  turn to the only light that they have. And I think they are saved and they are
                  going to be with us in heaven."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Contrast those Graham comments
                  with this from the introduction of Graham's new book: "You may be thinking,
                  Billy, surely you do not believe all of this Hellfire and brimstone. My dear
                  friends, it is not what I say that counts. It is what the word of God says.
                  Jesus spoke more about hell than heaven. Why? Because of his great compassion
                  for souls. He gave his life to spare you the agony, torment, and gruesome
                  reality that hell is reserved for those who reject Christ."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">FATE OF NON-CHRISTIANS </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Asked about his father's comments
                  on TV, Franklin Graham said that Schuller's questions - about the future of
                  Christianity - "led him a little bit" and "my father did not
                  fully understand some of the questions." As for Buddhists and Muslims and
                  others getting to heaven, the younger Graham said they'd make it there "if
                  they confess their sins and acknowledge Jesus Christ as their savior and trust
                  him as their Lord."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Wacker said it is true that Billy
                  Graham always said that the only way to heaven was through Christ.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">But Wacker, who taught Christian
                  history at Duke, said Graham also held what Wacker called a "principled
                  agnosticism" about what happened to non-Christians after death.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"He resolutely refused to
                  judge what happened to people who failed to affirm faith in Christ,"
                  Wacker said. "He insisted that this was God's call, not his. ... His sole
                  task was to preach the Gospel and leave the rest to God."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">The Observer also asked Franklin
                  Graham about the process of writing "Where I Am," given its author's
                  advanced age and physical limitations. Billy Graham, who will turn 97 on Nov.
                  7, still has a sharp mind, his son said, but "he doesn't hear well. You
                  have to repeat things sometimes two or three times. And he doesn't see well.
                  ... If something is printed in real big print, he'll work at it."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">The younger Graham said his
                  father started working on the book before his 95th birthday. He did 80 percent
                  of what he needed to do - including an outline and summations of the chapters,
                  each of which is based on a book in the Bible.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"Then he got ill,"
                  Franklin Graham said. "We put the book on the shelf. We didn't think he
                  would finish it."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">But he did as his health got
                  better, Graham said, working with Toney, the writer assisting him.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">"The way it works with Daddy
                  - he can't read, so you have to read it to him and he comments," his son
                  said. "This isn't a cut-and-paste of his old sermons or anything like
                  that. It's a new book. Where we needed to fill in some gaps, we went back and
                  checked his sermons to make sure it was accurate. ... It's all him. Nothing in
                  the book was written that's not in his words."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Toney, the writer who has also
                  worked with Billy Graham on his last several books, authored an article about
                  the making of "Where I Am" in the current issue of
                  "Decision," a magazine published by the Charlotte-based Billy Graham
                  Evangelistic Association. She writes that Graham was eager to work on the book
                  - partly because he didn't think today's pastors preached enough about heaven
                  and hell and partly because he didn't think enough people understood their
                  choice in "where they will spend eternity after death."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Wacker, though, said that what
                  appears in "Where I Am" is "dramatically different from (Billy)
                  Graham's emphasis - especially in his spoken words ï¿½ through the time when he
                  was in his mid-80s."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">In a recent story by Religion
                  News Service, some Billy Graham scholars echoed Wacker in noting that the words
                  in "Where I Am" - including its focus on biblical descriptions of
                  hell - are a big shift from the language he used after the 1950s.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Franklin Graham's response:
                  "These people are supposed to be experts on Billy Graham. A lot of them
                  haven't talked to my father in 20-some years."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; " lang="EN">Wacker had his own response: He
                  said the BGEA has kept outside reporters and others away from Billy Graham for
                  at least six years. "If these are Graham's words," Wacker said,
                  "they are being expressed only through the family and inside the (Graham)

              <p>Now I tell you what sort of fate non-Christians go. Non-Christians including and sometimes especially Buddhists go to hell, and itÅ› because we asked for it.</p>
              <p>Yet if you outlive Jesus Christ by nearly three times the human age of your founding father, if somebody wrote that book on your behalf while you took all the credit, now it is my job to suggest that there is gravity on this planet earth. Take Taiwan for instance, we also publish books, Tzuchi alone publishes lots of books. If you go to Dharma Drum, well the retinue of the late Venerable Sheng Yen is also in business and they even make youtube videos. Now since I can hardly comb the whole of traditional China, I leave one out, now Venerable Hsin Yun also has lots of books, and as buddhists WE GIVE BOOKS FREE instead of selling them on Amazon.com.</p>
              <p>Now publishing books for sale is what Thich Nhat Hanh made famous with Martin Luthur King Jr, aint wrong, now if you think too much before a pen and paper sometimes buddhists have karma in fact all the time, you can get sick you dont get up. So somebody publishes on their behalf. Fine.</p>
              <p>The ajahns published loads of books as well, Ajahn Chah still has his website up and running having died over decades.</p>
              <p>Now whatÅ› the thing about a book? The thing about a book is because somebody bothers to read it and found it relevant.</p>
              <p>Yet now, who is the publishor? What you mean you printed hundreds and thousands of books on paper that came from Indonesia? Wah can we put an embargo somewhere. It is the paper that is the problem, now now.</p>
