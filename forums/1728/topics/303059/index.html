You may want to ask some christian to answer this question though.<br>I think maybe bible is much easier to read and doesn't require so much time considering the amount of content inside.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can think of several reasons:<br><br>1. Christianity is seen as hip and trendy, whereas Buddhism (especially the brand of Buddhism portrayed by the joss-stick-buddhists-turned-Christian) is seen as old fashion and superstitious.<br><br>2. Christianity is seen as classy. Some Christians like to showcase the VIPs in their church, politicians, doctors and famous university professors etc. Many people like the networking relationship made available in these church gatherings.<br><br>3. Spiritually, it is much easier being a Christian than a Buddhist. For the former, all you need to do is to pledge your allegiance to the Christian God, and whatever your past misdeeds will be forgiven. For Buddhists, you have to really work hard to atone for your past negative actions, and even then the negative karma arising from these misdeeds will not be 'forgiven', merely reduced in severity.<br><br>4. There is a 'feel good' element knowing that a supposedly almighty being is watching over you. Provides a spiritual 'crutch' to the spiritually handicapped.<br><br>5. Aggressive evangelizing. Christianity is a proselytizing religion. They make an art out of defending their faith (Apologetics) and spreading their religion.<br><br>6. Emotional elements knowing that Jesus has taken the brunt of our "sins" and died for us on the cross. Many people, especially ladies, will be 'touched' into believing.<br><br>7. Remnants of colonial mentality. Christianity is the dominant religion of the west. We were once a British colony. Although we have gained independance for more than 4 decades now, there is still some leftover colonial mentality whereby we think the west is good. We emulate the west, adopting western names and lifestyles, learning English (to the detriment of our own mother tongue etc etc, all under the guise of being cosmopolitan). Naturally we will want to also adopt the religion that is dominant in the west.<br><br>8. Christianity provides a convenient pidgeon hole into which all things unexplained, and all unfulfilled wishes etc. can be shoved.<br><br>9. Fear of death. Christianity provides comfort in telling believers that they wont die after they die. Similarly, deceased loved ones are not really dead and gone, but are waiting for you by God's side. (provided of course, that you also believe)<br><br>Edit: corrected typo and added another point:<br><br>10. Fear of hell and eternal damnation. Accordiing to Christianity, non believers will go to hell. Hell isn't a place you want to be. The suffering there is.... intense to put it mildly; Residents there are subject to roasting by the everlasting fire, and the pain is so intense that there is much weeping and gnashing of teeth. Eternity is also a very very very long time. So long, that it defies time itself. Put togather, this creates a very fearsome prospect for an unbeliever. Consequently, some people opt to 'play it safe' and join 'em.</div>

Your greed for love will lead you to misery. If you want love, go practise loving-metta meditation." After saying that, they will most probably leave you alone to understand/contemplate with your own 'wisdom'.<br><br>If you ask a fellow Christian to show you love, they will say to you: "How can I make you feel better, how can I make you feel loved?" They will start by giving you a little hug, expressing their observations of you, listing out both good and bad points, but focuses on your good points.<br></div>

But if it's from Christianity to Buddhism, and how many such people eventually do continue to stay on, I do not yet have the statistics to support my hypothesis. Will be doing research on that.<br><br>I'm glad to read that you are able to appreciate and follow Buddhist teachings since young. I'm also glad to know you have not changed your faith till now. Some of my current experiences so far about the conversion of some of my relatives,  friends or acquaintances to Christianity, has given me lots of food for thought.<br><br>Indeed any religion is good if it helps the individual anywhere in life.<br><br>However, as a fellow Buddhist, I feel we should be more pro-active in letting more members of the public understand Buddhism as it really is. Since Buddhism is really beneficial to all, why wait for people to come to us? We can go to them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Thanks for sharing with me.<br><br>All the best for your spiritual cultivation and your life ahead.
