Especially your example of having experienced Christian camp and living life as a Christian there. Usually most would have converted during or after the camp. So this gives me the impression something might have happened while you were in the camp. Either they had not yet approached you to challenge your present beliefs in a group or personal talk or maybe you had your own strong values which kept you on track. There are many possible reasons and I don't wish to speculate further as a form of respect to you.<br><br>I wholeheartedly agree with you that in order to know more of others' religion, you have to be in it. To see and experience things from their point of view.<br><br>All the best, dear friend. Whichever religion you ultimately choose to believe and practise, as long it teaches you to love and care for others like you do for your loved ones and yourself, you will definitely do well in life.<br><br>Take care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
