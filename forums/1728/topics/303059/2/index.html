Samsara can never be a 'comfort zone' for a true practitioner. The body is merely a tool for cultivation. Birth in human realm is important but one must never find 'comfort' (i.e become attached) in any samsara realm -- even the pleasures in heaven. So a Buddhist does not only not find comfort in Avici hell, but he should not get stuck/find comfort even in the pleasures of heaven.

It is only when we are still stuck in samsara, then the best rebirth is human realm because at least we can continue practice. We have 'no choice' so to speak. This has nothing at all to do with finding comfort in rebirth.<br><br>Next, majority doesn't accept rebirth doesn't mean the evidence and proof is not out there.

Your greed for love will lead you to misery. If you want love, go practise loving-metta meditation." After saying that, they will most probably leave you alone to understand/contemplate with your own 'wisdom'.</span><br><br>If you ask a fellow Christian to show you love, they will say to you: "How can I make you feel better, how can I make you feel loved?" They will start by giving you a little hug, expressing their observations of you, listing out both good and bad points, but focuses on your good points.<br></div></blockquote>Huh. no lah. Buddhist also practise on loving-kindness, compassionate, sympathetic joy and equanimity [ the four immeasurables ]<br><br>Don't sterotype all buddhist will behave like this. A buddhist who possess skillful means will explain to u in a way where one will understand. Yeh and we also care too. Probably we lack the skills and wisdom to help u understand too.<br><br>There is a difference between Christian and Buddhist metta. Well, i did discuss it with a friend and this is what we conclude: Buddhist's metta does not differentiate anyone. It includes all sentient beings: human, animals, insects, ghosts etc while Christian's metta mostly conveyed to human beings. Btw Christian's metta is definitely strong.<br><br>Let me share a story. This story was told by my meditation teacher. There is a story about my teacher's teacher who had also practised metta meditation for years. One day, he was brought to a buddhist bookshop by a layperson.While he was sitting in the bookshop to read the books. A woman stranger came up to him and asked if she can sat with him. The venerable agreed. After an hour, this stranger stood up and thank the venerable. She told the venerable that she hadn't been feeling well and when she saw him, she had felt very comfortable with his presence. After the woman had left, this venerable explained that it is due to his metta meditation practise for years that helped to soothe the woman's mind. Perhaps this might seem unbelievable to some.<br><br>There is a reason why metta is one of the immeasurable =  cannot be measured cos metta in buddhism does not limit to any sentient beings.. Btw Metta meditation is really good. Did u try it before??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what attracts young people to christianity is the instant community and sense of belonging that comes from being part of a church. The church provides a way of life that is definite (black and white, good and evil, etc), it tries to give a reason for living/existence, provides comfort and also friends. The whole being saved and going to heaven thing is also a rather atttactive proposition I guess.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>My question would be "why do christians still want to convert Catholics?"
