              to Visit Before You Die</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">06/16/2017 Huffpost</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              a major world religion, Buddhism is one of the most influential belief systems
              in the world. Founded over 2,500 years ago, Buddhism teaches of a way to end
              suffering and has spread to every corner of the globe since its founding. But
              Buddhism’s influence stretches far beyond the impact it has had on the beliefs
              of millions of people throughout history, it has also played a major role in
              inspiring some of the most remarkable landmarks the world has ever seen.
              Despite the same inspiration, Buddhist temples have been built in a variety of
              shapes and sizes with many unique styles of design. Here’s a list of five
              unique Buddhist temples you simply must visit before you die. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Mahabodhi Temple, Bodh Gaya, India</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, India is the most historic Buddhist temple on
              this list. The name literally means ‘the Great Enlightenment Temple’. The
              Mahabodhi Temple is located where the historic Buddha is said to have attained
              enlightenment and features a Bodhi tree that is a direct descendant of the
              Buddha’s enlightenment tree. The holy site features a stone brick central tower
              standing at about 180 feet high, as well as four smaller ones surrounding it.
              The temple is studded with several small stupas and Buddha statues outside the
              main tower and possesses walls with depictions of the Buddha’s life. The temple
              is believed to have been built by Buddhist Emperor Ashoka the Great about 200
              years following the Buddha’s enlightenment. The Mahabodhi temple was declared a
              UNESCO World Heritage site in 2002.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Shwedagon Pagoda, Yangon, Myanmar </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Shwedagon Pagoda (or Golden Pagoda) in Yangon, Myanmar is probably one of the
              most dazzling Buddhist temples in the world. The shining gold plated Pagoda
              towers at about 100 meters high and is encrusted with thousands of diamonds,
              rubies and other precious gems. The Shwedagon Pagoda holds what is believed to
              be relics of the Buddha himself and the main tower is topped off with an
              impressive 76-carat diamond. The origin story of this ancient Theravada temple
              was lost in time, however historians generally agree it was built sometime between
              the 6th and 10th century. At night, the bright golden temple is clearly visible
              even miles away. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fo Guang Shan, Dashu District,
              Kaohsiung, Taiwan </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Fo Guang Shan temple in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan takes a step back from the
              classic ancient temples on this list and offers an experience into Buddhism in
              the modern world. The over 300-acre temple in Kaohsiung City is the
              headquarters of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist Order founded in 1967. The order
              follows Humanistic Buddhism and is famous for its embrace of modern teaching
              methods. The popular Mahayana temple is designed with a traditional East Asian
              design and features magnificent shrines, grandiose buildings, and offers
              numerous activities within its large temple complex. The temple is also home to
              the Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum, one of the most impressive contemporary
              Buddhist museums in the world. The museum features comprehensive Buddhist
              exhibitions, regular festivals and events, and even holds tooth relics from the
              historic Buddha. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wat Phra Dhammakaya, Pathum Thani,
              Thailand</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Wat
              Phra Dhammakaya in Pathum Thani, Thailand is another large Buddhist temple that
              gives a peek into modern Buddhism in today’s world. Also known for its modern
              teaching methods, this Theravada temple is famous for its enormous size and
              modern style of design. Founded in 1970, the temple follows a very simple,
              minimalistic design and blends traditional Thai temple architecture with a
              crisp contemporary one. Wat Phra Dhammakaya has numerous places of interest,
              including a sleek modern stupa with 1 million Buddha statues, several
              impressive memorials, and a grand meditation hall that can accommodate hundreds
              of thousands of people. At approximately 1000 acres, the temple is about twice
              the size of the country of Monaco. But don’t let that intimidate you, the
              temple is complete with a well-maintained road system and gives guests ample
              access to transportation to visit the various sights. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Borobudur, Magelang, Indonesia</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Returning
              to the classic temples of ancient times, Borobudur, located in Magelang on the
              Indonesian island of Java, is the most famous Buddhist temple on this list. A
              UNESCO World Heritage site, the Mahayana temple is made up of several layers of
              platforms that takes visitors on a journey through Buddhist cosmology. The
              monument is divided into three levels symbolizing three realms, the Kamadhatu
              (sense realm), Ruphadatu (form realm), and Arupadhatu (formless realm) and is
              decorated with several stupas and relief panels throughout the temple depicting
              the Law of Karma and several Buddhist stories. Although it is unknown who built
              the monument, it is estimated to have been built out of over 2 million stone
              blocks some time around the 9th century. The famous monument is also considered
              a prime pilgrimage site, with Buddhists in Indonesia often visiting the ancient
              ruins en masse every year to celebrate Vesak Day.</span></p>
