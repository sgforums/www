              It means the religious identity of an Indian has to give way to the
              primary identity of a citizen. And the state has to guarantee the rights that
              come with this identity, as the rights of citizenship.</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 112%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'></span></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">In speaking about Indian society and the secular, let me say at the
              outset, that secularism goes beyond just politics, although our political
              parties have attempted to reduce it to a political slogan. So one party
              endorses it in theory but hesitates to apply it properly in practice, the other
              makes fun of it since the party’s foundational ideology is anti-secular. Supporting
              secularism or dismissing it, is not just a political slogan. It is deeply tied
              to the question of the kind of society that we want. This is perhaps why it was
              widely discussed in the early years of independence whereas now attempts are
              being made to scuttle it. Questioning the secular would mean seriously changing
              the direction that we have intended to give to Indian society. If secularism is
              removed from the constitution then democracy becomes a victim, with an
              unthinkable future.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">If however we want a secular society, then we would have to
              stop identifying ourselves primarily by religion, caste or language, and
              start thinking of ourselves primarily as equal citizens of one nation, both in
              theory and in practice. This involves mutual obligations between the state and
              the citizens and between citizens, not just in theory as of now but in
              actuality. The relationship of other identities such as religion, caste,
              language and region will inevitably become secondary. These latter have to be
              adjusted so as to ensure that rights of citizenship together with what they
              entail remain primary. Eventually the state will not be expected to support any
              religious organisation, even those it is currently supporting.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">I would like to begin by trying to explain what I mean by the terms
              secular, secularism and secularising. Secular is that which relates to the
              world and is distinct from the religious. Secularism involves questioning the
              control that religious organisations have over social institutions. This is
              sought to be justified by arguing that it ensures morality. But the morality
              fundamental to secularism goes beyond any single religion and extends to the
              functioning of the entire society. Secularism does not deny the presence of
              religion in society, but demarcates the social institutions over which religion
              can or cannot exercise control. This distinction is fundamental. And finally,
              secularising is the process by which society changes and recognises the
              distinction.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>What secularism is and is not</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">When the term was first used in 1851, secular had only one basic meaning.
              It described laws relating to morals and social values as having been created
              by human society in order to ensure the well-being and harmonious functioning
              of the society. These laws were neither the creation of divine authority nor
              did they require the sanction of divine authority. Authority lay in working out
              – through reasoning and sensitivity – what was best for society in keeping with
              generally accepted values of tolerance and social responsibility, by those who
              constituted that society. Authority was exercised through laws. Social values
              therefore grew out of rational thinking, debate and discussion. This was needed
              to establish a moral code agreed to by the entire society and was not linked to
              any particular religion, caste or class.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">What this means is that the laws and social values that govern the society
              should be observed as laws in themselves and not because they carry any divine
              sanctions. They have their own authority distinct from religion or caste or
              whatever. Religion involving belief and faith in a deity and in an afterlife
              continued to exist. However, the civil laws were sanctioned and upheld by
              secular authority and did not require the sanction of any religion. Secularism
              therefore is not what it is sometimes said to be  – a denial of religion –
              but a curtailment of the control that religious organisations have over social
              functioning. And I would underline this definition repeatedly.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">This theory after it came to be widely discussed had various consequences.
              One was that it allowed people the freedom to think beyond what was told to
              them as being religiously correct. Again this did not mean throwing religion
              overboard but disentangling the codes of social behavior from religious
              control. This did not make people immoral as some had feared at that time,
              since the threat of punishment for breaking laws was enforced, and punishment
              came immediately in this life. It was not postponed to the next life as in most
              religious codes. So it made people think about the purpose of their laws and
              such thinking is always extremely useful. The observance of the law is
              strengthened when people understand its purpose.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Having to reason things out meant that people had to learn to think
              independently. The thinking came from their education. Here too the explanation
              of everything being part of a divine plan and requiring divine sanction was not
              always the answer to simple questions. Therefore, education began to involve
              searching for explanations other than those based on faith and religion, or
              possibly even honing these explanations if there was evidence to do so. But
              preferably, social laws began to be drawn from rational enquiry into both the
              natural and the human world in which we live. Occasionally there might even
              have been a small leap of imagination ultimately to be explained by reason. So
              the explanations for the laws and a discussion of these, became an essential
              part of education, and of thinking about the implications of being secularised.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Religion had originated as a personal emotional need. This was then
              extended to explanations of how one experienced life and beyond that how the
              universe functioned. This was all attributed to a supernatural power who was
              held in awe. Gradually however, this personalised religion became a complex
              organised religion and took the form of institutions ambitious to control
              society and politics. With this change, religion became powerful both as the
              focus of belief and as an authority controlling social institutions through various
              religious organisations. In some places, its power paralleled that of the
              governing authority – the state. It is this particular aspect of religion – the
              control that religious organisations have over social institutions – that the
              secular person wishes to keep separate from the state. The distinction is
              important because we often overlook it, in saying that secularism denies
              religion altogether.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Secularism then takes on an additional meaning. The state having authority
              over the making and observing of laws by human agencies should be distinct from
              religion since religion has its sanction from faith and from deity. The
              authority of each was clearly different.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Social laws are the spine of a society. They should protect the right to
              live and they should ensure that there should be no discrimination that affects
              life and work. This is crucial to protecting the points of change in the human
              lifecycle for which laws are necessary, such as registering birth, marriage, or
              even divorce, processes of education by which a child is socialised into
              society, occupation and employment, and inheritance, generally of property.
              Actions linked to these come under the jurisdiction of civil law. To make this
              link effective, social laws have necessarily to provide the basic aspects of
              welfare in a modern state – the absolute minimum of which are equal access to
              education and to health care for all members of society, and to employment, and
              this is to be irrespective of religion and caste. If civil laws are to be
              universal and uniform as they would be ultimately in a secular society, then we
              must guarantee this endorsement by the state. Discrimination on any count would
              be completely unacceptable.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">So religious authority continues in a secular system but is limited. It
              extends only to governing religious belief and practice. It has been argued
              that there should be no rigid barrier between religion and the state, but there
              can be a negotiated, principled distance between them. This can allow for new
              alignments within the religion or between religions or between religion and the
              state. The overall relationship would disallow the dominance of any single
              religion since each would have equal rights on the state and the state on them
              and equal status before the law. Nevertheless, there is a degree of stipulated
              separation in this arrangement in as much as religious authority would no
              longer be controlling social laws.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>‘Indian’ secularism</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">This is not of course the same as what is sometimes described as the
              Indian definition of secularism, namely the coexistence of all religions. Mere
              coexistence is insufficient as religions can still be treated as unequal and
              some be marginalised, as they often are. The acceptance of coexistence together
              with equal status before the law can certainly be a first step. But we do have
              to ask how far does this go and what should be the next step.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">This definition based on the coexistence of religions is incomplete in
              many ways since the question of the jurisdiction of religious authority remains
              unanswered. The intention would in any case be not to put up barriers between
              state and religion. It would be to demarcate the activities that come under a
              civil jurisdiction and those that would continue to be controlled by the
              organisations representing religious authority. In a democratic system the
              equality would be essential – as essential as spelling out who controls which
              laws. In contemporary India, the coexistence of religions exists but their
              equality has yet to be established. The secular is less evident and some might
              even say that it is virtually absent. Political and state patronage does not
              invariably distance itself from religious organisations. In fact, it is
              sometimes closely tied together as we know.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Some oppose secularism by arguing that it is a western concept not suited
              to India. Should the same be said about nationhood and democracy, both new to
              post independence India? And surely our internalising the new liberal market
              economy is a far stronger imprint of the west. To support the secularising of society
              does not mean subordinating ourselves to a western concept but rather trying to
              understand a process of change in our contemporary history. Being a
              nation-state is a new experience of modern times and is current now in every
              part of the world. We have chosen democracy as the most feasible system despite
              its being new to us. I would argue, that a secular society is essential to
              democratic functioning.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Let me turn now to the specifically Indian aspect of the subject and
              comment on how I see religion and society in the past in order to compare it
              with how it is viewed in our times. My argument is that colonialism introduced
              a major disjuncture in how we perceive ourselves and that we have accepted this
              without much question. Any deliberate social change with sizeable consequence
              becomes a little easier to handle if one can see the earlier historical forms
              of the society and its gradual mutation. The present, after all, does emerge
              out of the past. In the important area of the relationship between society and
              religion, we have been nurtured on ideas about how religion functioned in
              India. These ideas came from colonial views of Indian religion that we have internalised
              without adequately questioning them. So a brief look at these might be useful.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>Colonial view of religion</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Colonial perceptions were based on the European experience of religion in
              the context of European society. With reference to Europe, secularism is often
              described as the separation between Church and State. This is taken as a
              one-to-one relationship because generally the religion was a single monolithic
              religion. This was so strongly asserted that in past times those that
              questioned Catholic belief and practice in Europe were heavily punished as
              heretics. Some were burnt, some had to recant as did Galileo and many faced the
              punitive actions of the Inquisition. Although Protestantism later was more
              flexible, the earlier experience was not forgotten.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">This was the perspective of religion that was familiar to the colonisers.
              Their reading of Indian religion was through this perspective. Recent writing
              on Indian religion and society suggests that this was a defective view and
              therefore needs reinvestigation. The colonial image of Indian society projected
              two nations – the Hindu and the Muslim – defined by monolithic religious
              identities and inherently hostile to each other. And because of their mutual
              hostility, a controlling authority from outside was required. This became one
              justification for colonial rule. As many historians have pointed out, this
              image was then imprinted on the history of India – especially on the medieval
              period – thus enforcing a distancing between the two religions.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">The concept of majority and minority communities identified by religion
              was also introduced by colonial policy. This further consolidated the idea of
              monolithic religions and these in turn fueled communal politics. Permanent
              majority and minority communities are of course contrary to the norms of
              democracy. A democratic majority is formed on each occasion when a large number
              of people come together in support of a particular opinion. The number has to
              be larger than of any other group, and those that join it are not restricted to
              membership of any previous affiliated organisation. Forming a majority,
              therefore, is not based on any pre-existing religious, caste or linguistic
              identities. The constituents of the majority change with each issue. There are
              no permanent members of majority or minority communities.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Anti-colonial nationalism tried to confront this image since broad based
              nationalism has to be inclusive, has to induct a range of opinion, and has also
              to draw on a shared history. The shared history is crucial. I would also like
              to quote Eric Hobsbawm who wrote that history plays the same role in
              nationalisms as does the poppy in the life of opium addicts. It is the source.
              It feeds ideas of identity. Anti-colonial nationalism did not question the
              monolithic nature of religious communities. It focused on denying their
              antagonism and projecting their coexistence. This became central to its idea of
              secularism. But this did not fully succeed. One reason was that the colonial
              view of religion in India was, and it still is, also foundational to the
              ideologies of what are now referred to as religious nationalisms, Hindu and
              Muslim, that went into the making of the communal landscape of India. In other
              words, anti-colonial nationalism and both the religious nationalisms build on
              the colonial construction of Indian religion, though the first borrows much
              less so whereas the second make it foundational to their ideologies. A century
              or so ago, the organisations propagating religious nationalisms were the Muslim
              League and the Hindu Mahasabha. These were not religious orthodoxies but rather
              ideologies using religion for political mobilisation. Today, religious
              nationalisms include a range of Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and other religious
              organisations, politically ambitious and anxious to continue their control over
              community laws to ensure a political constituency. History in religious
              nationalisms is not shared, it is divisive and it becomes the arena of battle.
              The struggle over history text-books, therefore, is the attempt to ensure the
              projection of a history slanted towards one religion and a denial of a shared
              history.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">We may well ask was this actually the way in which religion functioned in
              relation to Indian society from early times? Have we looked analytically at our
              past? Have we examined the role of religious organisations from that past? What
              form did these organisations take, how did they exert authority and which
              sections of society supported which organisation ?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>The place of religion in Indian history</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">I would argue that the historical picture of religions in India was
              complex. It was not just a simple binary of Hindu and Muslim, because religious
              groups took the form of an array of sects, and not of a large monolithic
              community. I see it in terms of two sets of relationships, each required for
              investigating the link between religion and society. The first was the
              interaction of sect with a close social linkage through caste connections,
              present in every segment of Indian society. The second was the mediation with
              and through political authority that then became a three-way process involving
              sect, caste and the state. There was no church to bring together the sects into
              a single entity. In other words, I’m arguing for a much more decentralised way
              of looking at religion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">In the Indian past, the crucial relationship lay in the connection between
              multiple religious sects and many castes. The sect propagated belief, the caste
              often determined its social context. Status was measured through an
              interdependence of the two. Upper castes across religion – whether they
              observed caste restrictions strictly or not – tended to be more closely
              associated with the text-based formal manifestations of the religion, whereas
              the lower castes, perhaps being less text-based, were far more flexible. Caste
              determined the social code, maintained formally by those who claimed to be
              educated and knew the law. For most people, however, it was the hearsay of
              tradition. The authority of caste and sect over the social code has now to be
              replaced by civil law applicable to all. This will require looking afresh at
              the civil law claimed by all religions to ensure its secularity and its
              endorsement of social justice. Both secularity and social justice are familiar
              as values but their application in social institutions is new.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Many valuable and meticulous studies have been made of religious texts
              that have enhanced our understanding of them. However, less attention has been
              given to examining the institutions created by various religions both to
              propagate their beliefs and as agencies of social control. Rather than focusing
              on monolithic undifferentiated religious society in general, what may be more
              insightful is if we study the link between caste and sect in order to
              comprehend more precisely the interface between religion and society in our
              past. The link between caste and sect had a flexibility, even a fluidity that
              monolithic religions lack. We could then ask whether the rigidity lay less in
              religion and more in caste discrimination. In that case, the colonial construction
              of religion in India, so readily accepted by us, would need to be examined
              again. Perhaps we need to look more carefully at how caste in past times and
              now class in its turn, has shaped and is shaping the relations between religion
              and society. Which groups in society support which politico-religious
              organisations and why.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">In pre-Islamic times, there are no references to any monolithic type of
              Hinduism. Interestingly, what we today use as labels for religion, such as
              Hinduism and Buddhism, are not mentioned as such. Instead, there is reference
              to two broad categories of sects that propagated their distinctive ideas. These
              were the Brahmana and the Shramana. The basic differentiation was based on
              belief in or denial of, divinity, and the theories of the afterlife. Brahmana
              referred to brahmanic beliefs and rituals, Shramana referred to the<span> </span><em>shramanas</em>or Buddhist, Jaina,
              and other monks of so called heterodox orders, the<span> </span><em>nastika</em>/non-believers, and
              their followers. The latter rejected the<span> </span><em>Vedas</em>,
              divine sanctions and the concept of the soul. They were consequently associated
              with more rational explanations of both the universe and human life. Within
              each of the two, distinct sects with various beliefs were recognised.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Neither of these were monolithic groups. They were a collection of diverse
              sects. This duality of Brahmana and Shramana continues to be used in a variety
              of texts with reference to what we would today call religions, and over a
              period of 1500 years from the edicts of Ashoka, to the accounts of Megasthenes,
              the Chinese Buddhist pilgrims, and Al- Biruni in the 11th century AD.
              References are made in Brahmanical texts such as the<em>Vishnu</em><span> </span><em>Purana</em>, and in Buddhist
              texts, to occasional hostilities between the two. Interestingly, they use the same
              abusive terms for each other. The grammarian Patanjali of the early centuries
              AD, refers to the two and adds that their relationship was comparable to that
              of the snake and the mongoose.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">A third category that is not mentioned was that of those who were
              discriminated against because of their caste or lack of it. Because of this,
              they had their own belief systems and forms of worship. This was the category
              that was intrinsic to caste. The equivalent of what we call the Dalit today is
              found in every religion under different names, such as,<em>pasmanda</em>,<span> </span><em>mazhabi</em>, etc;. The Dalit is
              present even among those religious sects that claim that all men are equal in
              the eyes of God. Technically all Dalits, irrespective of religion, should have
              the same rights but this is not generally conceded.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>The importance of sects</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Among the multiple sects that were emerging over time, some adhered to the
              orthodox and others were supporters of the heterodox. The advantage of sects
              over monolithic religions is that sects shade off from the very orthodox to
              those far less so. This allows the less orthodox to assimilate new beliefs and
              these are not treated as heresy. The heretics function in a stream of their
              own.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Our understanding of conversion would be much clearer if we could focus on
              sect and caste, wherever the evidence exists or can be traced back. This would
              provide a far better explanation than merely going on referring to Hindus
              becoming Muslims. What we understand of historical interactions in the past
              moulds to a fair extent our thinking about present-day interactions. It is,
              therefore, incumbent upon us to be far more analytical and precise in our
              historical exploration and explanation. We should not allow history to be
              reduced to, or dismissed, as political slogans of various kinds.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">The creation of a sect was open and led to a plurality that became
              characteristic of every religion in India. This constitutes an important aspect
              in understanding the relationship between religion and society, and these
              relationships differ from society to society. We cannot assume therefore that
              the role of religion that emerged for Europe can be applied automatically to
              India – a mistake made by colonial scholarship. This does not imply that the
              meaning of secularism can change, but that the manner in which it is introduced
              into a society may vary.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Since Shramanism in the main was based on historical founders, it takes a
              fairly linear form with segments referring back to a central teaching. The
              history of Brahmanism is far more complex. An early phase was Vedic Brahmanism
              focusing on the ritual of sacrifice, the<span> </span><em>yajna,</em><span> </span>invoking many deities and specially
              Indra and Agni, and performed by upper castes. A variety of heterodox sects,
              pre-eminently the Buddhists, Jainas and Ajivikas, questioned these beliefs.
              Heterodox groups tended to provide rational explanations about social
              institutions and established a critical tradition of questioning orthodoxy,
              although eventually establishing their own orthodoxies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">By the early centuries AD, Brahmanical ritual became more individualised
              with a shift to the worship of Shiva and Vishnu. Sects of worshippers came
              together differentiated by particular deities, as for example the Vaishnava
              Bhagavata and the Shaiva Pashupatha. From the seventh century, religious belief
              and worship took the form of devotional sects – what we call the Bhakti sects.
              They arose at varying times in different parts of the sub-continent. The
              earlier recognisable ones were the Alvars and Nayannars in the south to be
              followed by many in the north. Some among the later ones reflected striations
              of new religious ideas.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Both Brahmanism and Shramanism received hefty patronage and became
              wealthy, powerful, established religions. This gave them status and enabled
              them to control social laws. Donations were made to sects and not to a
              monolithic religious entity because this did not exist at that time. This
              continued to be the norm even in later periods.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Centres of the wealthy sects became the nucleus of education. This added
              to their authority and they could induct the elite. Frequently, sects with
              large followings and authority began to function as castes in themselves as for
              example the Lingayat in Karnataka, and many others in others parts of the
              country. They did not necessarily identify with the formal religions, and some
              actually opposed them. But in colonial records they were assigned to either one
              or the other.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>The arrival of Islam</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">With the arrival of Islam and more so with the presence of the Sufis, the
              exploration of religious ideas – orthodox and heterodox – expanded, as did
              the number of sects. Some took orthodox positions, others held out mixed
              beliefs and worship. The latter were popular among the larger number of
              ordinary people.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">The new presence was marked by the elaborate mosques and<span> </span><em>khanqahs</em><span> </span>built by royal patrons and the
              wealthy. The religious endowments became richer and richer, as is so in all
              well-patronised religions. As with Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples and<span> </span><em>mathas,</em>these endowments tied
              to Islamic centres also enabled their recipients to participate in the world of
              scholarship and in politics. Detailed studies of the social institutions
              controlled by various religious authorities that we refer to as the Hindu,
              Muslim, Sikh etc. would be revealing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">As in earlier times the sect remained the popular religious identity among
              the majority of people. This becomes more evident if we look at two processes
              involved in the coming of Islam – settlement and conversion. Today this
              event is projected at the popular level largely in terms of invasion and
              its subsequent political consequences. But there were many other avenues
              that took different forms, as in the settlements of traders, migrants, Sufis
              and such alike.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Mohammad bin Qasim’s conquest of Sindh is known. But far more interesting
              were the settlements of Arab traders all down the west coast of India from
              Sindh to Kerala. Some Arabs entered the service of the Rashtrakuta kings of the
              Deccan dating to the 8th and 9th centuries. The more senior among
              them exercised their right to give grants of land to temples and<span> </span><em>brahmanas</em><span> </span>as had been the prevailing custom in
              the area. Arab traders inter-married locally and new communities evolved with a
              new take on existing religions. Inevitably, these became new sects – such as
              the Bohras, the Khojas the Navayat, the Mapilla and many others – where belief,
              ritual, and civil law did not hesitate to draw from existing practice. So no
              two were identical. Gujarati Bohras had little to do with Malayali Mapillas.
              Many such sects mushroomed all over but have not been sufficiently studied as
              part of the history of society and religion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">This pattern continued into later centuries at the level of the wider
              society. This was despite the emergence of other patterns that arose from
              political power and administration. Such dichotomies run through history and
              only their constituents change. The newly emerging teachers of various
              persuasions attracted supportive followers. Until recently, these remained the
              essentials of how a major part of Indians experienced religion irrespective of
              having to declare conformity to formal religions in colonial times. This was
              prior to the ingress of Hindutva and Islamisation, that have considerably
              hardened the boundaries and even altered practices. Many people today who
              identify themselves with the monolithic religion, whichever it may be, when
              pressed further, will mention the sect that they belong to, or the holy man
              whom they revere – the<span> </span><em>baba,
              guru</em><span><em> </em></span>or<span><em> </em></span><em>sant – </em>who can be
              of any persuasion. This link is often more pertinent to the lives they actually
              live. And interestingly, the sects that they identify with are generally those
              that were established in the last thousand years.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>Myth-making about medieval history</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">In the history of India, medieval history, which colonial historians
              called the Muslim period, is located in the last thousand years. This history
              has had a raw deal from religious extremists and politicians in being described
              as the age when, to quote the slogan, “We were slaves” – the assumption being
              that Islamic rule tyrannised an oppressed Hindu population. This is a
              continuation of the British interpretation of Indian history eagerly taken up
              by religious nationalism. Viewed historically, the scene differs at many
              levels.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">The interaction between what we call Hinduism and Islam had its moments of
              confrontations and conflicts in the face offs between competing politics and
              were manifested in various ways, and often through religious organisations.
              What was a largely political act at that time is often interpreted today as an
              entirely religious act, with the politics left out. Some confrontation was to
              be expected. Such confrontations were not new to the Indian scene if in earlier
              times the<span> </span><em>brahmanas</em><span> </span>and the<span> </span><em>shramans</em><span> </span>had a relationship comparable to the
              snake and the mongoose – and this was probably a correct assessment as we know
              that in some regions Buddhist monks were killed and in others Jaina monks were
              impaled. In the subsequent millennium, that is the last thousand years,
              things may not have changed strikingly. It was neither a culture given
              over to religious aggression as colonial scholars maintained, but nor was it
              entirely free of such aggression. It was, in fact, a normal culture similar to
              many others in the world at the time.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">But as was so in earlier times, the medieval period continued to be a
              time when striking creativity enriched facets of Indian culture and we still
              live with these. The intellectual liveliness of the time expressed in Sanskrit
              and Persian and in the regional languages matched that of earlier times,
              although in different genres. It was precisely this period that gave shape and
              form in various ways to much, although not all, that we now identify as Hindu
              in the landscape of present times.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Leaving aside for the moment the interaction of cultures practicing
              diverse religions, even some of the activities clustered around the Brahmanic
              tradition are most impressive. Throughout the second millennium AD, that is the
              last one thousand years, from Kashmir to Kerala and in between, there were
              scholarly commentaries being composed on Brahmanical texts and religious
              practice. Sayana’s explanation of the<span> </span><em>Rig</em><span> </span><em>Veda</em><span> </span>is a fascinating glimpse into the mind
              of a learned scholar of the 14th century with its mix of reality and
              fantasy. Social change draws out new commentaries on existing social codes.
              Kulluka’s commentary on the Manu<span> </span><em>Dharmashastra</em><span> </span>incorporates a reaction to the social
              change of the times, as in the debate over the status of temple priests
              vis-à-vis other categories of<span> </span><em>brahmanas,</em><span><em> </em></span>a matter of concern only when
              temples became powerful institutions, at a time simultaneous with the arrival
              of Islam in the sub-continent. The looting of some of the wealthy temples did
              not prevent the building of other equally wealthy ones and striking innovations
              in architecture.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">There were many commentaries, digests, discussions on classical Sanskrit
              poetry and literary compositions. With the gradual switch to the regional
              languages, grammars required commentaries. New and prior philosophical theories
              are discussed in texts such as the<span> </span><em>Sarva-darshana-sangraha</em><span> </span>of Madhavacharya in the
              14th century. Discussions on the Advaita Vedanta and Mimamsa schools of
              philosophy, to mention some, date to this period. There were explorations into
              theories in mathematics and astronomy going from Ujjain to Baghdad and beyond,
              with Indian scholars at the cutting edge of knowledge. Classical Hindustani and
              Carnatic music was patronised by the courts of Maharajas and Mughals and in the
              homes of the wealthy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">In addition to Sanskrit and Persian, literary compositions of high quality
              began to be composed in regional languages that acquired a new standing in the
              royal courts and in places linked to religious sects. These compositions carried
              much of the thought and creativity of their own times, as is evident in the<span> </span><em>Ramacharitamanas</em>, and the<span> </span><em>Krittibasi,</em>distinct from the
              Valmiki<span> </span><em>Ramayana</em><span> </span>and much revered by Hindi and Bengali
              speakers. There were even alternate histories sung as legends by folk poets and
              bards, very different from the court chronicles that we quote. These were the
              voices of numbers of people as also expressed in the<span> </span><em>bhajans</em><span> </span>of Meera and Surdas and the
              compositions of Tyagaraja. These were not the achievements of enslaved people.
              We are today unable to look beyond what we have been told by those who
              colonised us, and those who loyally continue to carry on with that legacy.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;"><strong>The task of secularisation</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">In this rather scattered attempt to look at some aspects of the past, I
              have tried to underline the plurality in the articulation of religion in India
              often in the form of sects and their interface with caste. To eventually
              disengage religious institutions from controlling the functions of civil
              society would help us in bringing about a more equitable society. The process
              of secularising society will have to address both religion and caste, and to
              that extent it requires a different kind of analysis from that of religions
              elsewhere. We have internalised the colonial version of the relationship
              between our religions and our society, and are experiencing its aftermath in
              the stridency of dominant religious organisations. We have also allowed some of
              these to become mechanisms for political mobilisation. Secularisation therefore
              will have to be thought through with sensitivity, care and thoroughness.
              Although it cannot be a rapid change, nevertheless a serious beginning has to
              be made to introduce secular values through establishing confidence in a
              secular society and explaining its necessary link to democracy. The resort to
              assassination to silence secularists can never succeed – it merely leads to the
              suffusion of terror that will one day rebound on those terrorising others. If
              there is one lesson that history teaches us it is this.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">A secular society and polity does not mean abandoning religion. It does
              mean that the religious identity of the Indian, whatever it may be, has to give
              way to the primary secular identity of an Indian citizen. And the state has to
              guarantee the rights that come with this identity, as the rights of
              citizenship. This demands that the state provides and protects human rights, a
              requirement that at the moment cannot be taken for granted. Such an identity,
              while adhering to human rights and social justice, would also be governed by a
              secular code of laws applicable to all.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">A beginning could be made in two possible ways. One would be to ensure the
              secular in education, and the other, the secular in civil laws. Education means
              the availability of all branches of knowledge to all citizens without
              discrimination. Knowledge means updated information and training young people
              to endorse the method of critical enquiry. I would like to add to this the need
              for young people to know what is meant by a shared history. Given that we are a
              democracy, we can perhaps work out how best this could be done.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">Our civil laws were drawn up in colonial times although we have made some
              changes after independence. In a turn to the secular, we shall have to comb
              through the existing civil laws to ensure that they conform to equal rights for
              all citizens with no exceptions. Resolving the differences between the civil
              laws and the laws of each religion and caste, will have to be discussed with
              the communities concerned and not only with those currently controlling
              religious and caste codes. A uniform civil code does not mean merely doing away
              with the laws of one religious code. It means reconsidering jointly the social
              laws of all religious codes and arriving at a common secular civil code. In this
              process, injustice and discrimination against minorities and against the
              underprivileged – whether because of religion, gender or caste – will need to
              be annulled. Law does not remain law if it can be manipulated to allow
              discrepancies. This is likely to be the most problematic in our turn toward
              secularising society. Is it not time now to start work on this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 28.05pt; margin-left: 0in;">The overwhelming projection of religiosity – not religion but the
              excessive display of religiosity – in the world that surrounds us sometimes
              appears to be a surrogate for not coming to terms with real life problems; or
              perhaps it is due to our having become a competitive society with all its
              unexpected insecurities. Can we instead consider how we can make the reality of
              citizenship a guarantee of our social welfare, our well-being, our
              understanding of our world, and our wish to bring quality into our lives? The
              secularising of society is not an overnight revolution. It is a historical
              process and will need time. But hopefully it will be assisted by the
              recognition that the state and society need to function in a new way. Implicit
              in democracy is the upholding of the ethic of human action. Secularising
              society is an advancing of that very ethic.</p>
