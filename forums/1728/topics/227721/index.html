They do not reborn in the sense that they do not reborn in samsara due to attachment and karma. If they were born in samsara, they are born due to compassionate vows and are not due to the strength and karmic force. This is the difference between ordinary sentient beings and enlightened persons.<br><br>If a Buddha appear in this world, he will not be attached and does not suffer.

            <div class='col-md body'>I just posted this in <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=227623" rel="nofollow">Question on Buddhism</a><br><br>Check out Wanderer's reply too (in that topic). When Buddhist say enlightened ones overcome suffering, it has to do with overcoming the illusion of duality.<br><br>There are three kinds of sufferings:<br><br><blockquote>First, there is the form of suffering that the Buddha is most famous for talking about, ordinary suffering, the standard list including such things as birth, sickness, old age, death, lamentation, pain, grief and despair. These are ordinary forms of suffering that we can try to mitigate as best we can by ordinary methods, i.e. by working within the scope of the first training, i.e. the conventional world. I am a big fan of trying to find worldly happiness so long as we do not neglect the importance of the other two trainings. There is also the form of suffering relating to the scope of the second training that comes from being limited to our ordinary state of consciousness, with our only way out coming from sleep or the use of chemical substances. We yearn for bliss that is not so bound up in things like whether or not we get a good job, for experiences like those found in the concentration states. Our minds have this potential, and the failure to be able to access these states at times when doing so would be helpful and healthy is a source of bondage. I am a big fan of being able to attain these wonderful states so long as we do not neglect the other two trainings.<br><br>There is also the kind of suffering that comes from making artificial dualities out of non-dual sensations, and all of the unnecessary reactivity, misperceptions, distortions of perspective and proportion, and basic blindfulness that accompanies that process. This kind of suffering, relating to the scope of training in wisdom, is not touched by the first two trainings, and thus forms a background level of suffering in our life and also increases the potential for further suffering in the other two scopes. This form of suffering is gradually relieved by the stages of enlightenment, as fewer and fewer aspects of reality have the capacity to trick the mind in this way. I am a big fan of awakening and thus eliminating this pervasive form of suffering, just as long as we do not also neglect the other two trainings.<br><br>The suffering of the ordinary world can be extremely unpredictable, and working to relieve it is a very complex business, the work of a lifetime and perhaps an eternity. The suffering related to being unable to access refined altered states of consciousness is mitigated by simply taking the time to learn the skills necessary and then refining them until they are accessable to us when we wish. There are limits to these states, and so the basic states attainable by training in concentration can be very thoroughly mastered within a lifetime and even within a few years or perhaps months for those with talent and diligence. <strong>The stages of enlightenment are permanent, and once they are attained, that aspect of our suffering is forever eliminated and never arises again.</strong> This can be accomplished by those who take the time to learn the skills necessary to see individual sensations clearly and are willing to work on that level.<br><br>These basic facts can be used to help us plan our quest for happiness and the elimination of the various forms of suffering in our life. We can direct our studies, our training, and work on specific skills that lead to specific effects and abilities in the order we choose, within the limits of our life circumstances and the resources available to us. For instance, it might make sense to learn concentration skills early in our life, as they cultivate so many of the skills necessary for the other two trainings and can provide increased sense of ease and wellbeing. For example, rather than popping a cold beer at the end of a hard day, we could bathe our body and mind in as much bliss and peace as we can stand for as long as we wish. If we master concentration practices, we have the option to make such choices.<br><br>It might also make sense to work on insight practices early rather than later so as to reduce the amount of time during our life that we live with the fundamental suffering caused by the illusion of duality. There is only so much we can do to prevent ordinary suffering for ourselves and others, though it is always good to do what we can. Thus, it is also good to realize that we can also reduce and eliminate the other forms of suffering through learning the two basic styles of meditation more easily than we can eliminate much of our conventional suffering.</blockquote><blockquote>	We might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in a loop, the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dogÂ’s tail chasing itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be Â“over there.Â” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to widen the imagined split. This will never work, because it doesnÂ’t actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful. When boring or unpleasant sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place.</blockquote>- Dharma Dan</div>

In god religions, you have to accept god to go to his kingdom. Is there a possibility to be god or god equals? absolutely no way. you are god's creation, if you die, thats god will, if you are born stupid, thats god creation, you just have to accept it. for animals, its even worse, animals are created specially for humans to savour. no redemption for animals.<br><br>But in Buddhism, all is not lost, animals can be humans one day and vice versa.<br>Anyone can be a Buddha if you strive for Buddhahood, but you have to practise your perfections until you are perfect and ready to be a Buddha.<br><br>A Buddha's sole mission is to spread his teachings so that humans and devas (heavenly beings)  in the past, present and future can benefit from it and strive for enlightenment and attain Nibbana.
