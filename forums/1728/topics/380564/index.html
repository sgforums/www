              <p>hi guys,</p>
              <p>i currently have a thai shakyamuni statue which i have been worshipping for the past 5 years. It's only recently that i really got to know that in buddhist, it actually split into two different canons, for example - mahayana &amp; theravada. I'm quite into tibetan buddhist culture after getting know about them recently. Understand that Thai buddhist is under the Theravada canon. I don't mean to offend, but would really like to find out more about the different in terms of worshipping mahayana and theravada buddha statue. I have a relative who is a regular student at <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/366521">è�©æ��é�“æ¬¡ç¬¬å¹¿è®º</a> and she actually taught me some of the stuffs which i really don't understand. She has a thai buddha statue at home too, thought <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/366521">è�©æ��é�“æ¬¡ç¬¬å¹¿è®º</a> is more to mahayana teaching? Though we know that buddha, towards which canon is still the same, four noble truth....etc. But wouldn't that be confusing? She told me that it's wrong to place my cup of water on the platform where my thai shakyamuni sits, it should be below the platform and offer to don't know how many buddhas.....</p>
              <p>Afterall, i'm really sincere into buddha's teaching. Just that i have been offering Thai Shakyamuni for years and plus the fact that i'm really quite comfortable the ways of mahayana.... i just don't wanna worship / respect in a wrong manners. Plus is it okay to follow mahayana teaching, have a theravada shakyamuni statue at home and play thai chanting at the same time (that is what she did)?</p>
              <p>Experts please clear my doubts as i really wanna have a proper way of offering shakyamuni statue at home.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>I think it's fine to have Thai version of Shakyamuni, etc. It's not important what style of statue you have, cultures differ, so the design and the traditional practice differ slightly, but what's important is that you must understand the essence of what the Buddha teach. Shakyamuni Buddha is our Original Teacher whether it is Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana alike.</p>
              <p>As for cup of water etc, we do put them slightly lower than the statue itself. Also regarding your relative, did you ask her what tradition she comes from?</p>

              <h1>A Brief Introduction to <br>Setting up a Buddhist Altar</h1>
              <h4><em>Writer in Chinese by Dr. Yutang Lin </em>
              <p><em>Translated by Chien-Yun Hsu</em></p>
              </h4>
              <p>This essay briefly presents Guru C. M. Chen's teaching on the 
              meanings and 
              principles of setting up a Buddhist altar so as to provide a practical 
              manual 
              for the beginners. References are listed behind for those who are 
              interested in 
              further studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>A. The Meanings of Setting up a Buddhist Altar</h2>
              <p>a. To invoke holy beings to come down and stay so as to enrich the 
              wisdom and 
              compassion of the practitioner and his family daily until the Perfect 
              Enlightenment is achieved.</p>
              <p>b. All sorts of attendant practices such as prostrations, 
              offerings, praises, 
              etc. are included in the daily practices so that, firstly, the merits 
              for 
              achieving enlightenment are accumulated by deepening the relationship of
               Refuge; 
              and secondly, the bodhicitta is nourished through extending the merits 
              toward 
              the attainment of Buddhahood for all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>c. By means of gazing at Buddhas, lighting lamps, burning 
              incense, offering 
              flowers, prostrating, etc., the functions of the five sense-organs are 
              completely absorbed in the Buddhist practices and hence the purification
               of the 
              practitioner's mind is enhanced and accelerated.</p>
              <p>d. It is easier to form an unalterable habit by doing the daily 
              practices not 
              only at a regular time but also at a definite place.</p>
              <p>e. The grandeur and serenity of a Buddhist altar would 
              demonstrate the 
              practitioner's faith in taking the Refuge and give visitors chances of 
              acquainting with and taking delight in such practices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>B. The Location of a Buddhist Altar</h2>
              <p>It is ideal to set up a Buddhist altar in a dedicated room. If the 
              building 
              is of two or more stories, it is proper to set it up on the top floor. 
              If there 
              is no dedicated room available, a quiet place or a room which can be 
              closed up 
              for quiet meditation at the regular practice time should be selected.</p>
              <p>The orientation of a Buddhist altar depends on the main Buddha 
              worshipped. If 
              the practitioner majors in the Pureland school, the main Holiness should
               be 
              Amitabha Buddha And hence the altar</p>
              <p>should be oriented toward the East. In case of the Healing Buddha
               who 
              eliminates misfortunes and prolongs lives, it should be orientated 
              toward the 
              West. (All notes below are added into the English translation by Dr. 
              Lin. Note 
              1: Amitabha Buddha's Pureland is in the West, hence the altar ideally is
               to be 
              set up such that when we face Him, we are facing the West. A similar 
              remark 
              applies to the case of the Healing Buddha whose Pureland is in the 
              East.) If the 
              wall available is not of the ideal orientation, it is also fine to 
              ignore this 
              point. It is proper to select a wall with sufficient illumination so 
              that it is 
              easier for the practitioner to concentrate on gazing at the holy images .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>C. The Installation of the Images of Buddhas</h2>
              <p>The images of Buddhas selected should have been made according to 
              correct 
              rules. Try to avoid those made of fragile materials, such as porcelain, 
              so that 
              they will not be damaged in accidental falls.</p>
              <p>In general, holy images complete with a seat are to be selected 
              for an altar. 
              However, in case of an antique image that had been worshipped by some 
              virtuous 
              Buddhist for a long time, even though it is scarred and cracked a 
              little, it is 
              still fine to welcome it home with respect and continue worshipping.</p>
              <p>It is proper to ask a virtuous Buddhist practitioner to perform 
              the 
              invocation ceremony for a Buddhist image so as to bring in the body, 
              speech, 
              mind, merits and activities of the depicted holy being. If a Buddhist 
              statue is 
              hollow, it should be fully filled in advance with sutras, mantras, holy 
              relics, 
              jewels, dried pine or cypress leaves etc. by the practitioner who is 
              going to 
              conduct the invocation. If there is no virtuous Buddhist practitioner 
              near by, 
              it is also fine to install and worship the images first and get the 
              invocation 
              done in the future when chances arise.</p>
              <p>The Buddhist images hung on the wall should be positioned 
              according to their 
              status. Usually, they are hung in rows from top down in the order of 
              guru, 
              yidam, dakini and protector. Again, in the rows, they should be arranged
               in the 
              order of Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya or of Buddha, 
              Bodhisattva, 
              Pratyekabuddha and Arhat. There are two ways to arrange the images in a 
              row:</p>
              <p>1. The superiority is from right to left - the highest one starts
               from the 
              right most side of the wall (i.e. the left-hand side of the practitioner
               when he 
              faces the wall).</p>
              <p>2. The superiority starts from the middle and then in turn to its
               right-hand 
              side and its left-hand side as follows.</p>
              <p>The shape and size of the images should also be taken into 
              consideration so 
              that the resultant combination would be symmetrical and nice looking. 
              Hence one 
              of the two ways introduced above can be chosen to produce the best 
              arrangement 
              possible. (Note 2: On one altar, the two ways introduced above may be 
              applied 
              respectively to different rows. For example, the images on the wall may 
              be 
              arranged according to the second way, while the holy statues on the 
              table may be 
              arranged according to the first way.) The image of a yidam and the image
               of its 
              mandala should be hung in a column but not in a row. The mandala can be 
              either 
              over or under its yidam. For example, the picture of the Western 
              Pureland may be 
              hung over or under the image of Amitabha Buddha but not beside it. The 
              superiority on the right as mentioned above is an ancient custom of 
              Sakyamuni 
              Buddha handed down in India and Tibet. The images of the three 
              Holinesses of the 
              Western Pureland as drawn by the Chinese painters usually follow the 
              Chinese 
              custom of superiority on the left, and hence with Avalokitesvara and 
              Mahasthanaprapta on Amitabha's left and right respectively. If both 
              Bodhisattvas 
              are painted facing toward the Buddha, we are obliged to follow the 
              underlying 
              local custom in our arrangement. If the three images are not on one 
              sheet of 
              paper and the two Bodhisattvas are facing forward, then it is more 
              proper to put 
              Avalokitesvara on the right (Note 3: and mahasthanaprapta on the left of
               
              Amitabha Buddha) according to Sakyamuni's original custom.</p>
              <p>If the wall chosen is not large enough for hanging all the 
              images, some of 
              them may be hung on the other three walls of the room. On each wall, the
               images 
              should still be installed according to the principles explained above. 
              The 
              images of protectors may be hung on the wall opposite to the alter at 
              lower 
              positions so that they can pay attention to the instructions of Buddhas.
               It is 
              also fine to add an offering table with offerings under the images of 
              protectors 
              to form an altar dedicated to these Dharma protectors.</p>
              <p>Buddhist statues may be placed on the altar table. If there is 
              only one 
              table, arrange the statues near the wall and the offerings before them. 
              (Note 4: 
              Some altar uses two tables: a higher one set near the wall for placing 
              the 
              statues and a lower one in front for placing the offerings.) The order 
              of 
              arrangement is still determined as mentioned above. If there are two or 
              more 
              rows, do not let the bigger statues block the view of the smaller ones. 
              It is 
              proper to have the altar table and the offering table covered with 
              majestic 
              cloths or decorated with carved designs of auspiciousness.</p>
              <p>It is proper to put the sariras (Note 5: i.e. relics of holy 
              Buddhists) in a 
              miniature sarira-stupa with transparent glass windows and place it on 
              the altar 
              table for worshipping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>D.The Location of the Bookshelves for Sutras</h2>
              <p>All Buddhas are born from the Dharma (Note 6: i.e. Enlightenment is 
              achieved 
              through following the Buddhist teachings), hence sutras and mantras may 
              only be 
              placed over or beside the Buddhist images or statues to show respect. It
               is a 
              mistake to put sutras and mantras under the images of Buddhas or 
              offering 
              tables. Sutras or mantras may also be placed on the altar table for 
              worshipping. 
              Make sure that nothing is placed on top of them (Note 7: except 
              protective or 
              ornamental coverings.) If there is only one bookcase which is not for 
              the 
              exclusive use of sutras, sutras and mantras should be placed on the top 
              shelves; 
              Buddhist books and the audio cassettes of Buddhist hymns and Amitabha 
              chanting, 
              the middle ones; and books on other religions or worldly affairs, the 
              bottom 
              ones.</p>
              <p>Those practitioners who intend to circulate, free of charges, 
              Buddhist books 
              and images may assign a part of a bookcase or set a dedicated bookcase 
              near the 
              Buddhist altar or in the parlor for that purpose so that visitors may 
              select and 
              pick up whatever they are interested in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>E. The Placement of the Dharma Implements</h2>
              <p>Dharma implements, such as a wooden fish, hand-bell, Dharma wheel, 
              bell and 
              vajra, etc., may be placed in front or on either side of the Buddhist 
              images on 
              an altar table. A Buddhist rosary may be coiled clockwise to form a 
              lotus seat 
              with three loops so that the father- and mother- beads stand upright on 
              the 
              seat. While picking up a set of bell and vajra, cross the hands with the
               right 
              one over the left one and take the vajra with the right hand, and the 
              bell, the 
              left one. The way of putting down the bell and vajra is the same as the 
              way of 
              picking them up. Hence the bell is placed closely on the left of the 
              vajra on 
              the table. The female Buddha's face on the bell-handle should face the 
              practitioner. If there is a Tantric drum (Damaru), it should be placed, 
              standing 
              on its side (instead of one drumhead flat on the table), to the right of
               a 
              vajra. If a Dharma wheel can not stand steadily by itself, its handle 
              may be 
              inserted into a cup filled with rice. Tantric implements, such as ritual
               daggers 
              and curved knives, should be placed close to the holy beings who use 
              them. If 
              they are set flat on the table, their sharp ends should face away from 
              the 
              images so as to defend against demons. If they stand upright, their 
              sharp ends 
              should point downwards. Hence daggers are sometimes inserted in a tube 
              filled 
              with rice. The counters for counting the numbers of chantings, offerings
               or 
              prostrations may also be placed on the edge of an altar table. The board
               for 
              prostrating and the cushions for worshipping or meditating may be placed
               in 
              front of an offering table. If there is room under the table, they may 
              be stored 
              in there when they are not in use.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>F. The placement of the Offerings</h2>
              <p>A censer may be placed in the middle of an offering table. The censer
               should 
              be filled with incense ash or fine sand (Note 8: so that incense sticks 
              may be 
              inserted to stand upright.) It may also be filled with rice first, and 
              then, 
              after a fair amount of incense ash has accumulated, the contents thereof
               are 
              sieved to preserve the ash. A censer may also be used for burning 
              powdered or 
              shredded sandalwood. The way is to bum the powdered sandalwood first, 
              and then 
              gradually add the shreds of sandalwood. In order to prevent the walls 
              from 
              getting smoked, a censer with cover for incense to lie in may be used. 
              If an 
              incense stick extinguishes before it is entirely burned up, it may not 
              be lit 
              again, but it may be placed in a censer for lying incense and be reused.
               (Note 
              9: An incense stick that stands up in a censer and fails to burn through
               is 
              called a "beheaded" incense. It is considered irrespectful to offer the 
              rest of 
              that stick while it stands. When we use the remaining parts in a lying 
              position, 
              we consider it as mere incense powder.) Do not pull out and extinguish 
              an 
              incense which is still burning. Do not use the electric counterfeit 
              incense 
              sticks with tiny bulbs in place of the real ones. In case it is 
              forbidden to 
              burn incense in a rented house or room, at least, three or five pieces 
              of 
              sandalwood should be offered on the table.</p>
              <p>A pair of lamps may be set on the left and right sides of the 
              offering table 
              in front of the Buddhist images. It would be better to have lamps that 
              are 
              majestically decorated with dragons or lotus-flowers. It is best to use 
              small 
              red bulbs for the lamps and leave them on all the time. Besides, butter 
              lamps, 
              peanut-oil lamps or candles may also be added as offerings.</p>
              <p>A couple of flower vases should be placed on both sides of an 
              offering table. 
              Beautiful and decorative vases which are not fragile, for example, 
              Cloisonne 
              vases, are preferable. Fresh flowers in season are recommended. 
              Artificial 
              flowers which are well arranged would also be fine. In this case, 
              whenever the 
              fresh flowers become available, they may be offered in additional vases.
               Several 
              peacock feathers may also be offered in the flower vases. Flowers of 
              thorny 
              plants should not be offered to Buddhas. They may only be offered to 
              Dharma 
              protectors who are brave beyond being afraid of thorns. When the flowers
               in a 
              vase are well arranged, the best-looking side should be turned toward 
              the 
              Buddhist images.</p>
              <p>In front of the censer, a row of offering cups may be set up. In 
              Exoteric 
              schools, three cups of clean water may be offered. In Tantric schools, 
              seven, 
              eight or nine cups may be used according to different traditions. The 
              offerings 
              in the cups are essentially the same for all traditions. Eight cups 
              stand for 
              eight offerings; they are, starting from the right side of the images, 
              water 
              (for washing), water (for drinking), flowers, incense (for burning), 
              lamp, 
              saffron (for perfuming), food and music respectively. Usually seven cups
               of 
              water are offered. Food is offered beside them. (Note 10: In this case, 
              although 
              all seven cups contain only water, they are visualized as the seven 
              kinds of 
              offerings, besides food, mentioned above.) The sixth cup of water which 
              stands 
              for saffron may be added with a few drops of perfume (Note 11: instead 
              of 
              saffron, but not in addition thereto.) The distance between two adjacent
               cups 
              (Note 12: measured from rim to rim) is about the length of a long grain 
              of rice. 
              On the offering table in a retreat room, two rows of offering cups may 
              also be 
              set up. The row nearer to Buddhist images is for Buddhas. The other row 
              which is 
              nearer to the practitioner is for the practitioner who possesses the 
              Buddha 
              Pride of his yidam. This row of cups start from the right-hand side of 
              the 
              practitioner for what they stand for as explained above.</p>
              <p>Usually, a Tantric practitioner would offer a mandala. It 
              consists of seven 
              or thirty-seven offerings. In addition, The Nyingma School practitioners
               offer 
              their special trikaya mandala.</p>
              <p>All kinds of fruits in season or food may be offered. Generally, 
              Exoteric 
              practitioners make only vegetarian offerings. Tantric practitioners 
              include meat 
              in their offerings but they should not kill or ask other people to kill 
              in order 
              to get the meat. Only meat available from markets may be purchased for 
              offerings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>G. The Adding and Replacement of the Offerings</h2>
              <p>It is proper to add or replace the offerings before each meal. 
              Incense may be 
              offered at any time, but at least twice a day, once in the morning and 
              once in 
              the evening. If the oil lamps or candles other than the unceasingly lit 
              lamps 
              can not be offered very often, they should be lit in the evening or 
              during daily 
              practices. The water in vases for the fresh flowers should be replaced 
              every two 
              or three days. The withered flowers should be removed when noticed. 
              Artificial 
              flowers may be replaced after several months. Before going to bed or 
              after the 
              evening practice, visualize the offering water to be nectar and then 
              pour it 
              away to feed hungry ghosts. Dry the cups, pile them up in two sets and 
              put them 
              upside-down on the table. (The sixth cup for the water added with 
              perfume is 
              placed alone. The others are all in one pile.) If the cups can not be 
              piled up, 
              they may be placed upside-down separately. After getting up in the 
              morning, set 
              the seven cups in place again. The forth one may first be placed before 
              the 
              censer as the central reference, and then set the left and right three 
              ones 
              respectively. Then pour the water into the cups from a teakettle and 
              repeat "Om 
              Ah Hum" while pouring. (Note 13: Fill the cups four fifth full.) 
              Whenever one 
              makes offerings, one should repeat "Om Ah Hum." The mandala should be 
              added with 
              rice. If there is no time to replace the rice in the mandala everyday, 
              it should 
              be done on the four days when offerings are made to gurus, yidams, 
              dakinis, and 
              protectors respectively. (In order, the four days are the eighth, 
              fifteenth, 
              twenty-fifth and twenty- ninth of each month in (Note 14: the Chinese or
               
              Tibetan) lunar calendar. For a Nyingma School practitioner, the eighth 
              is 
              replaced by the tenth which is a special day of Padmasambhava.) All food
               
              offerings should be removed after the period of burning up one incense 
              or one or 
              two days before they would become spoiled so as to avoid the contrary 
              result of 
              committing a sin. The value of offerings depends more on the sincerity 
              of the 
              offerer, hence offerings that are specially bought or prepared for 
              Buddhas are 
              best. Food for ourselves may also be offered to Buddhas before we take 
              it so 
              that we can obtain the Buddhas' blessings. While eating, one visualizes 
              the food 
              to be nectar. The offerings removed may be taken by ourselves or be 
              given to the 
              beings outdoors while repeating the Giving of Leftovers Mantra: "Om 
              Woojeedza 
              Palingda kaka Kasee Kasee" so that they can also share Buddhas' grace. 
              All the 
              rice removed from the mandala may be fed to birds. The incense, candles,
               rice, 
              matches, etc. for making offerings may be stored in the drawers of the 
              offering 
              table or under it for convenience. Matches are poisonous, hence they 
              should not 
              be placed on the offering table. If there are small children in the 
              family, the 
              matches and candles should be stored at other higher places so that they
               cannot 
              be reached and played by kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>H.The Disposition of an Altar during Traveling or Moving</h2>
              <p>When you are out traveling, you had better ask someone else to do the
               
              offerings at the altar as usual and you yourself should also make a 
              remote 
              offering of food before each meal. (Note 15: Before each meal, chant "Om
               Ah Hum" 
              three times and visualize the food has been offered to all Buddhas and 
              their 
              attendants, including the holy beings worshipped at your own altar.) If 
              nobody 
              else can do the offerings at home for you, you first visualize that all 
              the holy 
              beings on your altar melt into light and enter your heart cakra or the 
              hand-held 
              Dharma wheel that you usually use. Then remove the fresh flowers and 
              those food 
              that would become rotten, extinguish the candles and pour away the 
              offering 
              water. While traveling, offer your food to the holy beings in the Dharma
               wheel 
              brought along with you before each meal, or visualize that you are 
              offering the 
              food to the holy beings in your heart while you are eating. After you 
              have 
              returned home, then visualize that the Holy beings come out as lights 
              from your 
              heart or the Dharma wheel and return to their images respectively.</p>
              <p>When you are going to move or just to move the altar to another 
              room, 
              visualize that the Holy beings enter your heart cakra or a Dharma wheel 
              in the 
              form of lights before you move anything on the altar. After you have set
               up the 
              Buddhist altar again at the new place, then visualize the Holy beings 
              return to 
              their images in the form of lights. If there is a virtuous Buddhist 
              practitioner 
              near by, an invocation ceremony may be performed again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>I. Concluding Remarks</h2>
              <p>The very brief introduction above is intended for practical 
              applications so 
              that explanations on the profound theoretical significances are omitted.
               I hope 
              that the beginners would set up their Buddhist altars accordingly, start
               to do 
              the preliminary practices, such as offerings and prostrations and form a
               habit 
              of practising at a regular time and a definite place. And please do not 
              be 
              content with what you have learned from this, but study further the 
              supplementary readings listed below so as to understand the differences 
              between 
              worshipping a Buddhist altar and a godly altar, the way to establish a 
              proper 
              relationship with the Buddhist images and the meanings and 
              symbolizations at 
              various levels of the multitude of offerings.</p>

              <p>Like thunders waking up beings in the hibernation of Ignorance, As 
              moonlight 
              shining through barred windows upon jailbirds, Buddha expounded the 
              Tathagata-garbha luminously and fully; Remembering such grace of 
              Sakyamuni 
              Buddha makes our tears flow!</p>
              <p>Like a silkworm imprisoned by its cocoon of selffabrication, we 
              are caught in 
              the illusive net of our Karmic threads; The more our efforts to untangle
               it, the 
              deeper our entanglement therein; Buddha's transcendental wisdom 
              clarified the 
              nonexistence of such inherent sufferers; Remembering such grace of 
              Sakyamuni 
              Buddha makes our tears flow!</p>
              <p>Buddha secretly realized the Bliss of Nirvana, Not arising 
              through practices, 
              but existing innately to be enjoyed; Buddha unconditionally presented 
              the 
              complete collection of His treasures to us; Remembering such grace of 
              Sakyamuni 
              Buddha makes our tears flow!</p>
              <p>The Light of Victorious Significance is continuously omnipresent;
               Silently 
              holding a flower to hint at the indescribable Truth, Buddha showed us 
              the 
              meaning of the oneness of Samsara and Nirvana; Remembering such grace of
               
              Sakyamuni Buddha makes our tears flow!</p>
              <p>May All Be Auspicious!</p>
