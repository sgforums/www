It is not riddles and also cannot be intellectually understood. It is more like a METHOD, a skillful means to bring the practitioner to non-conceptual Wisdom of Reality.<br><br>Please see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=256297&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">What is Koan?</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">That's right. A Koan is a method and not something that can be learnt or known. It is also [b]NOT a riddle! It is not something we can 'figure out' by thinking. The whole point of a koan is that it is utterly beyond what our rational thinking and conceptuality can ever grasp or understand, for the Truth can only be realised through the intuitive mind as Lankavatara Sutra says.<br><br>As my Master (Master Shen Kai) said:<br><br><img src="http://img259.imageshack.us/img259/946/koanub5.gif"><br><br>Here's a good article:<br><br><strong>We have said in part I that Zen functions in non-duality, The process of thought, of reasoning, of conceptualizing takes place in the field of duality. It follows that no thinking process will achieve Zen. Thought in itself can go a very long way; the seeker can by reason intellectually understand the concept of the ONE, the abstract concept of the VOID, think that mentally he understands what awareness is... But still all these concepts even the most abstract intellectual ones are still made in the world of reasoning and duality...So, Zen philosophy is to discard all kind of concepts and challenge the mind and intellect of the seeker by Zen KOANS which are not easily cracked...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is a Koan? Essentially a koan is a paradox, i.e., that is 'beyond' thinking which transcends the logical or conceptual. Thus, since it cannot be solved by reason, a koan is not a riddle. Solving a koan requires a leap to another level of comprehension. Since the koan eludes solution by means of discursive understanding, it makes clear to the student the limitations of thought and eventually forces him to transcend it in an intuitive leap, which takes him into a world beyond logical contradictions and dualistic modes of thought.</span><br><br>For Zen masters, WORDS are sounds or marks of agreed meaning in terms of ideas, thoughts or feelings. They are symbols, when therefore, a master wishes to transmit to another some spiritual experience, he must descend to the level of thought and present the discovery in words that will touch the feelings of his student. On his turn the seeker unwraps the words and their symbolic meaning, extracting and resonating whatever he can understand from his master's Koan... or symbolic Words...</strong><br><br>Bhante Gunaratana also says:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The second Zen approach used in the Rinzai school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious thought and into pure awareness. This is done by giving the student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve anyway, and by placing him in a horrendous training situation. Since he cannot flee from the pain of the situation, he must flee into a pure experience of the moment. There is nowhere else to go. Zen is tough. It is effective for many people, but it is really tough.</span></strong></div></blockquote><blockquote><strong><strong><a href="http://www.mountainrunnerdoc.citymaker.com/page/page/1523597.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountainrunnerdoc.citymaker.com/page/page/1523597.htm</a><br><br>...Not all Zen schools use koans, which are a form of Â‘riddleÂ’ sometimes used by the Masters to break the fixation of mind of their students. They are solved not by giving the right answer but by transcending the conceptual mind in the process of contemplation of the paradox the koan represents. As such they are really only useful chiefly for advanced practitioners, whose mind, and general character development, are "ripe" for a breakthrough to a true glimpse. This matter of maturity and ripeness, as well as the need for practise after satori, is so important and apparently so rarely found today that the the very legitimacy of such practise and dharma transmission itself have been called into question. D.T. Suzuki (1970-1966) considered his master, Soyen Shaku, to be the last of the great Zen Masters. Things seem to have deteriorated even further since he made that comment, although there have been exceptions. Part of this is unfortunately inevitable when a tradition or school becomes too insular and its masters and students are uninformed by an in-depth study of their own as well as discriminative study other philosophical teachings.<br><br>A classic koan is Â“what is the sound of one hand clapping?Â”, or "what was your original face before you were born?", or simply "Mu". Then one might be told to meditate on his koan for twenty hours a day until he Â‘solvesÂ’ it. The beginning student (but still one tested and prepared by a preliminary course of discipline) traditionally came to the master (in what came to be known as the 'shouting and beating school", at any rate) with a clever answer and typically got a whack from his staff or a cuff on the ear. In some cases, the disciple may get a blow even before he speaks:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">" Master Tokusan was a much more severe kind of Zen Master. Once a monk came to see him and, according to the Buddhist manner, made a bow to the Master before asking a question. However, before he had finished bowing, Tokusan gave him a blow of his stick. The monk did not know what it was all about, and said, "I have just bowed to you and have not asked you any question yet. Why have you struck me?" "It is no use to wait till you start talking," was the reply Tokusan gave him. In such a strict denial of words we are to see how earnestly Zen insists on the experience itself."

It's not something we can speculate.<br><br>That means you can't say if I hit you, I will get hit back some day, because of karma. Karma is not a tit for tat kind of 'judgement' system, though its consequences and effects are very real.<br><br>That is to say one can realise Emptiness to a high extent, but unless you become a Buddha with omniscience you will not completely understand the whole workings of karma and the precise causes and effects.<br><br>However Karma is also based on the reality of interdependent origination and conditioned arising. Like I said, the consequences and effects are very real, so we should take karma into perspective in our life, how are we going to live life with that understanding.<br><br>Therefore, as Dharma Dan says:<br><br><strong>This is sometimes referred to as the Â“Law of Karma,Â” where karma is a word that has to do with our intentions and actions. Some people can get all caught up in specifics of this that cannot possibly be known, like speculating that if we kill a bug we will come back as a bug and be squished. Don't. Cause and effect, also called interdependence, is just too imponderably complex. Just use this general concept to look honestly at what you want, why, and precisely how you know this. Examine what the consequences of what you do and think might be for yourself and everyone, and then take responsibility for those consequences. It's a tall order and an important practice to engage in, but don't get too obsessive about it. Remember the simplicity of the first training, training in kindness, generosity, honesty and clarity, and gain balance and wisdom from the other two trainings as you go.</strong><br><br>----------------<br><br><strong>"Karma just means that everything has a cause and condition. The cause and condition of everything is what we call karma. Karma is emptiness because it's nothing more than cause and condition. Karma cause, karma result, karma condition. When we really look into the study of the karma, there are, if I remember correctly, six causes, four conditions, and five results. That's how karma is explained.

We could also say that everything we do is motivated by compassion, which is part of the fundamentally empty nature of reality. That doesnÂ’t mean that everything we do is skillful; that is a whole different issue.<br><br>Compassion is a very good thing, especially when it involves one's self and all beings. It is sort of the flip side of the Second Noble Truth. The whole problem is that Â“misdirectedÂ” compassion, compassion that is filtered through the process of ego and its related habits, can produce enormous suffering and often does. It is easy to think of many examples of people searching for happiness in the strangest of places and by doing the strangest of things. Just pick up any newspaper. The take-home message is to search for happiness where you are actually likely to find it.<br><br>We might say that compassion is the ultimate aspect of desire, or think of compassion and desire on a continuum. <strong>The more wisdom or understanding of interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect compassion and the more the results will turn out well. The more greed, hatred and delusion or lack of understanding of interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect desire and the more suffering there will likely be.</strong></span><br><br>~ Dharma Dan</div>

So obviously there is some really close relationship between suffering, desire and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff and worth investigating.<br><br>We might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in a loop, the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dogÂ’s tail chasing itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be Â“over there.Â” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to widen the imagined split. This will never work, because it doesnÂ’t actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful. When boring or unpleasant sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place....</span><br><br>--- Dharma Dan.<br><br>The description of dualistic 'compassion', i.e Desire.<br><br><blockquote>You need to explain in terms of Buddhist philosophy of Emptiness and Karma<br><br>Why Karma=&gt;Interdependence leads to Compassion/Love</blockquote>Karma is interdependent origination because that's the truth of all things -- conditioned arising, interdependent origination.<br><br>As I quoted:<br><br><strong>"Karma just means that everything has a cause and condition.

As long as one is caught up in causes and effects of karma, and creating new karma, not liberated from it, there will be endless sufferings.<br><br>However, when one becomes aware of the interdependence, and does not act unwisely/contrary to the truth of interdependence, then there is compassion and does not create any negative unwholesome karma. There is compassion that motives what we do, based on the understanding of interdependence, causes and conditions. They are not filtered by the process of self-identification/ego, and hence no dualistic attraction nor aversion.</div>

Many of my friends here and I would like to know what is Human Bliss Culture.</span><br><br><strong>The culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture</strong><br><br>It is because the bliss culture that you have in mind and what I have in mind are different. The bliss culture that you have in mind may be how to prosper with great wealth and fortune, or how to have a good wife in order for the family to have bliss. In this manner, the definition of bliss is too narrow! We need to know that the culture of Buddhism is the real bliss culture. If everybody is able to attain the ultimate Nirvana, then this is indeed the real bliss culture.<br><br>The purpose of our learning Buddhism is to distance from suffering and attain happiness. Many people think that to distance from suffering and attain happiness means going to the Western Pure Land. In fact, it is not only this. When we distance from suffering and attain happiness, we have to instantaneously distance from suffering, instantaneously attain happiness and liberation. Some people may be suspicious; how can liberation be attained so easily? In fact, it is very simple. If someone scolds you, and you apologize to him, then that is a small liberation. If someone hits you, and you retaliate; an eye for an eye, then isnÂ’t that very miserable? What happen if that results in loss of life? Even though you are rude to me, I will still apologise very politely to you. IsnÂ’t that being liberated? This is Jen Chen BuddhismÂ’s teaching of liberation. If whilst alive, we cannot even attain small liberationÂ’s like this, then what more to say of liberation after death? In the course of our daily lives, if we are liberated at every moment, then in time to come we will be able to attain the great liberation. Please think it over, isnÂ’t this a very blissful? This is but to use a small matter to illustrate the path of liberation. If we are able to understand more of the Buddha-Dharma and apply them in our life, family, society, country, and to the extent of the entire humanity of the world, then isnÂ’t this a great bliss culture? Therefore, we say that the culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture.</div>
