Suffering is actually luminosity. Otherwise how do you know it is suffering?</strong> Why the pain is so real? Anything that is real, that you feel, that you touch, anything that you feel so real. It is actually luminosity. <strong>How can you know what suffering is all about? Without thoughts or what, you still feel suffering, right?

In fact, all beings' Buddha Nature is already complete, they just don't know.<br><br>There's a term for the first Buddha -- Adi Buddha, or the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Primordial</span></strong> Buddha, that is the First Buddha, "a metaphor for our true condition".<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"> Question: Is it possible to conceive of a being that has never entered into dualism, into samsara?<br><br>Answer: Reading certain tantras it would seem that originally, by the magic of knowledge and of ignorance, on one side there arose Samantabhadra, <strong>the first Buddha</strong>, and on the other side beings who transmigrate.  However, this should be mainly understood as a metaphor to enable us to discover our real condition.  If we deem Samantabhadra an individual being, we are far from the true meaning.  <strong>In reality, he denotes our potentiality that, even though at the present moment we are in samsara, has never been conditioned by dualism.  From the beginning, the state of the individual has been pure and always remains pure: this is what Samantabhadra represents.  But when we fall into conditioning, it is as if we are no longer Samantabhadra because we are ignorant of our true nature.  So what is called the primordial Buddha, or Adibuddha, is only a metaphor for our true condition.</strong><br><br>Question: What does it mean, then, that Samantabhadra is the "first" enlightened one and that he has never transmigrated?<br><br>Answer: We cannot talk about the true condition of the primordial state in terms of "before" and "after," as if there was somebody before and then something else arose.  These are all limited concepts, and it is necessary to go beyond time.  Samantabhadra means our state, and should not be interpreted as God in the sense of a supreme entity who is the only creator, for example.<br><br>~ EPILOGUE:<br>On The Nature of Samantabhadra<br>A Conversation with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu[/quote]<br><br>So, it is here, all the time, and "before" time. No, actually, it is beyond all notions of time, "before" or "after", it is timelessly ever-present. So to say it is the beginning is still not quite right, because there is NO beginning in time. You must know it is only a metaphor.<br><br>There is NO time ultimately, reality is Timeless. Buddha Nature has no beginning, no end, no time. With that, there is no birth, no death, no increase, no decrease. (see Heart Sutra)<br><br>The Buddha Nature is Unborn. And all things are actually manifestation of Buddha Nature, and is of the essence of Buddha Nature, and is also in its essence, empty, and Unborn. Ultimately, Manifestation is the Source. Do not think that there is a creator-created division, this is duality. (also see: <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/source-thing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamdatum.com/source-thing.html</a>) There is no particular existence of a creator, and nothing is ever born/created ultimately (they're empty). Yet, Source, like the great ocean is the unmanifested ground where all manifestations, the waves, are apparently happening, but do not think waves and ocean separate, they are one. Awareness is like the great ocean where all phenomena is simply happening, all manifestation are manifestations of Awareness.<br><br>Only by illusions do we see entities/independent objects with inherent existence, time, beginning and end/birth and death.<br><br>In The Awakening of Faith in Mahayana by Asvhaghosha:<br><br><blockquote>The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality (dharmadhatu) and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality.<br><br>That which is called "the essential nature of the Mind" is unborn and is imperishable. It is only through illusions that all things come to be differentiated. If one is freed from illusions, then to him there will be no appearances (lakshana) of objects regarded as absolutely independent existences; therefore all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization, description, and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis, undifferentiated, free from alteration, and indestructible. They are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness. All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable of denoting Suchness.<br><br>The term Suchness likewise has no attributes which can be verbally specified. The term Suchness is, so to speak, the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to words. But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to, for all things in their Absolute aspect are real; nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; hence the name Suchness.</blockquote><blockquote>The way to correct this error is to make clear that the five components are unborn in their essential nature and, therefore, are imperishable - that what is made of the five components is, from the beginning, in nirvana.</blockquote>All phenomenal existence and the 5 skhandas is from the beginning Unborn, Imperishable and in Nirvana. Only through ignorance we do not see their Emptiness, and thus perceive the existence of the 'World' and 'Samsara'. We begin to perceive a Subject (self in here) and an Objective reality (world out there).<br><br>So since originally all things are by nature empty and unborn, already in Nirvana, Nirvana is simply Samsara rightly seen.<br><br>See: <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/groundbase.jpg" rel="nofollow">Ripples on the surface of the Source</a><br><br>[quote]<img src="http://www.dreamdatum.com/groundbase.jpg"><br><br>The followings are just descriptions of my understanding. Nothing definitive though.<br><br>The impression of there being a 'me/self' interacting with the environment and others can be compared to the ripples on the surface of Being. The ripples can be liken to individuals/selves. The ripples are the perceptions of sensorial and thought experiences. Different beings/individuals will have different experiences that are dependent on their sense characteristics. Being/Absolute can be liken to the entirety which is the vast ocean.<br></div><div class="quote_body">When the feeling/impression of the observer-being observed(outward interaction- 'ripple percieving other ripples') is recognised, the impression dissolves as/into the all-pervading un-manifested whole. Then, all that is percieved becomes like a mere happening. This mere happening are like reflections on the vast mirror.<br><br>Why is that so? Perhaps, it is because when this (self-recognition) occurs, attention/self-knowingness re-blends with the unmanifested ground-base that is Oneness with all. Here, there is no subject-object division. However, the surface and reflections are still there... and they appears like mere happenings in the phenomenal world.<br><br>From the above description, we call also postulate that everything is the Source itself... which is no-thing at all.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here are some Dzogchen teachings:<br><br><blockquote>    The Dzogchen teachings themselves view the process of cosmic origination in a way that is parallel to, but slightly different from, the Bon tradition. <strong>In the Dzogchen teachings, it is considered that the primordial state, which is beyond time, and beyond creation and destruction, is the fundamentally pure base of all existence, both at the universal and the individual levels.  It is the inherent nature of the primordial state to manifest as light, which in turn manifests as the five colors, the essences of the elements.  The essences of the elements interact (as explained in the Bon cosmology) to produce the elements themselves, which make up both the individual's body and the whole material dimension.  The universe is thus understood as the spontaneously arising play of the energy of the primordial state, and may be enjoyed as such by an individual who remains integrated with his or her essential inherent condition, in the self-liberation, self-perfected state, the state of Dzogchen.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But if, through fundamental misperception of reality, the individual enters into the confusion of dualism, primordial consciousness, which is in fact the source of all manifestation (even of dualistic consciousness and, in fact, of all phenomena), itself becomes obscured. The individual's deluded mind then mistakes the manifestations of its own pure, innate primordial awareness for an external reality existing separately from itself, which it endlessly, and ultimately unsuccessfully, attempts to manipulate, trying in vain to bring an end to the continual underlying sense of dissatisfaction and unease which is the inevitable experience of the obscuration of pure awareness.  The experience of underlying dissatisfaction (or 'dukha', in Sanskrit) that unavoidably arises with a deluded mind, continues, no matter how 'successful' the individual becomes in dealing with his or her world in materialistic terms, until the individual regains the experience of the primordial state.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">All the various passions arise from the fundamental misperception of reality just described, and the passions once they have arisen continually condition the individual into dualism, deepening the individual's sense of confusion about the nature of reality.  This is why samsara, the endless round of conditioned existence, is often described in the teachings as bing a 'vicious cycle'.</span></strong><br><br>The Dzogchen teachings, in the explanations of the Base, the Path, and the Fruit, set out to show how the illusion of dualism has come about, how it can be undone, and what the experience of an individual is when it is undone.  But all examples used to explain the nature of reality can only ever be partially successful in describing it because it is, in itself, beyond words and concepts.  As Milarepa said, we may say that the essential nature of the mind is like space, because both are empty, but mind is aware, while space is not.  Realization is not knowledge about the universe, but the living experience of the nature of the universe.  Until we have such living experience, we remain dependent on examples, and subject to their limits.<br><br>~ 'The Crystal and the Way of Light - Sutra @ Tantra, and Dzogchen' by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu p.93-94</blockquote><blockquote>"Buddha and God" (7)<br><br>The relevant scripture is not officially a sutra (although it does on occasion refer to itself as such), but a Buddhist "tantra" (a more mystical, secret manual for Buddhist practice). It is entitled The All-Creating King. This is what it teaches: all things spring from the Awakened Mind (bodhicitta), which is called Samantabhadra Buddha. "Samantabhadra" means "All-Good" (we remember that one of the definitions of God earlier in this study stated  that God is "all good"). This Samantabhadra Buddha is the source of all Buddhas and all beings. Apart from Samantabhadra Buddha, nothing truly exists, since all depends on Buddha, but Buddha depends on nothing. This Primaeval Buddha is called "Adi-Buddha" (Primordial Buddha) elsewhere in Buddhism, and is sometimes named Vairochana or Vajrasattva. The important point, however, is that this Buddha represents the Ultimate Source of all things, whether of the past, present or future. Without Samantabhadra Buddha - the all-good, universal Mind of Awake-ness - nothing can exist. Here are some quotes from the All-Creating King Tantra, in which Samantabhadra speaks directly to the listener:<br><br>"I, the supreme source ["All-Creating King"], am the sole maker, and no other agent exists in the world. The nature of phenomena is created through me ... The very manifestation of existence itself depends on me ... I am self-arising wisdom that has existed from the beginning. I am the supreme source of everything, pure and total consciousness ...'Consciousness' means that self-arising wisdom, the true essence, dominates and clearly perceives all the phenomena of the animate and inanimate universe. This self-arising fundamental substance, not produced by causes and condition, governs all things and gives life to all things ... As my nature is unhindered and all-pervading, it is the celestial abode of wisdom and luminous space: therein abides only self-arising wisdom. As I am the substance whence everything arises, the five great elements, the three worlds [i.e. the worlds of Desire, Form, and Formlessness] and the six classes of beings [hell-denizens, ghosts, animals, humans, Titans, and gods] are only my body, my voice, and my mind: I myself create my own nature ... The root of all phenomena is pure and total consciousness, the source. All that appears is my nature. All that manifests is my magical display. All sounds and words express only my meaning ...<br><br>"I am the core of all that exists. I am the seed of all that exists. I am the foundation of all that exists. I am the root of existence. I am 'the core', because I contain all phenomena. I am 'the seed', because I give birth to everything. I am 'the cause', because all comes forth from me. I am 'the trunk', because the ramificationsof every event sprout from me. I am 'the foundation', because all abides in me. I am called 'the root', because I am everything [emphasis added]" (Translation of "The All-Creating King", published as The Supreme Source, tr. by Adriano Clemente and Andrew Lukianowicz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, New York 1999, pp. 137-141, 157).</blockquote></div>

It is so sad that such things are so easily turned into an object of egoic identification.<br><br>I wrote a year ago:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Exerpt from A New Earth by Eckhart Tolle, page 13 to 19</span><br><br><strong>THE ARISING NEW CONSCIOUSNESS</strong><br><br>Most ancient religions and spiritual traditions share the same common insight Â– that our Â“normalÂ” state of mind is marred by a fundamental defect. However, out of this insight into the nature of the human condition Â– we may call it the bad news Â– arise a second insight: the good news of the possibility of a radical transformation of human consciousness. In Hindu teachings (and sometimes in Buddhism also), this transformation is called <span style="font-style: italic;">enlightenment</span>. In the teachings of Jesus, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">salvation</span>, and in Buddhism, it is <span style="font-style: italic;">the end of sufferings. Liberation</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">awakening</span> are other terms used to describe this transformation.<br><br>The greatest achievement of humanity is not the works of art, science, or technology, but the recognition of its own dysfunction, its own madness. In the distant past, this recognition already came to a few individuals. A man called Gautama Siddhartha, who lived 2,600 years ago in India, was perhaps the first who saw it with absolute clarity. Later, the title <span style="font-style: italic;">Buddha</span> was conferred upon him. Buddha means Â“the awakened one.Â” At about the same time, another of humanityÂ’s early awakened teachers emerged in China. His name was Lao Tzu. He left a record of his teaching in the form of one of the most profound spiritual books ever written, the <span style="font-style: italic;">Tao Te Ching</span>.<br><br>To recognise oneÂ’s own insanity is, of course, the arising of sanity, the beginning of healing and transcendence. A new dimension of consciousness had begun to emerge on the planet, a first tentative flowering. Those rare individuals then spoke to their contemporaries. They spoke of sin, of suffering, of delusion. They said, Â“Look how you live. See what you are doing, the suffering you create.Â” They then pointed to the possibility of awakening from the collective nightmare of Â“normalÂ” human existence. They showed the way.<br><br>The world was not yet ready for them, and yet they were a vital and necessary part of human awakening. Inevitably they were mostly misunderstood by their contemporaries as well as by subsequent generations. Their teachings, though both simple and powerful, became distorted and misinterpreted, in some cases even as they were recorded in writing by their disciples. Over the centuries, many things were added that had nothing to do with the original teachings, but were reflections of a fundamental misunderstanding. Some of the teachers were ridiculed, reviled, or killed; others came to be worshiped as gods. Teachings that pointed the way beyond the dysfunction of the human mind, the way out of the collective insanity, were distorted and became themselves part of the insanity.<br><br>And so religions, to a large extent, became divisive rather than unifying forces. Instead of bringing about an end of violence and hatred through a realisation of the fundamental oneness of all life, they brought more violence and hatred, more divisions between people as well as between different religions and even within the same religion. They became ideologies; belief systems people could identify with and so use them to enhance their false sense of self. Through them, they could make themselves Â“rightÂ” and others Â“wrongÂ” and thus define their identity through their enemies, the Â“others,Â” the Â“nonbelieversÂ” or Â“wrong believersÂ” who not infrequently they saw themselves justified in killing. Man made Â“GodÂ” in his own image. The eternal, the infinite, and unnameable was reduced to a mental idol that you had to believe in and worship as Â“my godÂ” or Â“our god.Â”<br><br>And yetÂ…. And yetÂ… in spite of all the insane deeds perpetrated in the name of religion, the Truth to which they point still shines at their core. It still shines, however dimly, through layers upon layers of distortion and misinterpretation. It is unlikely; however, that you will be able to perceive it there unless you have at least already had glimpses of that Truth within yourself. Throughout history, there have always been rare individuals who experienced a shift in consciousness and so realised within themselves that toward which all religions point. To describe that nonconceptual Truth, they then used the conceptual framework of their own religions.<br><br>Through some of those men and women, Â“schoolsÂ” or movements developed within all major religions that represented not only a rediscovery, but in some cases an intensification of the light of the original teaching. This is how Gnosticism and mysticism came into existence in early and medieval Christianity, Sufism in the Islamic religion, Hasidism and Kabala in Judaism, Advaita Vedanta in Hinduism, Zen and Dzogchen in Buddhism. Most of these schools were iconoclastic. They did away with layers upon layers of deadening conceptualisation and mental belief structures, and for this reason most of them were viewed with suspicion and often hostility by the established religious hierarchies. Unlike mainstream religion, their teachings emphasised realisation and inner transformation. It is through these esoteric schools or movements that the major religions regained the transformative power of the original teachings, although in most cases, only a small minority of people had access to them. Their numbers were never large enough to have any significant impact on the deep collective unconsciousness of the majority. Over time, some of those schools themselves became too rigidly formal or conceptualised to remain effective.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by TheGoodEarth:<br>In a nutshell: There is no beginning and no ending.</blockquote>That's right.<br><br><blockquote>There is existence yet no existence.</blockquote>No, and I didn't say that.<br><br>Emptiness means Empty of the 4 extremes: existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, neither existence nor non existence.<br><br>You cannot say there is existence, yet you also cannot say there is no existence. Both belong to the understanding of eternalist/realist and nihilist. Buddha did not teach these extremes, he taught middle way, and middle way = Emptiness. Empty of all the 4 extremes.<br><br>I need to explain emptiness a bit.<br><br>Why empty of any inherent, separate existence? Because all things are conditioned arising/interdependent origination, completely transient and not even staying for one moment, ungraspable.<br><br>Let's take cloud as an example. As you know cloud is always changing form, and we know that we cannot find any graspable entity, or the 'cloudness' of cloud. Such things simply cannot be found, it is in a constant state of fluctuation, transiency. Or let's say weather. Weather is not an entity that can be found, but is actually a completely random, well not random but 'conditioned' and ever-changing patterns of clouds, wind, rain, lightning, and etc. It is ever changing, empty of any inherent existence or 'thingness'.<br><br>Now, 'Self' is also like that. There is no 'Self' at all apart from the everchanging thoughts, emotions, feelings and perceptions, in other words the 'clouds' of 5 aggregates passing by and ever changing. There is really no self to be found, just as the word 'weather' really does not mean any permanent and findable entity. Since there is no self to be found, there is no separate and permanent Agent such as a Self -- means there is NO Watcher, NO Doer, NO Thinker. There is only watching, doing, and thinking arising moment to moment. This part clear?<br><br>So as you can see, 'clouds', 'weather', and 'self' are empty of inherent existence. In reality ALL phenomena are empty. Not only are they empty of inherent existence, they are also empty of non-existence, neither, and both. Why empty of non-existence, etc? Because if 'cloud', 'weather', 'self' is ultimately not even a findable entity in the first place, <strong>how can they have non existence?</strong> Non-existence is the flip-side of existence, and they always refer to a 'something', but there is really 'no-thing' to be found. Get it?<br><br>HOWEVER, for conventional purpose, for communication, we have to use relative truths and our conceptual models to communicate with others, so we say 'cloud' or 'weather' and 'self'. No problem, like I said, as long as you recognise they are <strong>only relative truths and NOT ultimately true.</strong><br><br><blockquote>There is myself yet noself.</blockquote>No, there is really no self, the notion 'myself' is illusory. In fact I stressed this a lot of times, didn't I say clearly that even 'physical self' and 'metaphysical self' or 'conscious self' and all the kinds of self <strong>are also empty</strong>? There is only completely empty and transient aggregates, the 5 aggregates. No self to be found.<br><br>But we do not have choice but to talk about 'myself', this is just a conventional way to communicate with other people, to understand things conceptually. No problem with this <strong>as long as you do not take it as ultimately True</strong>. The Ultimate Reality is that it is empty.<br><br><blockquote>I am beginning to understand Duality but not Reality.</blockquote>That's because you misunderstand my words. Try to understand the essence of what I am saying, <strong>don't just sweep through the words without understanding.</strong> But if you really don't get it pls ask.<br><br><blockquote>So some kind of  'nature' existed long before Gautama 'discovered' this nature. This is termed the First Buddha. So where did First Buddha come from?<br>Nowhere, it merely existed out of Emptiness!</blockquote>Our Buddha Nature does not come out of Emptiness. It <strong>IS</strong> Emptiness! It is Luminous-Emptiness. It is <strong>Unborn</strong>. Since it is unborn, <strong>you also cannot say it has 'inherent existence'</strong>, yet it has Awareness. <strong>So Buddha Nature is Luminous(Aware)-Emptiness inseparable.</strong> All things are empty, but not just empty otherwise you can't even be here. You are also aware. Everything you touch, hear, see, everything that feels so real including suffering is an expression of intrinsic Luminosity, Awareness. All phenomena are expressions of this Luminous-Emptiness nature, our Buddha Nature.<br><br>Oh and, do you understand the meaning of the word 'nature'? The reason why the word 'nature' is used is to tell you that it's <strong>not an entity or a 'something'. It's more like an intrinsic characteristic. For example, people say 'it's my nature to help the animals', 'he is by nature compassionate'.<br><br>Similarly, Buddha Nature is not a 'thing' or an 'entity', it is the characteristic of Reality, and of all beings. All beings are BY NATURE Buddhas (though they didn't realise it), and ALL phenomena in their essence is also the expression of Buddha Nature. Just like 'Impermanence' is not a thing, but is the nature of all things, get it?</strong> Emptiness and Awareness are not 'things', they are the NATURE of all phenomena.<br><br>I believe this should clear some of your confusion.<br><br><blockquote>There were indeed tortures, atrocities, wars and inhumanities brought about by our desires to find the Source, the Beginning, the God. Often-times, these were the 'works' of the very people in the organisations and hierarchies of religious orders. So sufferings and devastations were brought about in the name of God.

If there is God, would such things happen?<br>And why it is the animals don't do the silly things that human does?</blockquote>Yes I agree... so much ignorance and violence has been attributed to religion and God, supposingly a holy figure but really just a mask for our egos.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elaboration:<br><br><blockquote>Just like 'Impermanence' is not a thing, but is the nature of all things, get it?</blockquote>Since Emptiness, Awareness, Impermanence, are not even a 'thing', but rather is the <strong>nature</strong> and <strong>characteristic</strong>, it doesn't make sense to say things like 'Where does Impermanence come from'? or worse, 'Who created impermanence?' It is silly to ask this way. It just is -- all phenomena is just impermanence, and permanence is just an illusory concept, a cognitive error. Similarly you can't ask 'where does Emptiness or Awareness or Buddha Nature comes from?' It just is!<br><br>It is only our illusions that make up ideas about existence, self, permanence and etc, and obscures our instrinsic luminosity.

This view belongs to a materialistic philosophy which refuses to accept knowledge of mental conditionality. To subscribe to a philosophy of materialism is to understand life only partially. Nihilism ignores the side of life which is concerned with mental conditionality. If one claims that after the passing away or ceasing of a life, it does not come to be again, the continuity of mental conditions is denied. To understand life, we must consider all conditions, both mental and material. When we understand mental and material conditions, we cannot say that there is no life after death and that there is no further becoming after passing away. This nihilist view of existence is considered false because it is based on incomplete understanding of reality. That is why nihilism was also rejected by the Buddha. The teaching of kamma is enough to prove that the Buddha did not teach annihilation after death; Buddhism accepts 'survival' not in the sense of an eternal soul, but in the sense of a renewed becoming...</strong></div>

His parents did not believe in past lives until the evidences are presented to them right in front of their eyes.<br><br>Of course, there are lots more other such cases among westerners.</div>
