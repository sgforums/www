In fact a baby's ability to remember long memories are naturally less than us and therefore most memories will be forgotten. (Do you even still remember what you did when you were 1 year old?) I also remembered the scriptures mentioning several reasons why we lost our past lives memory, though I can't remember exactly what are they now. I think one of them is the pain and struggle the baby experience when entering the world.<br><br>But anyway, lots of people have remembered them again by various ways.<br><br>It is very possible to remember past lives.

And enlightenment. Lots of people have gained enlightenment. All these, liberation, bliss, enlightenment, are not just psychological states, but about insights. You can't get enlightened from psychology, but through practising the Dharma that Buddha taught.</div>

They have very clear and vivid memories of their past lifes, not only one past lives, but many past lives.<br><br>Is it good? I would say, there is not very significant benefits, though sometimes one can understand one's situation better, in the case of Longchen (one of our forummers who had past life memories) who was able to trace happenings back to the karmic cause in a previous life. He was also able to trace from one lifetime to another lifetime, keep tracing backwards, to understand one's karmic tendencies and behaviors better.<br><br>However, it is not very important or necessary... Most important is to gain enlightenment, knowing past lives may help us understand things more, but provides no solution. Only through practising the dharma will we gain in wisdom, and gain liberation.<br><br>Recalling past lives does not lead to liberation, sometimes it leads to greater bondage and attachment. Just live your current life, don't bother too much about past and future. Focus on this life, that's enough. There's the Buddhist saying, if you want to know what you have been doing in your previous lives, look at your situation now.

Similarly, compassion is feeling for <span style="font-style: italic;">others</span>, though at that time there is really no separation between self for others. It is truly feeling for someone elses' sufferings that goes beyond all boundaries.<br><br>(as opposed to Pity, which is still dualistic as one seems to be down here, pitying someone else over there, because one compares him to oneself. therefore this is dualistic)<br><br>Boundary, self, is ultimately empty... but most of the time we focus our attention on ourselves. Our bondange and attachment is strong.</div>

Only until you realise the emptiness of them all, then you reach the source. That's the same method to reach enlightenment as asking 'Where do I come from?' in Zen Koans. You keep thinking and pushing back, where did I come from? my mom, before my mom? my grandmother, before that? my great grand mother (etc). But its beyond all conceptual answers, it is beyond all notions of time... one day you will realise the nature of Emptiness, drop all of them and realise the true source.<br><br>Oh and, only when you attain Buddhahood will you be like Shakyamuni Buddha, who remembers 96 aeons of past lives.</div>

A little difficult..<br><br>Several years ago in the IRC Buddhist chatroom, I had a chat with this guy called 'TheVoice'. Those who was from 'that era' would know him. His experience and understanding of Reality at that time is inclining a bit more to Hindu (the experience of 'I AMness'), but that's besides the point, and I think there might be some truth behind what he said regarding karma.<br><br>[19:01] <p> do the cells in ur body belong to u?<br>[19:01]  The true essence - You are the Divine.<br>[19:01]  all things are you.<br>[19:02]  when you hurt someone- you hurt yourself, that is why karma always exists.<br>[19:02]  in all states of matter and intention .<br>[19:02]  The mind is merely a tool .<br>[19:02]  and an extension of the Supreme Reality .<br><br>Since Reality has no separation between self and others, if you hurt others you get hurt too, because all are actually 'you' in a higher sense.
