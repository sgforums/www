You can use me as an example of someone who benefited from the high-quality exchanges in these forums. I was able to move along because of the willingness to let go of what i already know and explore possiblities afforded by many of these exchanges with expereinced practictioners and mystics.<br><br>True enough, the deeper experiences cannot be 'conceptualised'... but the quality exchanges can entice people with the 'suitable attribute' to progress along the spiritual journey.<br><br>It is true that enlightenment is not for everyone in their current lifetime.

The non-dual mode certainly is more blissful.<br><br>[/quote]<br>Just for sharing:<br><br>Like samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss associated with certain level of concentration; the bliss experienced from insight into our nature differs.<br><br>The happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from that experienced by a practitioner.  Â“I AMnessÂ” is a higher form of happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously chatters.  It is a level of bliss associated with a state of Â‘transcendenceÂ’ Â– a state of bliss resulting from the experience of Â“formlessness, odorless, colorless, attributes and thoughtlessnessÂ’.  No-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct experience of Oneness and no-separation.  It is related to the dropping of the Â‘IÂ’.   When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a form transcendence-oneness.  It is what I called transparency of non-duality.<br><br><blockquote><br><strong>What i have noticed is that from the dualistic mode to the non-dual mode, there is a strong bond(different for different situation). The bond is the attraction to the dualistic perception and the initial pull away from it causes some feeling of unpleasantness.

I called this the bond of 'I'.  It is a quantum leap in perception that the observer is really the observed.  The 'I' does not exist apart from phenomenality.<br><br>However to factor such understanding into different kind of situations requires the loosening of another bond, the bond of 'mine'.  The Â‘bondÂ’ may not be obvious even during hours of naked awareness but surfaces when meeting conditions.  Conditions are the mirror to what that is latently deep in consciousness.  This bond like the bond of Â‘IÂ’ is not known through analysis; it is not about asking Â‘why this and why thatÂ’ but is 'known' through a form of Â‘sensingÂ’ -- sensing with an entire mind and body.  This is more to the primordial mode of Â‘knowing where Â‘sensingÂ’ is in the entire flow of body/mind and conditions of arising; it is knowing on the go. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[quote]<br>Before any non-dual experience, there simply is no way of understanding and comparing the differences. ..as the mind is 100% in dualistic mode.<br>Well said!  We are unable to let go of the Â‘IÂ’ before non-dual experience even though a separate Â‘IÂ’ has always been an illusion because there is no Â‘seeingÂ’.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></strong></div>
