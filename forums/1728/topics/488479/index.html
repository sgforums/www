              <h1>Young Indians, pack up your bags this summer and get off to Manasarovar</h1>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Sat, May 23rd, 2015 New Delhi Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Manasarovar is a
              fresh water lake situated in Burang, western Tibet around 940 kilometres from
              Lhasa ensconced in Himalayas at 4,590 metres above mean sea level. This is a
              relatively high elevation for a large freshwater lake in Tibet Plateau as most
              of the lakes of the region are saline. The Lake is round- shaped with 320
              square kilometres surface area; circumference running to 88 kilometres, depth
              reaching 300 ft. It used to be a part of the Sutlej River basin—the easternmost
              large tributary of the Indus—but disconnected now due to tectonic shift. This
              is the place where Sutlej, Brahmaputra, Indus, and Karnali rivers have their
              headwaters. The holy lake is also known as Mapam Yumco to locals. To the west
              of Manasarovar is another lake Rakshadal —locally known as La Ang Kuo — and
              both are connected by natural Ganga Chhu channel. Manasarovar overflows into
              Rakshastal which is a salt water endorheic lake. The word ‘Manasarovara’, in
              Sanskrit language, is a combination of two words— Manas (mind) and Sarovara (lake)
              implying mind lake. The legend has it that the Lake was created first in the
              mind of the Lord Brahma before its manifestation on Earth.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Lake Manasarovar is
              an important place of pilgrimage for Tibetan Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and
              Bonpas —the native pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. The holy lake, Hindu
              scriptures reveal, is purity personified as devotees who bathe or drink water
              from the lake are believed to be cleansed of all the sins committed over even a
              hundred life times and go to the Abode of Lord Shiva after death. The lake, in
              Hindu religious belief, is supposed to be the summer abode of the Hamsa goose
              considered to be an important sacred element in the symbology of the
              subcontinent, representing wisdom and beauty. Kora- a circumambulation of the
              lake (88 kilometres)- is prescribed by some religion for salvation and one Kora
              takes about 4-5 days Buddhists associate the lake with the legendary Anavatapta
              lake where Queen Maya is believed to have conceived Buddha. The lake has a few
              monasteries on its shores; ancient Chiu Gompa Monastery built on a steep hill
              being the most notable. It looks like being carved right out of the rock. Lord
              Buddha is believed to have stayed and meditated near this lake on several
              occasions. The Lake is also the subject of the meditative Tibetan tradition,
              ‘The Jewel of Tibet’.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Mount Kailash
              located to the North-North West of Manasarovar is considered to be the center
              of the universe and in combination with Manasarovar constitute a pilgrimage
              destination for Buddhist, Hindus and Bonpas who worship the sacred mountain for
              various reasons ,hence the often repeated phrase ‘Kailash Manasarovar Yatra’
              The place is replete with legends most of them pertaining to Buddhist religion.
              Saga Dawai is a great Buddhist festival observed to commemorate Shakyamuni
              Buddha’s Enlightenment also for releasing living things as monks and pilgrims
              flock in thousands to the south face of Mount Kailash. Legend has it that
              Buddha was born, became a Buddha and even died on the 15th day of lunar month.
              Hindus consider the holy mountain as tenth throne of Lord Shiva while Buddhists
              deem it as precious jewel of snow and BonPo— the ancient religion of Tibet
              predating Buddism— regard it as the nine -story Swastika mount which lead to
              heaven.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The pilgrims walk
              and prostrate along the path as Hindus and Buddhists believe that
              circumambulation of Kailash and Astapada on the 52 km stretch cleanses one of
              his sins. Jains revere Kailash- Manasarovar as Rishabananda—the first
              Tirthankara and founder of Jain faith— attained spiritual liberation at Kailash
              heights. Lake Manasarovar’s proximity to the sources of four of the greatest
              rivers of Asia, namely the Brahmaputra, Karnali, Indus and Sutlej makes the
              holy lake an axial point which the pilgrims from India, Nepal, Tibet and
              neighbouring countries have thronged to for thousands of years. Kailash
              Manasarovar belt is a great pilgrimage centre, attracting old faithful of all
              religions be it Buddhists, Hindus, Bonpas. It is also frequented by non
              believers, atheists and nature lovers. Now it is time that Manasarovar enters
              the manas (mind, imagination) of the youth of India and dwells there
              permanently. This holy place our past generations longed to visit is under
              Chinese occupation for over five decades now. Forget politics a, youth should
              be emotionally and culturally integrated with this place. Can the place be
              reclaimed culturally by the youth? Such is the attraction of this idyllic
              Himalayan abode that in social media some say they ‘don’t want to die before
              visiting this place’ whereas others reiterate ‘surely love to do this once in
              my life time’. Those who have visited the place claim that above statements
              are, at their best, understatements.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Get enrolled for a
              visit to Manasarovar this summer. Visit the place which is simply out of this
              world for its sheer natural beauty. If you are religious, better. Following the
              Chinese Invasion of Tibet, the region was closed to foreign pilgrims between
              1959 and 1980. After the 1980s it has again become a part of the Indian pilgrim
              trail. Pilgrimage tours are organized regularly, especially from India, the
              most famous of which is the Kailash Manas Sarovar Yatra which takes place every
              year. Traditionally Indian pilgrims travelled to these two holy places through
              Uttarakhand route which used to be arduous and 22 day long. Recent arrangement
              with China has opened up the route through Nepal which will be of 12 days
              duration and this year will be the first year of the new route. There are
              various packages available by helicopter service ranging from to seven to
              fifteen days. I wish could visit Manasarovar. But alas, with arthritic knee in
              advancing age I cannot do Kara (circumambulation) at this stage of life. Would
              you like to repent 20-30 years down the line, the way I do now. I hope none of
              you does so. Hence the urgency. Hey, whom are you waiting for? Just get up and
              get going. Best of journey.</p>
