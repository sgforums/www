              <p><br>It depends on what you are practicing.<br><br>Shamatha
                                  basically focuses/concentrates and solidifies a single point or object,
                                  resulting in states of absorption/jhanas, whereas insight practice is
                                  aimed at deconstructing the apparent solidity of an object (and Subject) into
                                  impermanent/flickering sensations, empty (of self and phenomena), and
                                  of suffering/unsatisfactory nature -- that is the nature of all our
                                  reality, i.e. our sensate reality, or all phenomena (which includes
                                  thoughts).<br><br>In insight practice, it is also seen that the notion
                                  of a Subject, observer, doer, thinker, etc. that is at the center of
                                  all this, subject to this, sometimes split off from things, sometimes
                                  as the mercy of reality: all that is more sensation that must be seen
                                  as it is, and when this is seen directly and clearly in real-time, that
                                  is awakening.</p>
              <p>In other words, all of our reality are only pure
                                  sensate reality (includes thoughts), i.e. there is only Experience,
                                  without a separate 'passive observer' or 'experiencer'. The feeling of
                                  being a 'passive observer' is simply more transient, empty sensations. These sensations do not make up a Subject, nor are they an object, are just pure sensations.</p>
              <p>There is actually no split between observer and observed. The split is
                                  simply an impression, a persisting illusion that is the cause of
                                  samsara. Awareness is not an observer, is not localized and is
                                  inseparable from the diversity of conditions, hence empty. Awareness is
                                  a point of luminous clarity, e.g. the breathing-sensation is a point of
                                  luminous clarity. All experience are 'points of clarity', are
                                  awareness. All along, everything is already the play of luminous
                                  clarity, but being obsessed with our 'I, me, mine' stories, we miss it,
                                  we filter them out.<br><br>So, when breathing, there is no need to
                                  stand back as a passive observer, simply experience (without standing
                                  back as an observer) moment-to-moment, the minutest detail of the
                                  sensation of the air, whether it is cold or hot, hard or soft, etc, the
                                  entire texture of Awareness as the breathing-sensation is naturally
                                  revealed in clarity in its entirety.<br><br>This clarity can also be
                                  extended to all of our 6 senses, and the four foundations of
                                  mindfulness can be practiced in our daily living as well. But, it is
                                  still important to do sitting meditations. Both sitting + daily living
                                  practice are important. You can start with Mindfulness of Breathing,
                                  and then eventually the other foundations of mindfulness are perfected
                                  as well, and liberation attained. It can also be experienced that
                                  distractions are not as 'solid' as it seem but are just more flickering
                                  sensations/experiences, not-self, not-other-than-self. The evaluations,
                                  likewise, can also be experienced in its true nature as flickering,
                                  empty sensations, if we stop giving our thoughts an excessive sense of
                                  solidity/realness and observe its true nature. Anything that comes up
                                  into your field of experience, simply experience them in their true
                                  nature. Then the grasping, being seen for what it is, subsides in its
                                  own accord effortlessly.</p>
              <p>Consciousness is always in the state of everchangingness according to the various conditions, never stays for a moment. Simply effortlessly/choicelessly experience them as-it-is with no abidance. <strong>No watcher needed, the process itself knows and rolls as Venerable
                                              Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga.</strong><br><br><br>Buddha on Mindfulness of Breathing:<br><br>“Monks.
                                  If mindfulness of respiration is cultivated and made much of, the four
                                  foundations of mindfulness are fulfilled and perfected. If the four
                                  foundations of mindfulness are cultivated and made much of, the seven
                                  factors of enlightenment (bojjhaá¹…ga) are fulfilled and perfected. If
                                  the seven factors of enlightenment are cultivated and made much of,
                                  knowledge (vijjÄ�) and liberation (vimutti) are fulfilled and perfected.”<br><br><br>Happy meditating.<br><br><br>p.s.
                                  As a wise friend of mine said, "...The key point about mindful
                                  awareness is there is no keeping of the mind on anything and by not
                                  resting on anything, it fuses into everything; therefore it cannot be
                                  concentrated; rather it is to relax into nothingness empty of self,
                                  empty of any artificial doing so that the natural luminosity can take
                                  its own course. There is no focusing, there is only allowing the mirror
                                  bright clarity to shine with it natural radiance. In essence there is
                                  no one there, only the phenomenon arising and ceasing telling their
                                  stories."</p>

              <p><br> Last year, Thusness: <em></em></p>
              <p><em>Here the highlight must not only be the empty nature of Â‘soundÂ’
                                      alone, that luminosity as Â‘soundÂ’ must similarly be emphasized.
                                      When we stripped-off the symbolic representation of Â‘birdÂ’,
                                      Â‘chirpingÂ’, Â‘outsideÂ’, Â‘eyes-organÂ’, Â‘ears-organsÂ’, Â‘senate
                                      realityÂ’ and merely experience in bare, this is the meditative
                                      state of intuitively knowing that quality of being luminous in
                                      oneness. Oneness as there is nothing to divide when devoid of these
                                      symbolic layering. The depth of the crystal clarity of that pure
                                      experience Â– Â‘chirpingÂ’ is not what language can convey. The point
                                      here is not to bring about a scientific study on the topic of
                                      qualia but to have a direct feel of the full absorption in the
                                      delight of that clear-luminosity of Â‘soundÂ’. It is the Â‘depth and
                                      degreeÂ’ of absorptive-clarity yet non-staying that is most
                                      important; not the symbolic understand of meanings.</em></p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When I say 'split', it means a very subtle and yet always arising momentum that goes undetected, that momentum which causes us to contract into a separate space-time bound self trapped in this body. It is a constriction into a sense of an individual separate entity, to a body-mind.</p>
              <p>The evidence of this is the obsession and attachment and identification with our mind, our thoughts. We think our thoughts are real, and by believing in our thoughts and our story, that itself is believing in the false 'self'. That is identification with a separate identity. The 'self' lives in the thoughts, the identification, the bond. And because over countless life we have picked up this habit of identification and also what we have learnt since day 1 in this present life, the sense of self is acting most of the time yet gone unnoticed.</p>
              <p>We are in a spell-like state, like a dream. We <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot</span></strong> know that we are in a spell until we are outside the spell, just like
                              we cannot know we are dreaming unless we are already awake. We cannot
                              know that we are imagining something unless we have woken out of the
                              imagination. Lucid dreaming is another matter, and I just spoke
                              recently of my experience of having a lucid nightmare. In lucid dream you are aware that the symbols you experience are your mental projection and you can even manipulate them. But for most of us we mistook our symbols as real entities, but with awareness, we can see through this illusion.</p>
              <p>(This is why in all the traditions enlightenment is known as 'Waking Up', 'Awakening', 'Awakening from the Dream'. It's the hypnotic spell-like dream of separation. 'Enlightenment' wasn't even the word used by Buddha, the word 'enlightenment' is a modern western invention. 'Awakening' was the word used by Buddha.)</p>
              <p>Therefore
                              it is important to meditate, to remain aware and non-symbolic, non-conceptual and let the momentum die
                              down. When we reach that state we can then contrast with our usual
                              dualistic mode of perception. Then we will know what exactly is the sense of self. When we let go of this identification with our dream-like, spell-like imagination, that the thoughts are real and 'mine', that the body is 'mine', that I am so and so and this is my history, a change in perception may occur.</p>
              <p>There can then be an energetic expansion... an oceanic experience and the true face of awareness is revealed and experienced directly. And when the hypnotic bond/identification of our body/mind is dissolved, and the inner-outer division does not take place, awareness is experienced as everything.</p>
              <p>It is a distinct recognition that you are not this body/mind, you are everything, including the text appearing on the screen, the sound of bird chirping, everything in your room is shimmering as consciousness. You will see yourself as everything, instead of perceiving from a separate body/mind. This is NOT (and I stress this because it becomes very dangerous when it becomes another mental conceptual identification) a theoretical understanding, NOT a concept. If you take it as a concept, it is as bad or even worse than identifying with your body/mind.</p>
              <p>Rather, non-dual experience is an experiential, feeling-recognition that there is no separation... it is a recognition that is intensely alive... you know you are everything because there is only everything shimmering without the sense of a separate perceiver. That illusion is gone, either temporarily due to absorption, or due to the awakening of insight (but NOT to be misunderstood as theoretical understanding, but an intuitive seeing)</p>
              <p>Also, you can perfectly understand No-Self, Emptiness conceptually, and yet there is no energetic expansion occuring.
                              For example, like me. I had a rather good conceptual grasping of this
                              subject since some years back, but the understanding doesn't mean I
                              have dissolved my illusion. Also, I had experiences of this non-dual
                              expansion, but duality is still my main predominant mode of perception most of the time.
                              This is also different from the realisation of Anatta as an everpresent
                              characteristic of reality, i.e. dharma seal, experientially.</p>
              <p>When we have this oceanic experience, it is a glimpse of your Buddha Nature. But then again, such experiences may be misunderstood (as I AM)... hence a correct understanding of Anatta and Emptiness is important as an antidote.</p>

              <p>This is a very old conversation with Thusness, that time I was 14 years old. That conversation took place in January 2005. It shows how deep the belief in symbols, and self, can cause so much suffering.</p>
              <p>My understanding was still amateurish at that time. Now looking back, I can understand a little better.</p>

              <p>Just practice dropping everything first... there is no need to focus on a particular point but if it helps you can do so. Otherwise you can just relax and let go of everything yet remaining aware, then after that continue doing your insight practice...</p>
              <p>Regarding intention to open eyes or end meditation, that is an impulse and a thought. An impulse is a thought. Just don't follow the thought, don't react to content, to projections of the mind, to symbols. Let them subside in its own accord. Continue dropping and practice strong mindfulness so that every single transitory experience does not go unnoticed. Whether thoughtless or thoughtful, practice the mindful presence.</p>

                          appearance is really the source, what gives rise to the diversities of
                          appearances? “Sweetness” of sugar isn’t the “blueness” color of the
                          sky. Same applies to “AMness”… all are equally pure, no one state is
                          purer than the other, only condition differs. Conditions are factors
                          that give appearances their ‘forms’. In Buddhism, pristine awareness
                          and conditions are inseparable...</span></p>

                          <p>An elaboration on Emptiness/Dependent Origination:</p>
                          <p><br><span style="font-family: arial;">...Like a red flower that is so
                          vivid, clear and right in front of an observer, the “redness” only
                          appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of
                          red does not arise in all animal species (dogs cannot perceive colours)
                          nor is the “redness” an attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum
                          eyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no
                          attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost complete space/void
                          with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are
                          dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or
                          fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet
                          empty, mere Appearances without inherent/objective existence. What
                          gives rise to the differences of colours and experiences in each of us?
                          Dependent arising... hence empty of inherent existence. This is the
                          nature of all phenomena.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">As you've seen, there is no ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">'The Flowerness'</span>’
                          seen by a dog, an insect or us, or beings from other realms (which
                          really may have a completely different mode of perception). ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">'The Flowerness'</span> is an illusion that does not stay even for a moment, merely an
                          aggregate of causes and conditions. Analogous to the example of
                          ‘flowerness’, there is no ‘selfness’ serving as a background witnessing
                          either -- pristine awareness is not the witnessing background. Rather,
                          the entire whole of the moment of manifestation is our pristine
                          awareness; lucidly clear, yet empty of inherent existence. This the way
                          of ‘seeing’ the one as many, the observer and the observed are one and
                          the same. This is also the meaning of formlessness and attribute-less
                          of our nature....</span></p>

                          <p class="style4">This article describes a spiritual insight. It may be quite hard to understand.</p>
                          <p class="style4">The
                          things that we experience are registered by all the sense organs. The
                          eye sight registers vision, the ears register sound, the body registers
                          sensations. These perception, sensations and experiences are not
                          happening in some places. They are the experience of the arising of
                          certain conditions. There is no solidity and physicality in the actual
                          experience.</p>

                          <td align="left" valign="top">
                          <p class="style4">What
                          we experienced is not universal and common to all. Here's an example to
                          illustrate that: We know that as human beings, we see in term of
                          colours. Some animals are however colour-blind, thus they see
                          differently from us. But none of us, is really seeing the truth nature
                          directly. The senses of different species of sentient beings experience
                          things differently. So who is seeing the real image of an object? None.</p>
                          <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Likewise,
                          the various planes of existence are due to different conditions
                          arising. In certain types of meditation, one is said to be able to
                          access these planes of existence. This is because they are not specific
                          locations. They are mental states and are thus non-localised. In these
                          meditations, our consciousness changes and 'aligned' more with these
                          other states or planes of existence.</p>
                          <p class="style4" style="margin-bottom: 0in;">All
                          the planes of existence are simultaneously manifesting, but because our
                          senses are human-based conditioned arisings, we only see the human
                          world and other beings that shared 'similar' resonating arising
                          conditions. But nevertheless, the other planes of existences are not
                          elsewhere in some other places.</p>

                          solidity whatsoever. Even our touch sense is just that. The touch sense
                          gives an impression of feeling something that is physical and
                          three-dimensional. But there is really no solid self-existing object
                          there. Instead, it is simply the sensation that gives the impression of
                          physical solidity and form.</p>

              <p>Bill Harris with Byron Katie:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BK: Yes, it was impossible to see anything the same<br>way because I didn’t know what anything was and<br>you know, I had no reference for anything and when I<br>opened my eyes, it was amazing. It was like something<br>else looking out of these holes and this apparent being<br>and I would maybe look out the window and my mind<br>would say, “Sky,” but I couldn’t velcro to it. I couldn’t<br>believe it. I wasn’t able to hold it. It may as well... It is<br>like someone looking at the sky and calling it a tree. It<br>was chaos and none of it real and I began to laugh as I<br>saw that the mind, the moment that mind hit my head,<br>a world, absolutely, was produced, but then people<br>would say, for example, they would say, “Katie, how<br>are you?” And I’d have to look around to see who they<br>were talking to and they taught me my name was Katie,<br>you know, Byron Kathleen Mitchel, now, that’s my<br>birth certificate, Byron Kathleen Reed and actually, my<br>family came to get me and they told me my husband<br>and children were coming and I had no idea that I was<br>even married or had children. Nothing, but my mind<br>was such a yes! It was just so in love with everything<br>that a man and three grown people, you know, came<br>to get me and that’s how I knew I had a home. They<br>told me they were taking me home and it was just, it<br>was marvelous! You know? And learning the name<br>of everything and referencing, you know, learning<br>references and it is not as thought I had amnesia,<br>you know, I can like, talking to you right now, Bill...<br>If someone said, “What is your name?” I would say,<br>“Katie.” And I would say, you know, inside of my head,<br>“Just don’t ask me if I believe it or not.” So, nothing<br>has changed from that first instant of this amazing,<br>unlimited, infinite being.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>BK: So, if I believe something, I have to see it because<br>it’s impossible to see what we can’t believe. For<br>example, if I am a child and my parents continue to<br>tell me this is a tree, this is a tree, this is a tree, that’s<br>a tree, this is a tree. It doesn’t make it a tree to me.<br>I’m not separate, words don’t have meaning. It means<br>nothing except to them, but it doesn’t affect me until<br>there is that moment that I attached, you know, I<br>attach like that word to reality, a false reality, and in<br>that moment, I am separate. There is the tree and me.</p>
              <p><br>BH: Because, tree is just a noise that represents a tree,<br>but it isn’t the tree. It’s just a representation.</p>
              <p><br>BK: I can’t see a tree until I believe it. We cannot see<br>what we don’t believe.</p>
              <p><br>BH: Well, you know what is interesting, you know,<br>with a little tiny child, they will point at a bunch of<br>stuff on the wall, a bunch of just, a mess on the wall<br>and say, “What’s that mommy?” Or, “What’s that<br>daddy?” And it isn’t anything that an adult has a name<br>for. It is just a bunch of marks on the wall and it’s<br>a disconcerting moment for the adult because they<br>are looking at that and the child is trying to attach a<br>name to it and there is no name for it. I heard Alan<br>Watts talking about this once and I thought that was a<br>perceptive thing for him to have brought up that there<br>are many things in the world that have no name and a<br>child already at two-years-old or three-years-old has<br>bought into this idea that they have got to attach a<br>label to this and then start mistaking the labels for the<br>things themselves.</p>
              <p><br>BK: Yeah, or we buy in that we have to name<br>everything for the children and of course, it does have a<br>name. It’s a mark on the wall. So, we have two names<br>there. We have mark and then wall and, you know,<br>names for things. So that’s separating out of the whole<br>and it’s how the mind, it is how the mind... It mirrors a<br>reality that is false.</p>
              <p><br>BH: Right...</p>

              <p>My comments:</p>
              <p>The moment you believe that what you see in front is a tree, an object, you have unconsicously separated yourself, and deadened something tremendously alive into an image... a symbol, and we believe and grasp on it. This is the split. The mind's power at categorising what belongs to me and what doesn't, and objectifying and solidifying what is seen and experienced, it's all the spell-like mind conditioning... and hence we miss the actuality that is everpresent and a seamless whole.</p>
              <p>But if you can drop the symbol there can be the amazing realisation that everything is expression of you, i.e. consciousness. There is no separation.</p>
