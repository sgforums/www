              became a Buddhist nun and helped spread feminism in Sri Lanka</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Vinod Moonesinghe 10
              September Scroll.in</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Miranda
              Maria Banta later adopted the Bahaii faith, and died a Hindu. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              March 1896, in the San Francisco suburb of Oakland, the Sri Lankan Buddhist
              revivalist and missionary Hewavitarne Dharmapala, on a lecture tour of the
              United States, met Countess Canavarro. Seeking spiritual sustenance, she struck
              him as determined and forceful. According to Tessa Bartholomeusz, four months
              after meeting her, Dharmapala proposed that she travel to Sri Lanka and
              establish an order of Buddhist “nuns”, and become full-time principal of the
              island’s first Buddhist girls’ high school, Sanghamitta, named for the first
              female Buddhist missionary to Sri Lanka.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              the evening of August 30, 1897, at the New Century Hall on New York’s Fifth
              Avenue, Dharmapala administered to the Countess Canavarro the five Buddhist
              precepts (pansil), making her the first female convert to Buddhism on American
              soil. Thus, she became the first in a new order of “Buddhist nuns” which
              Dharmapala wanted to create in Sri Lanka, some seven centuries after female
              ordination died out. She took on the enormously significant religious moniker
              “Sister Sanghamitta”, recalling the ancient missionary, as well as the school
              she intended to run.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to Thomas A Tweed, the Countess, by the very act of conversion, caused a huge
              stir. In the rigidly Christian atmosphere of fin de siecle America, adopting
              another religion simply was not done. Although almost forgotten in the US, in
              her day, she made a considerable impact on the spread of Buddhism, Bahaism,
              Hinduism, and esoterica in general.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Her
              effect on Sri Lanka, despite her short stay of three years, has been much
              greater. Her school still exists as Sri Sanghamitta Balika Vidyalaya, Punchi
              Borella, an offshoot of the co-educational Mahabodhi vernacular school
              resurrected by Dharmapala at Foster Lane. Her imaginings of what a Buddhist nun
              should be have had their effect on the order of Dasa Sil Mathas, even their
              attire being based on her original design.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sanghamitta Convent</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sanghamitta
              Girls’ School had a short but chequered history. Founded by the Women’s
              Education Society in 1891, its first principal, an Australian woman called Kate
              Pickett, drowned. Louisa Roberts, a local teacher, acted as a stop-gap until
              Marie Musaeus Higgins, a German-American, arrived. In 1893, the latter broke
              away and started her own school, Musaeus College. Thereafter, Kate Pickett’s
              mother, Elise, served as school director, returning to Australia just before
              the Countess arrived.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dharmapala
              and the Countess wanted to establish Sanghamitta on the lines of a Roman
              Catholic convent school, with Buddhist nuns teaching the girls. Accordingly,
              the school was relocated from its existing location, Tichbourne Hall, and moved
              to the same location as the “convent” – the Sanghamitta Upasikaramaya.
              Dharmapala and the Countess decided on Gunter House, a single-storey building
              set amidst a hectare of gardens in Darley Lane (now Foster Lane), which the
              Maha Bodhi Society bought for 25,000 Sri Lankan rupees (30 million in today’s
              currency).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              convent, school, and an orphanage were soon up and running, large crowds
              attending the opening. There was no shortage of pupils for the school. The
              Countess, who styled herself as Mother Superior, came to be known by the
              children as Nona Amma (or Madam mother). Sister Dhammadinna (a Burgher woman
              called Sybil LaBrooy) managed the household, and several Sinhalese “nuns”
              completed the staff.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              mid-1898, Catherine Shearer, a nurse from Boston’s Eliot Hospital, joined her,
              becoming “Head Sister” Padmavatie. However, the two did not get along. The
              Countess expected Shearer to run things for her, while she busied herself with
              Mahabodhi Society work.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              friction between them betokened a deeper difference in attitudes. According to
              Bartholomeusz, the Countess considered Shearer “a dreamer”, but herself
              remained ignorant of the discipline expected from a Buddhist nun. Much against
              his will, she accompanied Dharmapala to Kolkata and appears, at some point, to
              have tried to seduce him. Finally, she removed herself from Gunther House and
              set up a convent on her own. This not only proved unsuccessful but also doomed
              the Sanghamitta Convent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Countess Canavarro</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              an infant, Miranda Maria Banta, born in 1849 in East Texas, accompanied her
              mother to California. At 17, she married post master, insurance agent and
              scalp-hunter Samuel Cleghorn Bates, having four children by him. Bartholomeusz
              thinks he may have been an abusive husband, leading her to leave him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">She
              probably met Lieutenant António de Souza Canavarro, scion of a noble family, on
              his way to become the Portuguese consul general in Hawaii – then an independent
              country – in August 1882. By November the next year, she styled herself
              “Miranda A de Souza Canavarro”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              figure in West Coast high society, her conversion to Buddhism attracted
              considerable publicity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              the obscure Gazette Appeal of Marion County, Georgia, reported it:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“This
              convert, whose purpose is to devote years of labor in the far east to uplift
              her sex, is the Countess M. De Canavarro, an American, formerly of San
              Francisco, who, to follow her chosen life surrenders, as the officiating priest
              announced, family, fortune, and title.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Years
              later, the whiff of scandal remained. The Iowa-based newspaper Adair County
              Democrat claimed Dharmapala had hypnotised her and prevailed upon her to desert
              her family.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Companionate marriage</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              November 1900, after the Sanghamitta Convent debacle, the Countess returned to
              the US, moving to the East Coast. She lectured on Buddhism and the Orient in
              general, and several of her lectures were published.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Soon
              after, she entered a companionate marriage with a fellow Theosophist, Myron H
              Phelps, a patent lawyer. The couple travelled to Sri Lanka posing as brother
              and sister. However, she continued describing herself as a Buddhist “nun”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              December 1902, the Countess accompanied Phelps to Akka in Palestine, to meet
              Abbas Effendi, the Bahai leader. The Countess interviewed Abbas’ sister Behiah
              Khanum, who provided the biographical material which went into Phelps’ book
              Life and Teachings of Abbas Effendi. In late 1903, still bearing the name
              “Sister Sanghamitta”, she declared her acceptance of the Bahai faith.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Two
              years later, she and Phelps were to play host to the influential Hindu
              revivalist and moderniser Ponnambalam Ramanathan and his Australian secretary,
              Lillie Harrison, who would later become Ramanathan’s wife and take on the name
              Leelawathy. Ramanathan’s intellectual view of Hinduism attracted Phelps: by
              1908, he would see himself as a Hindu.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Phelps
              left the Countess, journeying to India to join the independence movement.
              Almost bankrupt, she moved to a farm in Blackstone, Virginia, in a
              compassionate marriage with Deuel Sperry, the longest-lasting of her
              relationships. She continued to lecture, but concentrated on writing: she
              produced several novels and the autobiographical Insight into the Far East.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1922, she moved back to Hawaii, settling later in the Los Angeles suburb of
              Glendale, from where she would travel to the Ananda Ashrama, founded by Swami
              Paramananda in nearby La Crescenta. For, in the last phase of her life, she
              adopted Vedanta Hinduism. She passed away in Glendale on July 25, 1933.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Countess’ Legacy</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Her
              legacy affected not only the future of Eastern religion in the United States,
              but also the development of Buddhism, which had already arrived in the country
              along with the Chinese who flooded into California with the 1849 Gold Rush. The
              Countess represented a different type of Buddhist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              more profoundly, her example affected the way in which Sri Lankan society
              looked at women. Hitherto, crushed by Victorian values, the female gender were
              considered nothing more than sexual playthings or baby-making machines.
              According to Bartholomeusz:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              Countess and her ‘sisters’, by choosing to become world-renouncers, challenged
              the stereotype of the pious Buddhist woman as wife and mother; they helped to
              make renunciation a respectable choice for Buddhist women in Ceylon.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
              the Buddha’s teaching enhancing the position of women, stressing the ability of
              women to achieve enlightenment and the existence of female arhants, later
              accretions to the canon made out that the feminine body proved a barrier to
              understanding the Dhamma. The Sri Lankan Buddhist tradition had, for seven
              centuries, lacked a female branch of the Sangha. This reinforced the idea of
              women being mentally inferior to their male counterparts, which became dogma.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Countess
              Canavarro, by resurrecting the image of the Buddhist woman seeking
              enlightenment, demonstrated the intellectual equality of genders and overthrew
              this perspective. Her action proved vital to the development of feminism on
              this island.</span></p>
