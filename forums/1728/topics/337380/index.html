              <p>Hi, first of all I'm glad you're taking an interest in Buddhism and also to have a repentant heart for mistakes you have made.</p>
              <p>You can read about repentance here: <span><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no2c.htm">Repentance 
                                is a Demonstration of Wisdom</a></span></p>
              <p>You can repent to the Buddha for anything done out of greed, hatred and ignorance, and what is most important is your sincerity.</p>

              <p><br>Dear Skedaddle ,what AEN mentioned is very subtle ..on a higher level the Repentance should be very educational and all-rounded</p>

              <p>on the other hand ... beside repenting .. you should make up to her for your actions</p>
              <p>like maybe help her in ways you can ..</p>
              <p>maintaining friendship is a art .. you need constantly to remind yourself of the dos and dont in a friendship</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is spell out in buddhism sigalovada sutta on friends relationship</p>
