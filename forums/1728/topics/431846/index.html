              <p>Yeah, that is what I understand. Earth Store Bodhisattva's vow "åœ°ç‹±ä¸�ç©ºï¼Œèª“ä¸�æˆ�ä½›ï¼Œä¼—ç”Ÿåº¦å°½ï¼Œæ–¹è¯�è�©æ��“ã€‚Just my opinion, I think it should be possible but takes a long long time. Hell is only 1 of the 6 path. May be I'm wrong, I really don't know.</p>
              <p>You are very compassionate. Very few people I know have thought of what you thought. I've only thought of doing my best to free as many people from ignorance in this life time and hope there will be no next life on this earth. My friends who were previously from other dharma doors switch to Pureland because they also do not want to be reborn again.</p>

              <p>generate bodhicitta often, it's a wonderful feeling. :) suddenly realising some special insight is also a wonderful feeling.</p>
              <p>when our three thousand great thousand world is coming to an end, yes, hell is going to be empty first, then follow by spirit, animal, human up to the 3rd jhana heaven.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>After the Existence Kalpa, the Destruction Kalpa begins. Within this Destruction Kalpa, there are also 20 small kalpas. During the 19th small kalpa, sentient beings in every world, including the earth world, of the Three Thousand Great Chilocosm will be the first to be destroyed. Then, through aeons of kalpas, as a result of the efforts of many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions in the Three Periods (past, present and future) to enlighten sentient beings, all sentient beings learn to change their wicked ways and lead virtuous lives instead. When many sentient beings transmigrate from the six realms of existence into the human realm and successfully received the guidance, and when hell has emptied so that there isn't a single sentient being left there, then the 20th small kalpa of the Destruction Kalpa starts. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva () vowed: "As long as hell is not empty, I shall not become Buddha. Only when all sentient beings are guided and saved, will I attain supreme enlightenment." One can thus see that the great vow of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva can be accomplished. All sentient beings can be guided and saved, and he will then attain Buddhahood.<br><br>Before the 19th small kalpa, all the sentient beings that are above the 1st Jhana [1] , and in all the worlds from the 1st Jhana down to the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering, will transmigrate, each according to his own good karmic seeds of the past. Some will transmigrate above the 2nd Jhana; some will surpass Three Fields of Existence (World of Desires, World of Forms, and World of Formless); and others will arrive at Pure Lands of Buddhas elsewhere. At this time, the world of sentient beings will be totally ruined. Only then, at the end of the final phase of the last small kalpa, will the "Three Great Calamities" occur, destroying all the material worlds. These three calamities of fire, water and wind will not occur simultaneously, but each will take its turn. At that time, balance in space will be lost, planets of all the worlds will leave their orbits, and looking from the earth, one will see seven suns appear in the sky at the same time. The suns' fiery heat will burn up all the worlds. The destruction will reach the farthest depths of the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering, including all the worlds of the Three Thousand Great Chilocosm World of Desires, and even the 1st Jhana of the World of Forms.<br><br>After the passing of the "Great Fire Calamity" comes the "Great Water Calamity". The worlds from the 2nd Jhana Plane in the World of Form down through the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering will be engulfed by floodwaters.<br><br>Next, the Great Wind Calamity follows. All the worlds below the 3rd Jhana down to the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering will be blown away like dust. All the materials will be dispersed into oblivion.</p>

              <p>this is just our single three thousand great world. hell beings who's "sentences" are way more than the time span of a single three thousand great world are transmigrated to other world system's hell realm. and there are countless other world systems out there.</p>
              <p>that mean still got hell in other world system even though our's are empty.</p>
              <p>when Guan Yin take over Western Pureland, sentient beings will suffer less where there's no dark period of no dharma. and when Great Strength bodhisattva take over, beings will be even better. i cannot imagine how better. beings without ignorance, without hell realm? will see. :)  </p>
              <p>but all and all is going to be better and better in the "end". :)</p>
