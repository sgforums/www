              <p>(excerpts from chapter 1 of 'the most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss')</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>EGO: ego is the thought I. <br>The ego is the I-thought. <br>“I am happy”, “I am sad”, “I did this”, “I did that”. There are so many
                              sentences that are thought of with the word I in them. That thought “I”
                              in each of those sentences is the ego. <br>The ego is the idea of a separate, individual identity. <br>The ego identifies with the body and with thought, and calls the body
                              and thought “I”. <br>The ego is thought. <br>The ego is thinking.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>You know that thoughts are not part of your true nature because you had
                                              to learn them. <br>That is why you cannot speak, write and think fluently in languages, because
                                              you have not learned, or brought in those languages from the outside.
                                          <br>You can observe that same process in an infant. <br>You can see that an infant is aware before it learns any language. <br>You can observe the child growing older and learning a language. <br>You can observe when the child learns the word I and when the child begins
                                              to say the word “I”. <br>Being able to see how the imposter arose in you and how the imposter arises
                                              in every human infant and child are very important tools. <br>The reason they are very important tools is because you do not have to
                                              rely totally upon those who have ended the imposter and who have awakened
                                              from the human dream to tell you that the ego is something acquired and
                                              not natural and is an imposter. <br>You can observe this for yourself.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>Thought pretends to be the Self. <br>Thought is not the Self. <br>Thought is an imposter. <br>Thought believes that it is a real entity and that it is a real self.
                                          <br>Thought is not a real entity and thought is not a self. <br>Living from thought instead of living from Awareness is the cause of all
                                              human suffering. <br>The imposter is the cause of all human problems, sorrow and suffering.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>Because the ego believes it is a real entity, the ego is afraid of ending.
                                          <br>The ego controls all thinking. <br>Because the ego is afraid of ending and controls all thinking, the ego
                                              directs thought in ways that will preserve its imaginary self so that
                                              its imaginary self is not brought to an end. <br>The purpose of the teachings in this book is to bring the imposter to
                                              an end so that what remains is only the true Self whose nature is: infinite-eternal-awareness-bliss-love.
                                          <br>When the imposter ends, all suffering and sorrow also end. <br>Thinking that thinking or thought is your self is a delusion, a dream-like
                                              illusion. <br>Thinking that you are a body living in a world is a delusion, a dream-like
                                              illusion. <br>Thought has created those delusions. <br>All sorrow, suffering and delusions have one single root. <br>The single root is thought. <br>The root of thought is the I thought. <br>The root of thought is the thought I. <br>Thought is not part of your true nature. Thought is something you learned.
                                          <br>Do not let something you acquired pretend to be your self.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>In humans the virus is called the ego or the I thought. <br>The I thought (ego) is an imposter pretending to be the Self. <br>The ego is the cause of all human sorrow and suffering. <br>The ego is the cause of all disease, death, war, fear, anger and violence.
                              <br>Human beings have made almost no inward progress for thousands of years
                                  toward ending suffering, sorrow, war, fear, anger, violence and lying.
                              <br>Thousands of years ago humans had suffering, sorrow, war, fear, anger,
                                  violence and lying. <br>Today humans have suffering, sorrow, war, fear, anger, violence and lying.
                              <br>What has kept humans in the same pool of inward unsolved problems? <br>The ego (the imposter) has kept humans in the same pool of inward unsolved
                                  problems. <br>Inward problems cannot be solved by looking outward. <br>Inward problems can only be solved by looking inward. <br>The ego knows that if the attention is turned inward, the ego will be
                                  found to be a myth, an imposter, an illusion. <br>Therefore, due to the ego’s fear of ending, the ego keeps the attention
                                  directed outward. <br>Even when there is an attempt to turn the attention inward, usually due
                                  to not understanding the meaning of looking inward, people are still looking
                                  outward. <br>Humans are slaves to an imposter “self”. <br>Exposing the strategies of that imposter “self”, how to put an end to
                                  those strategies, how to bring the imposter “self” to an end, thus ending
                                  all suffering and sorrow and remaining in the true Self whose nature is
                                  infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss are the primary purposes of this
                                  book.</p>

              <div class="width80">The ego controls all thinking. <br>The ego can create an argument against anything. <br>Therefore, reserve all arguments against what is being presented here
                                                  until you have read the book at least three times. <br>Otherwise, the ego will generate arguments against any anti-ego presentation,
                                                  thus blocking what is being presented. <br>See the vicious circle: <br>The ego in its attempts to block the ego from being exposed for the imposter
                                                  that it is, and to block the realization that the ego is the cause of
                                                  all human sorrow and suffering, creates arguments against what is being
                                                  revealed in this book. <br>Because the ego sets the standards for the debate, the ego always wins
                                                  the debate. <br>The way to break that vicious circle is to delay all arguments against
                                                  what is being presented here until you have read the book very slowly
                                                  at least three times. <br>When the ego forms an argument against what is being presented in this
                                                  book, see the argument as an ego preservation strategy and ignore it,
                                                  delaying all argument until the presentation is complete. <br>Having the motivation to understand, instead of to argue, will help to
                                                  produce an insight into what is being presented here. <br>Put the arguments on hold until you have read the book at least three
                                                  times. <br>By that time you may be so skilled at recognizing the ego’s preservation
                                                  strategies, you may decide to delay the arguments forever.</div>

                                                  ideas, beliefs, and opinions are the ego’s primary tools to preserve the

                                                  people ends the ego illusion, why did the other nine hundred ninety-nine
                                                  thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine miss the opportunity? <br>The reason the other nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and
                                                  ninety-nine missed the opportunity is because of the ego’s fear of ending.
                                              <br>Due to the ego’s fear of ending, the ego creates strategies to preserve
                                                  its imaginary self. </strong><br>Distorting the teachings is one of the many strategies the ego has to
                                                  preserve its imaginary self. <br>That applies to the teachings in the book you are now reading and to other
                                                  spiritual teachings. <br>Right from the beginning, the ego’s preservation strategies have to be
                                                  dealt with, otherwise the ego would block out what is being presented
                                                  here in this book. <br>Then, instead of being an extraordinary journey, this would be just one
                                                  more failed attempt. <br>The ego’s preservation strategies can be brought to an end and we will
                                                  look at how to do that in this book. <br>Usually any mention of exposing the ego’s preservation strategies makes
                                                  the ego run the other way. <br>To be willing to look at the ego’s preservation strategies is a sign of
                                                  spiritual maturity. <br>Most people are not willing to look at the ego’s preservation strategies.
                                              <br>Reading a book that reveals some of the ego’s preservation strategies
                                                  does not make one immune to them. <br>One of the ego’s preservation strategies is the thought “This does not
                                                  apply to me”. <br>The ego is very tricky and deceptive in all humans. The ego is a liar
                                                  in all humans. The ego lies to its imaginary self. <strong><br>Therefore, when something is pointed out in this book and you think “This
                                                  does not apply to me”, take a second look. <br>Maybe it does apply to you and the ego is blocking that fact out, as a
                                                  preservation strategy. </strong><br>Challenge the thought “This does not apply to me”. <br>The thought “This does not apply to me” may be an ego preservation strategy.
                                              <br>One of the differences between the one out of a million who awakens and

                                                  not, is the ability to stay focused on an essential point until it becomes
                                                  an insight and a tool that you can use. <br>The fact that the intellect understands what is written here is not enough.
                                              <br>The book you are now reading is filled with the insights that lay the
                                                  foundation to be the one who awakens and not one of the nine hundred ninety
                                                  nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine who miss. <br>Dwell on what is written in every sentence in every chapter until an insight
                                                  is awakened that becomes a tool you can use. <br>To awaken insight, don’t read what is written like you were reading a
                                                  newspaper or a book of trivia, and don’t read for the purpose of gathering
                                                  information. <br>To awaken insight, read as though you were reading instructions about
                                                  how to fly that are vital so that you do not crash. <br>Slowly reflect on each line. <br>That is why the sentences are often separated with a space between them,
                                                  to encourage you to slowly reflect on them and not to be in a hurry to
                                                  get to the next sentence. <br>Continue to read and re-read long after the intellect has understood the
                                                  meaning of the words. <br>Reading very, very slowly is insight reading. <strong><br>Read very, very slowly. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>The ego is like an inchworm that lets go of one thought only when it has
                                                  grabbed hold of the next thought. <br>Therefore, when re-reading every chapter over and over, don’t be in a
                                                  hurry to proceed to the next sentence. <br>It is important to understand the difference between insight and intellectual
                                                  understanding. <br>Never confuse intellectual understanding with insight. </span></strong><br>Intellectual understanding, which is to understand the words, is good
                                                  as a first step. <br>However, after one has understood the words, if one then goes on to another
                                                  concept before the insight has been awakened, the words will become obstacles
                                                  and hindrances to ending the ego instead of tools that end the ego. <br>Intellectual “understanding”, an intellectual appetite and an intellectual
                                                  approach to “spirituality” are what characterize the nine hundred ninety-nine

              <p>Thanks for the interesting article. It really contain many useful insights.</p>
              <p>Just a sharing...</p>
              <p>The author say that thought is a problem. It may not be entirely accurate.</p>
              <p>IMO, when visual vision and thought imagery arise, there is a tendency to compartmentalise certain sections as entities, focus or objects. Next, there is a desire to modify that section. For example, in the visual sense, from the environment you are engaging a conversation with someone. The mind desires to change the 'person' into what it imagines will be the desired outcome. Example, you want to make the person think the way you think and so on so forth. The mind fails to see that this is 'hit and miss' and that the changes is really not dependent on the desire to modify the subject. Rather, it has got to do with the 'person' own willing or not.</p>
              <p>So... to me, thought is the not the problem. Instead, the desire to modify and change 'what is' is the cause of suffering.</p>
              <p>Also, when we say that we are not the thoughts or the body, unconsciously we have separated 'phemonena' from a 'untouchable' portion of ourself.</p>
              <p>The difference at the non-duality stage is that, no attempt is made... Sensations are left as they are...</p>
              <p>At the I AM/eternal witness stage, there is a seeking for the place beyond thoughts.</p>
              <p>Also, at the I AM/eternal witness, no-suffering is preferred over suffering. There is no understanding that there is really NO blissful place that is beyond pain. When there is pain, there is nothing beyond it too.</p>
              <p>So at the I AM/eternal witness stage, attempts may be employed by the mind to get rid of the pain... to go a place beyond the pain. The understanding  that 'sensation and pain' is inseparable from Presence/Buddha Nature is not there yet.</p>

              <p><br>Thought is not a means to discover the absolute Truth. <br>The ego has convinced almost all humans and almost all spiritual aspirants
                                  that thought is a means to know the absolute Truth. <br>There are those people who think they already know that thought is not
                                  a means to know the absolute Truth. <br>Almost all of those people are still trying to use thought as a means
                                  to know the absolute Truth. <br>That means that they do not really know that thought is not a means to
                                  know the absolute Truth. <br>They have confused knowing-insight-awareness with conceptual “knowing”.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>For those few individuals who are seriously intent on liberation, it is
                                  essential to stop using thought as a means to know the absolute Truth.
                              <br>It is also essential to stop believing your own thoughts. <br>Understanding the nature of beliefs can help one to see that thought is
                                  not a means to know the absolute Truth. <br>Seeing that thought is not a means to know the absolute Truth is the way
                                  to stop using thought as a means to know the absolute Truth. <br>There is a method you can try that reveals that thought is not a means
                                  to know the absolute Truth. <br>We can call it the “How Do You Know Method”. <br>Here are the instructions for the How Do You Know Method: <br>Look at any belief you have. <br>Ask of that belief “How do I know absolutely for sure that is true?”.
                              <br>The mind will give an answer. <br>To the answer the mind gives ask “How do I know absolutely for sure that
                                  is true?”.<strong> <br>Every time the mind gives an answer, question the answer, by repeating
                                  the question “How do I know absolutely for sure that is true?”. <br>You must be willing to question every answer the mind gives for the process
                                  to work. <br>If you are willing to question every answer the mind gives to the question
                                  “How do I know absolutely for sure that is true?”, the inquiry will always
                                  end in “I don’t know absolutely for sure that is true”. </strong><br>The How Do You Know Method is an excellent way to see the difference between
                                  believing and knowing. <br>The How Do You Know Method is also an excellent way to see that thought
                                  is not a means to know the absolute Truth. <br>After questioning a few hundred beliefs, it should be quite clear that
                                  thought is not a means to know the absolute Truth. <br>Thought is like a great pretense or house of cards. <br>One idea is supported by another idea. <br>The How Do You Know Method is a way to see that when you trace each idea
                                  back, you find that there is actually no real foundation at all. <br>There is another way to see that thought is not a way to know the absolute
                                  Truth, understand the nature of belief and concepts, see how belief is
                                  formed and how the ego creates ideas that will serve to preserve its imaginary
                                  self. <br>We can call this the “Arguing Both Sides Method”. <br>The Arguing Both Sides Method is to look at some belief you have, maybe
                                  one of the current issues of the day. <br>Write an argument for the side of the belief you are on. <br>In other words, take a belief you have and write up all the proofs, arguments,
                                  evidence and reasons you have for that belief. <br>Next, pretend that you have the opposite belief and write up all the proofs,
                                  arguments, evidence and reasons you have for that opposite belief. <br>The purpose of the Arguing Both Sides Method is to demonstrate that thought
                                  can create reasons, evidence and support for any belief. <br>Seeing that thought can create evidence and reasons to support any belief
                                  is a very powerful key. <strong><br>The Arguing Both Sides Method is another way of showing that thought is
                                  really baseless. <br>The Arguing Both Sides Method also demonstrates that thought forms conclusions
                                  based on motive. <br>Evidence is not the primary factor that determines what conclusions and
                                  beliefs will be formed. <br>Motivation is the primary factor in the forming of beliefs. <br>Evidence will be gathered to support the motive. <br>Whatever the ego wants to believe, the ego will gather all the so-called
                                  evidence and reasons to support what the ego wants to believe. <br>The ego’s primary motive is to preserve its imaginary self. <br>Therefore, the ego directs thought to create concepts that will help to
                                  preserve the ego’s imaginary self.</strong></p>

                                  is to confuse intellectual “spirituality” with authentic spirituality.
                              <br>Most people only have an intellectual interest in spiritual concepts and
                                  do not wish to end the ego. <br>Most people are just enjoying learning about the concepts. <br>There are some people who realize that their interest is only intellectual.
                              <br>There are other people who believe that they have an interest in ending
                                  the ego, who do not really have an interest in ending the ego. <br>Almost all of the people who are on a spiritual path that claims to have
                                  as its aim the ending of the ego illusion, have very little desire to
                                  actually end the ego. <br>The way to end all of the ego’s preservation strategies is to increase

                                  the desire for liberation. </span></span><br>There are a few very condensed Direct Path teachings that can be a great
                                  help on the Direct Path. <br>You will find those Direct Path teachings in the book you are now reading.
                              <br>However, to go on and on reading books and discussing spiritual teachings
                                  is an ego preservation strategy to keep you in the realm of thought instead
                                  of practice. <br>All of the time you spend reading and discussing could be better spent
                                  in practice. <br>Practice leads to liberation. <br>Endless reading and discussing leads to illusion. <br>The ego creates arguments against the Direct Path as a preservation strategy.
                              <br>The ego calls indirect paths direct paths as an ego preservation strategy.
                              <br>Instead of spending all one’s spare time in spiritual practice, the ego
                                  finds endless ways to spend one’s spare time such as television, entertainment,
                                  reading, discussing, thinking, etc. and that is one of the ego’s primary
                                  preservation strategies. <br>If you were to drop all of your unnecessary activities, you would have
                                  much more time for spiritual practice. </strong><br>One ego preservation strategy (imposter trick) is creating arguments against
                                  what is written here instead of open mindedly considering the possibility
                                  that what is being revealed in this book is pointing towards the truth
                                  that the ego usually never allows people to see. <br>Another ego preservation strategy (trick the imposter uses) is deciding
                                  in advance that one of the methods will not work, without ever giving
                                  the method a sincere try. <br>See how the ego is directing every thought you think to create a way to
                                  preserve its imaginary self. <br>In other words, ask of every thought, idea, concept, belief, etc. “Does
                                  this thought, idea, concept or belief help the ego illusion to continue?”.
                              <br>When you form a belief, you are no closer to discovering the absolute
                                  Truth than before you formed the belief. <br>When you form a belief, you have created an obstacle to discovering the
                                  absolute Truth. <strong><br>If you were honest, your view would be “I don’t know”. <br>If you really wanted Truth you would insist on Direct Experience. <br>If you really wanted Truth, you would never accept a belief. A belief
                                  is only a group of symbols. All words are symbols. </strong><br>The extremely intense desire for liberation is the key to ending the ego’s
                                  tricks and the book you are now reading contains step-by-step instructions
                                  in how to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation. <br>This book is also for the purpose of exposing the strategies the ego uses
                                  to preserve its imaginary self. <br>Reading this book is a good first step. <br>Repeated reading, over and over, reflecting on each sentence is very important.
                              <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>The motivation while reading is very important also. <br>The correct motivations are (86 - 89): <br>Extremely intense Self-honesty. <br>An extremely intense desire to know the Truth. <br>A willingness to let go of all the ideas you have accumulated in the past.
                              <br>An extremely intense longing to be free of sorrow and to live in joy. </strong></span></span><strong><br>If the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened in you, the
                                  Clarity, Honesty, Insight, Integrity and Earnestness that the extremely
                                  intense desire for liberation brings, will not allow the desire for liberation
                                  to become weak again. <br>If the desire for liberation becomes weak, it means that the extremely
                                  intense desire for liberation has not yet been awakened in you. <br>When the extremely intense desire for Freedom is awakened, Clarity, Sincerity,
                                  Earnestness, Insight and Discernment are also awakened and then you can
                                  see what is essential and what is not essential. </strong><br>The end of the ego is the end of all suffering and all sorrow for all
                                  eternity. <br>The end of the ego is infinite-eternal-awareness-love-bliss. <br>Realize that ending the ego is the only truly worthwhile event that can
                                  happen in a human life. <br>Take a look at your actions moment by moment to see if they conform to
                                  the realization that ending the ego is the only truly valuable thing that
                                  can happen in a human life. <br>The ego projects thoughts and fantasies and the ego interprets. <br>One way to stop this distortion is to ask “Is this thought I am having
                                  about what I am reading, really in the words I am reading, or have I added
                                  a thought that is not there in the words I am reading?”. <br>Another way to stop the distortion is to ask “Have I added a concept or
                                  interpretation to what I am reading?”. <br>Most people project much thinking unto the teachings that they read. <br>Their thinking has very little to do with the teachings they have read.</p>

              <p>Hi Longchen and Thusness,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your comments and corrections.</p>
              <p>The author also uses doubt/skepticism of thoughts to bring back one to the only 'real' -- consicousness. But in the process may be separating thoughts and experiences from consciousness (the I AM level).</p>
              <p>This is exactly what Ken Wilber said about Descartes in this video, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa4WtuR0wbY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fa4WtuR0wbY</a> (Descartes: Reviving the West's Greatest Modern Vedantist)</p>
              <p>He also pointed out that Descartes is one of the the most misunderstood philosopher, he actually uses doubt to point back to one's Being as the only undoubtable. But that the only point he could be faulted is that he did not push through to the non-dual side of the equation.</p>
              <p><strong><br>If you would be a real seeker after truth, it is necessary that at
                              least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.  <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.headless.org/Biographies/descartes.htm">Rene Descartes</a><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know I really 'feel' that message of Chapter 3 yesterday while meditating... I could actually feel that, all thoughts are not absolutely right or wrong and are equally illusory, can be 'doubted', and come and go against the only 'Real' unmoving formless background awareness that is completely alive. That only Consciousness is 'real'. Real in the sense that it IS, an undeniable Presence.</p>
              <p>I could not perceive the 'oneness' or 'nondual' nature though. I just stayed with that Awareness and doubted (let go) everything else.</p>
              <p>Maybe you guys can comment on that?</p>

                                                                      accurate.</p>
              <p>IMO, when visual vision and thought imagery arise, there is a
                                                                      tendency to compartmentalise certain sections as entities, focus or
                                                                      objects. Next, there is a desire to modify that section. For
                                                                      example, in the visual sense, from the environment you are engaging
                                                                      a conversation with someone. The mind desires to change the
                                                                      'person' into what it imagines will be the desired outcome.
                                                                      Example, you want to make the person think the way you think and so
                                                                      on so forth. The mind fails to see that this is 'hit and miss' and
                                                                      that the changes is really not dependent on the desire to modify
                                                                      the subject. Rather, it has got to do with the 'person' own willing
                                                                      or not.</p>
              <p>So... to me, thought is the not the problem. Instead, the desire
                                                                      to modify and change 'what is' is the cause of suffering.</p>
              <p>Also, when we say that we are not the thoughts or the body,
                                                                      unconsciously we have separated 'phemonena' from a 'untouchable'
                                                                      portion of ourself.</p>
              <p>The difference at the non-duality stage is that, no attempt is
                                                                      made... Sensations are left as they are...</p>
              <p>At the I AM/eternal witness stage, there is a seeking for the
                                                                      place beyond thoughts.</p>
              <p>Also, at the I AM/eternal witness, no-suffering is preferred
                                                                      over suffering. There is no understanding that there is really NO
                                                                      blissful place that is beyond pain. When there is pain, there is
                                                                      nothing beyond it too.</p>
              <p>So at the I AM/eternal witness stage, attempts may be employed
                                                                      by the mind to get rid of the pain... to go a place beyond the
                                                                      pain. The understanding  that 'sensation and pain' is
                                                                      inseparable from Presence/Buddha Nature is not there yet.</p>

              <p>And what he said I think, is also exactly the same problem as the author of the book. The author recommends 'Awareness Watching Awareness', to simple observe/BE the Awareness while turning the attention away from pain, from thoughts, from all experience. Nevertheless, I still practice that at my current stage... especially when meditation when I can easily drop the pain, thoughts, etc. In meditation, I can just allow Awareness to turn onto Itself alone. I believe this practice is known as å��é—»é—»è‡ªæ€§ in Buddhism. My forum signature, a quote from Shurangama Sutra for many months now goes, <br> <em><br> Â“All you who listen here should turn inward your<br> faculty of hearing to hear your own nature. This is how<br> enlightenment is won.Â”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I'm wondering if we should practice this in daily life, because turning away from pain, from experience is a kind of denial? Awareness is also not separated from everything else.</p>

              <p>You know I really 'feel' that message of Chapter 3 yesterday
              while meditating... I could actually feel that, all thoughts are
              not absolutely right or wrong and are equally illusory, can be
              'doubted', and come and go against the only 'Real' unmoving
              formless background awareness that is completely alive. That only
              Consciousness is 'real'. Real in the sense that it IS, an
              undeniable Presence.</p>
              <p>I could not perceive the 'oneness' or 'nondual' nature though. I
              just stayed with that Awareness and doubted (let go) everything

              <p>I think this is an experience of detachment from thought's conditioning power. That's why, you can feel that there are no absolute right or wrong. Yet, at the same time, because of the loosened conditioning, the presence will be felt.</p>
              <p>However, i don't think this is an experience of 'no-thought' yet.... not that we need to strive for it. In an experience of 'no thought' and 'no sense impressions', the Presence will be felt as all-pervading. It is not vast, but all pervading. There is a difference here. Vast denotes great distance. All-pervading denotes infinity... no border... no center.</p>
              <p>Further insight of this infinity may allow you to understanding why space, location and distance are merely impressions.</p>

              <p>Even that is an assumption, a belief! Because how do you know, unless it is an intuitive-insight-awareness? What is Nirvana anyway? For beginners who are not yet liberated, they only take it on assumption and belief. They merely hear the words from others, it is not their experience.</p>
              <p>But it is nevertheless a good assumption to make. A good belief. Because for practical purposes in life, we have to have beliefs. Even science is included, we invest a lot of faith in science, because there is no certainty. But Buddhism and Science are examples of reasonable faith, because it can be tested in experience. Nevertheless, before you SEE it, it is still a belief. But when practicing, it is good to question all beliefs, because to hold onto a belief and be satisfied with the belief and think that it is knowledge, is to miss the Truth. We simply cannot approach Reality (in the ultimate sense) through a belief system, a thought system, or a rational logical system of analysis.</p>
              <p>Also, once there is an awakening, a quantum shift in perception, such spiritual beliefs are deemed irrelevant.</p>
              <p>But prior to awakening, we can have beliefs as long as they do not become a hindrance to knowing truth. To say 'I Believe' is still ok, but to confuse 'I Believe' with 'I Know' is a form of arrogance. And we must also differentiate beliefs from knowledge, and as I wrote in another forum,</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 85%;"><strong><br>There are many things that I can
                                          doubt, but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My
                                          consciousness IS, and even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my
                                          consciousness doubting. I can imagine that my senses are being
                                          presented with a fake reality – say, a completely virtual reality or
                                          digital reality, which looks real but is merely a series of extremely
                                          realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the consciousness that is
                                          doing the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability of my present
                                          awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers
                                          to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in
                                          the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt consciousness and Being in
                                          this moment, for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all
                                          existing…</strong><br><br>Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?<br><br>If
                                          you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is
                                          actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can
                                          doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt
                                          the doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display.
                                          Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows
                                          God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of
                                          now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty
                                          lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not
                                          in the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God,
                                          because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that
                                          can be seen…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but
                                          impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never really
                                          be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the
                                          Runner. To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but
                                          impossible to avoid: it is that which is looking at this page right
                                          now. Can’t you feel That One? Why on earth do you keep looking for God
                                          when God is actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I
                                          am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am aware
                                          of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in
                                          the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body –
                                          and I am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover,
                                          I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can
                                          doubt that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt that the
                                          Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there
                                          to witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings
                                          in the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am
                                          that Witness – a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent
                                          Openness that impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror
                                          spontaneously reflects all its objects…<br><br>You can already feel
                                          some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of
                                          witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are free from the
                                          suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts
                                          – they all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open
                                          Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This
                                          is actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the
                                          formless Witness, causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the
                                          entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are
                                          not the body, not the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that
                                          – you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With
                                          this discovery… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any
                                          and all finite objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are
                                          free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted,
                                          drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to
                                          time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and
                                          suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss,
                                          the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, and all that was, and all that
                                          ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that only halfway home? </span>Because
                                          as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware
                                          of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great
                                          catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear
                                          entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead
                                          of touching the earth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the
                                          thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos because One
                                          Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt.
                                          Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and
                                          the solar system replaces your head…<br><br>You are One Taste, the
                                          empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that arise in its
                                          embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal,
                                          radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…<br><br>So the primary
                                          Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between… in here and
                                          out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all things
                                          witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once
                                          you actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then – can
                                          it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes
                                          fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so
                                          how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian
                                          dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian dualism,
                                          then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking
                                          at the world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of
                                          that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that is
                                          arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face
                                          looking out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with
                                          a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a
                                          five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling
                                          hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present
                                          condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular
                                          organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction
                                          that makes it seem that “you” are in the head looking at the rest of
                                          the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the personal
                                          bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is arising – a
                                          vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely Full
                                          expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject
                                          and every single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of
                                          One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you
                                          become the All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity
                                          is everything that is arising moment to moment (just as previously you
                                          felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal
                                          coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have become One
                                          Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br><br>(Source:

              <p>I want to add something regarding the method this author (Michael Langford) is teaching (Awareness Watching Awareness). This practice is also taught in Buddhism and in the sutras, and is a valid practice, but at most will lead to the I AM level of experience. It is a glimpse, an initial realisation of our Buddha-nature. But it does not come with the understanding of luminosity as Anatta/No-Self and Emptiness. Therefore as Longchen told me, those doing one pointed meditation will have to switch to Insight-practice (Vipassana/Vipashyana) after their initial awakening of Presence that occurs by absorption, in order to uncover deeper insights into the non-dual and empty nature.</p>
              <p><strong>Generally speaking, my friend Thusness would usually recommend insight-practice from the start. But to a few persons, depending on conditions, he would recommend self-inquiry or methods that leads to a quick glimpse of Presence. This has its danger as the experience may be misunderstood. But it is a faster means to have an initial glimpse.</strong></p>
              <p>As Thusness said 2 years ago,</p>
              <blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid #008080; padding-left: 5px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 0px;">
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">The AMness can be said to be a form of
                              absorption where the object of concentration is the Self.  It can be a
                              question "Who am I" that leads one to the experience of the
                              subject-object becoming one.  Till a point the practitioner simply
                              experiences a pure sense of existence.  However such mode of experience
                              has no understanding of its luminous clarity and its nature as anatta. 
                              The key point about mindful awareness is there is no keeping of the
                              mind on anything and by not resting on anything, it fuses into
                              everything; therefore it cannot be concentrated; rather it is to relax
                              into nothingness empty of self, empty of any artifical doing so that
                              the natural luminosity can take its own course.  There is no focusing,
                              there is only allowing the mirror bright clarity to shine with it
                              natural radiance.  In essence there is no one  there, only the
                              phenomenon arisng and ceasing telling their stories.  <br></span></div>

              <p>Excerpts from</p>
              <h2 class="tight">Chapter 4 - THE DESIRE FOR LIBERATION</h2>
              <p>Awakening the extremely intense desire for Liberation is the most important
                                      first step that can be taken towards being liberated here and now in this
                                      lifetime. <strong><br>The extremely intense desire for liberation is (3 - 7): <br>The extremely intense desire for the realization of the absolute Truth.
                                  <br>The extremely intense longing for the ending of sorrow and the experience
                                      of Eternal-Love-Joy. <br>The extremely intense desire to experience who or what you really are
                                      at your core and to live eternally as your true Self. <br>The extremely intense desire for freedom from all illusion and delusion
                                      and freedom from the ego that is the source of all illusion and delusion.
                                  <br>The extremely intense desire to awaken from the human nightmare. </strong><br><br>The extremely intense desire for liberation is the foundation of all true
                                      spirituality. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br>Of all of the factors that determine whether you will or will not be free,
                                      the intensity or lack of intensity of your desire for liberation is the
                                      most essential factor. <br>Therefore, whatever you can do to most effectively increase your desire
                                      for liberation should be done.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><br>All obstacles that appear in your journey to freedom are caused by too
                                      little desire for freedom. <br>Even a little increase in your desire for freedom is helpful. <br>As your desire for freedom grows in intensity the ego creates fewer obstacles.
                                  <strong><br>When your desire for freedom becomes very intense, your desire for freedom
                                      demands that you take no detours. <br>When your desire for freedom becomes very intense, for the first time
                                      you can see what is essential for freedom and what is not essential. <br>When the desire for freedom is weak, the ego will not allow you to see
                                      the ego’s preservation strategies. <br>When the desire for freedom is stronger, you can begin to see the ego’s
                                      preservation strategies. <br>When the desire for freedom becomes even stronger, the desire for freedom
                                      itself will bring you everything you need to succeed in your quest for
                                      liberation including the answer to all your questions, finding the Direct
                                      Path teachings, the solution to all obstacles, etc. </strong><br>You will also be able to see how, before the awakening of the extremely
                                      intense desire for liberation, the ego was selecting spiritual teachings
                                      that would help to preserve it. <br>When the desire for freedom becomes even more intense, you can see all
                                      of the ego’s preservation strategies. <br>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will
                                      marvel at how it was possible that you did not see the ego’s preservation
                                      strategies before. <br>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will
                                      be able to see how the ego distorted even the Direct Path teachings.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><strong><br>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, you will
                                      see the endless maze of concepts the ego has created to trap your attention.
                                  <br>When the desire for freedom becomes even more intense, the ego will no
                                      longer create preservation strategies. </strong><br>The extremely intense desire for the Direct Experience of the absolute
                                      Truth will guide you to your inner Teacher. <br>The extremely intense desire for Truth will guide you to the practice
                                      that gives the Direct Experience of eternal life. <br>The intensity of the desire for the realization of the Truth is the key.
                                  <br>Increasing your desire for the absolute Truth is the most important step.
                                  <br>Increasing the desire for freedom must be the first step. <br>Without an increase in your desire for freedom, all of your attempts at
                                      awakening will fail to produce eternal experience. <br>Without an increase in your desire for freedom, the ego will distort all
                                      your spiritual studies, including what you read in the book you are now
                                      reading. <br>Without an increase in your desire for freedom, the ego will never allow
                                      you to see the Truth. <br>Another great key is self-honesty. <br>Self-honesty will help in all aspects of the quest for liberation. <br>Self-honesty will help you to increase your desire for liberation. <br>Self-honesty means to be as honest as you can be. <br>Self-honesty means to be 100% honest with your self, all of the time.
                                  <br>Catch your ego using preservation strategies. <br>See your ego creating arguments that lead you away from the Direct Path.
                                  <br>What if your desire for liberation were to double from its present level?
                                  <br>If your desire for liberation were to double from its present level, that
                                      would be a huge help. <br>If your desire for liberation were to double from its present level, immediately
                                      you would begin to see what you have never been able to see before. <br>What if your desire for liberation were a million times greater and more
                                      intense than it is now? <br>Really, even if your desire for liberation doubles or triples, great changes
                                      will occur in what the ego allows you to see. <br>When your desire for liberation increases greatly, every moment of your
                                      life will be dedicated to your liberation. <br>That great intense desire for liberation itself will demand that you do
                                      not waste even one moment of time, and it will demand that you stop the
                                      ego lies, and that you drop that which is not essential. <br>The wonderful thing is, it is that same extreme desire for liberation
                                      that brings you the knowledge of what is essential and what is not essential

                                      can see, but you are really blind. <br>After the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, all is made clear
                                      and you have no doubts! <br>After the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, for the first time
                                      you can see! <strong><br>If the extremely intense desire for liberation does not arise in you (58
                                      - 62): <br>None of the words in this book will be of any benefit to you. <br>The ego will interpret what is written here in the book you are now reading.
                                  <br>The ego will create arguments against what is written here. <br>Instead of seeing what you read literally, without any interpretation,
                                      the ego will begin to interpret. <br>The ego will change the teachings into something that preserves the ego
                                      instead of something that brings the ego to its final end. <br>Therefore, the key to everything is to awaken the extremely intense desire
                                      for liberation and to make that desire for freedom grow everyday.</strong></p>

              <p><br>If the desire for freedom is not great enough in you, the ego will always
                                      find a way to occupy your time with something other than spiritual practice.
                                  <strong><br>Thus the key to bringing the ego to an end is the intensity of the desire
                                      for freedom. </strong><br>Eagerness for liberation must be equal to the eagerness someone who is

                                      more intense than it is now? (110 - 114): </strong><br><strong>Then there would not be time for all these games, detours and distractions. </strong><br><strong>Then you would stop listening to teachers who are supposedly liberated
                                      but who are not liberated. </strong><br><strong>Then you would not pretend thinking about spirituality is Spirituality. </strong><br><strong>Then you would not pretend an intellectual journey is a spiritual journey. </strong><br><strong>Then the only means you would accept would be the most direct means. </strong><br><strong>Then you would be just like the man who is being kept underwater trying

              <p>IMO, once one has sufficient direct experience of what the author calls infinite-eternal-awareness-bliss-love -- our true nature, the entire outward seeking momentum will be overturned. Not that it will no longer arise forever, but that it will not be as strong as before.</p>

              <p>The primary means to awaken the extremely intense desire for liberation
                              is to carefully examine two choices everyday until the extremely intense
                              desire for liberation awakens. <br>Choice A is to choose to end the ego by dropping all unnecessary activities,
                              to create the maximum amount of time everyday to practice the most direct
                              and rapid means to eternal bliss. <br>The most direct and rapid means to eternal bliss, here and now in this
                              lifetime, is the Awareness Watching Awareness Method described in Chapter
                              Seven. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><br>Choice A is Infinite-Eternal-Awareness-Love-Bliss with no sorrow and no
                              suffering. <br>Choice A is Eternal Life. <br>Choice A is to live as your true Self for all eternity. <br>Choice A is absolutely perfect joy. </strong></span><br>The above (2 - 7) is a summary of Choice A.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><strong><br>Choice B is being identified with a body subject to suffering, sorrow,
                              disease, death, violence, fear, anger, etc. <br>Choice B is to allow an imposter called the ego to pretend to be yourself
                              and to control you. <br>Choice B is to allow an imposter called the ego, that has created all
                              the wars, diseases, death, sorrow, suffering and evil that every human
                              has ever experienced, to continue. <br>Choice B is to have a temporary and therefore futile life that leads only
                              to death. <br>In order to better examine Choice B, you can make a list of all the forms
                              that human sorrow and suffering take. </strong><br>You can write on that list thousands of wars, thousands of diseases, thousands
                              of forms of violence and every other form human sorrow and suffering takes
                              that you can think of. Usually humans look only at a small part of the
                              ocean of human sorrow and suffering. The purpose of the list is to look
                              at the entire ocean of human sorrow and suffering all at once. The purpose
                              of the list is to look at the entire negative side of human life all at
                              one time. (In the future there will be a sample list on The Freedom Religion
                              website.)<br>You need only read the suffering list once. <br>After that, the summary found in Chapter Five should be enough. <br>Read Chapter Five everyday, comparing the summary of Choice A and the
                              summary of Choice B, until the extremely intense desire for liberation
                              awakens in you. <br>Read Chapter Five everyday comparing the summary of Choice A and the summary
                              of Choice B until you have made Choice A. <br>How will you know that the extremely intense desire for liberation has
                              been awakened? <br>When you drop all unnecessary activities everyday, and use all of that
                              free time created to actually practice everyday the most rapid and direct
                              means to eternal bliss, you will know that the extremely intense desire
                              for liberation has been awakened. <br>How will you know that you have made Choice A? <br>When you drop all unnecessary activities everyday, and use all of the
                              free time thus created to actually practice everyday the most rapid and
                              direct means to eternal bliss, you will know you have made Choice A. <br>The Awakening of the extremely intense desire for liberation, which can
                              also be called “really making Choice A” is (25 - 55): <br>It is like a sign stating “NO MORE” that is a million miles high. <br>NO MORE to all of the human evils of the past. <br>NO MORE to all of the horrors the ego has created. <br>It is like a silent shout saying NO MORE so loud, that if it were given
                              a voice it would shatter the eardrums of every human on earth. <br>It is a demand for Truth. <br>It is the absolute demand for absolute Truth. <br>It is the absolute demand for the final end of all human opinions. <br>It is the absolute demand for absolute goodness. <br>It is the absolute demand for the final end of the imposter who is called
                              the ego. <br>It is the absolute demand for the Direct Experience of the true Self.
                          <br>It is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of Truth with a grip
                              so strong, no power can weaken that grip. <br>It is like an infinitely strong grip that grabs hold of the true Self
                              with a grip so strong, nothing is powerful enough to weaken that grip.
                          <br>The extremely intense desire for liberation is like an infinitely strong
                              grip that grabs hold of the absolute goodness that has never known falsehood
                              with a grip so strong nothing can weaken that grip. <br>It is like an absolutely immovable “NO” saying no to the trillions of
                              human lies spoken in the past and the billions of human lies being thought
                              of each day. <br>It is an absolute “NO” to the trillions of horrors humans have created
                              in the past and the billions of horrors humans are creating everyday.
                          <br>It is an absolute demand for the end of all sorrow and suffering. <br>It is an absolute demand for perfect infinite-eternal-love-joy. <br>It is an absolute demand that the source of all suffering, violence and
                              evil, which is the imposter called ego, come to a final end. <br>It is an absolute devotion to the true Self that is the background of
                              awareness. <br>That absolute devotion takes the form of turning the attention away from
                              the world, the body, thought, etc. and towards awareness watching awareness.
                          <br>The extremely intense desire for liberation is a demand for Truth that
                              never compromises. <br>It is a demand for the end of thought. <br>It is a demand for the Direct Experience of the absolute Truth. <br>When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, these demands are
                              directed inwards, not towards others. <br>When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, one never again
                              bows before any egotistical human. <br>When the extremely intense desire for freedom arises, all obstacles are
                              swept away. <br>It is absolute dedication and devotion to absolute Truth. <br>It is absolute dedication and devotion to knowing the true Self in Direct
                              Experience. <br>After the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, every moment
                              of one’s life is dedicated to awakening from the human dream. <br>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, all of the
                              ego’s lies and games are seen for what they are and all of the ego’s lies
                              and games come to an end. <br>When the extremely intense desire for liberation is awakened, the nightmare
                              the ego has created is no longer tolerated. <br>The ego is the source of all evil. <br>The ego is insane. This is true for all humans. <br>To produce so many trillions of horrors, the ego has to be evil and insane.
                          <br>Something in you longs for an end to the imposter’s dream. <br>Something in you longs for infinite Love. <br>Something in you longs for the end of all suffering and sorrow. <br>Something in you longs for eternal-joy-love. <br>It is possible to end the ego’s dream and to discover the true Self which
                              is free of all suffering and sorrow and whose nature is infinite-eternal-love-joy.
                          <br>It is possible now in this lifetime, while this body is living. <br>Co-operate with your Heart. <br>Stop listening to your ego. <br>If you turn your attention away from thought and towards awareness watching
                              awareness and sustain that look for many hours everyday, eventually the
                              ego dream will end and the true Self will be known. <br>Then all suffering and sorrow ends and what remains is the eternal perfection
                              of awareness-love-bliss. <br>Make Choice A. <br>Make your choice absolute and absolutely immovable. <br>Make your choice absolutely solid and final. <br>Your true Self, the background of awareness that is looking through your
                              eyes now, deserves your attention. <br>For your entire life, you have been ignoring your true Self. <br>Your true Self, the background of awareness, deserves your love &amp; attention.
                          <br>Demand sanity. <br>The human dream is insane. <br>Demand sanity by waking up from the human dream into the reality of your
                              own awareness. <br>Make Choice A by dropping all unnecessary activities to create more time
                              for spiritual practice. <br>Make Choice A by dropping all distractions, detours and entertainment
                              to create more time everyday for spiritual practice. <br>Make Choice A by making sure your spiritual practice is the most rapid

              <h2>THE AWARENESS WATCHING AWARENESS
                                          <br> METHOD PRACTICE INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
              <p><a href="http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/most_rapid/chapter07.aspx">http://www.albigen.com/uarelove/most_rapid/chapter07.aspx</a></p>
              <p>There are 24 variations in description of the same thing, I'll just copy 3.</p>
              <p>The author recommends practicing 2 hours a day on the following instructions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Description A: Shut your eyes. Notice your awareness. Observe
                                                        that awareness. Turn your attention away from the world, body and thought
                                                        and towards awareness watching awareness. If you notice you are thinking,
                                                        turn your attention away from thought and back towards awareness watching
                                                        awareness. <br>Description B: Look out at the room and notice your awareness looking
                                                        out through your eyes. Now shut your eyes and notice that same awareness
                                                        is still there that a moment ago was looking outward at the room. Observe
                                                        that awareness. If you seem to be having a lot of thoughts, ignore them
                                                        and turn your attention away from the thoughts and towards awareness observing
                                                        awareness. <br>Description C: Shut your eyes. Notice that you are conscious. Watch that
                                                        consciousness. Every time you notice a thought, turn your attention away
                                                        from the thought and continue watching your consciousness. Do not watch
                                                        your thoughts. Watch your consciousness. Consciousness watching consciousness.
                                                        Consciousness conscious of consciousness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are also many other methods I did not mention here, the 'Abandon Release Method', 'The Eternal Method', 'The Infinite Space Method', 'The Loving-All Method' and 'The Reminders', in the further chapters.</p>
              <p>Thusness told me to practice dropping, I think is also quite similar (in some ways) to the Abandon Release Method. However there are also subtle differences, in what Thusness instructed me, due to certain conditions I had.</p>
              <p>I think I'll stop sharing here, the rest if readers are interested can read further.</p>
