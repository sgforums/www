              <p> Zen Master Xu Yun:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Self-nature is Mind. When one turns inward to hear one's self- 
              nature, one is turning inward to contemplate Mind. In the phrase, "Perfectly 
              illuminating pure awareness," pure awareness is Mind and illumination is 
              contemplation. Mind is Buddha. When one recites Buddha's name one contemplates 
              Buddha. Contemplating Buddha is contemplating Mind. </em></p>
              <p><em>Investigating hua-t'ou or "looking into who is reciting 
              Buddha's name " is contemplating Mind. Hence contemplating Mind is contemplating 
              pure awareness. It is also illuminating the Buddha- nature within oneself. Mind 
              is nature, pure awareness, Buddha. Mind has no form, no characters, no 
              directions; it cannot be found in any particular place. It cannot be grasped. 
              Originally, Mind is purity, universally embracing all Dharma realms. No in or 
              out, no coming or going. Originally, Mind is pure Dharmakaya. </em></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><em><strong> </strong></em></p>
              <h4><em><span style="font-family: Arial;">5. Taking Care of Hua-t'ou and Turning Inward to Hear 
                    One's Self-Nature: </span></em></h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Someone might ask, "How is Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara's 
                    method of turning inward to hear self-nature considered investigating 
                    Ch'an?". I have previously explained that taking care of hua-t'ou is 
                    being, moment after moment, with only one thought, singlemindedly shining 
                    the light inward on "that which is not born and not destroyed". Inward 
                    illumination is reflection. Self-nature is that which is not born and not 
                    destroyed. When "hearing" and "illuminating" follow sound and form in the 
                    worldly stream, hearing does not go beyond sound and seeing does not go 
                    beyond form. However, when one turns inward and contemplates self-nature 
                    against the worldly steam, and does not pursue sound and form, then he 
                    becomes pure and transparent. At that time, "hearing" and "illuminating" 
                    are not two different things. </span> </strong></em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>Thus we should know that taking care of the hua-t'ou 
                    and turning inward to hear self-nature does not mean using our eyes to see 
                    and our ears to hear. If we use our ears to hear or our eyes to see, then 
                    we are chasing sound and form. As a result we will be affected by them. 
                    This is called submission to the worldly stream. If one practices with one 
                    thought only, singlemindedly abiding in that which is not born and not 
                    destroyed, not chasing after sound and form, with no wandering thoughts, 
                    then one is going against the stream. This is also called taking care of 
                    the hua-t'ou or turning inward to hear one's self- nature. This is not to 
                    say you should close your eyes tightly or cover your ears. Just do not 
                    generate a mind of seeking after sound and form</em>. </span> </strong></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At first, it is like being told to open our eyes in a dark room entirely devoid of light and being told to<em> really look</em>.
              In working with a hua tou or kung-an we use the same faculty we use to
              explore the world of the senses: the mind; but we turn that faculty
              inwards instead of outwards. Instead of using our sense of sight to
              look outward we use the sense of mind to look inward. At first all we
              see is darkness, but before long that darkness becomes illuminated from
              within by a most brilliant light.
              Hsu Yun's comments on hua tou practice:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="indent">"Hua-tou practice means to turn inwards your
              hearing to hear your self-nature. Unremittingly and one-pointedly turn
              the light inwards on that which is not born and does not die.
              Unremittingly and one-pointedly turn inwards the faculty of hearing to
              hear your Self-nature. To 'turn inwards' is to 'turn back'. 'That which
              is not born and does not die' is nothing but Self-nature. When hearing
              and looking, follow sound and form in the worldly stream. Hearing does
              not go beyond sound and looking does not go beyond form. When going
              against the mundane worldly stream, meditation is turned inwards to
              contemplate Self-nature. When hearing and looking are no longer in
              pursuit of sound and appearance, they become fundamentally pure and
              enlightening and do not differ from each other. We should know that
              what we call 'looking into the hua-tou' and 'turning inwards the
              hearing to hear Self-nature' cannot be effected by means of the eye to
              look or the ear to hear. If eye and ear are so used, the mind will
              pursue sound and form -- the result will be that the mind will be
              affected by external things: it will 'surrender to the mundane stream'.
              If there is singleness of thought abiding in that 'which is not born
              and does not die', without pursuing sound and form, this is 'going
              against the mundane stream': it is also 'looking into the hua-tou' or
              'turning inwards to hear the self-nature'."</div>

              <p>And what he said I think, is also exactly the same problem as
              the author of the book. The author recommends 'Awareness Watching
              Awareness', to simple observe/BE the Awareness while turning the
              attention away from pain, from thoughts, from all experience.
              Nevertheless, I still practice that at my current stage...
              especially when meditation when I can easily drop the pain,
              thoughts, etc. In meditation, I can just allow Awareness to turn
              onto Itself alone. I believe this practice is known as å��é—»é—»è‡ªæ€§ in
              Buddhism. My forum signature, a quote from Shurangama Sutra for
              many months now goes,<br> <em><br> Â“All you who listen here should turn inward your<br> faculty of hearing to hear your own nature. This is how<br> enlightenment is won.Â”</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I'm wondering if we should practice this in daily life,
              because turning away from pain, from experience is a kind of
              denial? Awareness is also not separated from everything else.</p>

                              you will also try and catch the vase while you are practicing the Loving
                              All Method. </li>
              <li>You do not allow the vase to fall because you are loving the falling. </li>
              <li>If someone were to try to punch you in the face and if you would normally
                              duck, you will also duck while practicing the Loving All Method. </li>
              <li>The fact that you are loving the fact that someone is trying to punch
                              you does not mean you will not duck. </li>
              <li>You also love the fact that you are ducking to avoid being punched. </li>
              <li>The Loving All Method is about emotional acceptance. </li>
              <li>The Loving All Method is not about changing your actions. </li>
              <li>Like any skill, the more you practice, the more skill you gain. </li>
              <li>If someone says something mean to you and if you feel bad emotionally
                              because of what they said, then love your negative emotion and love yourself
                              for having the negative emotion. </li>
              <li>In the beginning, even though you are attempting to love everything and
                              every experience exactly the way it is, you probably will not succeed
                              in loving everything and every experience exactly the way it is. </li>
              <li>Changing the long time habit of emotionally rejecting experiences will
                              require lots of practice. </li>
              <li>Love as much as you can love. </li>
              <li>Keep practicing everyday trying to love everything exactly the way it
                              is. </li>
              <li>As the months go by, you will gain more success at loving more and more
                              experiences exactly the way they are. </li>
              <li>It might take some years of practice for you to be able to love everything
                              exactly the way it is. </li>
              <li>Everyday, try to love everything and every experience that happens, exactly
                              the way it is. </li>
              <li>Loving everything the way it is includes emotional acceptance. </li>
              <li>Emotional acceptance does not prevent you from trying to change whatever
                              you wish to change. </li>
              <li>What you wish to change, you will still change. </li>
              <li>Whatever action you would normally take to change something, you will
                              still take that same action. </li>
              <li>In the beginning, even though you are trying to love everything you experience,
                              you might only be able to love a small part of what you experience. </li>
              <li>Everyday that you practice the Loving All Method, you will gain more skill
                              at being able to love everything you experience, exactly the way it is. </li>
              <li>You should not try to look inward while engaged in daily activities. </li>
              <li>You should look outward while engaged in daily activities. </li>
              <li>In other words, it is important to pay attention to what you are doing
                              while engaged in daily activities. </li>
              <li>The Loving All Method is not a “looking inward” method. </li>
              <li>It is important to pay close attention to what you are doing during your
                              daily activities so that your activities flow smoothly. </li>
              <li>If you were to try to look inward during your daily activities, your activities
                              may not flow smoothly. </li>
              <li>For example: if you try to look inward while putting toothpaste on your
                              toothbrush, you might put shampoo or shaving cream on your toothbrush
                              instead of toothpaste, because of having your attention divided between
                              outward and inward. </li>
              <li>Fortunately, the Loving All Method does not require inward attention. </li>
              <li>The Loving All Method does not require thought either. </li>
              <li>The Loving All Method is developing a new feeling habit. </li>
              <li>The Loving All Method is developing the habit of feeling love towards
                              everything you perceive. </li>
              <li>In the beginning you could try practicing “no emotional resistance” during
                              all of your daily activities. </li>
              <li>In action you can resist all you want to resist. </li>
              <li>If you would normally resist something in action, you will continue to
                              resist something in action while practicing the Loving All Method. </li>
              <li>Not resisting emotionally has nothing to do with what you do in your actions,
                              activities and behavior. </li>
              <li>You can continue to resist all you wish to resist in your actions, activities
                              and behavior while practicing the Loving All Method. </li>
              <li>While you may be resisting in action, you do not resist emotionally while
                              practicing the Loving All Method. </li>

              <li>Description A: Shut your eyes. Relax your body. Now ignore
                              your body. Let go of all effort. Let go of all sense of having to do something,
                              as though there is nothing you have to do and nothing you have to think
                              about. Letting go of all effort means letting go of all will and all desire
                              as though there was nothing that needed to be accomplished or changed.<br> <br> Let go. Relax. Let go more. Relax more. See how far it is possible to
                              let go. Let go of all thoughts. Let go of all feelings. Let go of all
                              effort. Let go of everything except your awareness.
                              <br> <br> Whatever thoughts, perceptions, images or feelings arise, let them go
                              as soon as they arise or even before they arise. Do not follow thoughts,
                              as though you had no interest in them. Let go of all your perceptions
                              as though they have nothing to do with you.
                              <br> <br> Continue to relax more and more. Throughout the practice session let go
                              more, then let go even more and as the practice session continues see
                              how far it is possible to let go. Relax completely. Let go totally. Release
                              everything except your awareness.
                              <br> <br> Letting go is giving up completely. Letting go is surrendering completely.
                              Letting go is relaxing completely. Letting go is releasing completely.
                              Letting go is letting go of all effort and all thought. Letting go is
                              letting go of all feelings, desires and images. Letting go is letting
                              go of everything except your awareness.
                              <br> <br> The difference between falling asleep and the Abandon Release Method is
                              when you fall asleep you let go of everything including your awareness.
                              In the Abandon Release Method, you let go of everything except your awareness. </li>
