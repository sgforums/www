She has deeply entered Dhyana Samadhi and thoroughly penetrated all Dharmas. In the space of a Kshana she brought broth the Bodhi mind and attained to irreversibility. Her eloquence is unobstructed and she is compassionately mindful of all living beings as if they were her children. Her merit and virtue is complete. The thoughts of her mind and the words from her mouth are subtle, wonderful, and expansive. She is compassionate, humane and yielding; harmonious and refined in mind and will, and she is able to arrive at Bodhi."<br><br>Wisdom Accumulation Bodhisattva said, "I have seen the Thus Come One Shakyamuni practicing difficult ascetic practices throughout limitless aeons, accumulating merit and virtue as he sought Bodhi without ever resting.

This is difficult to believe. Why? The body of a woman is filthy and not a vessel for the Dharma. How can you attain to the Supreme Bodhi? The Buddha Path is remote and distant. Only after one has passed through limitless aeons, diligently bearing suffering and accumulating oneÂ’s conduct, perfecting oneÂ’s cultivation of all Paramitas, can one then attain realization. What is more, a womanÂ’s body has Five Obstacles: one, she cannot become a Brahma heaven king; two, she cannot become Shakra; three, she cannot become a Mara king; four, she cannot become a Wheel Turning Sage king; five, she cannot become a Buddha. How can a woman quickly realize Buddhahood?"<br><br>Now the Dragon Girl had a precious pearl, its worth equal to the entire system of three thousand great thousand worlds, which she took before the Buddha and presented to him.

Likewise, everything we call "the future" is nothing but present memories inverted, or rearranged, to form a prediction or expectation. The appearance of "time" is little more than a trick of memory, as the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Ornament Scripture) says. You can easily discern this for yourself: simply figure out what it is you consider "the past" and "the future." You will discover that it is nothing but thoughts--nothing but memories, nothing but expectations, nothing but mental commentary. It's "all in your head," so to speak. There's really no such thing as time. There is really only Now--an eternally present Present with no beginning and no ending. Everything is completely new, distinct, and original every instant, with no real "change" or "motion" at all. The mystic-philosopher Heraclitus, explaining this point, said, "A man cannot step in the same river twice."<br><br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm</a><br><br>This is a very good website on time.</blockquote><blockquote>Originally posted by Longchen:<br><br>From my understanding thus far, all past lives are actually happening in the ETERNAL NOW.

I could only catch a glimpse of it.<br>Anyway, hereÂ’s what I think I perceivedÂ…<br><br>Â“TIME existed only as a perception for physical consciousness in this realm. Without consciousness, TIME does not exist. Events are all happening in the NOW moment. However, not all consciousnesses are in the present time. Past events/memories are also happening in the NOW.

Science has viewed time as a dimension that can be manipulated if "we are able to travel faster than the speed of light." According to Einstein, a photon travelling at the speed of light does not experience time, coz time halt at the speed of light!<br>So where is "Time" according to Science? It is another "space" far from<br>"here" and can be reached if we are able to travel faster than light.</blockquote>Time is merely a measurement and works on the relative level. Albert Einstein defines time as what he can see in his clock. That is right, on the relative level.

For us convinced physicists the distinction between past, present, and future is an illusion, albeit a persistent one." p. 294<br><br>For many other "wise and buddhist-ic" quotes by Einstein, refer to <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=122948&amp;page=2" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=122948&amp;page=2</a></blockquote>But "past" and "future" does not have inherent existence! We can say, the ancient greeks lived a few thousand years ago... but did they live in the past? No. They lived in the "Now".. they can't possibly live in the past. I mean, it would be absurd to think so.. how can you "live in the past"? Are you "living in the past" now? You are living in the "now". Similarly the greeks lived in the "now", they don't live in the past. All happenings happen in the now. Memory is also a happening, in the now.<br><br>Nothing lives in the past, as longchen said, "all past lives are happening in the ETERNAL NOW". There ever was only this eternally present Present with no beginning and ending. We delude ourselves by thinking that past and future have inherent existence, and this illusion causes sufferings. So the Zen Master said, "the only reality is Now". And even present/now does not have inherent existence since "present" is always in relation to past and future. The word "present"/"now" is only a word, a pointer, not ultimately real. You cannot grasp the "now" because once you capture it mentally, that moment has passed. So the "present" is also ungraspable and empty. Therefore as my signature says, past, present, future mind are ungraspable. Ungraspable due to its empty nature.</div>

Here's the Sixth Patriarch, Ch'an Master Hui-neng:<br><br>"In this moment there is nothing that comes to be. In this moment there is nothing that ceases to be. Thus there is no birth-and-death to be brought to an end. Thus the absolute peace in this present moment. Though it is at this moment, there is no limit to this moment, and herein lies eternal delight."<br><br>Zen Master Seung Sahn elaborated on this topic in his excellent book The Compass of Zen (p. 143):<br><br>"Everyone thinks that this is extremely difficult teaching, something beyond their reach or experience. How can things appear and disappear, and yet there is, originally, even in this constantly moving world, no appearing and disappearing? A student once asked me, 'The Mahaparinirvana-sutra seems very confusing. Everything is always moving. And yet everything is not moving? I don't understand this Buddhism . . .' But there is a very easy way to understand this: Sometime you go to a movie. You see an action movie about a good man and a bad man--lots of fighting, cars moving very fast, and explosions all over the place. Everything is always moving very quickly. Our daily lives have this quality: everything is constantly moving, coming and going, nonstop. It seems like there is no stillness-place. But this movie is really only a very long strip of film. In one second, there are something like fourteen frames. Each frame is a separate piece of action. But in each frame, nothing is moving. Everything is completely still. Each frame, one by one, is a complete picture. In each frame, nothing ever comes or goes, or appears or disappears. Each frame is complete stillness. The film projector moves the frames very quickly, and all of these frames run past the lens very fast, so the action on-screen seems to happen nonstop. There is no break in the movement of things. But actually when you take this strip of film and hold it up to the light with your hands, there is nothing moving at all. Each frame is complete. Each moment is completely not-moving action.<br><br>"Our minds and the whole universe are like that. This world is impermanent. Everything is always changing, changing, changing, moving, moving, moving, nonstop. Even one second of our lives seems full of so much movement and change in this world that we see. But your mind--right now--is like a lens whose shutter speed is one divided by infinite time. We call that moment-mind. If you attain that mind, then this whole world's movement stops. From moment to moment you can see this world completely stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Like the film, you perceive every frame--this moment--which is infinitely still and complete. In the frame, nothing is moving. There is no time, and nothing appears or disappears in that box. But this movie projector--your thinking mind--is always moving, around and around and around, so you experience this world as constantly moving and you constantly experience change, which is impermanence. You lose moment-mind by following your conceptual thinking, believing that it is real."</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:</div><div class="quote_body">So change doesn't equate in terms of time?</div></blockquote>Yes. Time, which is division, is psychological, or a perception of consciousness as Longchen said. It is our thought that makes us believe there is continuity of our life through time. That is called "age form" in Diamond sutra. Or "time form". Changes happen but it is not "things" that are changing, empty phenomena are changing. Empty means empty of inherent existence, it does not mean a null void or nothingness. There must be continuity of an existence of a "thing" for there to be time, but all things are by nature empty. What you are now is neither same nor different from what you are 20 years ago, because you are by nature empty.<br><br>If lets say there is a time line of moment 1, moment 2, moment 3, moment 4, and so on. When you said "now" at moment 1, it is immediately moment 2. So which exist? Moment 1 or Moment 2? If you say all 4 moments exist because you registered it in your memory, what about a person with memory loss? What if the whole world had amnesia? So time is a psychological impression due to not knowing the ultimate truth (Emptiness).<br><br>However for practical purpose, chronological time, or clock time, is a useful means because it is relative truth. It is true that you are born (lets say) 20 years ago. In Buddhism that would be relative truth. It has relative reality, it is true in relation to something but it has no ultimate reality. Even the Sutras make good use of relative truth. However according to ultimate truth however, you were never born. There never was a beginning nor an ending. There is no "self" that is born.<br><br>The only problem arise when sentient beings mistake relative truth as ultimate. Or, not knowing the ultimate truth. Here is some quotes by J.Krishnamurti which I found useful:<br><br><blockquote>"Time provides no solution. All religions have maintained that time is necessary, the psychological time we are talking about. Heaven is very far away, and one can only come to it through the gradual process of evolution, through suppression, through growth, or through identification with an object, with something superior. Our question is whether it is possible to be free of fear immediately. Otherwise fear breeds disorder; psychological time invariably does breed extraordinary disorder within one."<br><br>"I am questioning the whole idea of evolution, not of the physical being, but of thought which has identified itself with a particular form of existence in time. The brain has obviously evolved to come to this present stage, and it may evolve still further, expand still more. But as a human being, I have lived for forty or fifty years in a world made up of all kinds of theories, conflicts, and concepts; in a society in which greed, envy, and competition have bred wars. I am a part of all that."<br><br>"To a man who is in sorrow, there is no significance in looking to time for a solution, in evolving slowly for the next two million years as a human being. Constituted as we are, is it possible to be free from fear and from psychological time? Physical time must exist; you canÂ’t get away from that. The question is whether psychological time can bring not only order within the individual but also social order. We are part of society; we are not separate. Where there is order in a human being, there will inevitably be social order outwardly."<br><br><strong>A timeless state</strong><br><br>"When we are talking about time, we do not mean chronological time, time by the watch. That time exists, must exist. If you want to catch a bus, if you want to get to a train or meet an appointment tomorrow, you must have chronological time.<br>But is there a tomorrow, psychologically, which is the time of the mind? Is there psychologically tomorrow, actually? Or is the tomorrow created by thought because thought sees the impossibility of change, directly, immediately, and invents this process of gradualness?"<br><br>"I see for myself, as a human being, that it is terribly important to bring about a radical revolution in my way of life, thinking, feeling, and in my actions, and I say to myself, Â“IÂ’ll take time over it; IÂ’ll be different tomorrow, or in a monthÂ’s time.Â” That is the time we are talking about: the psychological structure of time, of tomorrow, or the future, and in that time we live."<br><br>"Time is the past, the present, and the future, not by the watch. I was, yesterday; yesterday operates through today and creates the future. ThatÂ’s a fairly simple thing. I had an experience a year ago that left an imprint on my mind, and the present I translate according to that experience, knowledge, tradition, conditioning, and I create the tomorrow. IÂ’m caught in this circle. This is what we call living; this is what we call time."<br><br>"Thought, which is you, with all its memories, conditioning, ideas, hopes, despair, the utter loneliness of existenceÂ—all that is this time...And to understand a timeless state, when time has come to a stop, one must inquire whether the mind can be free totally of all experience, which is of time."<br><br><strong>The very nature of thought</strong><br><br>"Time is thought, and thought is the process of memory that creates time as yesterday, today and tomorrow, as a thing that we use as a means of achievement, as a way of life. Time to us is extraordinarily important, life after life, one life leading to another life that is modified, that continues. Surely, time is the very nature of thought, thought is time."<br><br>"And as long as time exists as a means to something, the mind cannot go beyond itself Â—the quality of going beyond itself belongs to the new mind which is free of time. Time is a factor in fear. By time, I donÂ’t mean the chronological time, by the watchÂ—second, minute, hour, day, year, but time as a psychological, inward process. It is that fact that brings about fear. Time is fear; as time is thought, it does breed fear; it is time that creates frustration, conflicts, because the immediate perception of the fact, the seeing of the fact is timeless..."<br><br>"So, to understand fear, one must be aware of time Â—time as distance, space; me which thought creates as yesterday, today and tomorrow, using the memory of yesterday to adjust itself to the present and so to condition the future. So, for most of us fear is an extraordinary reality; and a mind that is entangled with fear, with the complexity of fear, can never be free; it can never understand the totality of fear, without understanding the intricacies of time. They go together."<br><br><strong>Time is a poison</strong><br><br>"In your bathroom you have a bottle marked Â“poison,Â” and you know it is poison; you are very careful of that bottle, even in the dark. You are always watching out for it. You donÂ’t say, Â“How am I to keep away, how am I to be watchful of that bottle?Â” You know it is poison, so you are tremendously attentive to it."<br><br>"Time is a poison; it creates disorder. If this is a fact to you, then you can proceed into the understanding of how to be free of fear immediately. But if you are still holding time as a means of freeing yourself, there is no communication between you and me."<br><br>"You see, there is something much more; there may be a totally different kind of time altogether. We only know two times, physical and psychological, and we are caught in time. Physical time plays an important part in the psyche, and the psyche has an important influence on the physical. We are caught in this battle, in this influence. One must accept physical time in order to catch the bus or the train, but if one rejects psychological time completely, then one may come to a time that is something quite different, a time which is not related to either. I wish you would come on with me into that time! Then time is not disorder; it is tremendous order."</blockquote></div>

When you finally do the laundry it will be in the <strong>present "now"</strong>. Most people that you meet will never fully be in the now. They will live there lives looking forward to that next thing that will make the hole inside them fill up. <strong>IN the mean time they will miss all the things that are happining as they happen. </strong><br><br>The point is that "now" is all that is real. <strong>The mind is the only place that Future and Past live. </strong><br><br>A rainbow is only beautiful because it takes you by suprise and your mind for a split second does not think of a future or past and you are stuck experiencing the now if only for a second. Then the rainbow will not be new and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the mind will take over and start running is future/past records again.</span><br><br>Hope that helps explain what now is and how important it is to experience "now.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
