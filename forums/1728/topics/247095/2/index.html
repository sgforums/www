This is my last reply to you. Probably I didn't make myself clear. When I said personal belief, it doesn't mean I don't accept science. Probably it's due to the fact proven. However there are part of science that has its limitation. Like the center of the Earth. I was made to believe from our textbooks that the core is mantle and etc. Till now then I know that it's just a hypothesis, the Earth could be hollow at its center. Like is the neutron in an atom definitely the smallest particle ever exist? Even science claim that there are sub-atomic particles but they couldn't dwell in further. Has science ever been successful in exploring the most bottom of the ocean? Probably it couldn't due to the immerse water pressure.<br><br>My point is that while science is trying its best to prove aything or everything, it has its limitation. And scientists are humans too, they may not be perfect, and probably that may affect the results.<br><br>I've heard a tape recording of a small young boy reciting a lot of suttas. According to the Buddhist Professor who showed us this tape, this boy was living in a village and didn't really receive any buddhist teachings but he could recite simply by his 'memory'. And it's not 1 or 2 sutta but quite a big chunk from the Pali Canon. And some of the other academic made a research on his recitation, it seems the language structure-based is very much earlier than the modern Pali used. It could be most probably be that of used during Lord Buddha's time itself. The boy claimed to have remembered some of his past lives vividly. One of his past lives is a disciple to the Venerable Sariputra.<br><br>My point is that I believe AEN has posted ample scientific findings on rebirth and if really people like Andrew REALLY not satisfy with it, please go conduct your own research and disprove it.<br><br>Andrew, so what's your purpose in involving in this thread? To disprove rebirth?<br><br>My point is still that science is mankind using technology and mundane knowledge in trying to get to know the nature BUT it always has its limitations and probably not always right. BUT (again) base on this it doesn't mean I'm asking people not to believe in science.<br><br>My personal belief in the rebirth is also because I see it logical that life doesn't pop out of nowhere and dies off like that.  I believe life is beyond this physical bodies of ours. It carries on from a body to another which is a life to another.<br><br>My personal belief finds rebirth more logical than a creator God whom suppose to pop out of nowhere itself and start create human for warped reasons only known to him, seeing the sufferings and people waging war in His name.<br><br>Andrew, end of the day, IF you ARE a buddhist (I'm not sure whether are you), then as buddhists we should focus more on solving our problems than again speculating on rebirth. But then again, only you know who you are and your purpose here yourself.<br><br>Probably I won't reply you further till you're off your ego trip.<br><br>Period.</div>
