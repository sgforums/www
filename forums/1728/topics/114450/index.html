            <div class='col-md body'>Prajnaparamita Heart Sutra (Xin Jing):<br><br>Thus have I heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagriha at Vulture Peak mountain, together with a great gathering of the sangha of monks and a great gathering of the sangha of bodhisattvas. At that time the Blessed One entered the samadhi that expresses the dharma called "profound illumination," and at the same time noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, while practicing the profound prajnaparamita, saw in this way: he saw the five skandhas to be empty of nature.<br><br>Then, through the power of the Buddha, venerable Shariputra said to noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, "How should a son or daughter of noble family train, who wishes to practice the profound prajnaparamita?"<br><br>Addressed in this way, noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, said to venerable Shariputra, "O Shariputra, a son or daughter of noble family who wishes to practice the profound prajnaparamita should see in this way: seeing the five skandhas to be empty of nature. Form is emptiness; emptiness also is form. Emptiness is no other than form; form is no other than emptiness. In the same way, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are emptiness. Thus, Shariputra, all dharmas are emptiness. There are no characteristics. There is no birth and no cessation. There is no impurity and no purity. There is no decrease and no increase. Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness, there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no formation, no consciousness; no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind; no appearance, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no dharmas, no eye dhatu up to no mind dhatu, no dhatu of dharmas, no mind consciousness dhatu; no ignorance, no end of ignorance up to no old age and death, no end of old age and death; no suffering, no origin of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path, no wisdom, no attainment, and no non-attainment. Therefore, Shariputra, since the bodhisattvas have no attainment, they abide by means of prajnaparamita.<br><br>Since there is no obscuration of mind, there is no fear. They transcend falsity and attain complete nirvana. All the buddhas of the three times, by means of prajnaparamita, fully awaken to unsurpassable, true, complete enlightenment. Therefore, the great mantra of prajnaparamita, the mantra of great insight, the unsurpassed mantra, the unequaled mantra, the mantra that calms all suffering, should be known as truth, since there is no deception. The prajnaparamita mantra is said in this way:<br><br>OM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA<br><br>Thus, Shariputra, the bodhisattva mahasattva should train in the profound prajnaparamita.<br><br>Then the Blessed One arose from that samadhi and praised noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, saying, "Good, good, O son of noble family; thus it is, O son of noble family, thus it is. One should practice the profound prajnaparamita just as you have taught and all the tathagatas will rejoice."<br><br>When the Blessed One had said this, venerable Shariputra and noble Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva mahasattva, that whole assembly and the world with its gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas rejoiced and praised the words of the Blessed One. death. There is no Four Noble Truth. There is neither wisdom gained nor wisdom to be gained. Therefore, the Practitioner with Perfection Wisdom does not experience encumbrance and fear. Being free from delusions, He ultimately attains nirvana.<br><br>The buddhas of the past, present, and future attain anuttara-samma-sambodhi (roughly, "the ultimate enlightenment") because of the Perfection Wisdom. Beyond all doubts, the Perfection Wisdom is a divine mantra, a great enlightening mantra, and a supreme mantra, which can remove all sufferings. Thus, the Perfection Wisdom mantra is taught to (and spoken by) the Practitioner. The mantra states: "Go, go to the opposite shore, and be enlightened."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The Heart Sutra is the shortest and the most popular sutra in Buddhism. The six hundred volumes of the Maha Prajna Sutra are summarized by the Diamond Sutra in around 5000 words, and the Diamond Sutra is summarized by the Heart Sutra in around 250 words. The Heart Sutra is regarded as the summation of the wisdom of Buddha. It expresses perfectly the insight attained by non-attachment, the doctrine of emptiness.<br><br>Many Buddhist around the world recite the Heart Sutra daily. However, they may not really and fully understand what it is. Some of them may have incredible response, and benefits. In Buddhism, reciting Buddha-name and sutra has great merit and virtues. And, it is one of the effective ways in cultivation of Buddhist Way. In nearly all Buddhist monastery and many Buddhist household, the Heart Sutra is recited by the people regularly on a daily basis.<br><br>If it is the first time you read Heart Sutra, you may find that it is difficult to understand because its way of thinking is different from the traditional ones. Therefore, you should be open-minded, and think deeply and carefully. The Heart Sutra reveals the entire secret of truth of the universe and life. Don't miss it, otherwise you'll regret.</blockquote>If you want a good conceptual understandings of Heart Sutra, here is a line-by-line  <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/heartstr.htm" rel="nofollow">commentary for you</a>.<br><br>For me, I did not read any of these commentaries when I first got an understanding of it when I was 12. I was practising meditation and my mind was quiet without much hindrance. When I came across the line "Form is Emptiness, Emptiness is Form", immediately I have an insight that was so different from my ordinary way of thinking. That experience of insight was something like I have never experienced before. There is a sense of joy, and I think this joy comes from the clarity of the mind. Therefore those who practise chanting heart sutra and meditating daily, I believe will surely one day come to understand it. But first we must tame the mind of wild thoughts.<br><br>So commentaries and conceptual understandings are not absolute, because the essence of heart sutra is beyond all concepts. Emptiness is emptiness because we hold onto the concept of Emptiness, without concepts, Form and Emptiness are One. That is the "true emptiness". Mind is the source of all divisions, seperation, conceptualizing it. We must realise that reality is not as such... there is nothing to grasp, everything is impermanent, interdependant, and simply Conditioned Arising, things are just-as-it-is. Everything is EMPTY of an inherent/independant self and we should not be attached to them.</div>
