              <p>Reflection no 328:<br>[For past reflections, see <a href="http://dharmafarer.org/">http://dharmafarer.org</a>]<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Making nothing of 
              it<br></span> <br>We have all heard of the 3 characteristics of impermanence, 
              unsatisfactoriness and non-self. It is impossi­ble for any of us, in our right 
              minds, to deny that everything in this universe is impermanent. Whatever is 
              impermanent is not satisfactory (or is suffering): we can never be fully 
              satisfied with such a thing, even if we tenaciously grasp to it. Indeed, we keep 
              grasping it because we are not satisfied with it!<br> <br>Whatever is 
              impermanent and unsatisfactory entails that there is no abiding entity behind 
              it. It has no con­trolling factor, nor any kind of essence, whether we call it 
              God, soul, or whatever. Everything that exists is a process. There are no 
              entities. Of course, we may have concepts of an “entity,” but it is merely an 
              idea to discuss or communicate some other ideas with.<br> <br>Very often, the 
              main hindrance to our understanding the higher reality that Buddhism or Buddhist 
              medi­tation offers us is that of language. The kind of language we use, the 
              kinds of questions we ask, often decide whether or not we will readily or really 
              understand the nature of true reality.<br> <br>For example, we often tend to ask 
              questions like “Who created the world?” This is a loaded question, one that is 
              wrongly put. We assume it is a “who” (some kind of entity) that “creates” the 
              world. We assume that the world is “created,” and so we assume that there is 
              also a “creator.” The world is “evolving,” a process; we are all processes, we 
              are evolving beings. We are sets of conditions, physical and mental, working 
              together to produce results which in turn become new conditions, and so on and 
              on.<br> <br>The problem is that whenever we assume something, especially about 
              someone or even about ourselves, the situation is never really what we have 
              assumed it to be. When we assume something to be “that,” it often turns out to 
              be something else. This is a more tricky aspect of impermanence that we are 
              troubled with but less likely to notice. Indeed, if we are able to notice this 
              guile of impermanence, we would surely understand ourselves and the world much 
              better.<br> <br>Things are such that we cannot make sense of them unless we 
              accept that they are impermanent, chang­ing and becoming other. Interestingly, 
              the key term here is “that.” We can rightly say, for example, “<em>that’s</em> the 
              way it is.” And leave it at that, but this is not easy if we do not really 
              understand what it is that we are letting go of.<br> <br><a name="_ftnref1"></a>Let’s use a simple figure: the hand takes the shape of 
              whatever it grasps. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The process of seeing</span>, for exam­ple, is explained as 
              the eye sending out some kind of rays which then takes the shape of what we see 
              and comes back with it. Similarly with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thought</span>: mental energy con­forms 
              to its object (such as a thought) and then returns to the subject. Our idea is 
              “formed of that,” which in Pali is <em>atam,mayata,</em>[1] that is, the mental 
              energy of the experiencer is physically shaped by the thing experienced. In 
              modern terms, this may be said to be a <em>representational</em><a name="_ftnref1"></a> view of perception.<br> <br>The early Buddhist theory of 
              perception, on the other hand, is <em>constructional</em>. We cognize sense-data 
              through the sense-faculties, which are then perceived or recognized by checking 
              them, as it were, against a memory bank of past experiences, so that we can make 
              sense of it, form ideas and motivation for vari­ous actions. In other words, we 
              do not really see even a representation of the external world, but con­struct 
              our own private reality and live with that.<br> <br>In simple terms, we can say 
              that an understanding of <em>atam,mayata </em>corrects our inner vision to see 
              things as they really are. Otherwise, we are constantly pushed ahead or pulled 
              back by the idea, “What is that?” meaning that something else out there is more 
              interesting or more real than what is in here. <br> <br>Try examining this. 
              Thinking the mind is in the body, we say, “my mind” [pointing at the head] or 
              “my mind” [pointing at the chest (the body)]. “It’s all in my mind.” Actually, 
              it’s the other way around. <br> <br>The mind is <em>not </em>in the body, but that 
              <em>the body is in our mind</em>! Even when we are <em>in</em> a body, “our” body, 
              we are not really there if we do not have a conception of “body.” We can only 
              truly know our body by constantly being mindful of it; then, we begin to know 
              what it really is.<br> <br>What do we know about our body? We can see it. We can 
              hear it. We can smell it. We can touch it. <br> <br>But, where does seeing 
              occur?               In the mind.     <br>Where does hearing 
              occur?                    In the mind.<br>Where does smelling 
              occur?                  In the mind.<br>Where does tasting 
              occur?                     In the mind.<br>Where do we feel 
              touch?                         In the mind. <br> <br>When we think or know of 
              the body, we do so through the agency of our minds. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We have never known 
              anything about our body except through our mind</span>. So our entire life, from 
              the very first day, everything we have ever known about our body and the world 
              has happened in our mind. So, where is our body?<br> <br><a name="_ftnref2"></a>It 
              does not mean that there is no physical world, but all that we can meaningfully 
              say is that <em>our expe­rience of the body and of the world happens within our 
              minds</em>. It does not happen anywhere else. It is all happening here, and in 
              this here-ness, that the world’s externality and separateness cease. When we 
              real­ize that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the whole world is in this body of ours</span>,[2] its thingness, 
              its thatness, its otherness<a name="_ftnref2"></a>, stop. We are bet­ter able to 
              see its true nature.<br> <br>This shift of vision is a simple but useful 
              meditation tool we can use any time. It is very useful be­cause it leads us on 
              to see the true reality of the matter. As it were, it turns our world inside 
              out, so that we are able to see that this body is indeed just a set of 
              perceptions, and everything is seen in proper per­spective. <em>It is all 
              happening right here in our minds</em>.<br> <br>Having said that, we are now 
              ready for <em>atam,mayata </em>to take us a step further. At first, <em>atammayata </em>makes us realize that there is really no “that,” only “this.” Then, as we 
              get used to this new level of reality, we soon realize that even the “this” is 
              meaningless, that is, we begin to see the duality of subject and object, or the 
              notions of self and other, as essentially meaningless.<br> <br>In reality, 
              <em>atammayata </em>creates neither an objective observed “thing” known nor a 
              subjective “observ­er” knowing it. There is neither a <em>representation</em> (“thatness”) of reality nor a <em>construction</em> (“thisness”) of reality: there 
              is just <em>true reality</em>. It is the abandoning of the conceiving of 
              “thatness” and “thisness,” of the observer and the observed, of subject and 
              object, of duality. Hence, <em>non-identification</em> refers to the sub­ject­­ive 
              aspect and <em>non-fabrication</em> to the objective. True reality transcends 
              both.<br> <br><em>Atammayata </em>is the realization that, in reality, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there 
              cannot be anything other than ultimate reality</span>. There is <em>neither this nor 
              that. </em>In completely letting go of <em>this </em>and <em>that, </em>the whole 
              relative subject-object world, even at its subtlest level, dissolves away. 
              Transcending both these extremes of perception, <em>atammayata </em>refers 
              nei­ther to a state where the mind does not “go out” to the object and occupy 
              it, nor to a fabricated virtual real­ity relative to the object. The roots of 
              duality have been pulled out. All we see is <em>a spacious whole­ness</em>: this 
              realization is <em>true wisdom</em> and seeing wholeness is <em>true 
              compassion</em>.<br> <br>With this kind of understanding, we will find that a 
              cryptic passage in <strong>the Malunkya,putta Sutta </strong>(S 35.95) becomes clearer, as 
              it is illustrative of<em> atammayata:<br> <br></em>”When, Malunkya,putta, 
              regarding what is seen, heard, sensed and cognized by you, <br> <br>in the 
              seen                   there will only be the seen; <br>in the 
              heard                  there will only be the heard; <br>in the 
              sensed               there will only be the sensed; <br>in the 
              cognized            there will only be the cognized, <br> <br>then, 
              Malunkya,putta, you are ‘not by that.’<br> <br>When Malunkya,putta, you are ‘not
