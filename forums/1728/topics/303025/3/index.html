              <p>What do you mean by religion and what is superstitious?</p>
              <p><br>Is rebirth superstitious?</p>
              <p>There are enough evidence and proof, both meditative and scientific, on rebirth. There are many who remembered past lives, including some in our forum... and there are also many evidences on rebirth by scientists who have done researches and studies and published their findings in scientific journals.</p>
              <p>Buddhists believe rebirth happens (as it is happening right now in this present life, all the time for us) as long as we are still stuck in samsara and it continues life after life. But there is no agent or subject of rebirth, and therefore we do not teach the reincarnation of a soul like Hinduism. We teach rebirth, not reincarnation.</p>
              <p>The greatest mistake and impediment in accepting rebirth among many people is the materialist reductionist belief that consciousness or mind is entirely a material realm. This is definitely not the case. Consciousness cannot be reduced to the material realm, they are mutually conditioning but not mutually dependent. Experiences of out of body experiences, near death experiences and so on proves this to be true. As Thusness once said years back,</p>

              <p>As Science progresses, especially beyond the field of classical science
              (such as quantum physics), it discovers that reality is much more than
              the physical, material world that we usually know. That to treat the
              physical world as having true inherent existence on its own is an
              optical delusion of our consciousness.</p>
              <p>It is completely limiting to reduce mind and consciousness to mere material existence.</p>

              <p>True wisdom allows one to be totally ease with oneself and with others, regardless of the circumstances and the length of time. There is compassion, there is constant high awareness of the 'empty' nature of all things and phenomena.</p>
              <p>If Buddhist knowledge equals to wisdom, then Buddhist scholars or those who have taken Buddhist studies for academic research would be regarded as having wisdom.</p>
              <p>True wisdom, whether from the Buddhist point of view or secular point of view, has to have the ultimate effect of helping others and self to gain everlasting happiness and peace for all. If not, there is no point discussing about the word 'wisdom' for it would become nothing more than a word game or different personal interpretations of what is 'knowledge' and what is 'wisdom'</p>

              <p>The 'conscious light' is talking about the subtlest level of Clear Light, the luminous nature of the mind:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>http://buddhism.kalachakranet.org/rebirth_reincarnation.html</p>
              <p><strong>Question</strong>: When people hear of luminosity of clear 
                              light that dawns at the moment of death they ask why it is called clear 
                              light. What has this got to do with light as we know it?</p>
              <p><br> <strong>Dalai Lama</strong>: "I don't think that in the term clear light, light 
                              should be taken literally. It is sort of metaphoric. This could have its 
                              roots in our terminology of mental will. According to Buddhism, all consciousness 
                              or all cognitive mental events are said to be in the nature of clarity 
                              and luminosity. So it is from that point of view that the choice of the 
                              term light is used. Clear light is the most subtle level of mind, which 
                              can be seen as the basis or the source from which eventual experience 
                              or realisation of Buddhahood, Buddha's wisdom might come about, therefore 
                              it is called clear light. Clear light is a state of mind which becomes 
                              fully manifest only as a consequence of certain sequences or stages of 
                              dissolution, where the mind becomes devoid of certain types of obscurations, 
                              which are again metaphorically described in terms of sun-like, moonlike 
                              and darkness. These refer to the earlier three stages of dissolution which 
                              are technically called, including the clear light stage, the four empties. 
                              At the final stage of dissolution the mind is totally free of all these 
                              factors of obscuration. Therefore it is called clear light. Sort of a 
                              light. It is also possible to understand the usage of the term clear light 
                              in terms of the nature of mind itself. Mind or consciousness is a phenomena 
                              which lacks any obstructive quality. It is non-obstructed."</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>But even it has no 'self existence', is also empty by nature. If luminous clarity is our nature, emptiness is its essence.</p>

              <p>I am fully supportive of scientific studies into spiritual phenomenon, and there is a lot that they can find.</p>
              <p>However, we must also know the limits of modern science in dealing with things like spirituality. Spirituality is not just about 'logic' or 'beliefs', just as science is not just about 'belief'.</p>
              <p><em> </em>As Thusness has written this about 2 years ago -  <a href="/users/97367/posts?page=15">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/users/97367/posts?page=15</a> </p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>Hi Casino_King,<br><br>It is inadequate to use rational thought to understand spiritual matters. Logic is only that branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning. It does not deal with all types of thinking such as remembering (Recalling past life included), dreaming (Dream Yoga), day dreaming, neurosis, learning..etc. These other types of thinking are the job of psychology and parapsychology.<br><br>Although evidence is needed to serve as a base for inductive and deductive reasoning, full proof evidence to arrive at a certain conclusion is not necessary in logical analysis. In daily life, not all reasoning attempts to provide conclusive evidence for the truth of a given conclusion and more often than not, conclusive evidence cannot be produced. For pragmatic ground, we merely want the evidence we arrived at be 'well founded'.<br><br>As human, sleeping and dreaming took up pretty much percentage of our life. We are not just a rational being, to understand human, we have to deal with all these matters with spiritual issues included. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>An additional point:<br><br>Science is but one way of understanding the phenomenon universe. It is neither the only way nor the best way. Just like it is not right to apply the same physical laws that govern a man size universe to the quantum world, we canÂ’t apply the same laws when we deal with a world that is non-material and qualitative (It is not meant for that). We do not create a mathematical formula to define the meaning of Â‘beautyÂ’ and Â‘loveÂ’. Using the wrong approach at times mislead us into conclusion that something is irrational and in turn, we might missed something truly valuable. Just my 2 cents worth. Happy discussing. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>------------</p>
              <p>Yes Casino_King,<br><br>I certainly agree with what you said. Transcendental experience till now must remain at a personal level and it is not wise to over emphasize these experiences and make objective claims. Since science has ascended to become the ruling mode of knowing, it will have to do something to account for non-material phenomenon. Perhaps quantum mechanics will succeed in doing so in future but till then, it should not stop us from further investigating into our own existence, our nature and the meaning of life through other modes of knowing other than science. Nice chat. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br>-------------</p>

              <div class="quote_body">It does not matter much whether this or there things really exist. Science has tried to prove time over time and this kind of things can take super- long time.<br></div>
              <p>I agree with most of the points you said except this. Personally I think it does matter and our entire value system and the meaning of existence will change. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br><br>My personal view:<br><br>If we are serious about life and the meaning of our own existence, we have to take steps into understanding it. It is not just about fear, it springs from the love of life and to find out more about what it is. Religion offers what science has not yet able to offer and we have the choice to choose the religion that suits us. Even if we have experienced the reality of the transcendental and rebirth, it is not final, we will soon realize how little we know about our own reality. There is no point over emphasizing anything and make objective claims about a subjective experience. Let science remains as it is and not over/under assert what it is not. The journey must still continue but walk with a truthful heart. To truly gain, the sincerity must be there.<br><br>Asking the reality of Â‘rebirthÂ’ and experiencing our luminous clarity is Â“unlockingÂ” the mystery of life, we should not expect it to come easy. To unlock this mystery, seriously make all effort into understanding the meaning no-self and emptiness and practice with all our heart. It is already taught, we have to take the steps. It is the gate towards unlocking the doubt we have in mind. This has to be subjective, it has to be personal, it is an individual Â‘touchÂ’ and authentication of what that is being taught by Buddha. All the core teachings of Buddhism are to be found here, now and this moment, it is not else where, not even a moment of thought away. We will be convinced by this Â‘touchÂ’ even it is not proven objectively by science. Resting in our pristine awareness and being authenticated by everything without gap, doubt cannot arise and by this, we remain undisturbed. My 2 cents, happy journey to all. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
