            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, buddhist knowledge is very very different from wisdom. I think what you mean here is how much a person knows about Buddhism based on what one reads from Sutras. This will be the same as intelligence and intelligence is very different from Wisdom.<br><br>Wisdom, from what I understand is accumulated or acquired through practise. Reading from Sutras just provide us a basic understanding but practising puts a person into a deeper level of understanding. Just like Math, one will understand through reading. But a deeper level comes from practising.<br><br>I think most pple will know the following flow:<br>Ethical Discipline --&gt; Peaceful serenity --&gt; Wisdom<br><br>And the first thing, Ethical Discipline already told us that the answer is through practising, stablize the mind to attain peaceful serenity (samadhi in most cases) and then one will able to see the ultimate reality... which is through Wisdom.<br><br>And about the Divine Eye thingy, it is not even Wisdom yet. And even to attain this feat, one will have to practise first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>This is MY 1.99cents comments.</div>

But there are also enlightened beings, arhats, in modern days (i.e. today) that still live and teach dharma... especially in the Thai forest tradition.<br><br>Similarly there are sincere practitioners, enlightened ones, who still live in Singapore, along with others who aren't practicing. There's a mix of both sides.<br><br>As long as you are sincere in your practice, with an intense desire for truth and liberation... your practice will certainly come to fruition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In another post:<br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong><br>The question 'what' or 'who' is exactly pointed out by Buddha to be irrelevant, false from the beginning.<br><br>In other words -- the question cannot be asked that way, because to say 'what' or 'who' presumes there must be an existent entity or self behind rebirth, but in reality no such entity can be found. In Buddhism, there is no such thing as an existing soul or atman that 'passes on' to the next life.<br><br>Rather, the Buddha say, it should be correctly asked 'Why', or "With what as condition is there birth?'<br><br>And the answer for that is very simple. There is birth, i.e. suffering, because of affliction and action. As long as the aggregates are afflicted, afflicted aggregates will continue to be appropriated.<br><br>And the primary affliction/delusion is the conceit of 'I am', and this is the '7th Consciousness', and it is this conditioned by the karmic propensities of the 8th Consciousness that drives rebirth.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">In Madhyamaka it is explained there is birth because of the innate self-grasping "I am" appearing to the afflicted mind. It is asserted that what appropriates birth in a new series of aggregates is the mental habit "I am." That "I am" is baseless, has no correspondence in the aggregates or seperate from them or in any one of them, just as a car is not found in its parts, seperate from them, or in any one of the parts. Nevertheless, the imputation "car" allows us to use cars effectively. Likewise, the mental habit "I am" is proper as both the agent of action and the object upon which it ripens even though it is basically unreal and has no basis in the aggregates, outside the aggregates, or in any one of them, but allows us to treat the aggreates as a nominally designated "person".</span><br><br>But to be more technical, the Buddha taught the 12 Dependent links of Origination which is founded on the principle of Dependent Arising.<br><br>Note how in each case the Buddha rejects the question of 'Who' or 'What' as an assumption that is fundamentally wrong, and insteads, inform the questioner of what he ought to have asked: "With what as condition...?" and finally "With what as condition is there birth?" (note that birth = 'becoming' in Pali terms)<br><br>The full sutra is here:<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.012.nypo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.012.nypo.html</a><br><br>[b]Phagguna Sutta</strong><br><br>"There are, O monks, four nutriments for the sustenance of beings born, and for the support of beings seeking birth. What are the four? Edible food, coarse and fine; secondly, sense-impression; thirdly, volitional thought; fourthly, consciousness."<br><br>After these words, the venerable Moliya-Phagguna addressed the Exalted One as follows:<br><br>"Who, O Lord, consumes1 the nutriment consciousness?"<br><br>"The question is not correct," said the Exalted One. "I do not say that 'he consumes.'2 If I had said so, then the question 'Who consumes?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the correct way to ask the question will be: 'For what is the nutriment consciousness (the condition)?'3 And to that the correct reply is: 'The nutriment consciousness4 is a condition for the future arising of a renewed existence;5 when that has come into being, there is (also) the sixfold sense-base; and conditioned by the sixfold sense-base is sense-impression.'"6<br><br>"Who, O Lord, has a sense-impression?"<br><br>"The question is not correct," said the Exalted One.<br><br>"I do not say that 'he has a sense-impression.' Had I said so, then the question 'Who has a sense-impression?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the correct way to ask the question will be 'What is the condition of sense-impression?' And to that the correct reply is: 'The sixfold sense-base is a condition of sense-impression, and sense-impression is the condition of feeling.'"<br><br>"Who, O Lord, feels?"<br><br>"The question is not correct," said the Exalted One. "I do not say that 'he feels.' Had I said so, then the question 'Who feels?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the correct way to ask the question will be 'What is the condition of feeling?' And to that the correct reply is: 'sense-impression is the condition of feeling; and feeling is the condition of craving.'"<br><br>"Who, O Lord, craves?"<br><br>"The question is not correct," said the Exalted One. "I do not say that 'he craves.' Had I said so, then the question 'Who craves?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the correct way to ask the question will be 'What is the condition of craving?' And to that the correct reply is: 'Feeling is the condition of craving, and craving is the condition of clinging.'"<br><br><strong>"Who, O Lord, clings?"<br><br>"The question is not correct," said the Exalted One, "I do not say that 'he clings.' Had I said so, then the question 'Who clings?' would be appropriate. But since I did not speak thus, the correct way to ask the question will be 'What is the condition of clinging?' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And to that the correct reply is: 'Craving is the condition of clinging; and clinging is the condition of the process of becoming.' Such is the origin of this entire mass of suffering.7</span></strong><br><br>"Through the complete fading away and cessation of even these six bases of sense-impression, sense-impression ceases;8 through the cessation of sense-impression, feeling ceases; through the cessation of feeling, craving ceases; through the cessation of craving, clinging ceases; through the cessation of clinging, the process of becoming ceases; through the cessation of the process of becoming, birth ceases; through the cessation of birth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering."[/b]</blockquote></div>
