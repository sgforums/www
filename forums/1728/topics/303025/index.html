            <div class='col-md body'>Spiritual life has nothing to do with how smart you are. In fact, being smart can be an obstacle. You can become proud and have more clutter in your brain.<br><br>There's another interesting story, about how Ananda became enlightened. Ananda was the only one left at the time of the first council of Buddha's own disciples who didn't become an arhat. He was Buddha's attendant. He heard every word that Buddha taught, and memorized them all, but he didn't meditate much because he was too busy. Some time after Buddha's death, there was a meeting of all the arhats, but since Ananda wasn't an arhat he couldn't go. So he kept meditating, trying at the last minute to become enlightened, and it got to be midnight, 2, 3 o'clock in the morning of the first council of Buddhist arhats, but still he couldn't make it, even though he was the repository of all of Buddha's words. All the other arhats wanted him to go, but he couldn't since he wasn't an arhat. Finally it got to be 3:45 in the morning, 15 minutes before the 4:00 wakeup call. Finally, <strong>Ananda just gave up </strong>and said, "Oh ********, I'm not an arhat." Then he got enlightened, because he saw things as they were. It was the end of the struggle. No more trying to become an arhat, and he became an arhat. Many Buddhist traditions teach this story. That says something to me. It eloquently speaks to being yourself, rather than to mere doing and self-improvement. It expresses clear vision, seeing things just as they are, rather than as we'd like them to be. It is a lovely, timeless story.<br><br>When I visited the place where that occurred, near Vulture's Peak, I was very moved and inspired. I felt, "I am just me, and I can afford to be just as I am. It's OK! Thanks, gentle Ananda, for your teaching and inspiration."<br>--Teaching by Surya Das.<br><br>/\</div>

You can become proud and have more clutter in your brain.<br><br>There's another interesting story, about how Ananda became enlightened. Ananda was the only one left at the time of the first council of Buddha's own disciples who didn't become an arhat. He was Buddha's attendant. He heard every word that Buddha taught, and memorized them all, but he didn't meditate much because he was too busy. Some time after Buddha's death, there was a meeting of all the arhats, but since Ananda wasn't an arhat he couldn't go. So he kept meditating, trying at the last minute to become enlightened, and it got to be midnight, 2, 3 o'clock in the morning of the first council of Buddhist arhats, but still he couldn't make it, even though he was the repository of all of Buddha's words. All the other arhats wanted him to go, but he couldn't since he wasn't an arhat. Finally it got to be 3:45 in the morning, 15 minutes before the 4:00 wakeup call. Finally, [b]Ananda just gave up </strong>and said, "Oh ********, I'm not an arhat." Then he got enlightened, because he saw things as they were. It was the end of the struggle. No more trying to become an arhat, and he became an arhat. Many Buddhist traditions teach this story. That says something to me. It eloquently speaks to being yourself, rather than to mere doing and self-improvement. It expresses clear vision, seeing things just as they are, rather than as we'd like them to be. It is a lovely, timeless story.<br><br>When I visited the place where that occurred, near Vulture's Peak, I was very moved and inspired. I felt, "I am just me, and I can afford to be just as I am. It's OK! Thanks, gentle Ananda, for your teaching and inspiration."<br>--Teaching by Surya Das.<br><br>/\[/b]</blockquote>Thanks for sharing.  Although the message carries invaluable advice, it is important not to mistake "seeing things just as they areÂ” as "not forcing oneself to be more than what one is Â”.  Such Â‘growing wisdomÂ’ of teaching us how to deal with ourselves does not make Ananda an Arhat.<br><br>In my opinion, it will be more advisable to think that Ananda is pondering over a question similar to what Buddha had taught Bahiya in Bahiya Sutta that Â‘in hearing, just the heardÂ’.  Ananda struggled hard to penetrate the profound teaching of Buddha, the meaning of Anatta.  He finally realized the truth of anatta thereby freeing himself from artificial struggle.  There is no Ananda to attain Arhatship.  Â‘In hearing, it is truly only just sound, no hearerÂ’.  Always so regardless of oneÂ’s depth of understanding, anatta remains a dharma seal, effortlessly so!<br><br>My 2 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
