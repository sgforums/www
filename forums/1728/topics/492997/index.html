              Detained While on Pilgrimage</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">EDWARD WONG NOV. 18, 2016
              The New York Times </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Forty-one Tibetans who were detained by the Nepalese police
              while they were on a bus bound for India have been released to a Nepalese human
              rights group, an advocate for Tibetan rights said Friday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The advocate, Kate Saunders, of the International Campaign
              for Tibet, said early Friday in London that the human rights group, the Human
              Rights Organization of Nepal, and other contacts in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital,
              had told her that immigration officials and the police had allowed all the
              Tibetans to be released.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ms. Saunders said the Tibetans were mostly from Kham and
              Amdo, Tibetan regions now ruled by China, and were on a pilgrimage to sacred
              sites in Nepal and India. It is likely that they planned to go in January to an
              important Buddhist ceremony, the Kalachakra teaching, in Bodh Gaya, an Indian
              city, she said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is unclear what those Tibetans will do now. They could end
              up at the Kathmandu transit center of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
              From there, many Tibetans make their way to India, against China’s wishes. Ms.
              Saunders said the Tibetans were in a “very precarious situation.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Human Rights Organization of Nepal did not respond to an
              email asking for an update on the situation of the Tibetans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans, is
              expected to teach at the Kalachakra gathering from Jan. 3 to Jan. 14. He offers
              this teaching regularly at different places, and many Tibetans try to make
              their way to Bodh Gaya, the site where the Buddha attained enlightenment, when
              the Dalai Lama travels there from his home in northern India to teach.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 2012, Chinese security officials detained hundreds of
              Tibetans after they returned from the Kalachakra in Bodh Gaya. Many of them
              were released later. The Chinese government opposes the Dalai Lama and calls
              him a “splittist,” but Tibetans remain devoted to him, and many try to travel
              to India to see him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Since a widespread uprising across Tibetan regions in 2008,
              the Chinese government has increased its security presence on the Tibet-Nepal
              border and has prevented many Tibetans from leaving. The number of Tibetans
              making their way to Nepal has plummeted. China is also exercising greater
              influence over Nepal, and Tibetans in Nepal complain of more detentions there
              and a ban on anti-China protests.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ms. Saunders said Chinese officials were making great efforts
              to prevent Tibetans from traveling to Bodh Gaya this year for the Dalai Lama’s
              teaching.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“What we know is that the Chinese authorities have tightened
              controls on Tibetans, in some areas going from house to house to confiscate
              people’s passports,” she said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“In the last few weeks, government officials have confiscated
              passports in the Tibetan areas of Qinghai and Gansu, and according to some
              sources, also in Sichuan and the Tibet Autonomous Region,” she added. “Some
              Tibetans who have already arrived in Nepal and India for pilgrimage and for
              attending the religious ceremony in Bodh Gaya have already been ordered to
              return, and their families pressured by the authorities.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“So no doubt for this group of 41, things will be very
              difficult,” she said, “particularly given that they will now be on the radar of
              the Chinese authorities in Nepal, given the nature of the relationship between
              the two governments.”</span></p>
