              <p>Found this interesting so I am sharing them.</p>
              <p>From <strong>Virmalakirti Nirdesa Sutra</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <div id="cdPostContentBox_MxI1AWT4GKB8NB" class="postContent" style="display: block;"><strong> 7. The Goddess </strong></div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>Thereupon,
                  Manjusri, the crown prince, addressed the Licchavi Vimalakirti: "Good
                  sir, how should a bodhisattva regard all living beings?"</div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>Vimalakirti
                  replied, "Manjusri, a bodhisattva should regard all livings beings as a
                  wise man regards the reflection of the moon in water or as magicians
                  regard men created by magic. <br> <br>He should regard them as being like a face in a mirror; <br>like the water of a mirage; <br>like the sound of an echo; <br>like a mass of clouds in the sky; <br>like the previous moment of a ball of foam; <br>like the appearance and disappearance of a bubble of water; <br>like the core of a plantain tree; <br>like a flash of lightning; <br>like the fifth great element; <br>like the seventh sense-medium; <br>like the appearance of matter in an immaterial realm; <br>like a sprout from a rotten seed; <br>like a tortoise-hair coat; <br>like the fun of games for one who wishes to die; <br>like the egoistic views of a stream-winner; <br>like a third rebirth of a once-returner; <br>like the descent of a nonreturner into a womb; <br>like the existence of desire, hatred, and folly in a saint; <br>like thoughts of avarice, immorality, wickedness, and hostility in a bodhisattva who has attained tolerance; <br>like the instincts of passions in a Tathagata; <br>like the perception of color in one blind from birth; <br>like the inhalation and exhalation of an ascetic absorbed in the meditation of cessation; <br>like the track of a bird in the sky; <br>like the erection of a eunuch; <br>like the pregnancy of a barren woman; <br>like the unproduced passions of an emanated incarnation of the Tathagata; <br>like dream-visions seen after waking; <br>like the passions of one who is free of conceptualizations; <br>like fire burning without fuel; <br>like the reincarnation of one who has attained ultimate liberation.</div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>"Precisely thus, Manjusri, does a bodhisattva who realizes the ultimate selflessness consider all beings."</div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>Manjusri
                  then asked further, "Noble sir, if a bodhisattva considers all living
                  beings in such a way, how does he generate the great love toward them?"</div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>Vimalakirti
                  replied, "Manjusri, when a bodhisattva considers all living beings in
                  this way, he thinks: 'Just as I have realized the Dharma, so should I
                  teach it to living beings.' Thereby, he generates the love that is
                  truly a refuge for all living beings;</div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>the love that is peaceful because free of grasping; <br>the love that is not feverish, because free of passions; <br>the love that accords with reality because it is equanimous in all three times; <br>the love that is without conflict because free of the violence of the passions; <br>the love that is nondual because it is involved neither with the external nor with the internal; <br>the love that is imperturbable because totally ultimate.<br> <br>"Thereby he generates the love that is firm, its high resolve unbreakable, like a diamond; <br>the love that is pure, purified in its intrinsic nature; <br>the love that is even, its aspirations being equal; <br>the saint's love that has eliminated its enemy; <br>the bodhisattva's love that continuously develops living beings; <br>The Tathagata's love that understands reality; <br>the Buddha's love that causes living beings to awaken from their sleep; <br>the love that is spontaneous because it is fully enlightened spontaneously; <br>the love that is enlightenment because it is unity of experience; <br>the love that has no presumption because it has eliminated attachment and aversion; <br>the love that is great compassion because it infuses the Mahayana with radiance; <br>the love that is never exhausted because it acknowledges voidness and selflessness; <br>the love that is giving because it bestows the gift of Dharma free of the tight fist of a bad teacher; <br>the love that is morality because it improves immoral living beings; <br>the love that is tolerance because it protects both self and others; <br>the love that is effort because it takes responsibility for all living beings; <br>the love that is contemplation because it refrains from indulgence in tastes; <br>the love that is wisdom because it causes attainment at the proper time; <br>the love that is liberative technique because it shows the way everywhere; <br>the love that is without formality because it is pure in motivation;<br>the love that is without deviation because it acts from decisive motivation; <br>the love that is high resolve because it is without passions; <br>the love that is without deceit because it is not artificial; <br>the love that is happiness because it introduces living beings to the happiness of the Buddha. <br>Such, Manjusri, is the great love of a bodhisattva."</div>
              <div class="postContent" style="display: block;"><br>Manjusri: What is the great compassion of a bodhisattva?<br>Vimalakirti: It is the giving of all accumulated roots of virtue to all living beings.<br>Manjusri: What is the great joy of the bodhisattva?<br>Vimalakirti: It is to be joyful and without regret in giving.<br>Manjusri: What is the equanimity of the bodhisattva?<br>Vimalakirti: It is what benefits both self and others.<br>Manjusri: To what should one resort when terrified by fear of life?<br>Vimalakirti: Manjusri, a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha.<br>Manjusri: Where should he who wishes to resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha take his stand?<br>Vimalakirti: He should stand in equanimity toward all living beings.<br>Manjusri: Where should he who wishes to stand in equanimity toward all living beings take his stand?<br>Vimalakirti: He should live for the liberation of all living beings.<br>Manjusri: What should he who wishes to liberate all living beings do?<br>Vimalakirti: He should liberate them from their passions.<br>Manjusri: How should he who wishes to eliminate passions apply himself?<br>Vimalakirti: He should apply himself appropriately.<br>Manjusri: How should he apply himself, to "apply himself appropriately"?<br>Vimalakirti: He should apply himself to productionlessness and to destructionlessness.<br>Manjusri: What is not produced? And what is not destroyed?<br>Vimalakirti: Evil is not produced and good is not destroyed.<br>Manjusri: What is the root of good and evil?<br>Vimalakirti: Materiality is the root of good and evil.<br>Manjusri: What is the root of materiality?<br>Vimalakirti: Desire is the root of materiality.<br>Manjusri: What is the root of desire and attachment?<br>Vimalakirti: Unreal construction is the root of desire.<br>Manjusri: What is the root of unreal construction?<br>Vimalakirti: The false concept is its root.<br>Manjusri: What is the root of the false concept?<br>Vimalakirti: Baselessness.<br>Manjusri: What it the root of baselessness?<br>Vimalakirti:
                  Manjusri, when something is baseless, how can it have any root?
                  Therefore, all things stand on the root which is baseless.</div>

              <p>Thereupon, a certain goddess who lived in that house, having heard this
              teaching of the Dharma of the great heroic bodhisattvas, and being
              delighted, pleased, and overjoyed, manifested herself in a material
              body and showered the great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas, and the
              great disciples with heavenly flowers. When the flowers fell on the
              bodies of the bodhisattvas, they fell off on the floor, but when they
              fell on the bodies of the great disciples, they stuck to them and did
              not fall. The great disciples shook the flowers and even tried to use
              their magical powers, but still the flowers would not shake off. Then,
              the goddess said to the venerable Sariputra, "Reverend Sariputra, why
              do you shake these flowers?" <br>Sariputra replied, "Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious persons and so we are trying to shake them off."<br><br>The
              goddess said, "Do not say that, reverend Sariputra. Why? These flowers
              are proper indeed! Why? Such flowers have neither constructual thought
              nor discrimination. But the elder Sariputra has both constructual
              thought and discrimination. <br><br>"Reverend Sariputra, impropriety
              for one who has renounced the world for the discipline of the rightly
              taught Dharma consists of constructual thought and discrimination, yet
              the elders are full of such thoughts. One who is without such thoughts
              is always proper. <br><br>"Reverend Sariputra, see how these flowers
              do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes, the
              bodhisattvas! This is because they have eliminated constructual
              thoughts and discriminations.<br><br>"For example, evil spirits have
              power over fearful men but cannot disturb the fearless. Likewise, those
              intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms, sounds,
              smells, tastes, and textures, which do not disturb those who are free
              from fear of the passions inherent in the constructive world. Thus,
              these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated
              their instincts for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of
              those who have eliminated their instincts. Therefore, the flowers do
              not stick to the bodies of these bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all
              instincts." <br><br>Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long have you been in this house?"<br><br>The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation."<br><br>Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some time?"<br><br>The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some time?"<br><br>At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.<br><br>The
              goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why do you
              not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the question." <br><br>Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say.<br><br>Goddess:
              All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of
              liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can
              it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither
              internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else.
              Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning
              speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all things! <br><br>Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred, and folly?<br><br>Goddess:
              "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" that is the
              teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of pride are taught
              that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself liberation.<br> <br>Sariputra: Excellent! Excellent, goddess! Pray, what have you attained, what have you realized, that you have such eloquence?<br><br>Goddess:
              I have attained nothing, reverend Sariputra. I have no realization.
              Therefore I have such eloquence. Whoever thinks, "I have attained! I
              have realized!" is overly proud in the discipline of the well-taught
              Dharma. <br><br>Sariputra: Goddess, do you belong to the disciple-vehicle, to the solitary-vehicle, or to the great vehicle?<br><br>Goddess:
              I belong to the disciple-vehicle when I teach it to those who need it.
              I belong to the solitary-vehicle when I teach the twelve links of
              dependent origination to those who need them. And, since I never
              abandon the great compassion, I belong to the great vehicle, as all
              need that teaching to attain ultimate liberation. <br><br>Nevertheless,
              reverend Sariputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a
              magnolia wood, but only the magnolia flowers, so, reverend Sariputra,
              living in this house, which is redolent with the perfume of the virtues
              of the Buddha-qualities, one does not smell the perfume of the
              disciples and the solitary sages. Reverend Sariputra, the Sakras, the
              Brahmas, the Lokapalas, the devas, nagas, yaksas, gandharvas, asuras,
              garudas, kimnaras, and mahoragas who live in this house hear the Dharma
              from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by the perfume of the
              virtues of the Buddha-qualities, proceed to conceive the spirit of
              enlightenment. <br><br>Reverend Sariputra, I have been in this house
              for twelve years, and I have heard no discourses concerning the
              disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning the
              great love, the great compassion, and the inconceivable qualities of
              the Buddha. <br><br>Reverend Sariputra, eight strange and wonderful things manifest themselves constantly in this house. What are these eight?<br><br>A
              light of golden hue shines here constantly, so bright that it is hard
              to distinguish day and night; and neither the moon nor the sun shines
              here distinctly. That is the first wonder of this house.<br>Furthermore,
              reverend Sariputra, whoever enters this house is no longer troubled by
              his passions from the moment he is within. That is the second strange
              and wonderful thing.<br><br>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house
              is never forsaken by Sakra, Brahma, the Lokapalas, and the bodhisattvas
              from all the other buddha-fields. That is the third strange and
              wonderful thing.<br><br>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is
              never empty of the sounds of the Dharma, the discourse on the six
              transcendences, and the discourses of the irreversible wheel of the
              Dharma. That is the fourth strange and wonderful thing. <br><br>Furthermore,
              reverend Sariputra, in this house one always hears the rhythms, songs,
              and music of gods and men, and from this music constantly resounds the
              sound of the infinite Dharma of the Buddha. That is the fifth strange
              and wonderful thing. <br><br>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this
              house there are always four inexhaustible treasures, replete with all
              kinds of jewels, which never decrease, although all the poor and
              wretched may partake to their satisfaction. That is the sixth strange
              and wonderful thing. <br><br>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, at the
              wish of this good man, to this house come the innumerable Tathagatas of
              the ten directions, such as the Tathagatas Sakyamuni, Amitabha,
              Aksobhya, Ratnasri, Ratnarcis, Ratnacandra, Ratnavyuha, Dusprasaha,
              Sarvarthasiddha, Ratnabahula, Simhakirti, Simhasvara, and so forth; and
              when they come they teach the door of Dharma called the "Secrets of the
              Tathagatas" and then depart. That is the seventh strange and wonderful
              thing. <br><br>Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, all the splendors of
              the abodes of the gods and all the splendors of the fields of the
              Buddhas shine forth in this house. That is the eighth strange and
              wonderful thing.<br><br>Reverend Sariputra, these eight strange and
              wonderful things are seen in this house. Who then, seeing such
              inconceivable things, would believe the teaching of the disciples?<br><br>Sariputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?<br><br>Goddess: Although I have sought my "female state" for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. <br><br>Reverend
              Sariputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you
              ask her, "What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your
              female state?" <br><br>Sariputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?<br><br>Goddess:
              Just so, reverend Sariputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would
              you think, "What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical
              incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?" <br><br>Thereupon,
              the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Sariputra to
              appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the
              goddess, transformed into Sariputra, said to Sariputra, transformed
              into a goddess, "Reverend Sariputra, what prevents you from
              transforming yourself out of your female state?" <br><br>And
              Sariputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, "I no longer appear
              in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I
              do not know what to transform!"<br><br>The goddess continued, "If the
              elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could
              also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of
              women in just the same way<br>as the elder appears in the form of a
              woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of
              women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, 'In all things, there is
              neither male nor female.'" <br><br>Then, the goddess released her
              magical power and each returned to his ordinary form. She then said to
              him, "Reverend Sariputra, what have you done with your female form?" <br><br>Sariputra: I neither made it nor did I change it.<br><br>Goddess:
              Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they are not
              made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha.<br><br>Sariputra: Goddess, where will you be born when you transmigrate after death?<br><br>Goddess: I will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathagata are born.<br><br>Sariputra: But the emanated incarnations of the Tathagata do not transmigrate nor are they born.<br><br>Goddess: All things and living beings are just the same; they do not transmigrate nor are they born!<br><br>Sariputra: Goddess, how soon will you attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood?<br><br>Goddess:
              At such time as you, elder, become endowed once more with the qualities
              of an ordinary individual, then will I attain the perfect enlightenment
              of Buddhahood.<br><br>Sariputra: Goddess, it is impossible that I should become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual.<br><br>Goddess:
              Just so, reverend Sariputra, it is impossible that I should attain the
              perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood! Why? Because perfect enlightenment
              stands upon the impossible. Because it is impossible, no one attains
              the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood. <br><br>Sariputra: But the
              Tathagata has declared: "The Tathagatas, who are as numerous as the
              sands of the Ganges, have attained perfect Buddhahood, are attaining
              perfect Buddhahood, and will go on attaining perfect Buddhahood." <br><br>Goddess:
              Reverend Sariputra, the expression, "the Buddhas of the past, present
              and future," is a conventional expression made up of a certain number
              of syllables. The Buddhas are neither past, nor present, nor future.
              Their enlightenment transcends the three times! But tell me, elder,
              have you attained sainthood? <br><br>Sariputra: It is attained, because there is no attainment.<br><br>Goddess: Just so, there is perfect enlightenment because there is no attainment of perfect enlightenment.<br><br>Then
              the Licchavi Vimalakirti said to the venerable elder Sariputra,
              "Reverend Sariputra, this goddess has already served ninety-two million
              billion Buddhas. She plays with the superknowledges. She has truly
              succeeded in all her vows. She has gained the tolerance of the
              birthlessness of things. She has actually attained irreversibility. She
              can live wherever she wishes on the strength of her vow to develop
              living beings."</p>

              <div class="videoDescDiv expand-content"><span>According
                  to all the world's great wisdom traditions, the secret to happiness is
                  said to be remarkably simple: all we need to do is cherish others, to
                  learn to love as deeply as we possibly can, to the bottomless depths of
                  our souls. These words, however, are as easy to read as they are to
                  write—truly opening ourselves to another human being, seeing through
                  another's eyes and feeling another's heartbeat as our very own, is to
                  embrace the impossible pain of existence. After all, beneath the veneer
                  of day to day life, we all know the same hidden dread, the desperation
                  and loneliness we were all born into. And through the sacred channel of
                  human empathy, the veils of comfort, desire, and separation begin to
                  fall away, slowly revealing the true face of the manifest world:
                  suffering.<br><br>Where then, in the sulphur and shadow of this
                  uniquely human hell, is our "happiness" to be found? Effortlessly we
                  watch as the question unasks itself, and the flames of our suffering
                  become just another texture of our salvation—the cool waters of
                  liberation caresses our calloused skin, and together we can finally
                  awaken from this nightmare. </span> <span>(<a class="smallText eLink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF_gCAquRnc">less</a>)</span></div>
