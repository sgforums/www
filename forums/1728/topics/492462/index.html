              vernacular of of the so-called western world. It is no longer considered exotic
              to know the word 'karma' or to advocate for mindfulness; we know about the
              Dalai Lama and many of us harbour at least an aesthetic appreciation of Zen. In
              fact, the highly urbanized and refined minimalism so evident in the aesthetic
              staging of Zen is a powerful stimulant to tens of thousands of our companion
              citizens who have taken up the study of the Middle Way (ie Buddhist) practice.
              But we should never forget that the vast majority of western people will not
              become Japanese or Chinese or Vietnamese or Tibetan Buddhists. If there is ever
              to be a form of Buddhist thought that has a positively transformative effect in
              the western world, interested individuals need to examine the very basics of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Buddhism is full of fascinating takes on logic
              and morality and just what constitutes good behaviour. But under all that talk
              about karma and causation is the discrete notion of suffering. This is the core
              concern of Buddhism from its very beginning and one of the shared attributes of
              the myriad of Buddhisms.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Good Behaviour is defined many ways; 8-fold path,
              6 perfections and many other schemas, but the basic recipe is the 5 Prohibitory
              Precepts. Lay Buddhists can embrace these and be assured that a moral life will
              ensue. The five are: <em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>not
              taking what is not given, not doing harmful things, no careless or hurtful
              speech, no abuse of sensuality and not to imbibe intoxicants to the point of
              heedlessness</span></em>. What's interesting about this is: the initial
              template of good behaviour is that it involves cessation. Cessation means
              getting to zero; zero greed, zero harm, zero heedlessness in relation to
              speech, sexuality and intoxicants.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">From the perspective of Buddhist practice, what
              we do in meditation is erode the edifice of our own suffering and at the same
              time almost eliminate ourselves as a cause of suffering. Basic Buddhism teaches
              that suffering is caused by craving, clinging and that whole domain of
              attachment. This ultimately means that every desire that prompts action causes
              suffering related to the degree of attachment to that desire. In meditation we
              deliberately seek to configure a presence in which desire has been reduced to
              near zero.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">If Buddhist thought is ever to have real
              purchase in the west, a subtle shift will have to happen. Buddhist morality is
              centred on kindness being more important than rightness. Our western
              civilization is very compassionate and very generous, but it is also axiomatic
              that we accept great cruelty in the name of rightness. In a Buddhist morality
              the importance of punishment is diminished and our whole moral structure takes
              on a softer configuration. Meticulous morality becomes more of a scrupulous
              morality. This means less behaviour that is energized by fear and more
              behaviour motivated by a sense of personal value and balance. Meditation is the
              activity that allows that small shift to occur: initially as a recognition of
              its veracity and then as an evolving reference point for thought, word and
              deed.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.25in; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Zen meditation teaches the techniques of
              reducing toward zero such internal activities as judgments, opinions and
              attachments of all kinds. When we pay attention to our breath, the mind trends
              toward stillness and calm. Having zero desire beyond breath and posture, there
              is little suffering. In meditation we reduce suffering in which we are
              complicit and by doing not-doing we are not the cause of further harm to
              beings.</span></p>

Not everyone embraces buddhism or true path of Buddhism, so some instances required rightness such as police and Judge against crime, it needs some degree of kindness on handling criminals. Buddhism or Zen, is Buddha or one mind, which emphasises all beings are equally the same as Buddha, and are Buddha or would be Buddha or oneness, thus undaunted kindness is the basis attributing to the essence of all beings are genuinely originated from Buddha and one mind, omnisciently neither increase nor decrease and inclusively all sentience yet non attachment to all existences :) </p></div>
