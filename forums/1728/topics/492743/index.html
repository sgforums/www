              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="color: #1a1a1a; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 18.7pt; text-align: justify;">Pchum Ben – the Festival
              of Ancestors – is, along with Khmer New Year, the most important in Cambodia’s
              Buddhist calendar. No matter how busy people are, they will spend time
              preparing food and going to the pagoda with family and friends.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“The word Pchum in Khmer
              means ‘to meet’ or ‘to gather’,” explains Phal Lean, an elderly monk at Puok
              pagoda, which is situated 10 kilometres from Siem Reap city. “And the word Ben
              refers to the balls of rice. So, in other words, Pchum Ben means to collect
              food to give to the monks.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>The monks, who are
              intermediaries between this world and the next, fulfil a vital role at Pchum
              Ben, the 15-day festival that marks the time when the spirits who are residing
              in hell – the pret spirits – return to the world of the living in order to
              receive offerings from their relatives.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“But the spirits have
              only 15 days before they have to go back,” says Lean. “That is why people come
              to the pagoda to get a blessing from the monks and a dedication for the
              spirits.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>The difficulty for
              families is that they do not know whether their deceased relatives – who could
              be a grandparent, parent, brother, sister, daughter or son – have gone to
              heaven or to hell. If they are in hell, then Pchum Ben is the only time in the
              year that their spirit can escape its tortures of fire, pain, no food and no
              water.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>And it is vital that the
              living placate the pret spirits.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“The dead suffer
              terribly and are tortured [in hell], and they have nothing to eat or to wear,”
              says Lean. “Pchum Ben is the only time they can be free of hell, and can return
              to see their living relatives and to get a blessing so that perhaps they can
              gain some relief and be reborn.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>The returning spirit
              will go to the pagodas looking for offerings from its relatives. If the spirit
              finds that its family has not been to a pagoda by the end of the 15 days, it
              will cry out and curse its living relatives. That is because the spirit realises
              it has not been provided with food offerings, says Lean, and the monks will not
              have been chanting its name during the blessings.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“But if it sees its
              relatives have offered food to the monks and have dedicated prayers in its
              name, then the spirit will bless the family with happiness,” he says.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>For that reason, most
              Cambodian Buddhists do their utmost to attend the pagoda during Pchum Ben.
              Among the older people, many go every day; the younger generation might go only
              a few times during the festival – each day to a different pagoda. By doing
              this, says Lean, they show respect to their ancestors.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Fifty-eight-year-old Ma
              Ching is one of those visiting Puok pagoda. She is here to visit the monument
              to her son who died in a road accident several years ago. Today she has come
              with rice, fruit, desserts, water and juice for the monks – which, when the
              monks eat, will transmute to her late son, too.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“I came to offer food to
              the monks,” she says. “I hope my son will see what I have done for him, and I
              pray that his next life will be a long one filled with happiness.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Coming to the pagoda,
              says Ching, and having the monks deliver a blessing dedicated to her son,
              “makes me feel so peaceful and happy, and I hope he feels the same as I do”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Sok Ngek, 63, lives near
              Puok pagoda, and assists the monks on each day of Pchum Ben.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“It is our tradition,
              and I think it is as special to Cambodia as Khmer New Year is,” he says, adding
              with a broad smile that he wishes Pchum Ben would come sooner every year
              because it’s an occasion for him to see his children.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>“Pchum Ben is an
              important festival for me as an older person,” he says. “My children are so
              busy with their jobs and families, and they live in other provinces, so I don’t
              see them often. But when Pchum Ben comes, they take a break from work and come
              with me to the pagoda. It gives me great happiness to see my children’s faces.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Pchum Ben, Ngek points
              out, is not the only festival at which food is offered to the dead, but it does
              mark a special opportunity for families to come together at the pagoda to do
              good deeds so that they might meet again in the next life.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Those who do not attend
              the pagoda during Pchum Ben, he says, “do not know the value of the love of
              family and do not respect and offer gratitude to their ancestors”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Each day starts well
              before dawn when young and old dress in their finest and head to the pagoda.
              There, after the monks have prayed over the bowls of bai ben – small balls of
              sticky rice, sesame seeds and fruit – to dedicate the food to the ancestors and
              to those spirits who have no families, the living begin the process of bos bai
              ben, or throwing the rice balls.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>The rice balls are
              small, because the pret spirits have small mouths, and the ceremony of throwing
              the balls takes place before sunrise, because the spirits cannot be out during
              the day. “Bos bai ben is a must-do activity during the festival,” says Lean.
              “You are offering rice balls at dawn to any spirit with heavy sins who cannot
              receive offerings from its relatives during the day time.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>And so, before sunrise
              and under the gaze of all of the pagoda’s monks, the families walk outside
              where laymen like Ngek have set up a ceremonial space where, amid the scent of
              incense, relatives can throw bai ben to the eight compass points around the
              temple.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>Then, on the final day
              of Pchum Ben, families decorate small boats made from banana leaves and
              freighted with rice, desserts, fruit and money, along with lit candles and
              incense.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 8.4pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #1a1a1a;'>They take these
              ceremonial vessels to the river and send them on their way, each boat a
              farewell to their ancestors that carries the wish that their next life will be
              better.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>There is no such mentioned in sutra that hell beings could return back to world to receive offering or in reprieve. They are in the hell to atone their extremely evil sins and once their hell sins are cleansed off, they will rebirth back to either realms again, in the hope that they met with dharma or kind people to regain back its truth nature. The purpose of hell is created by themselves, with sole objective to remove their sins through self punishment. Once completed, they will try again in realm depending on their sin, usually is ghost or animals. Nevertheless, if the chanting is utmost sincere from their loved one, they can rebirth to Heaven directly, not only themselves, those around them followed together to heaven :)</p></div>
