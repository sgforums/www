              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After nearly six decades of exile, some Tibetans in India are
              slowly letting go of the past </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Vidhi Doshi October 9 Washington Post</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">BANGALORE, India — When ­Tenzin Dechen Deshar first heard
              that Tibetan exiles could apply for Indian passports, she agonized over the
              choice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A Tibetan born in India, Deshar lived a double life. She went
              to an Indian boarding school but spent summers in a refugee settlement, trying
              to learn to read Tibetan. She watched Bollywood movies with her Indian
              friends but fell asleep listening to her grandmother’s stories about a
              Himalayan wonderland.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Deshar spent her childhood convinced that she would someday
              see the land her family had left behind when Chinese forces seized control of
              Tibet. Then, in September 2016, the Delhi High Court ruled that
              Tibetans born in India between 1950 and 1987 are eligible to apply for Indian
              passports. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The new offer of nationality presented a dilemma. Take the
              passport, some said, and end decades of virtual confinement to a single
              country. Buy a car, own a house, apply for government jobs. Others argued that
              giving up your statelessness was akin to betraying the Tibetan cause that three
              generations have fought for. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“It was not a decision I took lightly,” Deshar said, lunching
              on dumplings between appointments at a regional passport office in Bangalore in
              southern India. But the long internal conflict had led her to a realization.
              “My grandmother’s stories were just that — stories, like fairy tales. I’ve
              never even seen snow. Or a yak.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibet is a mountainous, nominally semiautonomous region in
              China. But Tibetans consider themselves ethnically and culturally different
              from the Chinese. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Deshar’s grandparents were among tens of thousands who fled
              Tibet in 1959, after Mao Zedong’s Communist Party took control of Lhasa, the
              Tibetan capital, massacring thousands of Tibetans. Though some eventually found
              homes in the West, the vast majority of Tibetan exiles, 122,000 people, live in
              neighboring India and have endured nearly six decades of limbo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For years, the Tibetan movement has hung its hopes on
              international support for its exiles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Heart-rending stories of Tibetans walking through icy
              mountain passes to reach India — their land seized, their monasteries razed,
              their prayers silenced — buttressed U.S. efforts to isolate China during the
              Cold War and have continued to rake up support on college campuses and
              outside Chinese embassies worldwide. “Free Tibet” long ago became a
              familiar cry.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But without a stateless population to field the sympathies of
              Western democracies, some fear that the Tibetan struggle could crumble.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“What’s happened is that an entire nationality, so to speak,
              has given up on its nation,” said Giriraj Subramanium, a lawyer in Delhi
              who has argued more than a dozen Tibetans’ cases for passports in the
              Delhi High Court. “Tibet is over” is a common refrain among his clients,
              he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">An Indian government official said there is no count of how
              many Tibetans have made applications for passports. A spokesman from the
              Central Tibetan Administration (CTA), the exile organization that oversees
              Tibetan affairs, said only that a small number had applied.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Stateless Tibetans face a number of restrictions when
              traveling: They have to get exit permits and police verification in India,
              which often means paying bribes to authorities. At home, not having Indian
              nationality can complicate getting a mobile SIM card or registering a business.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 1959, as Chinese troops consolidated power over Lhasa, the
              Dalai Lama, only 23 at the time, disguised himself as a soldier
              and fled to India. Eighty thousand Tibetans followed. India
              allowed him to set up an exile government in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala.
              In the 1980s, hoping for compromise, the Dalai Lama stopped demanding complete
              independence and decided instead to settle for a “middle
              way” seeking “genuine autonomy” for the people of the Tibetan
              plateau. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many Tibetans, however, did not give up hope.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Karten Tsering, president of the residents welfare
              association in a Tibetan colony in New Delhi, explains Chinese control of the
              Tibet region in Buddhist terms: as part of the ever-changing nature of the
              universe. “Nations rise up and down — that is happening everywhere. Britain
              ruled India for 200 years. China was once under the rule of Tibetans,” he said,
              referring to the 7th-century Tibetan empire. “In our time, we’ve been born on
              the loser side.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Deshar rolled her eyes at the mention of the Tibetan empire.
              “Does anyone think China’s going to be like, ‘Come back’? Is that realistic,
              really? We have to stop living in a limbo,” she said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">China’s economic strength means even the Dalai Lama’s
              ­dialed-down demands for autonomy are a distant dream. For Beijing, the
              strategic importance of the Tibet region eliminates any question of conceding
              power; a sizable proportion of China’s water reserves are on the Tibetan
              plateau and the region includes a long land border with India, a neighbor with
              which China regularly spars.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Any concessions to Tibetans could draw the ire of
              hard-liners within China’s ruling Communist Party and rouse nationalist
              fervor in Inner Mongolia and other regions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Matthew Akester, an independent Tibet researcher, said the
              Central Tibetan Administration’s political strategy had failed to achieve its
              objectives. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“People see the Dalai Lama getting the Nobel Peace
              Prize, being selected for the cover of Time magazine, delivering speeches to
              packed audiences in Western countries,” he said. “But in terms of real
              politics, these things are not actually meaningful. For many years, the
              strategy has been, ‘If we are attractive and popular enough with Western
              countries, they will put pressure on China.’ That hasn’t worked.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The CTA claims to represent all Tibetans but has
              little contact with the vast majority in Chinese territory. Though there is
              opposition to China from within Tibet (for instance, the 2008 protests
              ahead of the Beijing Olympics), it is the exiles who have played a central role
              in achieving sustained international support for the Tibetan movement. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The CTA and even the Dalai Lama to a certain extent — their
              relevance will only remain if there are a large number of Tibetan exiles in
              India,” said Subramanium, the lawyer representing a number of Tibetans in
              court. After last year’s Delhi High Court ruling, the Indian government, which
              is closely allied with the CTA, introduced a number of bureaucratic hurdles for
              Tibetan applicants, such as having to leave their settlements and forfeit
              refu­gee documents. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Tibetans who spoke to The Washington Post said they had heard
              messages from the CTA on the radio urging Indian-born exiles not to apply for
              passports. Most of the discouragement, they said, has happened through
              word-of-mouth campaigns. A Tibetan-language circular from the CTA also urges
              passport applicants to “take a long-term view rather than considering
              short-term advantages.” Outwardly, however, the CTA has said that Tibetans are
              free to choose Indian nationality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“There have been murmurs in the Tibetan community that we
              shouldn’t do this, that this is wrong,” Deshar said. “But if I think about it,
              what am I really giving up? I’m not insecure about my Tibetan identity. I don’t
              feel the need to preserve statelessness to preserve who I am.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Taking Indian nationality need not mean the end of the
              Tibetan struggle, said Robert Barnett, ­director of the Modern Tibetan Studies
              Program at Columbia University.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As Indian citizens, Tibetans could form a strong lobby within
              India’s political system. “There is this Tibetan idea that politics is all
              about public relations,” he said. “It could be replaced by the idea that
              politics is about skill and strategy and building coalitions and understanding
              opponents.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Few exiled Tibetans have been able to return to China.
              Becoming Indian may symbolically represent giving up hope for eventual
              repatriation, but in some cases it could increase Tibetans’ chances of getting
              visas to travel to China. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many Tibetans remain uncertain about the nationality
              question. “People don’t really want to engage with the question of whether
              politics should be pragmatic or ideal. . . . For decades, they’ve left these
              kinds of decisions to lamas and political leaders,” Barnett said. “With young
              people, that kind of attitude still remains. It is not born out of ignorance or
              irresponsibility, but a fear of upsetting the system.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Others, like Lobsang Wangyal, editor of the news
              website Tibet Sun and founder of the Miss Tibet pageant, whose
              landmark case won Tibetans the right to Indian passports, are thrilled. “I
              thought, wow, now I’m an Indian,” he said.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But many others, like Tashi Topden, a musician born in
              India and raised in a Tibetan settlement in New Delhi, said they would not
              apply on principle. “My heart is Tibetan,” he said. “I want to remain Tibetan.”</span></p>
