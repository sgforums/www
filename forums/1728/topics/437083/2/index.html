              Compassion always comes from strength and richness from within, the ability to not only think only about ourselves. It is because we are not bankrupt of empathy and loving kindness that we can feel for others.
                          
              Also it does not mean foolish kindness with ones' eyes closed, for if you feel short -changed when dishing your own brand of compassion, usually means you are expecting something back in return!   There nothing wishy-washy about be compassionate.
                  Wanting to be compassionate does not absolves us of the need to be situationally aware!
                          
              Despite knowing the others' flaws,  one can still offer kind words, a cheerful smiley face for the negative people.  Being worried of being perceived as weak means you still emotionally needy, also you still need to polish up your life skills!
                          
              It takes courage to stand out in face of injustice, out of compassion for the trodden, especially when you may appear to be on the losing end! Not able to effectively help means we still do not have sufficient ability, there is nothing wrong with that!
                          
                          
              More importantly practising compassion as an antidote for the disease of "I"ness that besieged us.

              Nature is harsh, that's right! That's why we humans form groups, communities, civilisations to overcome the cruelness of nature! Human nature is flawed because we are still grasping and  clawing about!
              The strong within the community take cares of the weak, until they are strong enough to take care of themselves, later, others.
              Just as your parents, relatives, community takes care of you, the same you will take care of your offspring and seek help from your parents, relatives.community until the dissolution of your community !

              <p>It's a misconception that the spiritual path has to be one of great suffering and the need to bear great injustices. </p>
              <p>Let's
               not forget that there is also the concept of merit.  I read a book by 
              Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche recently, and in it he said that every little 
              bit of kindness we extend - be it lending a helping hand to someone 
              having a bad day or giving a smile to a neighbour - will avail to us 
              better circumstances and opportunities.  He experienced it himself.</p>
              <p>I mean this as a half-joke, but... "If one doesn't take care of the afterlife now, the afterlife will take care of you."  Personally, I don't want to end up in a hell or as a hungry ghost or an animal of labour.  I'd rather make the decision now.  Like one fellow forummer previously commented, the stakes are too high. </p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>What i meant is "Reality is harsh", Reality  is define as the world or the state of things as they actually exist, a thing that is actually experienced or seen. It has nothing to do with Nature.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Human Nature is flawed that ia why we "Human" exist in this Mundane Plane. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Society makes People or People makes Society.  What does being kind seen as weakness got to do with Community or Mother Nature?
