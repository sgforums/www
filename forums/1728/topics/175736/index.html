            <div class='col-md body'>In Buddhism, we believe that although we have all 'fallen' from our original state, the world can be purified and a pure land can be established in this world. Earth will be like Heaven. At this time Maitreya Bodhisattva will descend and attain Buddhahood. At such a time Jesus Christ wouldn't have needed to die for our sins. Therefore treat the problem at its source - the mind. Jesus Christ taught a lot of great teachings, however he never emphasized on liberation - he taught about mostly on how to ascend to heaven in the afterlife. He did teach a little on the essence - but only to some of his chosen disciples. A Christian who practises Christianity completely, following the commandments, and so on, will be able to be reborn in Tavatimsa Heaven. And from there, by practising even more blessings, he can rise to even higher levels of heavens.<br><br>Nevertheless, Jesus Christ is the emanation of a great bodhisattva, he has taught us important bodhisattva spirit and practise. He is one of the ultimate examples of Xi2 She3. Shakyamuni Buddha, in his 500 lifetimes before he attained Buddhahood, also practised this as a bodhisattva. Sacrificing his life for sentient beings is something a bodhisattva is much willing to do.</div>

If one is interested to know more about Christianity, go read more Christian books, websites, etc. My Buddhist Master (who was a pastor himself in the past) used to set up a group whereby there are two sides - Christians and Buddhists, and each of them study the teachings of each other religions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christians believe that Jesus' sacrificial blood will wash away their sins just as Hindus at the time of the Buddha believed that their sins could be washed away by bathing in holy rivers. The Buddha criticised the Hindu idea just as he would have criticised the Christian idea if he had known about it. To believe that blood, water or any other external things can purify the heart, which is an internal thing, is foolish indeed.<br><br>In the Bahuka River, at Adhikakka, at Gaya, in the Sundrika, the Sarassati, the Payaga or the Bahumati the fool can wash constantly but cannot cleanse his evil deeds. What can the Sundrika, the Payaga or the Bahumati River do? They cannot cleanse the angry, guilty man intent on evil deeds. For the pure in heart every day is lucky, for the pure in heart every day is holy (Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta No.7).<br><br>This being the case, bathing in sacrificial blood or holy rivers is a poor substitute for purifying oneself by acting in a pure way. The only sacrifice that the Buddha asked us to make was to give up our selfishness and replace it with love, wisdom and compassion.<br><br>may all hav peace &amp; happiness...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say, "The Buddha attained Enlightenment for me and showed me a Path!", or as Shinran Shonin would put it,<br><blockquote>"When I consider deeply the Vow of Amida (Amitabha), which arose from five kalpas of profound thought, I realize that it was entirely for the sake of myself alone (and for the rest of us)! Then how I am filled with gratitude for the Primal Vow, in which Amida resolved to save me, though I am burdened with such heavy karma.Â“<br></blockquote>Gassho</div>
