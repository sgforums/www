              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>Text and images by Elaine Ng @ Makansutra</p>
              <p>Some of us might have proudly conjured vegetarian dishes liberally peppered with common aromatics like garlic and onions for our friends who do not consume meat. But do you know this does not mean all vegetarians will welcome them?</p>
              <p>Unbeknownst to many, there are vegetarians who do not take alliums vegetables like garlic, onions and scallions. More than a few of us would have scratched our heads at this; especially since these common aromatics do not look or taste like meat in any way.</p>
              <p>In certain scriptures, eating garlic and onion causes people to be more passionate than desired, which includes anger and lust. As such, it could be a distraction in serious religious life, explains Mr Srivas, a Hare Krishna devotee of 13 years.</p>
              <p>This is generally observed by Buddhists and Vedic Dharma (Hindu) followers. “Those who want to advance spiritually should abstain from onion, garlic, mushrooms and the like. We also don’t take spicy or really hot stuff as these cause agitation to the mind and body,” says Mr Srivas.</p>
              <p>Such vegetables are considered tamasic (the mode of ignorance) and rajasic (the mode of passion). The former lowers one’s consciousness contrary to attaining higher divine awareness as an aspirant follower would be liken to aim towards, while the latter distracts him from devotions. Garlic, for one, is a natural aphrodisiac.</p>
              <p>Religious reasons aside, these “aromatics” are often the cause of bad breath and repulsive odour in our perspirations too. “You wouldn’t want to scare your friends or students away when you share Buddhist scriptures and teachings, would you?” quips devout Buddhist Mr William Soon, who shares one practical reason as to why vegetarians should avoid garlic and onions.</p>
              <p>Ancient Taoist sage Tsang-Tsze also writes that the five fragrant, spicy or scented vegetables of the onions, garlic, leeks, chives and spring onions have adverse effects to our lungs, heart, spleen, liver and kidneys respectively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p>However, modern medical studies have onions and garlic prized for their health benefits. Take the garlic for example. Pungent as it is, contains antibacterial and anti-fungal compound of the allicin that is activated when raw garlic is finely chopped or crushed — which unfortunately intensifies the odour at the same time.</p>
              <p>Garlic not only keeps the vampires or boys away but what is bad for our bodies too. The bulb is also known to aid the lowering of cholesterol as well as the incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer.</p>
              <p>“As with everything, eatin moderation. For some people who consume too much of either, they become gassy. This is especially so for onions. That said, results may vary for individuals and a varied, well-balanced diet is recommended,” advises Mr Daniel Jason Ong, a nutritionist from The Nutrition Clinic.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the reason, if you choose to avoid alliums vegetables, ingredients like yellow beans, red dates or ginger could be used to add fragrance to your dish in replacement of the more commonly used aromatics of garlic and onions.</p>

              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 13pt;  '>It is nice to know that the Goenka Vipasanna centre provide only vegetarian meals for participants in its vipasanna retreats. I believe there are no strict codes with regard to food that can be partake of in the Theravada tradition. MN 55 the Jivaka Sutta do mention when meat should or should not be consumed, but I have not come across Suttas that mentioned the prohibition on the consumption of any vegetable plants. </span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; font-size: 13pt;  '>Well, I use lots of garlic powder to season meat and also take raw garlic soak in cedar vinegar; nice with fried rice. I do use onions as vegetable, cooking it with eggs or meat or in soup. Maybe I should start taking note sometime in the future whether it does have any adverse effect on my meditation. </span></p>

              <p><br>mushroom although i also eat, is said to live in darkness and fed on rotten remains, hence the energy is not so good. maybe other than linzhi, that live on top of the mountain is better. so depend.</p>

              <p>In the monasteries and both <span class="st"> <em>bhikkhunis</em> and bhikkhus are not allowed. For laybuddhists depending on situation. It depends on laybuddhist mind, if you are trapped by such uncertainty, your mind is not at peace, if you are trapped by eating garlic or onion will not augur well for your practice, you are trapped by such worry and developing irkness. Just relax, if you are with a group vegetarians having meal together, surely there is no contraint in having meal free from garlic and onion. And if you are having meal with non vegetarian and there is no vegetarian stall around, you just enjoy moderation in such situation. If there is alot of worry, do practice Pureland, there is no mentioned in pureland sutra that garlic or onion cannot be taken. Its emphasis is mindful of buddha name and live lovingknessly together with others.<br></span></p>

              <p>i think for last time, or southern buddhism, the monastic while collecting alms, cannot choose what the people give them. however, for lay buddhists, they are more able to choose.</p>
