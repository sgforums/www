               is not a background of phenomena, not a unifying principle, not a 
              principle beneath our experience, but the very nature of all 
              phenomena/experience is to be empty of any intrinsic existence at all.</div>

              <div style="font: 12.0px Helvetica; margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px;">Furthermore, the dependent and empty nature of emptiness should show 
              that there is no 'underlying emptiness behind everything'. If the 
              emptiness of a cup depends on a cup, how can this emptiness be said to 
              be some universal underlying principle behind all phenomena?</div>

              back into emptiness. Emptiness is not a quality that things have, which 
              makes them empty. Rather, to be a thing in the first place, is to be 
              empty.</em></div>

              <p>The Vedanta religion is not talking about emptiness, it is talking about awareness. It is a different realization. This awareness is taken to be inherently existing in Hinduism as their ultimate reality Brahman, but in Buddhism we realize that Awareness too is empty of inherent existence (any kind of intrinsic, independent, changeless existence) or Self-hood. That is emptiness realization.<br><br>Secondly I think what I wrote here is relevant to your question because you are presuming that there is a 'purest state in the beginning':</p>
              <p>Thusness addressed the question of first cause years ago to me,
                          and I wrote this then based on what he said:</p>
              <p><em>Actually we don't have an original nature, we have an empty
                          nature, that has no beginning nor ending. To visualise a purest
                          state from the start is a dualistic view. Emptiness is not a void,
                          not absence of suffering, emptiness is the nature of suffering and
                          all phenomena. Getting 'lost' and becoming dualistic is natural
                          when we develop those conditions that make us 'lost', for example
                          being attached to our luminosity is one of the factor. When
                          condition is there, samsara (dualistic vision) simply
                          manifests...<br> <br> The assumption that there is a purest state and we will not
                          becoming dualistic is itself a dualistic view. There is no purest
                          state, when condition is there, delusion manifests, every states
                          are dependently originated and are empty, and being empty all
                          states are equally pure. Suffering too is empty and pure. Even the
                          state of delusion is empty and pure but we just don't recognize it
                          due to our karmic obscurations (or deep conditionings, karmic
                          propensities of falsely projecting 'self' and 'inherency') that
                          blinds us from seeing.<br> <br> And no, realising the luminosity aspect alone can't lead to
                          liberation. As I said... other religions talk about that aspect as
                          well and not just Buddhism, but when its empty nature is not known,
                          it becomes a metaphysical essence, and all phenomena becomes like
                          dust on the mirror. And then there is a mirror reflecting external
                          conditions. That becomes dualistic and 'inherent'. The cause of
                          samsara is still not uprooted, and one of the fundamental causes as
                          Thrangu Rinpoche* stated is the attachment to luminosity due to not
                          perceiving its empty nature. If you read <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html"> my friend's experience</a> you see that there must be further
                          insights into the anatta and sunyata nature of awareness.<br> <br> But emptiness is also not just empty, so you must realise the union
                          and inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. Having conviction
                          in our luminous nature as everpresent, never lost, is important,
                          but having glimpses of that pure luminosity is just the beginning
                          and we are still far from perceiving its nature.</em></p>

              <p>The first chapter of Tao De Jing, "The tao that can be named is not eternal Tao"</p>
              <p>My deepest impression of Tao comes from the book "Tao of leadership" by John Heider.</p>
              <p>"Wu wei" or non action is the highest state attained . It simply means centered in quietitude. Observing a group "field" or dynamics when in a group, the furry of life coming about in a seemingly still forest. Ripples forming across a mirrored lake when the wind blows. Simply observe without labelling or conceptions.</p>
              <p>Day to day, without being flustered yourself, watch the patterns and cyclical nature arise from a hurried haphazard daily routine of live. As we simply observe, out comes the flow and ebb, day by day , month by month, year by year.</p>
              <p>I believe if you are grounded with shamatha and vispassana practice, you should be able to observe "Tao".</p>

              so basically it is talking abt our mind should be empty and tranquil. then talks abt observing things fr various perspective free fr interferences or influences eg desire so as to be accurate. then move on to describing the construction n deconstruction of matters to its original form(nothingness) in order to be eternal, understood this a person is enlightened.   so I doubt it was talking abt the sensation exp while meditating.
              
              
              reincarnate n rebirth r 2 diff concepts. reincarnate is åŒ–èº«, rebirth æŠ•èƒŽ. idk y some dicts gave the same meaning.  simply put, we don't have control over rebirth...totally governed by the karma... Buddha, bodhisattva n arhat reincarnate, they know the realms they r going 2 help n teach the creatures there. I think arhants do reincarnate when requested by Buddha.
              
              lao zi era was the booming era of philosophers...in the other part of the world we had Aristotle, Socrates, plato, india we had Buddha n china we had lao zi n Confucius.  since buddhism transcends time, it doesn't matter who comes 1st.
