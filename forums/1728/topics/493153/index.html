              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">His Holiness the Dalai Lama will bestow Geshema degrees on 20
              Tibetan Buddhist nuns at Drepung Loseling Monastery in Mundgod, in the southern
              Indian state of Karnataka, on 22 December, the Central Tibetan Administration
              (CTA) announced on its website yesterday. The certificates will be awarded by
              His Holiness during the 600th founding anniversary celebrations for the
              original Drepung Monastery—one of the three largest Gelug monasteries in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Geshe (feminine: Geshema) is a Tibetan Buddhist academic
              degree for monastics. The qualification is emphasized primarily by the Gelugpa
              lineage of Vajrayana Buddhism, but is also awarded in the Sakyapa school. The
              annual Geshema examination has been held only since 2013—until 2011, the Geshe
              title was awarded only to monks. Nuns who successfully pass the Geshema degree
              are qualified to take on leadership roles in monastic and lay communities that
              were previously reserved for males.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The conferment of the Geshema degree is a historic
              development as it marks a new chapter in [the] empowerment and education of
              Tibetan woman, particularly in the spiritual sphere,” said Venerable Karma
              Gelek Yuthok, who heads the CTA’s Department of Religion and Culture. “The
              degree will open avenues of employment and opportunity to the nuns, as it makes
              them equally eligible as monks to assume various leadership roles in the
              monastic and lay communities.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Geshema exams were carried out under the supervision of
              the Board of Geshema Examination, which is comprised of representatives from
              the Department of Religion and Culture, non-profit organization the Tibetan
              Nuns Project, the Institute of Buddhist Dialectics in Dharamsala, and six
              nunneries in India and Nepal. The historic graduation ceremony will be
              livestreamed via the website of the Tibet Nuns Project, and on TTV, the CTA’s
              official website for online video content. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The examination process is extremely rigorous, taking four
              years in total. The nuns must undergo oral and written examinations, during
              which they are tested on the entirety of their 17-year course of study. The
              success this year of the 20 nuns therefore marks a new chapter in the
              development of education for female monastics and for Tibetan women.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Educating women is powerful,” Rinchen Khando Choegyal,
              founder and director of the Tibetan Nuns Project, which supports seven Buddhist
              nunneries in India, said in July, when the 20 nuns successfully passed their
              degrees.* “It’s not just about books. It is also about helping nuns acquire the
              skills they need to run their own institutions and create models for future
              success and expansion. It’s about enabling the nuns to be teachers in their own
              right and to take on leadership roles at a critical time in our nation’s
              history.” (Tibetan Nuns Project)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Tibetan Nuns Project, established under the auspices of
              the Tibetan Women’s Association and the Department of Religion and Culture,
              supports almost 800 nuns from all Tibetan Buddhist lineages living in nunneries
              and elsewhere in India. Many of the nuns are refugees from Tibet, but the
              organization also reaches out to the Himalayan border areas of India where
              women and girls have had little access to education and religious training.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">His Holiness the Dalai Lama and His Holiness the Karmapa had
              advocated the establishment of a Geshema program for many years. After seeing
              nuns participate in traditional monastic debates during a festival in March
              2012, the Dalai Lama expressed satisfaction with their level of knowledge and
              recommended that it was time to allow nuns to study for the advanced
              qualification.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Nuns must take both written and oral exams each year as part
              of the rigorous four-year Geshema examination process. Photo courtesy of

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The title Geshe was first bestowed upon masters of the
              Kadampa tradition, such as Geshe Chekawa Yeshe Dorje (1102–76). The degree
              represents the highest form of training in the Gelugpa school of Tibetan
              Buddhism. The first female monastic to qualify for the Geshema title was German
              nun Kelsang Wangmo, who was ordained in India and spent 21 years in training before
              becoming the first female to receive the Geshema title in 2011.</span></p>
