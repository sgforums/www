              <p>hello this is the first time i'm posting a topic here, i am someone who very much believe in the buddhism teachings and i wanted to ask something. In the teachings we are taught not to be greedy and things like that and to be unattached to the worldly affairs so i was wondering if someone is poor and always thinking of ways to earn money for himself and the family for a better life is it something which is against the teachings?</p>
              <p>sorry if you dont really understand this post because i can only think of this as the best way to describe the scenario.</p>

                                      taught by Buddha, the Right Action[1] advocates practitioners of
                                      Buddhism to pursue all that are virtuous with zeal and a commitment
                                      to progress. Such should be the correct attitude whether in our
                                      career or in pursuit of the ultimate truth. The following short
                                      story may help to illustrate Buddha's teaching more
                                      clearly.</span><br> <br> Early one morning Buddha and one of his chief disciples, Ananda,
                                      set out from Jetavana to seek alms. They came to the city of
                                      Sravasti. As they entered the city gate and were walking along a
                                      path by the city wall, they saw an aged couple.<br> <br> Their backs were crooked and they could neither straighten
                                      themselves nor move about. They were dressed in rags, appearing
                                      unhygienic and well worn with age: frail, toothless, grey hair,
                                      hard of hearing and poor eyesight. They lived next to a pile of
                                      rubbish by the derelict wall of a sleazy alley. They crouched close
                                      to each other, facing a small fire for warmth. With eyes only for
                                      each other, they resembled a pair of old swans that cannot bear to
                                      part.<br> <br> The Buddha turned his head and asked Ananda, "Did you see that aged
                                      couple by the wall and the warmth of the burning cow dung?"<br> <br> Ananda replied, "World Honoured One, I see them."<br> <br> The Buddha continued, "If this old couple had been determined and
                                      diligent when they were young and strong, regardless of the nature
                                      of their work as long as it is legitimate, perhaps at this age they
                                      are already amongst the wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. On
                                      the other hand, if they had chosen to renounce their worldly life
                                      to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they
                                      would have already attained the Arhat [2] by now.<br> <br> Even if they were not that determined when they were young, but are
                                      ambitious and diligent only at a later age and they work with the
                                      Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the second
                                      wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. Similarly, if on the other
                                      hand, they had chosen to renounce their worldly life to learn and
                                      cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would have
                                      already attained the Anagami [2].<br> <br> Worse still, should they only realise about diligence and progress
                                      when they are already at their middle age, and only then began to
                                      work with the Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the
                                      third wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. If they had chosen to
                                      renounce their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path
                                      with diligence, perhaps they would have already attained the
                                      Sakrdagamin [2].<br> <br> However, they did none of the above. Instead, they spent their life
                                      times loving and possessing each other, and wasted the most useful
                                      time of their lives. That is why today they are helpless and have
                                      no way out of their predicament. They live in poor conditions, are
                                      penniless and there is nothing that they can do. For them it is a
                                      living death, having to face the retribution of their own doing,
                                      and nobody took any pity on them. What meaning is there in a life
                                      like this?"<br> <br> In order to encourage people not to fall into the same predicament,
                                      the Buddha said, "Ananda, always remember to advise and guide
                                      people:<br> <br> In youth, be determined, diligent, and thrifty and strive to
                                      acquire knowledge.<br> <br> Maintain a mind that is distant and unchained from desire and be
                                      focused on building a career during the prime of life.<br> <br> In middle age, realise a stable career that is based on diligence,
                                      zeal, progress and Right Action.<br> <br> Always use the wealth meaningfully to benefit self and
                                      others.<br> <br> Do not wait till old age and rely on the people's benevolence like
                                      the aged swan."<br> <br> The above incident demonstrates the compassion of the Buddha in
                                      caring for sentient beings and encouraging people to be determined
                                      in striving for progress, regardless of whether one is concerned
                                      with building a career, or one who has renounced the worldly life
                                      to learn and cultivate the right path. His only wish was for all
                                      sentient beings to be distant from suffering and attain happiness
                                      in life.<br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Notes:<br> [1] Noble Eight-fold Path:<br> 1. Right Speech<br> 2. Right Action<br> 3. Right Livelihood<br> 4.
