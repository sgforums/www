Maybe you havent heard before, but I have seen photos of levitating yogis in books before. Some book that lists all the 'paranormal things'. Quite interesting. But why monks cannot show levitation? Because buddhism isnt about levitation, but if you meditate you can achieve that. <strong>We usually emphasize and encourage the UNimportance of miracles and siddhis in Buddhism because many people are fascinated over it and lose focus and direction in their cultivation. Siddhis are really only the side effect of samadhi, concentration and not peculiar to Buddhism.</strong><br><br>Let me tell you a true story.<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One day the Buddha met an ascetic who sat by the bank of a river. This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labor. The ascetic proudly replied that, now at last, he could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labor, since he could cross the river using a ferry for one penny!</span><br><br>Also see <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Library/Other/Miracles/miracles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Library/Other/Miracles/miracles.html</a> by the same author of the previous articles Buddhism and Science. BTW even Ajahn Brahmavamso also had some psychic powers, because a friend of mine actually visited Ajahn Brahmavamso, and he could penetrate his consciousness and know him directly - even his cultivation and meditation experiences. Alot of Buddhist monks, masters, have these powers. Some of whom happen to be my dharma teachers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> This is no big deal in Buddhism.<br><br>Anyway, attaining such psychic abilities is really also easier than attaining enlightenment. People who have psychic abilities does not necessarily mean they are enlightened.<br><br><blockquote>[03:35]  not surprise but no big deal<br>[03:35]  in fact i suspect most monks have<br>[03:35]  u mean powers or realisations<br>[03:35]  but if u say those power<br>[03:35]  i actually have a fren who can read mind<br>[03:36]  he is not a buddhist but practice many years of meditation<br>[03:36]  so i am not actually surprise<br>[03:38]  but i am disappointed if he shows such power<br>[03:38]  a monk ever say<br>[03:38]  showing such things for pple to know<br>[03:38]  is no diff from a gal showing underwear for a few coins<br>[03:38]  haha<br>[03:39]  those are refering to ppl who show powers to get money la<br>[03:40]  bhikkhu shouldnt show powers to make a living<br>[03:40]  laity should show also la or make a living out of it<br>[03:40]  *shouldnt<br>[03:40]  even laity also<br>[03:40]  oic<br>[03:41]  its mention to refrain from showing<br>[03:41]  icic..<br>[03:41]  seriously no big deal abt such power after i know taht muslim fren<br>[03:41]  who has mind reading power from meditation<br>[03:41]  muslim fren?<br>[03:41]  meditation?<br>[03:42]  he is a doc in psychology<br>[03:42]  they have a topic in it<br>[03:43]  like..?<br>[03:44]  meditation<br>[03:44]  oh... icic<br>[03:44]  but they refer it calling reaching alpha stage of mind<br>[03:44]  which is similar to sleeping<br>[03:44]  icic..<br>[03:44]  he say among his fren in that course<br>[03:44]  after knowing the method<br>[03:44]  abt 1/4 of it have similar power<br>[03:45]  oh haha<br>[03:45]  after certain years<br>[03:45]  oic..<br>[03:45]  thats alot<br>[03:45]  so seriously after seeing him make me realise its just that we din put enough time and effort<br>[03:45]  that why we are so amazed by it</blockquote>Again, miracles and siddhis are just a small part of the NATURAL that has just yet been discovered or explained by modern science.

He shared his experiences of realization, of spiritual insight into the nature of mind. In one of his earliest discourses, the Buddha addressed his audience of monks and lay people and said, <strong>"You should examine my teachings thoroughly. Like a gold merchant looking to acquire pure gold, you should thoroughly go through the process of analyzing these teachings."</strong> Buddha said that a substance could be examined to see if it were pure gold by first striking it, then cutting it, then rubbing it with different cloths. Through this testing, it is possible find out if a substance is pure gold or fake gold. In a similar way, Buddha said, "It is extremely important for you to analyze and examine my teachings, and then, in the end, you can decide whether to adopt them. If there is any wisdom, you can adopt it. If there is nothing, just leave it. You do not have to accept these teachings." Buddha said, "Do not accept my teachings because they are taught by a King, or a Prince. Do not accept them because they are taught by someone called "Buddha." However, accept them if they are logical, if they are reasonable, if there is wisdom in them, and if there is some benefit."</span></div>
