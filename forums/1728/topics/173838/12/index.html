            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">That is just your opinion. They told me themselves that they are Buddhists. There is also a thread to tell Buddhists to celebrate Kuam Im birthday tommorrow in this forum.<br><br></div></blockquote>A <strong>Buddhist</strong> is someone who follows the teachings of the Buddha - someone who embraces the four noble truths, attempts to live according to the precepts and most likely practices meditation and/or acts of devotion.<br><br>Unfortunately, as soon as one gives a label to something, that something begins to die. If you say to someone 'I'm a Buddhist' all sorts of assumptions are made about you based on a knowledge of Buddhism or lack of knowledge. At once you are labeled, categorized, conceptually pinned like a dead butterfly in a glass cabinet.<br><br>But being a Buddhist is a process rather than something fixed and static. It is not knowing everything or having all the answers. In fact, in many ways it's the exact contrary to that. It starts from 'well, actually, I don't really know very much at all but I want to find out'. Its starting point, it seems to me, is humility before the great, wondrous, complexity of life. It's also about being human and accepting one's own failings and the failings of others.<br><br>Buddhism offers tools for dealing with life. It is a way of trying to understand the individual that we are, and how we relate to the people and world around us. Buddhism offers a moral framework which enables us to go through the world causing less suffering to ourselves and others. It also - like all religions - has a transcendental aspect - that we can go beyond out present condition (essentially one of suffering and dissatisfaction) to being truly awake to what life is.<br><br>One of the most important aspects of being a Buddhist, however, is developing compassion and loving-kindness. It is in some ways easy to be a Buddhist with one's head and not one's heart. Buddhism today and at the time of the Buddha  had great intellectual appeal. It is a religion that encourages investigation in a systematic, almost scientific way. But Buddhism is also about the heart and without that it might be perceived as a cold religion. A Buddhist attempts to engage both head and heart- rational investigation of the self along with an impulse towards developing selflessness<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddhism is a path of practice and spiritual development leading to Insight into the true nature of life</span>. Buddhist practices such as meditation are means of changing oneself in order to develop the qualities of awareness, kindness, and wisdom. The experience developed within the Buddhist tradition over thousands of years has created an incomparable resource for all those who wish to follow a path Â— a path which ultimately culminates in Enlightenment or Buddhahood.<br><br>Because Buddhism does not include the idea of worshipping a creator god, some people do not see it as a religion in the normal, Western sense. The basic tenets of Buddhist teaching are straightforward and practical: nothing is fixed or permanent; actions have consequences; change is possible. Thus Buddhism addresses itself to all people irrespective of race, nationality, or gender. It teaches practical methods (such as meditation) which enable people to realise and utilise its teachings in order to transform their experience, to be fully responsible for their lives and to develop the qualities of Wisdom and Compassion.<br><br>There are <strong>around 350 million Buddhists and a growing number of them are Westerners. </strong>They follow many different forms of Buddhism, but all traditions are characterised by non-violence, lack of dogma, tolerance of differences, and, usually, by the practice of meditation . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

This is a forum, we are having a discussion. If you are not interested to have a discussion, then why are you in a forum?<br><br>The thread is very clear, what happens to people who does not belive in Buddhism? To answer that question, we have to look at Buddhism in detail and define exactly what Buddhism is all about. What Buddhism hopes to achieve and what Buddhists claim.<br><br>You are not helping because you do not provide any useful information to extend the discussion.</div></blockquote>Although we may not agree with certain religious points of view they hold, if they are sincere in their efforts to serve humanity and uplift it, we must respect them for it.  There are noble people in every religion.  The Buddha did not advise his disciples to go and convert people who would otherwise go to hell. Rather he advised them to show the world what is right and what is wrong and to be good and to do good, to encourage men to come and see for themselves the truth that he taught.<br><br>He and his followers do not condemn the followers of other religionists as Â“sinnersÂ” who are doomed to spend an eternity in hell. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">According to Buddhists, even those who have no Â“religionÂ” but who live in dignity, with compassion and goodwill can Â“go to heavenÂ”, that is, experience happiness</span>.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When we are happy and contented we are in Â“heaven.Â” When we suffer physically or mentally we are in Â“hell.Â” There is no need to wait to die to experience either of these states. </span><br><br>Buddhism is unique because we can talk about this Â“religionÂ” even without any reference to heaven or hell. I am sure that others cannot talk about religion in this way.  The BuddhaÂ’s message of goodwill and understanding to all beings is a universal message. The world today needs this noble message more than ever before in the history of humankind.<br><br>Buddhism as a religion is the unique exposition of the absolute truth which will show man how to live in peace and harmony with his fellow beings.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Buddha is one who has purified all the defilements of the mind the afflictive emotions, the imprints of the actions motivated by them, and the stains of these afflictive emotions and who has developed all good qualities, such as impartial love and compassion, wisdom knowing all existence, and skillful means of guiding others.<br><br>The Dharma embodies the preventive measures which keep us from problems and suffering. This includes the teachings of the Buddha, as well as the realizations of those teachings the cessations of problems and their causes, and the realizations or paths which lead to those cessations.<br><br>The Sangha are those beings who have direct non-conceptual perception of emptiness or ultimate truth. On a relative level, Sangha also refers to the ordained people who put the BuddhaÂ’s teachings into practice.<br><br>The Dharma is our real refuge, the medicine we take which cures our problems and their causes. The Buddha is like the doctor, who correctly diagnoses the cause of our problems and prescribes the appropriate medicine. By assisting us in the practice, the Sangha is similar to the nurse who helps us take the medicine.<br><br>Taking refuge means that we rely wholeheartedly on the Three Jewels to inspire and guide us towards a constructive and beneficial direction to take in our life. Taking refuge does not mean passively hiding under the protection of Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Rather, it is an active process of taking the direction they show and improving the quality of our life.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Logic is only that branch of philosophy that deals with reasoning.  It does not deal with all types of thinking such as remembering (Recalling past life included), dreaming (Dream Yoga), day dreaming, neurosis,  learning..etc.  These other types of thinking are the job of psychology and parapsychology.<br><br>Although evidence is needed to serve as a base for inductive and deductive reasoning, full proof evidence to arrive at a certain conclusion is not necessary in logical analysis.   In daily life, not all reasoning attempts to provide conclusive evidence for the truth of a given conclusion and more often than not, conclusive evidence cannot be produced.  For pragmatic ground,  we merely want the evidence we arrived at be 'well founded'.<br><br>As human, sleeping and dreaming took up pretty much percentage of our life.  We are not just a rational being, to understand human, we have to deal with all these matters with spiritual issues included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>Hi,<br>Do you see the assumptions that you have made?<br>1. Spitiual matters.<br>What in the world are spiritual matters? To say that there is a spirit is not "well founded." Spirit is ancient man's worldview. Today, many "spiritual" phenomena are understood in terms of reality.<br><br>When I look at Buddhism, frankly it is quite attractive. In the sense that it provides some interesting ideas for consideration. Unfortunately, it has many fantastic claims and assumptions and allusions that goes with it.<br><br>So I am simply curious why Buddhists like yourself, seemingly an educated person would find it normal to accept the fantasy? OK maybe to you it is not fantasy. How else would you then describe things that has not been proven?<br><br>KARMA is just a suggestion and a possibility but is meaningless because we see bad things happen to good people and good things happening to bad people.<br><br>We know for example that on the whole, being educated brings tangible verifiable calculable results. So an educated person wants his children to be educated. Instead of teaching "Karma" to his children, an educated person will strive to educate his child or ensure that his child is well educated.<br><br>We know that a healthy lifestyle leads to a healthy life and so we live a healthy lifstyle and not assume that we are sick because of some things we did in our past life.<br><br>We know for example that addiction is a function of brain chemicals. We will then with that knowledge devise startegies to help that person overcome his addiction instead of preaching to him. Againg we do not preach to him unless we are convimced that preaching to him will help.<br><br>I study Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism (mainly these three) for some ideas but I do not buy into the fantastic stuff.<br><br>Why do you buy into it? I need the answer because gambling addicts hold on to gambling beliefs with all their heart as fervently as religious people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>excerpt from <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=179467" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=179467</a><br>Science and Buddhism<br><br>When a Buddhist looks through a telescope, they are not scared by what they might find. They are not scared of science. Science is an essential part of Buddhism. If science can disprove rebirth, then Buddhists should give up the idea of rebirth. If science disproves non-self, and shows there is a self, then all Buddhists should abandon non-self. If science proves there is no such thing as kamma, but instead there is a big God up in the sky, then all Buddhists should believe in God. That is, if it's provable science. Buddhism has no sacred cows. However, I encourage you to do those experiments for yourselves. <strong>I'll bet you will find out that there is no one 'in there'. You will find out about kamma. You will find out you've been here before, that this is not your first life.</strong> If you don't behave yourselves in this life, you'll have another life to come yet. Do you think you are finished with nappies, with school? Do you really want to go through all that again? If not be careful.<br><br>So, here is my thinking about science and Buddhism. I think that Buddhism is pure science, a science that doesn't stop 'out there', but also investigates the mind, the 'being', the 'ghost in the machine'. And it doesn't disregard any anomalies. Buddhism takes everything as its data, especially experience, and looks at it scientifically. It is incredibly successful.<br><br>One of the reasons why people celebrate science is because of all of its achievements in technology. One of the reasons why Buddhism is growing these days is because of all of its achievements in the 'technology of the mind'. It solves problems. It explains mental difficulties. Buddhism succeeds in solving those inner problems because it has all these strategies, these ancient 'gizmos', which actually work. If you try some of these Buddhist gizmos, you will find out for yourself that they produce the goods, they solve your inner suffering and pain. That is why Buddhism is growing. I think that Buddhism will supplant science!<br><br>Thank you very much.<br></blockquote></div>
