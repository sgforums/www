            <div class='col-md body'>In fact Dukkha covers not only negative aspect but positive aspects as well.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>There is something that I feel has been largely misunderstood and I wish to clarify. Our forum name is ~ Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~... understandably, since this is a Buddhist forum, there is 'Buddhism', and since we wish to attain Buddha's enlightenment and wisdom, there is the word 'Wisdom', but why 'Bliss'? What has bliss got to do with Buddhism? People question this because they are stuck to worldly point of view and they think that hapiness is money, material possessions, a great partner, etc etc... you know better.<br><br>We want all these things due to our ego and cravings. But ego and craving are never extinguished by the fulfilment of desires. It just gets greedier and greedier. You will know this by observing a baby grow towards adulthood. As he grows older he is less easily satisfied and demands more. It becomes a habit. (note: habits can be brought over to the next life!) This is not bliss but suffering. Dukkha. Unfortunately we are not even aware. (note: Not aware = ignorance. Awareness is the nature of the Buddha.)<br><br>Actually Dukkha in Buddhism is very wide. Much wider than most of us would have imagined. When Buddhism says 'suffering is an inevitable part of life', people may only think of physical pain, but the nature of Dukkha is much more than that. The state of mental afflictions is itself dukkha. If we attach to something impermanent it is dukkha. We feel <span style="font-style: italic;">anxious, despairing, frustrated, irritated, upset, disappointed, discomfort, anguish, painful and disgusted</span>, all these are dukkha.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sometimes we have a success and feel very satisfied with our own performance. However, [b]this satisfaction itself is again Dukkha , simply because it does not stay forever</span></strong>. In a higher stage of meditation practice, you do not feel any mental annoyance at all. It is very calm and peaceful. It is called Sukha - happiness. Again, this happiness is Dukkha, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not because it causes unhappiness or suffering at that moment but because it does not stay forever. It changes. It starts and finishes. So it is Dukkha</span>. You see Dukkha does not cover only the negative side of life but the positive one as well.<br><br>When we understand this, we will know why even the heavens in the six realms cannot escape this (dukkha), and it is only by the honest cultivation of the Dharma will we be able to be freed from sufferings and attain the Highest Bliss. After all, <strong>all the tripitaka and twelve divisions</strong> (teachings Buddha expounded) all point humanity towards true Bliss. Therefore I say Dukkha is perhaps one of the most misunderstood concept - the reason why Buddhism is sometimes seen as pessimistic. <strong>But the concept of Dukkha is not pessimistic.</strong><br><br><strong><br>A student went to his meditation teacher and said, "My meditation is horrible! I feel so distracted, or my legs ache, or I'm constantly falling asleep. It's just horrible!" "It will pass," the teacher said matter-of-factly. A week later, the student came back to his teacher. "My meditation is wonderful! I feel so aware, so peaceful, so alive! It's just wonderful!' "It will pass," the teacher replied matter-of-factly.<br><br>Zen story</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">see: <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/page4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.ukonline.co.uk/buddhism/page4.htm</a> (concept of Dukkha)</span><br><br>The following conversation took place when my Master came to Singapore for a great dharma discussion session in 1989.<br><br>http://www.jenchen.org.sg/buddhism.htm#dharmatalk<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Question: The title of your Dharma talk is Human Bliss Culture; why then when you answer questions from the audience you did not mention Human Bliss Culture at all? Many of my friends here and I would like to know what is Human Bliss Culture.</span><br><br><strong>The culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Answer: It is because the bliss culture that you have in mind and what I have in mind are different. The bliss culture that you have in mind may be how to prosper with great wealth and fortune, or how to have a good wife in order for the family to have bliss. In this manner, the definition of bliss is too narrow! We need to know that the culture of Buddhism is the real bliss culture. If everybody is able to attain the ultimate Nirvana, then this is indeed the real bliss culture.</span><br><br>Nibbana is the <strong>highest Bliss</strong>. - Dhammapada<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The purpose of our learning Buddhism is to distance from suffering and attain happiness. Many people think that to distance from suffering and attain happiness means going to the Western Pure Land. In fact, it is not only this. When we distance from suffering and attain happiness, we have to instantaneously distance from suffering, instantaneously attain happiness and liberation. Some people may be suspicious; how can liberation be attained so easily? In fact, it is very simple. If someone scolds you, and you apologize to him, then that is a small liberation. If someone hits you, and you retaliate; an eye for an eye, then isnÂ’t that very miserable? What happen if that results in loss of life? Even though you are rude to me, I will still apologise very politely to you. IsnÂ’t that being liberated? This is Jen Chen BuddhismÂ’s teaching of liberation. If whilst alive, we cannot even attain small liberationÂ’s like this, then what more to say of liberation after death? In the course of our daily lives, if we are liberated at every moment, then in time to come we will be able to attain the great liberation. Please think it over, isnÂ’t this a very blissful? This is but to use a small matter to illustrate the path of liberation. If we are able to understand more of the Buddha-Dharma and apply them in our life, family, society, country, and to the extent of the entire humanity of the world, then isnÂ’t this a great bliss culture? Therefore, we say that the culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture.</span></blockquote></div>

Our human cells undergo 'reborning' very 7 years. hence we are actually having a new body every 7 years so to speak. this is relative to countless lifes. Our thoughts also undergo  'reborning' every moments. at one time we like this then on the next we lose our interest.<br>if the previous life 2 ppl were to harm each another, then in future life, if these 2 person were to meet again, they will not go well.<br><br><blockquote>Conscience can be explained from evolutionary theory which is based on evidence and observing reality.

Buddhism can be like theories to you. but many scientists also come up with theories and they prove it from basic logic and tests. that's why even Albert Einstein, to name a few scienists/doctors/philosophy/physicist like what Buddha taught. it's practical.<br><br><blockquote>Why say Karma, which is baseless instead of saying, evolution?

Therefore, that which is to be avoided is superstition, but the emptiness of superstition, which is like the sky, like empty space, is that which is to be practiced. By achieving this, we will be able to see the absolute nature of existence. Therefore, the bodhisattvas' practice is to avoid superstition and thus to achieve the non-superstitious mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>yes there's no nobel prize for attaining nirvana. if there's a prize to claim for attaining nirvana, then it's no longer a nirvana. the "prize" is not a prize, it is inconceivable, it is vast, limitness, timeless with everything within in an emptiness called FREEDOM BLISS yet reaching out to every single existence.<br><br></div>

I repeat - simple, but not easy, because of our karmic tendencies, our mental habits, our attachments and layers of illusions binding us to samsara.<br><br>Therefore it takes a long period of practise...<br><br>If nirvana is so easy to attain, then probably everyone in the world will have become buddhists, but this is not the case.<br><br>Many people are ignorant of buddhism, and many have been attracted to other promises by other religions. I believe a number of singaporeans dont even know what buddhism is about, they relate buddhism to worshipping of gods and deities etc. You get what i mean.<br><br>In the west it is different.

First of all, their main frequencies all appears at the lower Alpha or Delta range that indicates they are more relaxed. Secondly, bandwidth of the main frequency is much narrower that indicates more order and concentration. Thirdly, overall brainwave rhythm is more consistent that indicates higher mind stability. And finally, synchronization of both hemispheres is higher that indicates better coordination.<br><br>What surprised me is that one subjectÂ’s brainwave even showed the pattern of Schumann resonance(See figure below). He told me that he was in the state of deep An-Hsiang while measuring.

Nirvana is beyond conceptualisations. Because concepts, ideas, and knowledge are still under the catergory of 'perceptions' and perceptions is still rooted in ignorance.

            <div class='col-md body'>From our forum friend Longchen,<br><br><blockquote>    In one 'awakening' meditation, I came <strong>to a state of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> thoughts</strong>. Such experiences are very hard to describe. This is because the explanation process itself, is within the medium of thoughts and concepts. It is impossible to describe a state of no thoughts using thoughts! Anyway, in the void of no thoughts, one naturally assume that everything must be an unconscious blank. However, that was not the case! What came next was quite a revelation to me. In the void of no thought, I realise myself to be an omni Presence... Here's how I will describe him.<br><br>"The Presence is all pervasive, yet un-intrusive. IT seems to be in all things and observes with utter passiveness. IT exists beyond concepts, beliefs and do not need any form. Therefore, I understand IT as eternal. IT also seems to be the subtler state of myself. I also got the feeling that IT existed in all my lifetimes or even more. If I were to name IT, I will describe IT as The Eternal Presence."<br><br>I believed the Eternal Presence is the  God/Source Presence within oneself. This Presence is also called the Absolute, Dharmakaya. The paradox of it, is that is this not an object and is absolutely material-less.<br><br>About the Presence, it is ever present for <strong>it is us beyond the mind</strong>. You didn't see it doesn't means it is not there.<br><br>The God Presence is within us and more and IS us; always, even at this moment. This is the part that is simply pure awareness.</blockquote>------<br><br><blockquote>I also too feels that our perception of the universe is a hologram... and that the hologram itself is thoughts.<br><br><strong>As individual selfs, we only perceive our own thoughts... or rather we are these thoughts.</strong><br><br>My opinion is that all of us are individual containments within a vast/infinite 'body' of All that is. We are all one... and are different expressions (reciever) of the ONE.<br><br>When thinking, we perceive ourselves as separate beings. When the thinking mind is stilled (no thoughts/Now), <strong>we realised <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what emanated the thoughts</span></strong>... It appears to me as a 'bright' energetic vastness. This infinite vastness is us... we all meet here.<br><br>Suffering appears to me to be the thoughts... that creates a 'personalised sense of self'. It is the personalised sense of self that gave 'meaning' to the invisible vastness. In the vastness, there appears to me ... 'no meaning'.<br><br>I must say... I have not entered into these experiences long enough to give more concrete answers....<br><br>so these are just my understanding at current stage.</blockquote>Also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=178391" rel="nofollow">The Universe as a Hologram - Holographic Reality</a><br><br></div>
