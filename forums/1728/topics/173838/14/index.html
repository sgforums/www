            <div class='col-md body'>(in continuation of previous post - post split up so as to prevent disappearance after thread expiry)<br><br><blockquote>So each person can find their own truth in Buddhism. Buddha gives you some guidelines and ask to discover it for yourself. But it seems the nature of many people not to be able to trust their own experiences. They want certainty. When they do not find the evidence for something, they cannot simply say I do not know. It makes him feel unstable. So they cling on to "truths" based on other's experience. So you hold on to truths that Jesus and Buddha or the Holy Book teaches even when it does not jell with your own experience.<br><br>It takes someone of the stature of Einstein to understand that Buddha does not expect his disciples to apply his teachings in a dogmatic manner. Buddha expects his disciples to discover the truths for themselves.<br><br>I would suggest that you tell me what your experiences are that makes you hold on to beliefs that should be in the realm of "maybe" "interesting" "I do not know" instead of holding on to them in a dogmatic manner when there are no evidence for them based on your own experience.</blockquote>Although Buddhism definitely helps in our living, in ethical ways, and also seeking tranquility and bliss, liberatedness, I have not yet have any real attainment or insights. But with Awareness of our living, emotions, we do not become afflicted or deluded, that is how we gain in wisdom. Buddhadharma is definitely practical in life and if one practises it will bring results. One should never believe in Buddhism for the sake of believing, but actually practise what the Buddha taught. If one only believes, and never actually utilize what the Buddha taught, then the belief is of little use. I remember Thusness once asked me about my faith.<br><br>[00:04]  oh yes...faith will definitely strengthen when your practice reaps fruit.<br>[00:05]  just want to know whether it is becoz of ur family or urself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>[00:06]  my family isnt so into buddhism except my mother. i get to know about it through my mother when i was younger<br>[00:10]  ic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>[00:10]  then u leh<br>[00:10]  through mostly my experiences. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>[00:11]  oic<br><br>Everyone comes into Buddhism for various reasons. Some people like me, initially got into Buddhism simply liked the teachings and found it very useful. Others have certain meditative experiences and insights and are simply in line with what the Buddha taught... therefore their confidence is unshakeable.<br><br>Reminds me about shariputra.<br><br><a href="http://www.dhammabooks.org/food_for_heart/samma_samadhi_detachment_with2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dhammabooks.org/food_for_heart/samma_samadhi_detachment_with2.htm</a><br><span style="font-style: italic;">SAMMA SAMADHI - DETACHMENT WITHIN ACTIVITY<br><br>Take a look at the example of the Buddha. Both in his own practice and in his methods for teaching the disciples he was exemplary. The Buddha taught the standards of practice as skilful means for getting rid of conceit, he couldn't do the practice for us. Having heard that teaching we must further teach ourselves, practice for ourselves. The results will arise here, not at the teaching.<br><br>The Buddha's teaching can only enable us to get an initial understanding of the Dhamma, but that Dhamma is not yet within our hearts. Why not? Because we haven't yet practiced, we haven't yet taught ourselves. The Dhamma arises at the practice. If you know it, you know it through the practice. If you doubt it, you doubt it at the practice. Teachings from the Masters may be true, but simply listening to Dhamma is not yet enough to enable us to realize it. The teaching simply points out the way to realize. To realize the Dhamma we must take that teaching and bring it into our hearts. That part which is for the body we apply to the body, that part which is for the speech we apply to the speech, and that part which is for the mind we apply to the mind. This means that after hearing the teaching we must further teach ourselves to know that Dhamma, to be that Dhamma.<br><br>The Buddha said that those who simply believe others are not truly wise. A wise person practices until he is one with the Dhamma, until he can have confidence in himself, independent of others.<br><br>On one occasion, while Venerable Sariputta was sitting, listening respectfully at his feet as the Buddha expounded the Dhamma, the Buddha turned to him and asked:<br><br>"Sariputta, do you believe this teaching?" Venerable Sariputta replied, "No, I don't yet believe it". Now this is a good illustration. Venerable Sariputta listened, and he took note. When he said he didn't yet believe he wasn't being careless, he was speaking the truth. He simply took note of that teaching, because he had not yet developed his own understanding of it, so he told the Buddha that he didn't yet believe, because he really didn't believe. These words almost sound as if Venerable Sariputta was being rude, but actually he wasn't. He spoke the truth, and the Buddha praised him for it.<br><br>"Good, good, Sariputta. A wise person doesn't readily believe, he should consider first before believing."<br><br>Conviction in a belief can take various forms. One form reasons according to Dhamma, while another form is contrary to the Dhamma. This second way is heedless, it is a foolhardy understanding, micchaditthi, wrong view. One doesn't listen to anybody else.<br><br>Take the example of Dighanakha the Brahmin. This Brahmin only believed himself, he wouldn't believe others. At one time when the Buddha was resting at Rajagaha, Dighanakha went to listen to his teaching. Or you might say that Dighanakha went to teach the Buddha, because he was intent on expounding his own views ...<br><br>"I am of the view that nothing suits me."<br>This was his view. The Buddha listened to DighanakhaÂ’s view and then answered,<br><br>"Brahmin, this view of yours doesn't suit you either." When the Buddha had answered in this way, Dighanakha was stumped. He didn't know what to say. The Buddha explained in many ways, till the Brahmin understood. He stopped to reflect and saw...<br><br>"Hmm, this view of mine isn't right."<br>On hearing the Buddha's answer the Brahmin abandoned his conceited views and immediately saw the truth. He changed right then and there, turning right around, just as one would invert one's hand. He praised the teaching of the Buddha thus:<br><br>"Listening to the Blessed One's teaching, my mind was illumined, just as one living in darkness might perceive light. My mind is like an overturned basin which has been up righted, like a man who has been lost and finds the way."<br><br>Now at that time a certain knowledge arose within his mind, within that mind which had been up righted. Wrong view vanished and right view took its place. Darkness disappeared and light arose.<br><br>The Buddha declared that the Brahmin Dighanakha was one who had opened the Dhamma Eye. Previously Dighanakha clung to his own views and had no intention of changing them. But when he heard the Buddha's teaching his mind saw the truth, he saw that his clinging to those views was wrong. When the<br>right understanding arose he was able to perceive his previous understanding as mistaken, so he compared his experience with a person living in darkness who had found light. This is how it is. At that time the Brahmin Dighanakha transcended his wrong view.<br><br>Now we must change in this way. Before we can give up defilements we must change our perspective. We must begin to practice rightly and practice well Previously we didn't practice rightly or well, and yet we thought we were right and good just the same. When we really look into the matter we upright ourselves, just like turning over one's hand.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(in continuation of previous post - post split up so as to prevent disappearance after thread expiry)<br><br>Then what about Faith? Yes, for a beginner, faith definitely still help in one's path towards enlightenment. Just like if a person is full of sceptical doubts and no faith, how can he ever start to practise? It's not asking him to blindly believe. But the very least to be a Buddhist, we need to take refuge in the Three Treasures, Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, as our guide. Of course, it is important to find a Buddhist teacher who can guide you. Take refuge's essence is to return to the domain of the enlightenment.<br><br><a href="http://www.astepback.com/buddhism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astepback.com/buddhism.htm</a><br><br>9. From potential to actual Enlightenment there lies the Middle Path, the Eightfold Path "from desire to peace", a process of self-development between the "opposites", avoiding all extremes. The Buddha trod this Path to the end, and the only faith required in Buddhism is the reasonable belief that where a Guide has trodden it is worth our while to tread. The Path must be trodden by the whole man, not merely the best of him, and heart and mind must be developed equally. The Buddha was the All-Compassionate as well as the All-Enlightened One.<br><br><blockquote>If you have experienced it, then maybe you can tell me about it and I see if I experience the same and if I do, we are then in agreement. Otherwise, we continue to cling on to doubt and continue to search or simply rest in the unknown and base all our decisions in life on reality, the known, the ethical if you want to and the logical.</blockquote>If so far all you have done is only reading, reasoning, then I am afraid no matter how enlightened or experienced (i am not - just an example) i am, you will never be in agreement with me.</div>

A person does not necessarily have to believe in levitation to practise Dharma at all, because as I mentioned earlier too, performing so called paranormal abilities is not important in Buddhism. It is OK if you are not convinced about some of these things, but if you have a prejudiced view, and perception of your "reality", then you are in fact living in DOGMATISM. Just like a scientist wld tell a scepticist, if you dont believe, why dont you try to experiment yourself. I have already done it, you can do it too. But instead of doing the experiment and finding out himself which he is able, the person say "It's impossible. Looking at reality, it musn't be true." In that case the person is living in his Dogmas. I think his perception of reality is reality. He doesn't have an open mind.</div>

It defies Western logic. Perhaps the physical universe is not a physical universe at all. Perhaps it is just a play of our own conscious thinking, limited by our own consciousness. Perhaps by shifting our conscious awareness to the subtle more powerful regions of the mind we can transcend the limitations that we have at the more concrete expressions of consciousness that we call physical matter.<br><br>Quantum mechanics, an aspect of modern physics, identifies a field of life called the unified field, or ground state, which is the fundamental nonchanging field of life. It is eternal, unbounded, beyond space and time, wherein are contained all possibilities. It is the unmanifested field of pure potentiality from where all force and matter fields emerge. If you have this you have everything. Some physicists early on have postulated that this unmanifested field of pure potentiality may be consciousness itself. Max Planck stated, "I regard consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative from consciousness." And Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington said, "All through the physical world runs the unknown content that must surely be the stuff of our consciousness."<br><br>Renowned Harvard graduate and physicist, Dr. John Hagelin, is spearheading the cutting edge of the recent discovery that a unified field of consciousness is indeed at the foundation of all conscious experience. He argues that consciousness is fundamental in nature; the lively origin and basis of everything in creation and not merely the result of biochemical processes in the brain. Dr. Hagelin identifies numerous parallels between the qualities of the single unified field sought by Einstein and the qualities of consciousness. He argues that consciousness is the unified field.<br><br>This unified field of consciousness, that is the unified field of nature, is your own inner nature as well. It is your inner Being. It is from here that all impulses of creativity emerge. The reality of life, which was once shrouded in mysticism, is today being understood in terms of modern science. To better understand how consciousness constructs our reality, I highly recommend seeing the documentary-drama film, What the Bleep Do We Know!? For more information, please visit their website at What the BLEEP Do We Know!?<br><br>The unified field is the field of all possibilities because it is the home of all the laws of nature, the residence of the constitution of the universe. This is the level from which all of nature manifests and operates. And it does so according to its inherent constitution, the laws of nature that reside therein. This unified field of the universe has now been discovered to be the unified field of consciousness.<br><br>Because the unified field of consciousness is your own inner nature you need not look far to find it. It is easily experienced through the practice of deep meditation. All you need to do is to bring your awareness to the deep inner level of unified consciousness, and imbibe that status within your conscious awareness. Operating from that status you gain command and support of all the laws of nature.</span></div>
