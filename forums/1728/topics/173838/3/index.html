            <div class='col-md body'>That is a great discovery about Meditation. In fact meditation is increasingly popular worldwide. People of other faiths are also embracing meditation because it REALLY helps.<br><br>When the first telephone appeared. Many, at that time thought that it was the work of Satan. When someone first discovered that the Earth was round, many were skeptical believing Earth was flat. Majority thought that these are all illusion and imagination.<br><br>In my previous post, I did mentioned that so far Buddhism blends in very well with most, if not, everything about Science. But Science at this time is in a progressive stage to realise everything about Buddhism. Science today have not make a complete discovery about everything. I agree that things which do not conformed with science is doubtful. But I cannot take the assumption that things that have not yet discovered by Science are not true. Because at this time, TIME cannot and they probably will not claim or say that Heaven and Hell do not exist. Hence, it cannot be classified as illusion or imagination. Because this has not been proven false.<br><br>It is only now that I came to realise that most are concerned about the existence of Heaven and Hell. As I am gaining more insights to the spectacular wisdom the this wonderful and peaceful spiritual tradition. This has become more and more irrelevant. Because in the SAMSARA, it is sufferings. This is not the focus of a true Buddhist. Although, there are such realms, they are of no concerned to a true Buddhist.<br><br>It's really about your life and your choices. If you want to insist about having TIMES to justify or verify everything. By all means pls, this probably means you have to wait for a very long long time. But, in Buddhism, we can proof it ourselves through deep meditation. Many have done it in Buddhist community.<br>In Buddhism, the answer we are seeking is from within. And this will be more convincing than any other external proofs.<br><br>There is also good articles about Science and Buddhism by Ajahn Brahm - A British-American monk.<br><br>It will be more worth while and helpful for you to be at TIME forum page than to be here.<br><br></div>
