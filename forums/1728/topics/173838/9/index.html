Think about it. I am just using a small example to explain liberation. We start from cultivating small liberations and later eventually we will achieve complete liberation and enlightenment.<br><br>The reason why Buddhism is still relevant to present day living is because sickness, ageing, death continues to exist, sufferings and distress continues to exist in this world. And Nirvana is the only ultimate solution to samsara. Even modern psychology/psychiatry is learning from Buddhism, but anyway, psychology is still limited bcos it cannot bring one to the unconditioned realm where no more sufferings can affect you eternally. As long as humans exist, Buddhism is relevant.<br><br>And if you are talking about moral ethics, Buddhism ethics is definitely relevant to modern life. Is 5 precepts relevant to Modern day? I say it definitely is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> 5 precepts is only a very basic guideline for lay disciples.<br><br>If one practises the dharma, naturally he will not be immoral. When one cultivated samadhi and wisdom, naturally he will not break precepts anymore. At that moment, 5 precepts is no longer that important, not bcos its not important, but becos its merely a guideline and the wise would already avoid breaking precepts with or without the guideline.<br><br>Therefore keeping precepts is one matter, very important is to practise and cultivate our own innate wisdom. With the true wisdom of the Buddha, the person is definitely and naturally an ethical and morally upright person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by casino_king:<br><br>Only to Buddhists it is not mental conditioning. Other than change in your own thought patterns, nothing else have changed. </blockquote>I tell you what is mental conditioning. When there is an illusion of a 'Self', the 'Self' grasps on past, present, future, he grasps on forms of self, people, thoughts and time. All these are mental conditionings. They are conditioned mental phenomena.<br><br>Buddhism doesnt ask you to change thought patterns and illusions, but to get rid of all these illusions together, and to get rid of this 'Self' illusion.<br><br>Buddhists treat sufferings at its root. Others may use different ways to change mental thoughts, like when you are in stress, you try to recall something good, something beautiful, but buddhism doesnt need any of this. Therefore it is BEYOND mental conditionings. Nothing is changed, just that you are liberated.<br><br>Using a very simple analogy: you are very sad now because something bad happened 5 days ago. But if you can see through the illusions and let it go, your mind is no longer conditioned by "what happened five days ago".<br><br><blockquote>Nirvana is an imaginary place because there is no evidence for it. Samsara is just another exotic but nonetheless meaningless replacement for "world." My advice to you is to live in the realm of reality rather than "nirvana" or "samsara." </blockquote>Nirvana is not even a place to speak of as it is beyond time and space.<br><br>The reason why samsara is not simply termed as 'the world' is because a person can experience Nirvana right here without leaving 'the world'.. although the Nirvana is called 'nirvana with remainder'. And you are right in a sense, that samsara is refering to the world, but not just the world. Lets see what samsara means. The literal translation of samsara means 'The world of DUKKHA', as I have covered the meaning of Dukkha in the previous post I believe you should understand by now. But if one's mind is completely pure, SAMSARA is immediately changed into PURE LAND.<br><br>As I have said many times, but you persistantly ignore what I said. Please read before posting.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I dont know what you mean by evidence. So many people have attained it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So they are living proof and witness to the statement "there is nirvana". But if you are asking for proof as in... the stuff namelessness did, then I also have mentioned, or rather my ex-moderator himself has mentioned, ...because I knew that current scientific progress is not advanced enough to prove anything yet. We could only get a small glimpse of it.<br><br>But we can infer it by many buddhist spiritual masters who have attained enlightenment, and enlightened friends, being with them and learning from them.</span><br><br>Sinweiy made a good point: Evidence is in reality. It is only the matter of how illusioned you are or how enlightened you are. Even if you are illusioned doesnt mean the REAL is not there, but you have not realised it. But countless people had. The 3 dharma seals of impermanence, non-self, nirvana, can be realised and countless people of past and present who became enlightened can testify it.</div>

It starts from the root of known experience and not blind faith. Human problems must be understood by one through human experience and solved by developing great humane qualities. One should find the solution through the purification and development of the human Mind, and not through outsiders. That is why the Buddha never introduced Himself as a supernatural savior. He did not acknowledge that there is such a savior. According to Him, we can be our own saviors.<br><br>Buddhism never found the need to give new interpretations to its teachings. Newly verified scientific discoveries never contradict the teachings of the Buddha as the method and teachings of Buddhism are scientifically valid. Buddhism's principles can be maintained under any circumstances without changing its basic ideas. The understanding capacity of the value of these religious ideas may diminish and disappear from Human's Mind. And Human may experience the difficulty of practicing these principles in a corrupted society. However, the value of the Buddha's teaching will be appreciated by every cultured and understanding person at any time. As complimented by Albert Einstein (Physicist and Mathematician), winner of the Noble Prize, who is popularly regarded as the most outstanding scientist of the Twentieth Century:<br><br>"The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description... If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs, it would be Buddhism."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Other than change in your own thought patterns, nothing else have changed.<br><br>Nirvana is an imaginary place because there is no evidence for it. Samsara is just another exotic but nonetheless meaningless replacement for "world." My advice to you is to live in the realm of reality rather than "nirvana" or "samsara." </div></blockquote>To live is to experience a greater or lesser degree of dissatisfaction. The Buddha never denied that there is joy and happiness in life. But the nagging problem of dissatisfaction is always around, while "happiness" is always swiftly fleeting by. This is the only problem in our lives. But it is the biggest problem as it encompasses all problems we face. The Buddha is only drawing our attention to the fact that suffering is an inevitable part of life, that it is a problem that all experience, and wish to avoid, and that it can be overcome with the attainment of Nirvana (True Happiness).<br><br>Nirvana is the ground of being, the substance of all that is. For example, a wave does not have to "die" in order to become water. Water is the substance of the wave. The wave is already water. We are also likewise. We carry in us the ground of inter-being (inter-connectedness), Nirvana, the "world" beyond birth and death, permanence and impermanence, self and non-self. Nirvana is the complete silencing of concepts and phenomena - True Peace. Nirvana is the ground of all that is, just as waves do not exists out of water. If you know how to touch the waves, you know how to touch water at the same time. Nirvana does not exist separate of Anicca and AnattÃ¡. If you know how to use them to touch reality, you touch Nirvana in the here and the now.<br><br>Nirvana is the extinction of all notions. Birth and death are notions. Being and non-being are notions. In our daily lives, we have to deal with these relative realities. But if we touch life more deeply, reality will reveal itself in a different way. When you understand Anicca and AnattÃ¡, you are already free of much suffering and in touch with Nirvana. Nirvana is not something you look for in the future. As a Dharma Seal, it is present in every one of the Buddha's teachings. Nirvana is not the absence of life. Nirvana can be found in this very life. Nirvana means the pacifying, silencing or extinguishment of the fire of suffering. Nirvana teaches that we are already what we want to become within. We don't have to run after anything anymore. We only need to return to ourselves and touch or true nature. When we do this, we will have real peace and joy.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Buddhism is about becoming fully human - an awakened one. If an enlightened person show that he is a superhuman, then people may think that his state is very far and unachieveable, and may lose interest altogether. Buddhism isnt about idol worshipping someone superhuman - but learning to be awakened like them. What is your idea of 'superhuman' anyway?

I dont know how to say, but there is just something different when you meet them.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Forgetfulness is a human characteristic. Enlightenment can only be attained by a human being. An enlightened being doesn't become super-human, but rather fully human. Ven. Thien-An had a way of being that showed he was right there in each moment. He saw clearly and was able to communicate that clarity. We learned from his presence beyond what we learned from his words. He spoke with a smile of mind-to-mind transmission, the most important learning of all.<br><br>Can we really know if another person is enlightened? Maybe only the person having that experience can tell. Of course, that can be very dangerous; it may be our ego rather than our clarity that is telling us that we are attained. We may not be able to discern the difference until we have expanded our ego to include all. More importantly, if we focus constantly on our state of being and on the concept of enlightenment as a goal, we may miss the process of being in each moment, and thus never find it.</span><br><br>And as I have always mentioned, <span style="font-style: italic;">I dont know what you mean by evidence.

Monks, nuns, and ordinary meditators can reach such deep meditations that they can not only levitate, but they can remember previous lives! Many people can actually do this. When you come out of a deep meditation you have incredible energy. Afterwards you won't be able to go to sleep, nor will you be able to go and watch TV, because the mind will be too full of its own joy and happiness. Moreover, the mind is so empowered that you can make suggestions to it, suggestions that you would not normally be able to fulfil. But empowered by deep meditation, you can follow the suggestions. I've actually taught this special meditation to people on meditation retreats, because on meditation retreats some get deep results. People sometimes get memories of when they were babies, and then of being in their mother's womb. If they are lucky they get memories of when they were a very old person, i.e. memories from a past life! One of the important things with those past life memories is that they are very real to the person experiencing them. It's as if you are back there experiencing it. Anyone who has had a memory like that has no doubt in their mind about past lives. It's not a theory any more. Such memories are like remembering where you were this morning when you had breakfast. You have no doubts that that was you this morning, having that breakfast. You didn't imagine it. With the same clarity, or even greater clarity, you remember that that very old person was you, only it wasn't a few hours ago, it was many decades ago. It was a different time, a different body and a different life. Now if people can do that on nine day meditation retreats, imagine what you would do if you were a monk or a nun, who meditates not just for a weekend, or for nine days, but nine years, twenty-nine, thirty-nine, or fifty-nine years. Imagine how much power you could generate in that meditation. Now imagine how much more power you could generate if you were a Buddha with an Enlightened mind.<br><br>Now you know what to do to discover for yourself if you've lived before. Meditate. I don't mean just meditating to get rid of stress and make your self calm. I mean really meditate, deeply. Meditate to get your mind into what we call the Jhānas. Those are deep states of absorption, where the body disappears. You don't feel. You can't see. You can't hear. You're absolutely inside the mind. You have no thoughts but you are perfectly aware. You are blissed out. The method, the instructions for the experiment, are very clearly laid down. Even in my little book "The Basic Method of Meditation" all the steps are there. Follow them, and invest the resources necessary for doing that experiment not just one weekend retreat, but many weekend retreats, and sometimes many years of meditating. If you want to follow that 'scientific method', you have to enter into a Jhāna. And then, after you emerge from that state, you ask yourself, "What is my earliest memory?" You can keep going back in your mind, and eventually you will remember. You will see for yourself the experience of past lives. Then you know. Yes, it is true! You have had the experience for yourself.<br><br>The Buddha said he did remember past lives, many past lives, many aeons of past lives. He said specifically that he remembered ninety-one aeons. That's ninety big bangs, the time before and the time afterwards, huge spaces of time. That's why the Buddha said there was not just one universe, but many universes. We are not talking about parallel universes as some scientists say. We are talking about sequential universes, with what the Buddha called sanvattati vivattati. This is Pāli, meaning the unfolding of the universe and the infolding of it, beginnings and endings.<br><br>The suttas even give a measure for the lifetime of a universe. When I was a theoretical physicist, my areas of expertise were the very small and the very large; fundamental particle physics and astrophysics. They were the two aspects that I liked the most, the big and the small. So I knew what was meant by the age of a universe and what a 'big bang' was all about. The age of a universe, the last time I looked in the journals, was somewhere about seventeen thousand million years. In the Buddhist suttas they say that about thirty seven thousand million years is a complete age. When I told that to the state astronomer he said yes, that estimate was in the ball park, it was acceptable. The person who was the convener of the Our Place in Space seminar made a joke about the fact that a hundred or two hundred years ago, Christianity said the universe was about seven thousand years old. That estimate certainly isn't acceptable, the Buddhist one is!<br><br>It is remarkable that there was a cosmology in Buddhism twenty-five centuries ago that doesn't conflict with modern physics. Even what astronomers say are galaxies, the Buddha called wheel systems. If any of you have ever seen a galaxy, you will know there are two types of galaxy. First, there is the spiral galaxy. The Milky Way is one of those. Have you seen a spiral galaxy? It is like a wheel! The other type is the globular cluster, which looks like a wheel with a big hub in the middle. 'Wheels' is a very accurate way of describing galaxies. This was explained by someone twenty five centuries ago, when they did not have telescopes! They didn't need them, they could go there themselves!<br><br>There is a lot of interesting stuff in the old suttas, even for those of you who like weird stuff. Some times people ask this question, "Do Buddhists believe in extra terrestrial beings, in aliens?" Would an alien landing here upset the very foundation of Buddhism? When I was reading through these old suttas I actually found a reference to aliens! It's only a very small sutta, which said that there are other world systems with other suns, other planets, and other beings on them. That's directly from the Anguttara Nikāya.

Buddhism has no sacred cows. However, I encourage you to do those experiments for yourselves. I'll bet you will find out that there is no one 'in there'. You will find out about kamma. You will find out you've been here before, that this is not your first life. If you don't behave yourselves in this life, you'll have another life to come yet. Do you think you are finished with nappies, with school? Do you really want to go through all that again? If not be careful.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So, here is my thinking about science and Buddhism. I think that Buddhism is pure science, a science that doesn't stop 'out there', but also investigates the mind, the 'being', the 'ghost in the machine'. And it doesn't disregard any anomalies. Buddhism takes everything as its data, especially experience, and looks at it scientifically. It is incredibly successful.<br><br>One of the reasons why people celebrate science is because of all of its achievements in technology. One of the reasons why Buddhism is growing these days is because of all of its achievements in the 'technology of the mind'. It solves problems. It explains mental difficulties. Buddhism succeeds in solving those inner problems because it has all these strategies, these ancient 'gizmos', which actually work. If you try some of these Buddhist gizmos, you will find out for yourself that they produce the goods, they solve your inner suffering and pain. That is why Buddhism is growing. I think that Buddhism will supplant science!</span><br><br>Thank you very much.</blockquote>Also see, <strong>Come and See for Yourself</strong> and <strong>BUDDHISM, THE ONLY REAL SCIENCE</strong> from the Buddhism and Science article.</div>
