It deals only with the empirical facts of conscious experience and prescribes the techniques for mental development.</span> - http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/burns/wheel088.html<br><br>Buddha did not become enlightened through academic research of mental process or theoretical analysis - as i mentioned, buddha is beyond theory (remember the sutta quote? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">). He became enlightened through direct intuitive experience and realising the nature of all phenomenon.<br><br>Nothing in science can reach Buddha's level of insights on this area.</div>

As I have mentioned before, modern science is so into finding what is 'outside' but they have forsaken the 'within'.<br><br>Buddhism is much more advanced that anything else in terms of 'spiritual science'.<br><br>Lots of things you may not see it or believe it, but doesnt mean it is not true. Imagine you take a time machine back 3000 years ago, and tell people the world is round, that it is possible to make a machine that can fly in the sky, people think you are insane.<br><br>So the truth is, in terms of 'spiritual science', the world is still very backward. But if you realise the truths yourself, you will be among the minority who really know that 'the world is round' and 'you can make a machine that can fly in the sky'.<br><br><blockquote>Do you see the assumptions that you have made?<br>1. Spitiual matters.<br>What in the world are spiritual matters? To say that there is a spirit is not "well founded." Spirit is ancient man's worldview. Today, many "spiritual" phenomena are understood in terms of reality.</blockquote>Like? As far as I know, science has no real knowledge about spirituality.<br><br><blockquote>When I look at Buddhism, frankly it is quite attractive. In the sense that it provides some interesting ideas for consideration. Unfortunately, it has many fantastic claims and assumptions and allusions that goes with it.</blockquote>A round earth, and aeroplanes that fly in the sky, sounds very very fantastic to indigenous tribes and people who lived 3000 years ago. So as I just said... <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Lots of things you may not see it or believe it, but doesnt mean it is not true.</span><br><br><blockquote>So I am simply curious why Buddhists like yourself, seemingly an educated person would find it normal to accept the fantasy? OK maybe to you it is not fantasy. How else would you then describe things that has not been proven?</blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">[22:09]  in pure awareness, there is complete clarity with no sense of 'I'.  This clarity is so complete and clear that there is no doubt.<br>[22:10]  becoz it is the only Real and therefore no doubt.<br>[22:11]  words will prove futile here.<br>[22:11]  one do not doubt about the experience of Suchness or Isness.<br>[22:11]  or lose confident...etc<br>[22:11]  coz it is more real than the real. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></span><br><br><blockquote>KARMA is just a suggestion and a possibility but is meaningless because we see bad things happen to good people and good things happening to bad people.</blockquote>KARMA is most meaningful because it explains why bad things happen to good people, it is not fate, it is not because God is unfair, but it is due to karma brought over from a past life.<br><br>There is a saying "if you want to know your past life, look at what you are in the present. if you want to know your future life, look at what you are doing now."<br><br><blockquote>We know for example that on the whole, being educated brings tangible verifiable calculable results. So an educated person wants his children to be educated. Instead of teaching "Karma" to his children, an educated person will strive to educate his child or ensure that his child is well educated.</blockquote>Why compare education and karma? And how does what you learn from school and karma contradict? Nothing.<br><br><blockquote>We know that a healthy lifestyle leads to a healthy life and so we live a healthy lifstyle and not assume that we are sick because of some things we did in our past life.</blockquote>And how does knowing karma contradict with having healthy lifestyle? Karma is NOT fate but sort of the opposite.<br><br><blockquote>We know for example that addiction is a function of brain chemicals. We will then with that knowledge devise startegies to help that person overcome his addiction instead of preaching to him. Againg we do not preach to him unless we are convimced that preaching to him will help.</blockquote>What kind of addiction? Alcohol addiction.. drug addiction.. yes its a function of chemicals. And he needs to take drugs to neutralise the effects and still he need to undergo counselling.<br><br>But things like gambling cannot be cured by taking chemicals. You mean gambling is an addiction that will be cured by drugs? Even if he gone insane bcos of gambling and needs to take drugs, I believe the most important is counselling and helping him psychologically.<br><br>In Buddhism we dont preach dharma to people and not help them. All dharmas taught by Buddha are meant to lead everyone to liberation. If the drug/gambling/etc addict is able to meet the Buddha, the better. The Buddha will teach him the dharma to be liberated from that addiction. Buddhadharma is the ultimate solution to addictions and the ultimate 'drug' to cure afflictions.<br><br>As I have mentioned before, all dharmas taught by Buddha are like medicine that cures disease, and a raft that brings us to the other shore. Why medicine? Because it cures us from our afflictions and achieve tranquility and bliss.<br><br>In Buddhism, we dont preach but help. Not like other religions. Do you ever see Buddhist evangelist and people who forcefully preach onto others? Or religious holy wars fought by Buddhism?<br><br><blockquote>I study Christianity, Buddhism and Hinduism (mainly these three) for some ideas but I do not buy into the fantastic stuff. </blockquote>Nothing is fantastic and can be seen for yourself. Take rebirth for an example.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...One of the important things with those past life memories is that they are very real to the person experiencing them. <strong>It's as if you are back there experiencing it. Anyone who has had a memory like that has no doubt in their mind about past lives. It's not a theory any more. Such memories are like remembering where you were this morning when you had breakfast. You have no doubts that that was you this morning, having that breakfast. You didn't imagine it. With the same clarity, or even greater clarity, you remember that that very old person was you, only it wasn't a few hours ago, it was many decades ago.</strong> It was a different time, a different body and a different life....</span><br><br>And of course when you attain enlightenment the Buddhadharma will become doubtless to you. You will realise the essence - the reality of yourself and the universe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Casino_King,<br><br>Â‘Spiritual MattersÂ’ is merely a term to denote paranormal phenomenon, it is not an assumption.  However If I were to assert that Â‘spiritual matters really existÂ’, then it is an assumption.  I believe I have not done so. Similarly if anyone were to assert that Â“spiritual matters do not existÂ” then he/she immediately makes it an assumption.  The fact is, paranormal phenomenons are neither proven nor disproved.  Thus, we have to explore further.  But which and what method of exploration should we adopt?<br><br>I have stated that mere logical analysis isnÂ’t the correct approach -- Â“<strong>It is inadequate to use rational thought to understand spiritual matters</strong>Â”, I have given my reasons.  If you disagree, you must, at least tell me why or how through inference or syllogism itself is sufficient to Â‘understandÂ’ spiritual matters.  Or<strong> prove </strong>that -- Â“It is inadequate to use rational thought to understand spiritual mattersÂ” is an untrue statement through logic of syllogism.  Otherwise it is only reasonable and logical to employ a different approach.<br><br>Till now I have not spoken anything about Buddhism.  I certainly do not want to deviate too much from this forum but as what many forumers have pointed out, you might have to put in a little more effort towards understanding some of the main core concepts and teachings of Buddhism  -- Buddhism certainly isn't what you have perceived it to be.  Like you, I have made some studies and practices in other religions (add Taoism to your list), I still think Buddhism best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Lastly I do see some of your points.  You might want to look into how man is defined by symbols for your gambler case.  Again what I am going to say next might not be soothing to your ears but Buddhism truly teaches us how to go beyond these symbols.  In whatever case, reserve an open for a fruitful discussion.  We might not reach any conclusion but without an open mind, any form of discussion will eventually prove futile.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Mr CASINO,<br><br>Buddhist doctrine of rebirth <span style="text-decoration: underline;">should be distinguished from the theory of reincarnation</span> which implies the transmigration of a soul and its invariable material rebirth. Buddhism denies the existence of an unchanging or eternal soul created by a God or emanating from a Divine Essence (Paramatma).<br><br><strong>When did rebirth begin?</strong><br><br>Our Mind, that carries over from life to life has no beginning - its continuity is infinite. Each moment of our Mind is a continuation of the previous moment. Who we are and what we think and feel depends on who we were yesterday. Our present Mind is a continuation of the past Mind. One moment of our Mind was caused by the previous moment of our Mind. This continuity can be traced back to childhood and even to when we were a fetus in our Mother's womb. Even before the time of conception, our mind-stream existed in another body.<br><br>Using the example of a number line, looking left from position zero, there is no first negative number, and looking right, there is no highest last number - one more can always be added. Likewise, our mind-stream has no beginning or end. We all have had countless past rebirths, and our Mind will continue to exist infinitely. By purifying our mind-stream, we can make our future existence better and better.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

A principle or belief or a group of them: Â“The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy presentÂ” (Abraham Lincoln).</span><br><br>Since the truths of Buddhism is not derived by mere theory, or beliefs, neither are we asked to blindly believe in them, none of the truths Buddha taught can be classified as 'dogmas'.<br><br>Rather, those who fervently DISbelief it, maybe because they do not want to believe in it for some reasons, which is really a mere assumption due to his incapability to perceive what the Buddha perceived, it is his dogma.<br><br>Would you fervently disbelief what science has proven so far?

I think Thusness said very well here. It is merely your assumption. Logical assumption. Is logical reasoning REALITY? Far from it. If "logical reasoning" can lead someone to believe that we will never one day fly on aeroplanes, or the world is actually not flat but round, then there is no reason why "logical reasoning" alone cannot lead to the comprehension of spiritual truths.<br><br>Let me cite you an example. You are just like a person, who after seeing that a scientist has done certain experiments and proven a scientific fact. Then you say "as far as my experience tell me and by looking at reality, there is simply no evidence of past live and rebirth". The fact is the experiment is done by uncountable people, and you can do it yourself to find out, but instead of doing that experiment you proclaim that just because it is not within your perception it is not true. So what is Reality? Your own perception of "reality"? What Buddha attained is attainable by all of us. The ultimate result is ENLIGHTENMENT, BUDDHAHOOD.<br><br>And Thusness also said, you cannot derive answers to spiritual matters through logical deduction. Please read carefully and seriously consider what Thusness said.<br><br><blockquote>Neither has your experience. Without past lives and rebirth, then Karma is out too.</blockquote>That's because I haven't really been practising, and neither do I meditate very deeply. You should ask someone else who meditates more deeply. I have mentioned a few of our forummers here have recalled their previous lifetimes. I am merely a learner.<br><br>Although  I dont meditate often as of now (I will make an effort to do so) the times I meditate, there are really interesting experiences which I would rather not relate now. As I said I am still new to Buddhism, I only began interest a few years ago when I was 12, my mother brought me to the dharma centre to learn the dharma.<br><br>Not only will you see your past life, through practise you will also gradually understand and see Karma.
