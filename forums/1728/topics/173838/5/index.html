He refuses to appear on TV or radio, and magazine interviews are rarely granted.<br><br>But that doesnÂ’t stop us from calling attention StevensonÂ’s amazing and vitally important work.

And science cant do much when pertaining to things like consciousness beyond physical body, when modern science still knows so little about the nature of consciousness.<br><br>Many many people (especially v strong in meditation/samadhi) have developed the abilities to know far beyond our human world. It is not possible to be mental hallucinations as bcos these things arent just seen 'in a blur', but with clarity even stronger than what we normally experience because it is done in Samadhi. They can perceive faraway realms while we cant. They can also recall past lives. Whether or not you believe, it's ok. Because most important is your own experience and realisation.<br><br>In any way, you said 'Which is why right from the beginning I asked what you people derived from being a Buddhist when it is based not on reality but on imagination.' Buddhism is definitely not imagination, because we can testify what Buddha said, realise the truths of reality, and attain the highest bliss. There is so little that Science knows about the nature of consciousness, and honest scientists will admit that. In fact modern science has still a long way to go. Will you believe that the world is flat just because everyone else thinks so? There are always things that science still knows very little about. So far, I have not seen much that Buddhist teachings are in contradiction with modern science.<br><br>Go back to the basics and find out what Buddhism is all about and simply focus on the fundamental aspects of Buddhist practise. You will find out the other aspects one day. There is no need to be overly concerned.<br><br>What is important is that Buddha, and uncountable people have attained enlightenment and achieved liberation in the past and today.<br><br>We are not very concerned even if science has not proven certain aspects of Buddhist teachings. And it may never be possible in our lifetime. But Buddhism is definitely relevant to our daily lives.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/boowa/london.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/boowa/london.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Magga means the path, which the Buddha declared using the principles of the Middle Way. It is therefore the only path which always leads straight and steadfastly to Vimutti (freedom). It is never outdated, never having to be altered or changed in any way to keep up with changing situations and changing times. Even if everything should go on changing until they turn and turn about, the Dhamma of the Middle Way (Majjhima Dhamma) will still be the Dhamma which is always consistent. If we liken it to a medicine, it would be a medicine which doctors have already experimented with and proven the worth of and which is being used to cure disease. All Dhammas have already been completely tried and proven by the Buddha and there is no reason for doubting or being sceptical about them, for the proving of these Dhammas resulted in the enlightenment of the Buddha. Furthermore, all of the Buddha's disciples also attained the field of Vimutti by means of these Dhammas in the same way....</span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the same author, Ajahn Maha Boowa (a Thai Arhant: liberated saint who attained nirvana/enlightenment):<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/boowa/straight.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/boowa/straight.html</a><br><br>...<strong>Birth &amp; Death</strong><br><br>People come with questions Â— some of which I can remember Â— and everyone has the question that's waiting right at the barn door: Is there a next world after death? The next world, who goes on to the next world: These sorts of things aren't any one person's issue. They're an issue for all of us who are carrying a burden. When people ask this sort of question, I ask them in return, 'Was there a yesterday? Was there a this morning? Is there a present at this moment?' They admit that there was and is. 'Then will there be a tomorrow? A day after tomorrow? A this month? A next month? A this year? A next year and years after that?'<br><br>Things in the past that we can remember, we can use to make guesses about the future. Even for things that haven't yet happened, we can make comparisons with things that have already occurred. The future has to follow the way things have been in the past. For example, yesterday has already occurred, today is occurring. These things have followed one after the other. We know this, we remember, we haven't forgotten. This afternoon, this evening, tonight, tomorrow morning: We've already seen that things have been like this. This is the way things have happened, without being otherwise, and so we accept that this is the way they will continue to be.<br><br>Doubts about this world and the next, or about things concerning ourselves: This is delusion about ourselves. This is why these things become big issues, causing endless fuss all over the world of rebirth. 'Is there a next world? When people die, are they reborn?' These questions go together, for who is it that takes birth and dies? We ourselves Â— always dying and taking birth. What comes to this world and goes to the next world is us. Who else would it be? If not for this being of the world, this wanderer, there wouldn't be anyone weighed down with these questions and burdens.<br><br>This is the harm of delusion, of being unable to remember. It shows within us, but we can't catch hold of its causes, of why it has come about. Things that have happened, we can't remember. Our own affairs spin us around in circles and get us so tangled up that we don't know which way to go. This is why self-delusion is an endless complication. Being deluded about other things is not so bad, but being deluded about ourselves blocks all the exits. We can't find any way out. The results come right back at us Â— they don't go anywhere else Â— bringing us suffering, because these sorts of doubts are questions with which we bind ourselves, not questions by which we set ourselves free. We can have no hope of resolving and understanding these doubts if we don't find confirmation of the Dhamma in the area of meditation.<br><br>This is why the Lord Buddha taught us to unravel and look at our own affairs. But unraveling our own affairs is something very critical. If we do it by guessing or speculating or whatever, we won't succeed. The only way to succeed is to develop goodness step by step as a means of support and of drawing us in to mental development (bhavana), or meditation, so as to unravel and look at our own affairs, which lie gathered in the range of meditation. This is what will lead us to know clearly and to cut through our doubts, at the same time leading us to satisfactory results. We will be able to stop wondering about death and rebirth or death and annihilation.....</blockquote></div>

Because people are often biased. Buddhism gives you a scientific method for your practice. Buddhism says, do the experiment and find out for your self if what the Buddha said is true or not. Check out your experience. For example, develop the method to test the truth of past lives, rebirth and reincarnation. Don't just believe it with faith, find out for yourself. The Buddha has given a scientific experiment that you can repeat...</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Keep an open mind until you complete the experiment. The experiment is the practice of sila, samadhi and panna, (virtue, meditation and insight). The experiment is Buddhist practice.

Another way of expressing this is, "Abandon negative action; create perfect virtue; subdue your own mind. This is the teaching of the Buddha." By abandoning negative actions (killing, etc) and destructive motivations (anger, attachment, close-mindedness, etc.), we stop harming ourselves and others. By creating perfect virtue, we develop beneficial attitudes, like impartial love and compassion, and do actions motivated by these thoughts. By subduing our mind, we cut away all false projections, thus making ourselves calm and peaceful by understanding reality.<br><br>The essence of BuddhaÂ’s teaching is also contained in the three principles of the path: definite emergence, the dedicated heart and wisdom realizing emptiness.

It is simply too narrow minded to think that what we perceive is all that exists. If we haven't found out extra-terrestrial planets, doesn't mean that existence of aliens can be ruled out.<br><br>Although science has proven many things that Buddha has said, there are still a lot of things that science does not know yet. Nevertheless this is unimportant, as concerned man has said, go find the scientists in regards to scientific things. This is not of Buddhism's concerns. Our concern is spiritual cultivation, attaining wisdom, bliss and liberation, to realise the truths that Buddha taught us, and not simply scientific proves of 'spirit world' existence. Our concerns are - to do good, avoid evil, and purify our mind. If you want 'evidence that can be verified independently', Buddha's instruction is to cultivate the dharma, and you can verify everything yourself. Not just about 'spirit world' etc, but the ultimate truth of the Buddha. Many people have already done that, and everyone can.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">and if no harm comes to others from your belief</span><br><br>Buddhism is the only religion that does not have holy wars. No wars have been fought in the history of Buddhism, so unlike other monotheistic religions, nobody else will be harmed by Buddhist beliefs, and we do not advocate blind faith. Non-killing, peace, compassion, are very important in Buddhism.</div>

I do not see the fuss over this because there are no real contradictions between Buddhism and Science. Certainly there are things that Buddha taught but not yet proven by science, but just because science have not proven it or lack knowledge about it, it does not mean Buddhism is superstitious. It could be otherwise - that Buddha is in fact much more advanced than modern science (in fact we already know that many things Buddha taught were only discovered recently by scientists). If someone were to tell you that the world is round when everyone else thought it was flat, do you dismiss it as superstitious? Not necessarily. Truths that Buddha expounded isnt something that he simply made up or believed in, but truths that he REALISED through his cultivation and meditation. And it can be verified by uncountable others who also attained enlightenment under his guidance and teachings.<br><br>ENLIGHTENMENT in Buddhism requires an 'inward journey' to discover the innermost reality. The way I understand SCIENCE is probably different from yours. By walking this inward journey is in fact by conducting the ultimate experiment. In Buddhism its OK to doubt, and when enlightenment takes place, in Zen Buddhism its called "the great doubt shatters". So many enlightened people have already 'proven' over and over again the truths that Buddha taught. And if you are in doubt, simply do the experiment for yourself. <span style="font-style: italic;">...Keep an open mind until you complete the experiment. The experiment is the practice of sila, samadhi and panna, (virtue, meditation and insight). The experiment is Buddhist practice. Do the same experimental procedures that the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. Repeat it and see if you get the same results. The result is called Enlightenment...<br><br>- Ajahn Brahmavamso</span><br><br>Buddhism is one of its kind - not something replaceable like rhino horns with paracetamol. Psycology and psychiatry will never replace Buddhism either, and in fact, modern psychology and psychiatry had a lot to learn from Buddhism. Buddhism is also in fact beyond the conditioning of the mind. Ultimately it leads to the Unconditioned - which we call Nirvana. Buddhism is also neither a religion in the context of worshipping higher beings or Creator. And there is nothing else that leads someone to complete liberation and realisation of emptiness. Again I would like to say:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br>Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.<br><br>- Majjhima Nikaya, 72</span></div>
