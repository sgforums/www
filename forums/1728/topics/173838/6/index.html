It looks like you do not even know Buddhism. Please read more.<br><br>Non Buddhists cope with sufferings by 1) escape (danger: may lead to suicide) 2) tolerance. Tolerance is a good virtue, but in Buddhism, we practise Wu2 Ren3 Ke2 Ren3. Wu ren ke ren here doesnt mean we cannot tolerate it anymore, but we are instantaneously liberated from that situation, what is there to tolerate in the first place?<br><br><blockquote>Christians cope by believing in a personal God and that it is God's will.<br><br>I think the best is still to use logic and reality based solutions rather than coping using magic and superstitions.<br><br>There might be uneducated and ignorant people who have no other means other than to believe in magic and superstitions but the fact that you are participating in a forum tells us that you are educated and logical.

It is also not a religion in the sense that we do not worship a Creator, supreme beings, or gods, etc. We do not emphasize nor talk about the supernatural. But it is also true that the mind's power is much more than most people understand, and things lilke 'psychic abilities' can be developed through practise. But again, Buddhist teachers and Buddha himself would advise you not to seek these things - Wisdom and Liberation is much more crucial.</div>

Each cause will result in an effect.<br><br>There was once a blind monk who stepped on some bugs and the other monks reported it to the Buddha. The Buddha said that the monk committed no karma because he has no intentions of it. But if you purposely kill it, you create bad karma.</div>

(if you ever notice or aware that you even have wisdom or not) evidence can be complex and too profound to be able to perceive and understood. it can appear to you but because of overly ignorant or ego-clouded misconceptions you sometimes pass it or stubbornly unwilling to accept. its all up there in the mind, the truth is inside.<br><br>well, you have just (indirectly) understood the meaning of life and purpose for the existence of past present and future to come.<br><br>like the buddha had mentioned, do not simply believe what the books say, do not believe simply whats been passed down or rumoured or what others say or what the authoritative ppl say. investigate, experience it for yourself to see the truth which is possible and can be impossible. i'm neither standing on the right side nor left side of the comtemplation. your disbelief doesn't mean others will follow suit. its about one's ability to be able to be wise enough to be open minded and explore research and seek the truth. in reality evidence is infact empty.<br><br>to tell u very frankly. gamblers, their wisdom are only mere mediocre. thats not the real aim in our cultivation. you can use a gambler's aspects to look at buddhism which again is not a religion. (thats not a correct way to compare in fact, there's no need to even compare) the difference is the former is only relatively wise neither intelligent, while the latter is of superior wisdom transcending all theories dogmas deluded baseless speculations.</div>
