They are all what he realised.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Perfect One is free from any theory, for the Perfect One has understood what the body is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what feeling is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what perception is, and how it arises, and passes away. He has understood what the mental formations are, and how they arise, and pass away. He has understood what consciousness is, and how it arises, and passes away.<br><br>Therefore, I say, the Perfect One has won complete deliverance through the extinction, fading away, disappearance, rejection, and getting rid of all opinions and conjectures, of all inclination to the vainglory of I and mine.<br><br>- Majjhima Nikaya, 72</span><br><br>There is no need for blind faith in Buddhism. But it is important that we must be open minded and not dogmatic to our own predicated ideas. Eventually we will see the Truths for ourselves.<br><br><blockquote>Kalama Sutra<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."</span><br><br>- the Buddha<br><br>see also: the full Kalama Sutta - <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an03-065.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/anguttara/an03-065.html</a><br></blockquote>Buddha means 'The Enlightened One'. Everyone can be enlightened. <strong>For Buddha himself said - Everyone's Buddha Nature is wholly complete.</strong> We will all attain Buddhahood. Buddha Nature is already present here right now - it's only a matter of Awakening or Ignorance.<br><br>The Buddha taught the way to be liberated from sufferings forever and attain the highest bliss. There are countless people who have become enlightened and liberated since Shakyamuni Buddha's arrival who can testify that. Even some of our forumers are highly enlightened (excluding me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br><br>Happiness is the common interest of humanity. Nobody wants sufferings, everybody likes happiness. And I also have said if you practise, you will attain the Highest Bliss through Nirvana.  Everyone has his own ideas of hapiness. To some people, earning big bucks is happiness. To the others, having lots of sex is happiness. But this is very narrow and limited.<br><br><strong>Buddhism is the true 'Bliss Culture' as my Master puts it.</strong><br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/buddhism.htm#dharmatalk" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/buddhism.htm#dharmatalk</a><br><br><strong>The title of your Dharma talk is Human Bliss Culture; why then when you answer questions from the audience you did not mention Human Bliss Culture at all? Many of my friends here and I would like to know what is Human Bliss Culture.</strong><br><br>It is because the bliss culture that you have in mind and what I have in mind are different. The bliss culture that you have in mind may be how to prosper with great wealth and fortune, or how to have a good wife in order for the family to have bliss. In this manner, the definition of bliss is too narrow! We need to know that the culture of Buddhism is the real bliss culture. If everybody is able to attain the ultimate Nirvana, then this is indeed the real bliss culture.<br><br>The purpose of our learning Buddhism is to distance from suffering and attain happiness. Many people think that to distance from suffering and attain happiness means going to the Western Pure Land. In fact, it is not only this. When we distance from suffering and attain happiness, we have to instantaneously distance from suffering, instantaneously attain happiness and liberation. Some people may be suspicious; how can liberation be attained so easily? In fact, it is very simple. If someone scolds you, and you apologize to him, then that is a small liberation. If someone hits you, and you retaliate; an eye for an eye, then isnÂ’t that very miserable? What happen if that results in loss of life? Even though you are rude to me, I will still apologise very politely to you. IsnÂ’t that being liberated? This is Jen Chen BuddhismÂ’s teaching of liberation. If whilst alive, we cannot even attain small liberationÂ’s like this, then what more to say of liberation after death? In the course of our daily lives, if we are liberated at every moment, then in time to come we will be able to attain the great liberation. Please think it over, isnÂ’t this a very blissful? This is but to use a small matter to illustrate the path of liberation. If we are able to understand more of the Buddha-Dharma and apply them in our life, family, society, country, and to the extent of the entire humanity of the world, then isnÂ’t this a great bliss culture? Therefore, we say that the culture of Buddhism is Bliss Culture.</blockquote>Also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=98125" rel="nofollow">Proved: Buddhists are Happier!</a><br><br>If you are one of the open minded - I invite you to get an introductory book on Buddhism to know what exactly is its teachings about.

The consciousness of a person born on earth may have come from a galaxy far away, drawn here by the force of karma, which connects that personÂ’s mental energy to this planet. On the other hand, the consciousness of a person dying on this earth may at the time of death be karmically directed to a rebirth in another galaxy, far from here. If more minds are being drawn to earth, the population increases; if fewer, it declines. That does not mean that brand new minds are coming into existence. Each mind taking rebirth here on earth has come from its previous lifeÂ—perhaps in another galaxy, perhaps on earth itself, but not from nowhereÂ—in accordance with the cyclic nature of worldly existence.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The continuity of your mental energy is a bit like the flow of electricity from a generator through the wires until it lights up a lamp. From the moment itÂ’s conceived, as your body evolves, mental energy is constantly running through itÂ—changing, changing, changingÂ—and if you can realize that, you can more easily understand your own mindÂ’s previous continuity. ItÂ’s never simply a question of belief. Of course, initially itÂ’s difficult to accept the idea of reincarnation because these days itÂ’s such a new concept for most people, especially those brought up in the West. They donÂ’t teach you continuity of consciousness in school; you donÂ’t study the nature of the mindÂ—who you are, what you areÂ—in college. So of course, itÂ’s all new to you. But if you think itÂ’s important to know who and what you are, and you investigate your mind through meditation, you will easily come to understand the difference between your body and your mind; you will recognize the continuity of your own consciousness; from there you will be able to realize your previous lives. It is not necessary to accept reincarnation on faith alone.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Instead of focusing on some supreme being, Buddhism emphasizes more practical matters, such as how to lead our lives, how to integrate our minds and how to keep our everyday lives peaceful and healthy. In other words, Buddhism always accentuates experiential knowledge-wisdom rather than some dogmatic view.

So children who practice meditation should do much better than those who do not and who cannot concentrate.<br><br>Well it is very big leap from understanding the benefits and practising meditation to accepting that heaven and hell exists.<br><br>So you see, the scienctific studies you quote are meaningless to prove that there are 6 realms and ghosts and gods.<br><br>Certainly the studies you quoted did not make it to the magazine SCIENCE as the research would not be able to withstand scrutiny.<br><br>So what is left is what benefits believing in illusions and imaginations accrue to you personally?<br><br>That is what I want to know.</div></blockquote>The human mind instinctively seeks happiness. East, WestÂ—thereÂ’s no difference; everybodyÂ’s doing the same thing. But if your search for happiness is causing you to grasp emotionally at the sense world, it can be very dangerous. You have no control.<br><br>Now, donÂ’t think that control is an Eastern thing, a Buddhist thing. We all need control, especially those of us caught up in the materialistic life; psychologically, emotionally, weÂ’re too involved in objects of attachment. From the Buddhist point of view, thatÂ’s an unhealthy mind; the person is mentally ill.<br><br>Actually, you already know that external, scientific technological development alone cannot satisfy the desires of your attachment or solve your other emotional problems. But what Lord BuddhaÂ’s teaching shows you is the characteristic nature of human potential, the capacity of the human mind. When you study Buddhism, you learn what you are and how to develop further; instead of emphasizing some kind of supernatural belief system, Buddhist methods teach you to develop a deep understanding of yourself and all other phenomena.<br><br>However, whether you are religious or a materialist, a believer or an atheist, it is crucial that you know how your own mind works. If you donÂ’t, youÂ’ll go around thinking youÂ’re healthy, when in reality, the deep root of afflictive emotions, the true cause of all psychological disease, is there, growing within you. Because of that, all it takes is some tiny external thing changing, something insignificant going wrong, and within a few seconds, youÂ’re completely upset. To me, that shows youÂ’re mentally ill. Why? Because youÂ’re obsessed with the sense world, blinded by attachment, and under the control of the fundamental cause of all problems, not knowing the nature of your own mind.<br><br>It doesnÂ’t matter if you try to refute what IÂ’m saying by telling me that you donÂ’t believe it. ItÂ’s not a question of belief. No matter how much you say, Â“I donÂ’t believe I have a nose,Â” your nose is still there, right between your eyes. Your nose is always there, whether you believe it or not.<br><br>IÂ’ve met many people who proudly proclaim, Â“IÂ’m not a believer.Â” TheyÂ’re so proud of their professed lack of belief in anything. You check up; this is important to know. In the world today there are so many contradictions. Scientific materialists boast, Â“I donÂ’t believeÂ”; religious people say, Â“I believe.Â” But no matter what you think, you still need to know the characteristic nature of your own mind. If you donÂ’t, then no matter how much you talk about the shortcomings of attachment, you have no idea what attachment actually is or how to control it. Words are easy. WhatÂ’s really difficult is to understand the true nature of attachment.<br><br>For example, when people first made cars and planes, their intention was to be able to do things more quickly so that theyÂ’d have more time for rest. But whatÂ’s happened instead is that people are more restless than ever. Examine your own everyday life. Because of attachment, you get emotionally involved in a concrete sense world of your own creation, denying yourself the space or time to see the reality of your own mind. To me, thatÂ’s the very definition of a difficult life. You cannot find satisfaction or enjoyment. The truth is that pleasure and joy actually come from the mind, not from objective phenomena.<br><br>Nevertheless, some intelligent, skeptical people do understand to a degree that material objects do not guarantee a worthwhile, enjoyable life and are trying to see if there really is something else that might offer true satisfaction.<br><br>When Lord Buddha spoke about suffering, he wasnÂ’t referring simply to superficial problems like illness and injury, but to the fact that the dissatisfied nature of the mind itself is suffering. No matter how much of something you get, it never satisfies your desire for better or more. This unceasing desire is suffering; its nature is emotional frustration.<br><br>Buddhist psychology describes six basic emotions that frustrate the human mind, disturbing its peace, making it restless: ignorance, attachment, anger, pride, deluded doubt and distorted views. These are mental attitudes, not external phenomena. Buddhism emphasizes that to overcome these delusions, the root of all your suffering, belief and faith are not much help: you have to understand their nature.<br><br>If you do not investigate your own mind with introspective knowledge-wisdom, you will never see whatÂ’s in there. Without checking, no matter how much you talk about your mind and your emotions, youÂ’ll never really understand that your basic emotion is egocentricity and that this is whatÂ’s making you restless.<br><br></div>

If you're asking about Past Lives, there are many trustworthy people who I know personally, who have recalled their past lives. In fact some of our forummers have also recalled their past lives, like Longchen. It's not a difficult thing to recall past life. If you meditate regularly it is likely to come to you one day. Others may also have recalled their past life through past live regressions.. etc. There are really a lot a lot of people who have recalled past lives. There are also those who recalled existences in the celestial realms or lower realms.<br><br>As for forensic evidence, I believe you can read up on Ian Stevenson, and many scientists pertaining to the fact that consciousness does indeed survive death and is not merely our body. You can also do a search on the internet about near death experiences. Many many people travelled out of their body after death after being clinically dead, witnessing medical procedures, and later revived - they could tell you what procedures happened during his 'death'. This kind of things have happened many times. There are also countless Near Death Experiences which you can find in the internet.</div>

We do not believe in a Creator.
