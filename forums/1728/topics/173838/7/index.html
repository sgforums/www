Gambling is condemned by the Buddha. Karma works whether the person believe or not. But it is important not to do good deeds for the sake of getting karma.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/understa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/understa.htm</a><br><br><strong>Real merits</strong><br>Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</blockquote></div>

I can only write from my own experience and understanding.<br><br>This pure presence is called Rigpa in Tibetan Buddhism. I am not a Buddhist in this life, but I was a Tibetan Monk of Nyingma school several lifetimes ago. That is why I still have a lot of interest in Buddhism.<br><br>About Rigpa, when we experience it. It is formless and empty and at the same time infinite and all pervading. It is NOT BLISS. Bliss is a samadhi state but it is not the true nature yet, it is still a state in the mind. I have bliss experiences also, in fact i have then now quite often outside of meditation also.<br><br>Rigpa is a presence of 'yourself' that is connect to everything in the universe. That is probably why the Buddha say that there is 'no self'. All is connect to all in the Dharmakaya. Rigpa is a part of the Dharmakaya. When in the state, there is no separation into you or me... We are all one thing which cannot be described.<br><br>However, I must say that even now, while reading this, we are already the rigpa. We do not realise this is because we THINK we are just the mind/personality. The mind/personality is a REFLECTION from rigpa. It is not the true self. If you understand what I am write, you may get a sudden awakening/realisation. And if the realisation is deep enough, your viewpoint or way of seeing the world will change.<br><br>Just my 2 cents...</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>casino king,<br><br>it is very simple. u don't believe in reborn, enlightenment doesn't mean others don't as well. you don't rule the world the system neither do u you rule others' thoughts, criticising on others base on your judgement and personal theory. there are many people out there like you and also there are many people out there unlike you. since you know it is very easy to use simple logic to explain things, then you have just looked at things very simply. in true reality things are just very simple natural no need to be "fancy flamboyant wahh i know so much i wanna flash myself" thats an illusion of yourself thinking others gonna drop their jaws and admire  you fall to your feet and say "wooo you are so marvellous i admire you so much for your flamboyant knowledge"....blah blah blah.....<br><br>you read about gambling, its extra knowledge good if one can be in awareness all the time what is good and what is not right. i read about sun zi art of war, its my extra knowledge. but i don't equate the art of war with buddhism. the strategies are worldly matters and they don't hold ultimate wisdom. but with knowledge like them one DO NOT think spiritual cultivations are superstitious and not significant but in fact the latter is the genuine true reality superior wisdom in handling one's life and situations.<br><br>you read about gamblers. nobody stopping you and won't say to you thats wrong no good. its your life your intersest. your life is what you will it. we born alone, die alone, we bear consequences alone, no one can control your destiny only you yourself. likewise you don't manipulate others which you would try but because of strong stable cultivation enlightened people knows themselves more than anyone else know about their own that they know their thoughts their mind their intentions their destiny is in their very own hands, no body else can control. others who don't practice mind training enough would have many doubts eager wanting to know everything all at once demanding. time..... it is nature. things need time to grow like your mentality also need time to train. evidences need time to show because they are complex and cannot be perceived by naked eye and physical flesh in the "open market".<br><br>its very silly just to finalise things as "silly" whatsoever you name it just cos there's no evidence. yes its also silly to conclude things to believe to exist when there's no evidence. same goes to some religion who never seen God yet believe so much cos they experience miracles so they believe its from God.<br>Buddhist are certain because they cultivate practice by the teachings of the Buddha and they cultivate investigate and experience for themselves and revealing slowly layer by layer that the words of Buddha are true and not bluffing. there are many increasing numbers of scientist in various fields are buddhist. simply because it is reality and logical and NOT what you think is superstitious.<br><br></div>

Science is proven by experiments, Buddhism is also proven by experiments, only different methods bcos it concerns different aspects. Science is mostly discovering material things out there while Buddhism is more towards discovering our nature of consciousness and nature of reality.<br><br>I do not think Buddhists make false descisions based on Dogma. I have never heard of it. Could you list examples? Buddhism is completely relevant to life and reality.<br><br>And also, Buddhism isn't just about doing good and avoiding evil, but most of all, purification of the mind.<br><br>I dont think we have religious fanatics who holy wars and kill in the name of God either.</div>
