            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Venerable Pindola Bharadvaja is one of the Buddha's sixteen disciples named in The Amitabha Sutra. Under the Buddha's auspices he attained the holy fruit of Arhat. Once when in a jubilant mood, he said to the faithful, "Do you think flying in the sky is magical? I will show you some spectacular acts."<br><br>He then jumped up into the sky, FLEW all around and performed many miraculous acts. The faithful were all impressed and praised him without ceasing. The Buddha was very displeased upon learning of this incident. He asked the Venerable to come forth and admonished him, "My teaching uses morality to change others and compassion to save living beings. It does not use magic to impress and confuse people. You have MISUSED magic today. As punishment you to stay in this world to work for more merits and to repent for this misbehavior." The Venerable did not in his lifetime enter Nirvana. (source)<br>--------<br><strong>085 - The Flying Buddha</strong><br>On the fifth year of his Enlightenment, when the Buddha was dwelling in Kutagarasala in Vaishali, he saw his father on the death-bed by his divine eyes. He felt the urgency of preaching his doctrine to his father for his spiritual evolution, as he was just about to attain the arahatahood. Furthermore, a war had broken out between the Sakiyans of Kapilavatthu and the Koliyans of Kolanagara (also called Vyaghapajja) over the water-dispute of the Rohini river Â– which demarcated the territories of the two kingdoms.  As the Khattiyas of the two neighbouring kingdoms earlier enjoyed pleasant relationship; and intermarried and dined with each other, the Buddha wanted to protect the two countries as well.<br><br>The Buddha therefore, flew to Kapilavatthu to visit his father, and preached him to become an arahanta. Soon, Suddhodana became an arahanta and died.<br><br>After the death of Suddhodana, he became the peace mediator for the Sakiyans and the Koliyans. He thus averted the bloody feud between the two neighbouring tribes. Both the tribes then encouraged their men to join the Sangha as a token of gratitude for his mediation; and each extended hospitality by inviting him as its guest. The Buddha accepted both the invitations and dwelt alternately in Kapilavatthu and Koliyanagara.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Ajahn Maha Boowa (said to be a living arahant) relates this story, in his biography of Ajahn Mun:<br><br>"Acariya Mun described his teacher as someone with a smooth, serene temperament who inspired deep devotion. A rather strange feature of Acariya SaoÂ’s practice was his tendency to levitate while in samadhi, his body hovering quite noticeably above the floor. At first, doubtful that his body was indeed floating, he opened his eyes to see for himself. As soon as his eyes opened, concern about the condition of his body caused his citta to withdraw from samadhi. He promptly fell back to the floor, landing hard on his buttocks which was sore and bruised for many days. In truth, his body did float about three feet above the floor. But by opening his eyes to check, he lost the mindfulness needed to maintain his citta in samadhi. Withdrawing suddenly from samadhi caused him to come crashing to the floor, like any other object dropped from a height. Practicing samadhi later and feeling his body levitate again, he kept mindfulness firmly focused within that state of samadhi, and then, carefully opened his eyes to look at himself. It was obvious to him then that he did levitate. This time, however, he didnÂ’t fall back to the floor, for mindfulness was present to maintain total concentration.<br><br>"This experience taught Acariya Sao a valuable lesson about himself. Yet being an exceptionally careful, meticulous person, he wasnÂ’t entirely convinced. So he took a small object, inserted it into the underside of the thatched roof in his hut, and continued to meditate. When he felt his body beginning to float again, he firmly focused his citta in samadhi, and he was able to float upward until he reached that small object in the thatch. Drawing level with it, he slowly reached out and very mindfully took it in his hand so that he could bring it back down by means of samadhi. This meant that once he had it in his grasp, he gradually withdrew from samadhi to the point where his body could slowly, and safely, descend to the floor Â– a point still short of complete withdrawal from samadhi. Experimenting like this, he became convinced of his ability to levitate, though this did not occur every time he entered samadhi.</span></div>

There is the case where a monk wields manifold psychic powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.<br><br>"Then someone who has faith and conviction in him sees him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds. He reports this to someone who has no faith and no conviction, telling him, 'Isn't it awesome. Isn't it astounding, how great the power, how great the prowess of this contemplative. Just now I saw him wielding manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.'<br><br>"Then the person without faith, without conviction, would say to the person with faith and with conviction: 'Sir, there is a charm called the Gandhari charm by which the monk wielded manifold psychic powers... exercising influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.' What do you think, Kevatta Â— isn't that what the man without faith, without conviction, would say to the man with faith and with conviction?"<br><br>"Yes, lord, that's just what he would say."<br><br>"Seeing this drawback to the miracle of psychic power, Kevatta, I feel horrified, humiliated, and disgusted with the miracle of psychic power.</blockquote>---<br><br>Miraculous Power<br><br><strong>If a wicked man can become a pure religious man, this according to Buddhism, is a practical miracle.</strong><br><a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/dhammananda/31.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/dhammananda/31.htm</a><br><br>/\<br></div>
