I'm not saying Christianity is not pratical, but it emphasize more on faith. Buddhism is all about cultivation which leads to bliss, wisdom, liberation.<br><br><blockquote>What will you say if I tell you that you can simply forget about Jesus dying for the world and Christian claims of God but become a Christian anyway and learn and experience the truths in Christianity anyway.<br><br>This is what you are asking me to do.</blockquote>The Buddhist methods DOES lead to what it claims it will lead to, liberation, enlightenment, is definitely true because as I said.... so many people have already achieved that.<br><br>And if you have doubts at the very least keep an open mind until you see it for yourself.</div>

Emptiness is not just a VOID, because if it is, then it will be in oppositions to EXISTENCE. Emptiness is beyond this duality. In very short explanation, Emptiness is emptiness of inherent existence, and everything is interconnected/conditioned.

When you say "Realising the Unchanging ESSENCE of the Mind" you are simply saying perceiving or understanding something. That is a mental activity. Nothing outside the mind has changed. Only your own perceptions. [/quote]<br><br>As I have said, REALITY only appears to you when you have gone beyond perceptions. It is BEYOND mental activity.<br><br>As I have mentioned in previous post. (cut and paste)<br><br>From our forum friend Longchen,<br><br><blockquote>    In one 'awakening' meditation, I came <strong>to a state of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> thoughts</strong>. Such experiences are very hard to describe. This is because the explanation process itself, is within the medium of thoughts and concepts. It is impossible to describe a state of no thoughts using thoughts! Anyway, in the void of no thoughts, one naturally assume that everything must be an unconscious blank. However, that was not the case! What came next was quite a revelation to me. In the void of no thought, I realise myself to be an omni Presence... Here's how I will describe him.<br><br>"The Presence is all pervasive, yet un-intrusive. IT seems to be in all things and observes with utter passiveness. IT exists beyond concepts, beliefs and do not need any form. Therefore, I understand IT as eternal. IT also seems to be the subtler state of myself. I also got the feeling that IT existed in all my lifetimes or even more. If I were to name IT, I will describe IT as The Eternal Presence."<br><br>I believed the Eternal Presence is the  God/Source Presence within oneself. This Presence is also called the Absolute, Dharmakaya. The paradox of it, is that is this not an object and is absolutely material-less.<br><br>About the Presence, it is ever present for <strong>it is us beyond the mind</strong>. You didn't see it doesn't means it is not there.<br><br>The God Presence is within us and more and IS us; always, even at this moment. This is the part that is simply pure awareness.</blockquote>------<br><br><blockquote>I also too feels that our perception of the universe is a hologram... and that the hologram itself is thoughts.<br></blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">As individual selfs, we only perceive our own thoughts... or rather we are these thoughts.<br><br>My opinion is that all of us are individual containments within a vast/infinite 'body' of All that is. We are all one... and are different expressions (reciever) of the ONE.<br><br>When thinking, we perceive ourselves as separate beings. When the thinking mind is stilled (no thoughts/Now), <strong>we realised <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what emanated the thoughts</span></strong>... It appears to me as a 'bright' energetic vastness. This infinite vastness is us... we all meet here.<br><br>Suffering appears to me to be the thoughts... that creates a 'personalised sense of self'. It is the personalised sense of self that gave 'meaning' to the invisible vastness. In the vastness, there appears to me ... 'no meaning'.<br><br>I must say... I have not entered into these experiences long enough to give more concrete answers....<br><br>so these are just my understanding at current stage.</div></blockquote>Also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=178391" rel="nofollow">The Universe as a Hologram - Holographic Reality</a><br><br>[quote]Originally posted by casino_king:<br><strong><br><br>"And to attain Complete Buddhahood "; the same thing... nothing physical and reality has not changed a bit.

            <div class='col-md body'>To:  casino_king<br><br>You posted some good questions. And kudos to your courage for bringing them up though u knew they would invite criticisms.. or perhaps, critical debate on these issues was wat u intended for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I have thoughts about your questions but the 11-page post is simply too long for me. Will respond to you at a later time perhaps on a new thread.<br><br>Thought it would help to have a summary of your points:<br><br>1. Your primary stance is that people should only adopt beliefs that are based on verifiable facts, or scientific evidence. Any other concepts that cannot be proved by scientific evidence are not worthy to be believed.<br><br>2. Some aspects of Buddhism has been verified by Science, such as the benefits of meditation. These are the aspects that can be accepted into a rational person's belief system. So does the law of cause and effect IN THE PRESENT LIFE.<br><br>3. Some aspects of Buddhism are not verifiable, and therefore only exist in imagination. You wonder what then makes Buddhists accept these concepts, since according to the logic of #1, these concepts fail to exist and are mere imaginary concepts conjured by one's mind. E.g. would be past and future lives.<br><br>Have I misread you or missed out any other important points?</div>
