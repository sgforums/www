Will they go to hell? If not, what will happen to these people?</div></blockquote>As you may have known by now, the difference between Buddhism and Judaist faith is that other than Hell and Heaven, Buddhism also have 4 other realms. Basically there are 6 realms:<br><br>3 Higher Realms: Heaven, Human, Asura<br>3 Lower Realms: Animals, Spirits, Hell<br><br>And the Heaven realm itself is divided into 28 kinds, and have 3 kinds: Sensual, Form-jhana, Formless-jhana realms.<br><br>The cause of rebirth in Heaven is very rigidly keeping the 5 precepts and practising the 10 Virtuous Deeds. In addition, those who enters into Jhana states in meditation can be reborned in the higher levels - the Jhana realms. However heaven or jhanas are not ultimate. This is because they are still not eternal. (their lifespan can be up to several billions of years according to the different 'levels' of heaven they live in). Our lifespan is comparable to insects in their eyes. Due to their long lifespan, many Brahmas (jhanic celestial realm beings) mistakenly held the view that they live an eternal life, only to find out their impermanence after the Buddha told them. Also See: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185" rel="nofollow">How the Brahma believed He was God?</a><br><br>The difference between Buddhism and Judaist faith is that we do not believe in an eternal heaven or hell. As I have said earlier, no matter how evil or virtuous you are, your Buddha Nature is unaffected - it is wholly complete, perfect. It follows you to heaven but also to hell. And what does this imply? No matter what happens, in the end, you still become Buddha! No matter you are Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or something else, you will become a Buddha - a perfectly enlightened person, eventually. Hell and Heaven is only temporary... but doesn't mean you can start committing evil acts because you wouldn't want to suffer a long time in hell either.<br><br>Back to your question: what will happen to those who don't believe in Buddhism... I wld like to say that even non-Buddhists can attain rebirth in Heaven as long as they are virtuous and throughout his life done many many wholesome deeds. On the other hand, if people call themselves Buddhists only by name and commit all sorts of atrocities and evils, they will still have to go to Hell to suffer their karma.<br><br>One thing that other religion does not teach, is that other than doing good and avoiding evil, we should purify the mind.. since Mind is the source of all sufferings, afflictions, vexations, Greed, Hatred, Ignorance, etc. Some people interprete this as having only wholesome thoughts and getting rid of the evil thoughts. But this is only "virtuous", and at best will result in his rebirth in heaven. Purifying the mind is in fact reaching No-thoughts, No-mind. Meaning no more Sentient Thoughts and no more Sentient Mind. That is what is meant by 'purification of mind'. That is the difference. That is what no other religions offer - the opportunity for LIBERATION/AWAKENING.... most religions only lead their followers to higher realms but they do not lead them to Liberation from Samsara.<br><br>It is very very rare to live in a time where we can learn the Buddhist teachings, practise and attain enlightenment. Very rare. It is also very very rare to even be reborned as Human! You may not believe me, but the number of animals in the world are definitely much more than the number of humans. The number of beings in spirit realm and hell realm are also more than that of humans. Since being a human is most ideal for cultivation, we should make use of this opportunity to practise the dharma. It is a real pity to miss this opportunity... Life is meant for cultivating the dharma, because whatever achievements you have in life, it is only temporarily - can you take them away to the next life after you pass away?<br><br>regards,<br>An Eternal Now</div>

What kind of religion is that who says if you do not accept their teachings, you will go to hell. or go to heaven. that is dogmatic and blind faith.<br><br>Maybe that kind of teachings can flourish in the past, like 2000 or so years ago, but i believe these kind of teachings will not stand the test of time, especially in this present era where science and technology are advanced and the people are highly educated. But then, there are still people who are not that advanced in their thinking and accept dogmatic teachings without thinking any thought to it and that is blind faith.<br><br></div>

So good habit will lead you to upper realms. bad habit lead you to lower realms. but it is neither good nor bad habit (aka Pure habit) that will lead one to escape the enduring cycle of samsara(6 realms).<br><br>so can a addictive habit be cure. yes and no. see how determine are you.  by stop doing more habit(attachment).<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Although we may not agree with certain religious points of view they hold, if they are sincere in their efforts to serve humanity and uplift it, we must respect them for it. There are noble people in every religion. The Buddha did not advise his disciples to go and convert people who would otherwise go to hell. Rather he advised them to show the world what is right and what is wrong and to be good and to do good, to encourage men to come and see for themselves the truth that he taught.<br><br>He and his followers do not condemn the followers of other religionists as Â“sinnersÂ” who are doomed to spend an eternity in hell. According to Buddhists, even those who have no Â“religionÂ” but who live in dignity, with compassion and goodwill can Â“go to heavenÂ”, that is, experience happiness.<br><br>When we are happy and contented we are in Â“heaven.Â” When we suffer physically or mentally we are in Â“hell.Â” There is no need to wait to die to experience either of these states.<br><br>Without blaming anybody else, Buddhism also teaches that man is responsible for his own action.

It refers to the intentional deeds we do with our body, speech and mind through action, talking and thinking. Karma is the law that every willed deed, given the conditions, produces a certain effect. How does Karma Work?<br><br><strong>All deeds leave imprints or seeds on our consciousness, which ripen into our experiences when the appropriate conditions come together. For example, if we help someone with a kind heart, this action leaves an imprint on our mindstream. When conditions are suitable, this imprint will ripen in our receiving of help when we need it.</strong><br><br>Karmic seeds continue with us from lifetime to lifetime. However, if we do not create the cause or Karma for something, we won't experience that result. If one doesn't plant a certain seed, that plant will not grow.<br><br><strong>According to the seed that is sown, So is the fruit you reap.</strong> The doer of good will gather good result, The doer of evil reaps evil result. If you plant a good seed well, Then you will enjoy the good fruits.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Different kinds of Karma</strong><br><br>If an action brings pain and misery in the long term for oneself and others, it is unwholesome or negative Karma. And if it brings happiness, it is wholesome or positive Karma. Actions aren't inherently good or bad - they are only so according to the results they bring. Whatever happiness and fortune we experience in our lives comes from our own positive actions, while our problems result from our own negative actions.<br><br>You are responsible for everything. There is no one that decides the "rewards and punishments" for what we do. We create the causes of our actions, and we experience their results. We are responsible for our own experience. The Buddha discovered the law of Karma- He did not create it. By teaching us the law of Karma, the Buddha shows us how to work within the functioning of cause and effect in order to experience happiness and avoid pain.</blockquote>Therefore if you have a lot of seeds of anger and hatred, in the next life you will fall into the Asura realm, where they all fight and all that.

My master says that as a Buddhist the very least we must accomplish is to get rid of our Xi2 Qi4... 'habitual energy'. If we do not purify it in this life, we will suffer even worse the next life. Sometimes we are so controlled by our Xi Qi that we do not even realise it.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/learning.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/learning.htm</a><br><br>To learn Buddhism one needs to eradicate self serving and evil habits<br>Learning Buddhism is not difficult at all. In fact, it is very easy. First of all, we must know how to eradicate our self serving and evil habits. We can naturally do that when we understand how important it is to our life to eradicate such habits. If we do not understand this, then no matter how learned in Buddhism we are, it does not serve any real purpose. Take for example the question of consuming alcoholic drinks. You could take a fruit juice or tea in its place. It is not necessary that you must take alcohol. If persuaded by your friends, you could say : "I am very sorry, I have been advised by the doctor to lay off alcohol for a year. I will be in trouble should my wife finds out that I have been drinking." Your good friends will understand and therefore let you off. Handling questions like this is a matter of having wisdom.<br><br>The most difficult thing for anybody to do, is to eradicate oneÂ’s self serving and evil habits. This is because habits are carried into the present life from the aeons of previous lives. They are deeply rooted and therefore are difficult to eradicate. Once these have been eradicated, then the Mara-hindrances are eliminated. The inability to eradicate them results in one spending his entire lifetime with the Mara without ever knowing it.<br><br>Let me tell you a story. There was a very promising lay-Buddhist who came to take refuge in the Three Treasures and before leaving asked, "Master, is there anything about me that I need to correct?" I replied, "Very well, there is nothing you need to correct other than to eradicate your self serving and evil habits." He was puzzled. He wondered if it was because he had evil habits that were deeply rooted. He began to examine himself, "I am a moderate person. My bosses and my colleagues treat me well. What self serving and evil habits does Master want me to eradicate?"<br><br>While on his way home, he continued to think over this as he smoked. Four cigarettes later, he was still pondering. Then, as he was lighting his fifth, it suddenly occurred to him, "Oh! I smoke. This is the self serving and evil habit that Master wants me to eradicate!" At this moment he spontaneously extinguished the cigarette and quit the habit.<br><br>Thus, when learning Buddhism one should not just talk about the theories. One must really put the teachings into practice. One should not commit even the smallest bad deed, neither should one neglect even the smallest virtuous deed. Only then is one a Buddhist.</blockquote></div>
