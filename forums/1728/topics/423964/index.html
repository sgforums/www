              <p>Transforming Loss into the Path</p>
              <p>Hi all.. I'd like to share this verse I read as I view it to be applicable in our everyday lives, be it someone stealing something important to us, such as <em>physical</em> possessions, or maybe someone stealing job promotion chances from us, etc..</p>
              <p><em>Transforming problems into the path</em></p>
              <p>This verse begins a series of practices called "thought training" in which we practise transforming adverse circumstances into the path to enlightenment. Thought training practices are very practical because disappointments and obstacles abound in samsara. These practices may initially seem challenging, but when we contemplate them repeatedly, they begin to make sense. They show us a new way to view circumstances - a way that prevents anger and resentment and increases joy and the sense of meaning in our lives.</p>
              <p><em>Dedicate all to the person who steals from you</em></p>
              <p>One of the worst things anyone can imagine is robbers stealing needed and valued possessions from their home or a shady character swindling them out of their house. <strong>Normally, what would we do? we would be enraged; we would be furious; we would want revenge. </strong>Feeling violated and sorry for ourselves, we would kick up a big fuss, rant and rave and try to retaliate. Verse 12 instructs us to do the opposite. First we train to understand that getting angry doesn't help. It only poisons our mind and keeps us mentally trapped. Thus, instead of being angry and self-righteous, we train our mind to let go and dedicate our body, possessions and virtue to those who robbed us. Instead of thinking, "This is mine", and trying to get it back when there's no way we can ever get it back, we mentally give it to the thief. We don't just offer the thief all our possessions, but mentally offer our body which can transform into whatever they need, and our virtue past, present and future which becomes conducive circumstances for them to meet and practise the Dharma.</p>
              <p>Instead of holding a grudge and having it gnaw at us year after year, we let go and happily give the clung-to possessions to the person. Perhaps, something in your heart says "Are you kidding? Thats not fair." In response, ask yourself, "What will happen if i cling on to my notion of what's fair?" <strong>You may cling onto the thought, but will you be happy? No. In that case, what happens? You have lost not only your possessions but also your happiness. Being unhappy about the loss doesn't return the possessions to us. It just makes as a double loss.</strong></p>
              <p>If somebody takes your things without permissions, think, "They must need that very badly. I give it to them." If you genuinely give it to them and decide, "Now that doesn't belong to me anymore. It belongs to him," you will have mental peace. On the other hand, if you hold onto the feeling of being wronged and make yourself into a victim of another persons' injustice, you'll feel miserable.</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This does not mean that we allow people to cheat us or if someone steals things from us, we say "Do you want anything else? I can show you where the key to my neighbour's house is." If somebody steals your things, you can try to recover them, but do this without being angry at the person, without being vengeful and seeking retaliation</span>.</strong> This verse instructs us how to work with our mind so that our mind remains content and in a virtuous state.</p>
