              <p>I just bought a book The Sun My Heart by world renowned Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh, and find it very good. I sent some parts to Thusness and he liked it as well. Highly recommended. It is mostly about Awareness, Non-Duality and Dependent Origination. While discussing certain deeper Buddhist concepts, it is at the same time highly practical and experiential. It teaches about maintaining moment to moment mindful awareness in all our activities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's an excerpt from part of his first chapter:
                          <br> <br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Sunshine and Green Leaves</span> <br> <br> Beginning meditators usually think they must suppress all thoughts and
                          feelings (often called "false mind") in order to create conditions
                          favorable to concentration and understanding (called "true mind"). They
                          use methods such as focusing their attention on an object or counting
                          their breathes to try to block out thoughts and feelings. Concentrating
                          on an object and counting the breath are excellent methods, but they
                          should not be used for suppression or repression. We know that as soon
                          as there is repression, there is rebellion -- repression entails
                          rebellion. True mind and false mind are one. Denying one is denying the
                          other. Suppressing one is suppressing the other. Our mind is our self.
                          We cannot suppress it. We must treat it with respect, with gentleness,
                          and absolutely without violence. Since we do not even know what our
                          "self" is, how can we know if it is true or false, and whether or not
                          what to suppress? The only thing we can do is to let the sunlight of
                          awareness shine on our "self" and en-lighten it, so we can look at it
                          directly.
                          <br> <br>Just as flowers and leaves are only part of a plant, and just as
                          waves are only part of the ocean, perceptions, feelings, and thoughts
                          are only part of the self. Blossoms and leaves are a natural
                          manifestation of plants, and waves are a natural expression of oceans.
                          It is useless to try to repress or stifle them. It is impossible. We
                          can only observe them. Because they exist, we can find their source,
                          which is exactly the same as our own.
                          <br> <br>The sun of awareness originates in the heart of the self. It
                          enables the self to illuminate the self. It lights not only all
                          thoughts and feelings present. It lights itself as well.
                          <br> <br>Let us return to the apple juice, quietly "resting." The river of
                          our perceptions continue to flow, but now, in the sunlight of
                          awareness, it flows peacefully, and we are serene. The relation
                          between the river of perceptions and the sun of awareness is not the
                          same as that of an actual river and the actual sun. Whether it is
                          midnight or noon, whether the sun is absent or its penetrating rays are
                          beaming down, the waters of the Mississippi River continue to flow,
                          more or less the same. But when the sun of awareness shines on the
                          river of our perceptions, the mind is transformed. Both river and sun
                          are of the same nature.
                          <br> <br>Let us consider the relationship between the color of leaves and
                          sunlight, which also have the same nature. At midnight, the starlight
                          and moonlight reveal only the form of the trees and leaves. But if the
                          sun were suddenly to shine, the green color of the leaves would
                          immediately appear. The tender green of the leaves in April exists
                          because the sunlight exists. One day, while sitting in a forest,
                          mimicking the <span style="font-style: italic;">Prajna Paramita Heart Sutra</span>, I wrote:
                          <br> <br> Sunshine is green leaves
                          <br> Green leaves are sunshine
                          <br> Sunshine is not different from green leaves
                          <br> Green leaves are not different from sunshine
                          <br> The same is true of all forms and colors.
                          <br> <br> As soon as the sun of awareness shines, at that very moment a great
                          change takes place. Meditators lets the sun of awareness rise easily,
                          so we can see more clearly. When we meditate, we seem to have two
                          selves. One is the flowing river of thoughts and feelings, and the
                          other is the sun of awareness that shines on them. Which is our own
                          self? Which is true? Which false? Which is good? Which bad? Please calm
                          down, my friend. Lay down your sharp sword of conceptual thinking.
                          Don't be in such a hurry to cut your "self" in two. Both are self.
                          Neither is true. Neither is false. They are both true and both false.
                          <br> <br>We know that light and color are not separate phenomena. In the
                          same way, the sun of self and the river of self are not different. Sit
                          with me, let a smile form on your lips, let your sun shine, close your
                          eyes, if need be, to see your self more clearly. Your sun of awareness
                          is only part of your river of self, isn't it? It follows the same laws
                          as all psychological phenomena: it arises and vanishes away. To examine
                          something with a microscope, a scientist must shine light on the object
                          being observed. To observe the self, you must shine light on it too,
                          the light of awareness.
                          <br> <br>I just told you to put down your sword of conceptualization and not
                          cut your self into sections. Actually, you couldn't, even if you wanted
                          to. Do you think you can separate the sunshine from the green color of
                          the leaves? You can no more separate the observing self from the self
                          observed. When the sun of awareness shines, the nature of thoughts and
                          feelings is transformed. It is one with the observing mind, but they
                          remain different, like the green of the leaves and the sunshine. Don't
                          rush from the concept of "two" to the concept of "one." This
                          ever-present sun of awareness is at the same time its own object. When
                          a lamp is turned on, the lamp itself is also brought to light. "I know
                          that I know." "I am conscious of being conscious." When you think, "The
                          sun of awareness has gone out in me," at that moment it re-lights
                          itself, faster than the speed of light.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some other quotations which Thusness liked --</p>
              <p>"When we say I know the wind is blowing, we don't think that there is something 
                          blowing something else. "Wind' goes with 'blowing'. If there is no blowing, 
                          there is no wind. It is the same with knowing. Mind is the knower; the knower is 
                          mind. We are talking about knowing in relation to the wind. 'To know' is to know 
                          something. Knowing is inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing are one. We 
                          can say, 'Wind,' and that is enough. The presence of wind indicates the presence 
                          of knowing, and the presence of the action of blowing'."</p>
              <p>"..The most universal 
                          verb is the verb 'to be'': I am, you are, the mountain is, a river is. The verb 
                          'to be' does not express the dynamic living state of the universe. To express 
                          that we must say 'become.' These two verbs can also be used as nouns: 'being", 
                          "becoming". But being what? Becoming what? 'Becoming' means 'evolving 
                          ceaselessly', and is as universal as the verb "to be." It is not possible to 
                          express the "being" of a phenomenon and its "becoming" as if the two were 
                          independent. In the case of wind, blowing is the being and the becoming...."</p>
              <p>"In any phenomena, whether psychological, physiological, or physical, there is 
                          dynamic movement, life. We can say that this movement, this life, is the 
                          universal manifestation, the most commonly recognized action of knowing. We must 
                          not regard 'knowing' as something from the outside which comes to breathe life 
                          into the universe. It is the life of the universe itself. The dance and the 
                          dancer are one."</p>

              <p>The sun here has nothing to do with the duality of yin and yang. It is talking about your Buddha Nature. Your Buddha Nature is like the sun, it is luminous, and luminous means brightly aware.</p>
              <p>That awareness which is brightly aware is shining everywhere -- that awareness is manifesting in its activities (å¦™ç”¨) -- seeing, hearing, thinking, everything is the spontaneous activity of Buddha-Nature. Even when you close your eyes and you do not see anything, awareness is still brightly aware.</p>

              <p>The sun here has nothing to do with the duality of yin and yang. It is talking about your Buddha Nature. Your Buddha Nature is like the sun, it is luminous, and luminous means brightly aware.</p>
              <p>That awareness which is brightly aware is shining everywhere -- that awareness is manifesting in its activities (å¦™ç”¨) -- seeing, hearing, thinking, everything is the spontaneous activity of Buddha-Nature. Even when you close your eyes and you do not see anything, awareness is still brightly aware.</p>
