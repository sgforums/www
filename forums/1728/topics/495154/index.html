              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Science &amp; philosophy in Indian Buddhist classics</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">January 6, 2018, Arvind Sharma Times of India</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To make classical Buddhist scientific and philosophical
              thought on the nature of reality accessible to modern readers, the XIV Dalai
              Lama – who considers the dialogue of religion and science a crucial component
              of humanity’s future – conceptualised a five-part book on the subject. The
              Physical World is the first volume, edited by Thupten Jinpa and brought out by
              Wisdom publications. The volume consolidates understanding of the physical
              world as found in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition under such headings as
              knowable objects, subtle particles, time, the cosmos and its inhabitants, and
              fetal development. It is a pioneering work, brilliantly adapted for promoting
              the dialogue between religion and science.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to the Dalai Lama, classical Buddhist treatises
              refer to three domains: a scientific one, which would cover the empirical
              descriptions of the outer world of matter and the inner world of the mind; a
              philosophical one, which would cover the efforts to ascertain the nature of
              ultimate reality; and a religious one, which would refer to the practices of
              the Buddhist tradition. The present volume, covers the scientific dimension;
              so, too, the second. The third and fourth volumes will focus on the
              philosophical dimension while the fifth will cover the religious dimension. The
              material of the first two volumes is taken from the Tengyur, which consists of
              Buddhist treatises translated into Tibetan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The interaction between science and religion in the Christian
              West has often been characterised by a measure of hostility, because there,
              religion is based on revealed dogmatic truth and science on reason and
              experimentation. This, however, need not necessarily apply in the case of
              science and Buddhism, as in this case, one witnesses a broad methodological
              convergence. The reason is that while the ultimate goal of religious life in
              Christianity can only be achieved after death, the fruit of religious life in
              Buddhism can be experienced in this very life. Thus the conclusions of Buddhism
              become as falsifiable and verifiable as those of science. This endows the
              encounter between science and Buddhism with unforeseen possibilities of
              maturity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Enlightenment view of reason, treated the rational as
              representing the antithesis of the irrational so that this binary grid of the
              rational and the irrational has become the dominant trope of modernity. Life,
              however, may be said to consist not just of the rational and the irrational,
              but also of the non-rational. This category would cover such aspects of life as
              relate to our emotional attachment to our near and dear ones, to the
              appreciation of the world of art, music and literature and humanity’s urge for
              transcendence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is also a subtler issue involved. Science per se is not
              interested in human well-being but rather in the search for truth. Any benefit
              accrued is a foreseeable effect of science but not its intended one, whereas
              the intended goal of Buddhism is to save humanity from suffering. Hence
              science, in view of its neutrality in terms of value, may be harnessed for
              either good or evil. By contrast, the sole goal of Buddhism is the alleviation
              of human suffering which means that even its “truths” are meant to ensure human
              well-being and therefore are a means to an end and not an end in themselves.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In science, in the strict sense, truth alone is the end.
              Axiologically speaking, there is a fundamental gulf fixed between science and
              Buddhism.  Science can explain the how of things but not their why,
              whereas the raison d’etre of Buddhism is the why of suffering.</span></p>
