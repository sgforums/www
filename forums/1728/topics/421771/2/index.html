                          </blockquote>Hi xprobe, contrary to your claims i find that many people in this forum are genuine practitioners who are improving in their practice and realization so certainly thwse discussions are far from  far from empty rtalk  or waste of time, though i cannot speak for every single person .Also, the TS has geuine intentions to learn how to practice the teachings. im sure, due to his keenness in learning, that fruits will bear from his practice. if one doesnt know but doesnt ask, then to progress will be very difficult.

              <p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: center;"><span lang="EN-US">(from
              Part 2 - “Right Attitude” - of “Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind” by Shunryu Suzuki –
              Weatherhill, 1970)</span></p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">When we practice zazen our mind is calm
              and quite simple. But usually our mind is very busy and complicated, and it is
              difficult to be concentrated on what we are doing.<span>  </span>This is because before we act we think, and
              this thinking leaves some trace. Our activity is shadowed by some preconceived
              idea. The thinking not only leaves some trace or shadow, but also gives us many
              other notions about other activities and things. These traces and notions make
              our mind very complicated. When we do something with a quite simple, clear
              mind, we have no notion or shadows, and our activity is strong and
              straightforward. But when we do something with a complicated mind, in relation
              to other things or people, or society, our activity becomes very complex.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US">Most people have a double or triple notion in one activity. There is a
              saying, “To catch two birds with one stone”. That is what people usually try to
              do. Because they want to catch too many birds they find it difficult to be
              concentrated on one activity, and they may end up not catching any birds at
              all! That kind of thinking always leaves its shadow on their activity. The
              shadow is not actually the thinking itself. Of course it is often necessary to
              think or prepare before we act. But right thinking does not leave any shadow.
              Thinking which leaves traces comes out of your relative, confused mind.
              Relative mind is the mind which sets itself in relation to other things, thus
              limiting itself. It is this small mind that creates gaining ideas and leaves
              traces of itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US">If you leave a trace of your thinking on your activity, you will be
              attached to the trace. For instance, you may say, “This is what I have done!”
              But actually it is not so. In your recollection you may say, “I did such and
              such a thing in some certain way,” but actually that is never exactly what
              happened. When you think in this way you limit the actual experience of what
              you have done. So if you attach to the idea of what you have done, you are
              involved in selfish ideas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US">Often we think what we have done is good, but it may not actually be
              so. When we become old we are often very proud of what we have done. When
              others listen to someone proudly telling something which he has done, they will
              feel funny, because they know his recollection is one-sided. They know that
              what he has told them is not exactly what he did. Moreover, if he is proud of
              what he did, that pride will create some problem for him. Repeating his
              recollections in this way, his personality will be twisted more and more, until
              he becomes quite a disagreeable, stubborn fellow. This is an example of leaving
              a trace of one’s thinking. We should not forget what we did, but it should be without
              an extra trace. To leave a trace is not the same thing as to remember
              something. It is necessary to remember what we have done, but we should not
              become attached to what we have done in some special sense. What we call
              “attachment” is just these traces of our thought and activity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US">In order not to leave any traces, when you do something, you should do
              it with your whole body and mind; you should be concentrated on what you do.
              You should do it completely, like a good bonfire. You should not be a smoky
              fire. You should burn yourself completely. If you do not burn yourself
              completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you do. You will have
              something remaining which is not completely burned out. Zen activity is
              activity which is completely burned out, with nothing remaining but ashes. This
              is the goal of our practice. That is what Dogen meant when he said, “Ashes do
              not come back to firewood.” Ash is ash. Ash should be completely ash. The
              firewood should be firewood. When this kind of activity takes place, one
              activity covers everything.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US">So our practice is not a matter of one hour or two hours, or one day or
              one year. If you practice zazen with your whole body and mind, even for a
              moment, that is zazen. So moment after moment you should devote yourself to
              your practice. You should not have any remains after you do something. But this
              does not mean to forget all about it. If you understand this point, all the
              dualistic thinking and all the problems of life will vanish.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US">When you practice Zen you become one with Zen. There is no you and no
              zazen. When you bow, there is no Buddha and no you. One complete bowing takes
              place, that is all. This is Nirvana. When Buddha transmitted our practice to
              Maha Kashyapa, he just picked up a flower with a smile. Only Maha Kashyapa
              understood what he meant; no one else understood. We do not know if this is a
              historical event or not, but it means something. It is a demonstration of our
              traditional way. Some activity which covers everything is true activity, and
              the secret of this activity is transmitted from Buddha to us. This is Zen
              practice, not some teaching taught by Buddha, or some rules of life set up by
              him. The teaching or the rules should be changed according to the place, or
              according to the people who observe them, but the secret of this practice
              cannot be changed. It is always true.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt;" lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-US">So for us there is no other way to live
              in this world. I think this is quite true; and this is easy to accept, easy to
              understand, and easy to practice. If you compare the kind of life based on this
              practice with what is happening in this world, or in human society, you will
              find out just how valuable the truth Buddha left us is. It is quite simple, and
              practice is quite simple. But even so, we should not ignore it; its great value
              must be discovered. Usually when it is so simple we say, “Oh, I know that! It
              is quite simple, everyone knows that.” But if we do not find its value it means
              nothing. It is the same as not knowing. The more you understand culture, the
              more you will understand how true and how necessary this teaching is. Instead
              of only criticizing your culture, you should devote your mind and body to
              practicing this simple way. Then society and culture will grow out of you. It
              may be all right for the people who are too attached to their culture to be
              critical. Their critical attitude means they are coming back to the simple
              truth left by Buddha. But our approach is just to be concentrated on a simple
              basic practice and a simple basic understanding of life. There should be no
              traces in our activity. We should not attach to some fancy ideas or to some
              beautiful things. We should not seek for something good. The truth is always
              near at hand, within your reach.</span></p>

              <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span>No Trace</span></h3>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span>(from Part 2 - “Right
              Attitude” - of “Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind” by Shunryu Suzuki –
              Weatherhill, 1970)</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span>--o0o--</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>When we practice zazen our mind is calm and quite
              simple. But usually our mind is very busy and complicated, and it
              is difficult to be concentrated on what we are
              doing.<span> </span> This is because before we act we think,
              and this thinking leaves some trace. Our activity is shadowed by
              some preconceived idea. The thinking not only leaves some trace or
              shadow, but also gives us many other notions about other activities
              and things. These traces and notions make our mind very
              complicated. When we do something with a quite simple, clear mind,
              we have no notion or shadows, and our activity is strong and
              straightforward. But when we do something with a complicated mind,
              in relation to other things or people, or society, our activity
              becomes very complex.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Most people have a
              double or triple notion in one activity. There is a saying, “To
              catch two birds with one stone”. That is what people usually try to
              do. Because they want to catch too many birds they find it
              difficult to be concentrated on one activity, and they may end up
              not catching any birds at all! That kind of thinking always leaves
              its shadow on their activity. The shadow is not actually the
              thinking itself. Of course it is often necessary to think or
              prepare before we act. But right thinking does not leave any
              shadow. Thinking which leaves traces comes out of your relative,
              confused mind. Relative mind is the mind which sets itself in
              relation to other things, thus limiting itself. It is this small
              mind that creates gaining ideas and leaves traces of
              itself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you leave a trace of
              your thinking on your activity, you will be attached to the trace.
              For instance, you may say, “This is what I have done!” But actually
              it is not so. In your recollection you may say, “I did such and
              such a thing in some certain way,” but actually that is never
              exactly what happened. When you think in this way you limit the
              actual experience of what you have done. So if you attach to the
              idea of what you have done, you are involved in selfish
              ideas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Often we think what we
              have done is good, but it may not actually be so. When we become
              old we are often very proud of what we have done. When others
              listen to someone proudly telling something which he has done, they
              will feel funny, because they know his recollection is one-sided.
              They know that what he has told them is not exactly what he did.
              Moreover, if he is proud of what he did, that pride will create
              some problem for him. Repeating his recollections in this way, his
              personality will be twisted more and more, until he becomes quite a
              disagreeable, stubborn fellow. This is an example of leaving a
              trace of one’s thinking. We should not forget what we did, but it
              should be without an extra trace. To leave a trace is not the same
              thing as to remember something. It is necessary to remember what we
              have done, but we should not become attached to what we have done
              in some special sense. What we call “attachment” is just these
              traces of our thought and activity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In order not to leave
              any traces, when you do something, you should do it with your whole
              body and mind; you should be concentrated on what you do. You
              should do it completely, like a good bonfire. You should not be a
              smoky fire. You should burn yourself completely. If you do not burn
              yourself completely, a trace of yourself will be left in what you
              do. You will have something remaining which is not completely
              burned out. Zen activity is activity which is completely burned
              out, with nothing remaining but ashes. This is the goal of our
              practice. That is what Dogen meant when he said, “Ashes do not come
              back to firewood.” Ash is ash. Ash should be completely ash. The
              firewood should be firewood. When this kind of activity takes
              place, one activity covers everything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">So our practice is not a
              matter of one hour or two hours, or one day or one year. If you
              practice zazen with your whole body and mind, even for a moment,
              that is zazen. So moment after moment you should devote yourself to
              your practice. You should not have any remains after you do
              something. But this does not mean to forget all about it. If you
              understand this point, all the dualistic thinking and all the
              problems of life will vanish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">When you practice Zen
              you become one with Zen. There is no you and no zazen. When you
              bow, there is no Buddha and no you. One complete bowing takes
              place, that is all. This is Nirvana. When Buddha transmitted our
              practice to Maha Kashyapa, he just picked up a flower with a smile.
              Only Maha Kashyapa understood what he meant; no one else
              understood. We do not know if this is a historical event or not,
              but it means something. It is a demonstration of our traditional
              way. Some activity which covers everything is true activity, and
              the secret of this activity is transmitted from Buddha to us. This
              is Zen practice, not some teaching taught by Buddha, or some rules
              of life set up by him. The teaching or the rules should be changed
              according to the place, or according to the people who observe
              them, but the secret of this practice cannot be changed. It is
              always true.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span>So for us there is no other way to live in this
              world. I think this is quite true; and this is easy to accept, easy
              to understand, and easy to practice. If you compare the kind of
              life based on this practice with what is happening in this world,
              or in human society, you will find out just how valuable the truth
              Buddha left us is. It is quite simple, and practice is quite
              simple. But even so, we should not ignore it; its great value must
              be discovered. Usually when it is so simple we say, “Oh, I know
              that! It is quite simple, everyone knows that.” But if we do not
              find its value it means nothing. It is the same as not knowing. The
              more you understand culture, the more you will understand how true
              and how necessary this teaching is. Instead of only criticizing
              your culture, you should devote your mind and body to practicing
              this simple way. Then society and culture will grow out of you. It
              may be all right for the people who are too attached to their
              culture to be critical. Their critical attitude means they are
              coming back to the simple truth left by Buddha. But our approach is
              just to be concentrated on a simple basic practice and a simple
              basic understanding of life. There should be no traces in our
