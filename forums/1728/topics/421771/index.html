              <p>Yeah, that is something I learnt recently about formless. Form is limited, formless is unlimited. Actually I don't quite understand till the shifu said for instance a container which is empty will have space to contain more things than a container which is already full. I find Master æ˜Ÿäº‘ will use many simple examples to tell us the actual meaning of formless. People like me can only understand if shifu uses examples like the container or else I will  keep thinking how can formless be unlimited.</p>
              <p> å¿ƒæœ‰æ‰€ä½� is limited, å¿ƒæ— æ‰€ä½�ï¼Œå¤„å¤„æ˜¯å®¶, everywhere is your home.</p>

              <p>the line is the form and the inside and outside space is the formless. without the space/formless, we also don't have the circle/form.</p>

Is there any difference between this and “cultivate amid tranquillity”?<br><br></strong></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating amid our actions.</strong></span></em><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: x-small;"><br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">To cultivate while in tranquillity means not doing anything else besides practising sitting meditation, prostrating before the Buddha, or reciting the sutras. Indeed, some practitioners of this method of cultivation can practise sitting meditation for an uninterrupted stretch of several days at a time.<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism advocates that people cultivate amid our actions. The times have changed. Because of the need to earn a livelihood everyone has to work; everyone is working and is constantly engaged in some kind of activity. However, even though we are busy and in action, we also have to cultivate. It should not be that because we are busy doing something, therefore we do not cultivate.<br><br>No matter how busy we are, we cannot be as busy as Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Guan Yin Pu-sa). Just imagine that each day in this world there are so many people seeking Guan Yin Pu-sa’s help to deliver them from their woes. Guan Yin Pu-sa is very compassionate and merciful and he responds to their cries for help. He is indeed very busy. Does is it mean that because Guan Yin Pu-sa is so busy, he does not cultivate? As a matter of fact, he is also cultivating while he is attending to cries for help. We cultivate while we are in action and in the midst of our bustles. That is emulating Guan Yin Pu-sa’s cultivation.<br><br>We all need to talk. To cultivate amid our actions means that we should use soothing words in our speech, words that carry compassion, love, encouragement and the Buddha-dharma. In this way we are cultivating in the midst of our actions.<br><br>Whatever we do in the course of our daily life, we remain aware that we do not engage in illusions or day dreaming; and we constantly uphold brightness and illumine awareness. This is cultivating while in action.<br><br>For people who do not know about cultivation, they are either scolding other people or gossiping whenever they open their mouth. On the other hand, for a person who cultivates, regardless of how busy he is, he is sensible in whatever he says and in accord with the Buddha-dharma. He does not engage in lying, slander, harsh speech and idle speech. There are numerous examples of cultivating while in action and this is just one of them. <img src="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br><br>/\</span></p>

                      cultivate while in tranquillity means not doing anything else
                      besides practising sitting meditation, prostrating before the
                      Buddha, or reciting the sutras. Indeed, some practitioners of this
                      method of cultivation can practise sitting meditation for an
                      uninterrupted stretch of several days at a time.<br> <br> Jen Chen Buddhism advocates that people cultivate amid our actions.
                      The times have changed. Because of the need to earn a livelihood
                      everyone has to work; everyone is working and is constantly engaged
                      in some kind of activity. However, even though we are busy and in
                      action, we also have to cultivate. It should not be that because we
                      are busy doing something, therefore we do not cultivate.<br> <br> No matter how busy we are, we cannot be as busy as Avalokitesvara
                      Bodhisattva (Guan Yin Pu-sa). Just imagine that each day in this
                      world there are so many people seeking Guan Yin Pu-sa’s help to
                      deliver them from their woes. Guan Yin Pu-sa is very compassionate
                      and merciful and he responds to their cries for help. He is indeed
                      very busy. Does is it mean that because Guan Yin Pu-sa is so busy,
                      he does not cultivate? As a matter of fact, he is also cultivating
                      while he is attending to cries for help. We cultivate while we are
                      in action and in the midst of our bustles. That is emulating Guan
                      Yin Pu-sa’s cultivation.<br> <br> We all need to talk. To cultivate amid our actions means that we
                      should use soothing words in our speech, words that carry
                      compassion, love, encouragement and the Buddha-dharma. In this way
                      we are cultivating in the midst of our actions.<br> <br> Whatever we do in the course of our daily life, we remain aware
                      that we do not engage in illusions or day dreaming; and we
                      constantly uphold brightness and illumine awareness. This is
                      cultivating while in action.<br> <br> For people who do not know about cultivation, they are either
                      scolding other people or gossiping whenever they open their mouth.
                      On the other hand, for a person who cultivates, regardless of how
                      busy he is, he is sensible in whatever he says and in accord with
                      the Buddha-dharma. He does not engage in lying, slander, harsh
                      speech and idle speech. There are numerous examples of cultivating
                      while in action and this is just one of them. <img src="/forums/1728/topics/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18"><br> <br> /\</span></p>

              <p>See that everything that arises has no core and essence.</p>
              <p><em><br>If we observe thought and ask where does thought arise, how does it 
                          arise, what is ‘thought’ like.  'Thought' will reveal its nature is 
                          empty -- vividly present yet completely un-locatable. It is very 
                          important not to infer, think or conceptualise but feel with our entire 
                          being this ‘ungraspability’ and 'unlocatability'. It seems to reside 
                          'somewhere' but there is no way to locate it.  It is just an impression 
                          of somewhere "there" but never "there".   Similarly “here-ness” and 
                          “now-ness” are merely impressions formed by sensations, aggregates of 
                          causes and conditions,  nothing inherently ‘there’; equally empty like 
                          ‘selfness’.<br><br>This ungraspable and unlocatable empty nature is not 
                          only peculiar to ‘thought’.  All experiences or sensations are like that
                           -- vividly present yet insubstantial, un-graspable, spontaneous, 
                          un-locatable.<br><br>If we were to observe a red flower that is so 
                          vivid, clear and right in front us, the “redness” only appears to 
                          “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so. Vision of red does 
                          not arise in all animal species (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is 
                          the “redness” an inherent attribute of the mind. If given a “quantum 
                          eyesight” to look into the atomic structure, there is similarly no 
                          attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost complete space/void with
                           no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever appearances are dependently 
                          arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent existence or fixed 
                          attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, 
                          mere appearances without inherent/objective existence.<br><br>Likewise 
                          when standing in front of a burning fire pit, the entire phenomena of 
                          ‘fire’, the burning heat, the whole sensation of ‘hotness’ that are so 
                          vividly present and seem so real but when examined they are also not 
                          inherently “there” -- merely dependently manifest whenever conditions 
                          are there.  It is amazing how dualistic and inherent views have caged 
                          seamless experience in a who-where-when construct.</em></p>

              <p>This metaphor only manage to describe the space-like characteristic of pure awareness. But this is the relative nature of mind, not the ultimate nature of mind which is its emptiness. Many mix them up. The relative, space-like nature of awareness is experienced even in the I AM phase. However, it is important to first have glimpse of pure awareness (the I AM phase), then proceed on to further insights like non-dual, Anatta and Emptiness.</p>

                               six senses be shut off. When this is done the recollection             
                                                            of past events on which the mind tends to

                              discontinued and the flow of memory cut off. Similarly, plans

                                  its existence? The real and essential mind is what is to

                              we shall discover                                           that, unlike
                               external objects, its true nature is devoid                     of     
                                                form or color; nor can we find any basis of truth for 
                              such                                           false and deceptive 
                              notions as that mind originated from                     this           
                                          or that, or that it will move from here to there, or that   
                                                                      it is located in such-and-such a
                               place. When it comes into                                           
                              contact with no object mind is like a vast, boundless void,             
                                                            or like a serene, illimitable ocean. When 
                              it encounters an                                           object it at 
                              once has cognizance of it, like a mirror instantly                      
                                                   reflecting a person who stands in front of it. The 
                              true nature                                           of mind consists 
                              not only in taking clear cognizance of the                              
                                           object but also in communicating a concrete experience of

                              eye-consciousness,                                           
                              ear-consciousness, etc., perform their functions on external            
                                                             phenomena in a manner involving gross

                                                              phenomena, is also of a gross nature. 
                              When this type of gross                                           
                              stimulation is shut out, and when concrete experiences and

                              assumes the characteristics                                           of
                               infinite void similar to the infinitude of space. But                  
                                 this                       void is not to be taken as the true nature
                               of mind. We have                                           become so 
                              habituated to consciousness of the form and color                       
                                                  of gross objects that, when we make concentrated 
                              introspection                                           into the nature 
                              of mind, it is, as I have said, found to                     be         
                                            a vast, limitless void free from any gross obscurity or 
                              other                                           hindrances. 
                              Nevertheless, this does not mean that we have                           
                                              discerned the subtle, true nature of the mind. What has 
                              been                                           explained above concerns 
                              the state of mind in relation to                                        
                                 the concrete experience and clear cognizance by the mind             
                                      which                       are its function, but it describes 
                              only the relative nature                                           of 
                              mind.</p>
              <p>There are in addition several other 
                              aspects and states of                       mind. In other words, taking
                               mind as the supreme basis, there                       are many 
                              attributes related to it. Just as an onion consists                     
                                of layer upon layer that can be peeled away, so does every            
                                         sort of object have a number of layers; and this is no less  
                                                   true of the nature of mind as explained here; it, 
                              too, has                       layer within layer, slate within state.</p>
              <p>All compounded things are subject to 
                              disintegration. Since                       experience and knowledge are
                               impermanent and subject to disintegration,                       the 
                              mind, of which they are functions (nature), is not something            
                                         that remains constant and eternal. From moment to moment it  
                                                   undergoes change and disintegration. This 
                              transience of mind                       is one aspect of its nature. 
                              However, as we have observed,                       its true nature has 
                              many aspects, including consciousness                       of concrete 
                              experience and cognizance of objects. Now let                       us 
                              make a further examination in order to grasp the meaning                
                                     of the subtle essence of such a mind. Mind came into existence   
                                                  because of its own cause. To deny that the 
                              origination of                       mind is dependent on a cause, or to
                               say that it is a designation                       given as a means of 
                              recognizing the nature of mind aggregates,                       is not 
                              correct. With our superficial observance, mind, which                   
                                  has concrete experience and clear cognizance as its nature,         
                                            appears to be a powerful, independent, subjective, 
                              completely                       ruling entity. However, deeper analysis
                               will reveal that this                       mind, possessing as it does
                               the function of experience and                       cognizance, is not
                               a self-created entity but Is dependent                       on other 
                              factors for its existence. Hence it depends on something                
                                     other than itself. This non-independent quality of the mind      
                                               substance is its true nature which in turn is the 
                              ultimate                       reality of the self.</p>

                                                  when it comes to real life, it is difficult to put into
                                                  practice.</p>
              <p>How a person who is not enlightened yet see through form and
                                                  formless ? (å¦‚ä½•é€�è§†ç›¸ä¸Žæ— ç›¸ï¼Œ åœ¨ç”Ÿæ´»ä¸­èµ·ä½œç”¨ï¼Ÿï¼‰</p>

              <p>Btw, you can take it that æœ‰ç›¸ means attach to the four forms: æˆ‘ç›¸ã€�äººç›¸ã€�ä¼—ç”Ÿç›¸ã€�å¯¿è€…ç›¸</p>
              <p>æ— ç›¸ means not attach to those forms.</p>
              <p>For example in Diamond Sutra, it is said that if you practice with the idea that YOU are saving 'Sentient Beings', then you are not a true bodhisattva. Why? You are attached to æˆ‘ç›¸ã€�äººç›¸ã€�ä¼—ç”Ÿç›¸ã€�å¯¿è€…ç›¸</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva saves sentient beings, yet he does not harbour the idea of a Self, or a Being that is being saved, because he realized emptiness. This is true practice. An Arhant attains liberation, yet he does not harbour the idea of a Self that has attained liberation, because he realizes that there is no such self, and yet it is precisely because of this that he is known as an Arhant/liberated</p>
              <p>If you practice trying to 'save the world' while clinging to æˆ‘ç›¸ã€�äººç›¸ã€�ä¼—ç”Ÿç›¸ã€�å¯¿è€…ç›¸, you'll never attain enlightenment even after aeons upon aeons of practice.</p>
              <p>If you realize emptiness and no longer cling to  æˆ‘ç›¸ã€�äººç›¸ã€�ä¼—ç”Ÿç›¸ã€�å¯¿è€…ç›¸, then instantaneously you are awake and liberated.</p>
              <p>However... true non-attachment arises only when you realize emptiness. Prior to that, you practice hard and put in effort to let them go, but you don't realize they are illusory, so the clinging tendency continues and effort continues. Realization only arises after some period of practice. And then after that, further practice and deepening of insight is necessary.</p>

              <p>When I first "converted" to Buddhist, I've never thought of "studying" emptiness because I just wish to go to Pureland by simply reciting  Amitabha. Later, I found that "studying" emptiness is one of the "compulsory subject" for every Buddhist.

              <p>Yes. And why is emptiness compulsory? Because every Buddhist aims to attain enlightenment. Attain enlightenment means realizing emptiness.</p>

              <p>How a person who is not enlightened yet see through form and

              <p>Thanks guys for sharing. </p>
              <p>When I first "converted" to Buddhist, I've never thought of
              "studying" emptiness because I just wish to go to Pureland by
              simply reciting  Amitabha. Later, I found that "studying"
              emptiness is one of the "compulsory subject" for every Buddhist.
              One of the shifu said if you don't take the "emptiness" course now,
              you still have to "study" it in Pureland as Amitabha will preach to
              us.</p>
