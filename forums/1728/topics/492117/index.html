When I first became
              interested in aging and how our culture views ‘growing older’ many years ago, I
              learned that, beyond a certain age, very few people seem to be afraid of death.
              Some may be afraid of dying with unfinished business, but we eventually reach a
              point when the fact of our death is no longer such a big deal. The big question
              is when will we face the fact that we will die?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Dr. Judith Rich wrote a great piece in the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Huffington Post</span></em><span><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></em></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">with the title “</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-judith-rich/knowing-i-will-die-someda_b_231125.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Knowing I Will Die Someday, How Then Will I Live?</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“. No doubt, Dr. Rich has done the
              work to have come face to face with the inevitability of her own death and
              ‘knowing’ she will die someday is more than just a concept for her. But for
              many ‘knowing’ is just a concept — not a deeply embodied certainty. For
              example, in our culture we assume that the knowledge of something will impact
              on our day-to-day choices and experience of living. If this were true, no one
              would smoke, everyone would be fit, and happiness would be the norm.
              Unfortunately, knowledge doesn’t cause us to do anything. And most of us are
              doing what we are doing in spite of what we ‘know’. Nowhere is this more
              evident than in relationship to our own mortality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">I think that ‘learning to die’ begins by acknowledging that
              we’re all dying from the time we are born. We don’t know how long we’ll have or
              when the big moment will come or the circumstances of our demise. But all paths
              lead to the same end point — at least on this planet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">What if you knew you were going to die in a week? Would that
              affect the quality of your life, your experience of living between now and
              then? It is hard to imagine that it would not. Even in the most adverse
              circumstances (such as death row in prison or in times of war), people report
              that the certainty or high probability of death bring an almost indescribable
              experience of aliveness — a heightened awareness of being in the present. Some
              forgotten pundit once said, “Nothing so focuses the mind as the imminent
              prospect of being hanged”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But why should it take a crisis or life-threatening
              circumstances to open us to being fully alive — to experiencing the moment and
              the fullness of what is possible? I think that is what Socrates was saying:
              ultimately, wisdom is about how to get the most out life. We can never do that
              if we are living in the past or some imagined future. Circumstances don’t cause
              our experience — being present (or not present) is when we can experience being
              alive. Some people may have 10,000 experiences and others one experience 10,000
              times. The difference is whether we are living in the moment or in some story
              or commentary about what life should be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">‘Living in the present’ is also one of those maxims that is
              easy to understand but difficult to master. Having the concept isn’t the same
              as mastery. In fact, one of the most certain ways to ‘not be in the present’ is
              to think about ‘what to do’ to be in the present. We all have the experience of
              being present — as children we live in the present a lot. As adults we often
              find ourselves ‘in the zone’ when we play sports, participate in the performing
              arts or experience moments of profound intimacy. Being present is, at the end
              of the day, a way of being, not something we do. Being present is a state of
              ‘surrender’ and letting go while being open to possibility.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Learning to surrender (not succumb) is the essence of
              learning to die. It is the essence of accepting the fact we don’t control most
              of what we think we control. It is ‘letting go’ of the past and the future and
              allowing ourselves to experience the serenity of just being alive. Mastery of
              this state can take a lifetime or occur in an instant. It is a transformation
              in our relationship with: 1) ourselves and other people, 2) the circumstances,
              and 3) time.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Learning to die is really learning to live. It is what we at
              The Eldering Institute® call “Wisdom in Action™”.</span></p>
