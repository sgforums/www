Alternatively it has been described as the promotion of ideas as scientific when they are not in fact scientific.<br><br>A field, practice, or body of knowledge might reasonably be called pseudoscientific when (1) it is presented as consistent with the accepted norms of scientific research; but (2) it demonstrably fails to meet these norms, most importantly, in misuse of scientific method.[18]<br><br>The following have been proposed to be indicators of poor scientific reasoning.<br><br>Use of vague, exaggerated or untestable claims<br><br>Assertion of scientific claims that are vague rather than precise, and that lack specific measurements.[19]<br>Failure to make use of operational definitions. (ie. a scientific description of the operational means in which which a range of numeric measurements can be obtained).[20]<br>Failure to make reasonable use of the principle of parsimony, i.e. failing to seek an explanation that requires the fewest possible additional assumptions when multiple viable explanations are possible (see: Occam's Razor)[21]<br>Use of obscurantist language, and misuse of apparently technical jargon in an effort to give claims the superficial trappings of science.<br>Lack of boundary conditions: Most well-supported scientific theories possess boundary conditions (well articulated limitations) under which the predicted phenomena do and do not apply.[22]<br>Over-reliance on confirmation rather than refutation<br><br>Assertion of scientific claims that cannot be falsified in the event they are incorrect, inaccurate, or irrelevant (see also: falsifiability)[23]<br>Assertion of claims that a theory predicts something that it has not been shown to predict [24]<br>Assertion that claims which have not been proven false must be true, and vice versa (see: Argument from ignorance)[25]<br>Over-reliance on testimonials and anecdotes. Testimonial and anecdotal evidence can be useful for discovery (i.e. hypothesis generation) but should not be used in the context of justification (i.e. hypothesis testing). [26]<br>Selective use of experimental evidence: presentation of data that seems to support its own claims while suppressing or refusing to consider data that conflict with its claims.[27]<br>Reversed burden of proof. In science, the burden of proof rests on the individual making a claim, not on the critic. "Pseudoscientific" arguments may neglect this principle and demand that skeptics demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that a claim (e.g. an assertion regarding the efficacy of a novel therapeutic technique) is false. It is essentially impossible to prove a universal negative, so this tactic incorrectly places the burden of proof on the skeptic rather than the claimant.[28]<br>Appeals to holism: Proponents of pseudoscientific claims, especially in organic medicine, alternative medicine, naturopathy and mental health, often resort to the Â“mantra of holismÂ” to explain negative findings.[29]<br>Lack of openness to testing by other experts<br><br>Evasion of peer review before publicizing results (called "science by press conference"). [30] Some proponents of theories that contradict accepted scientific theories avoid subjecting their work to the often ego-bruising process of peer review, sometimes on the grounds that peer review is inherently biased against claims that contradict established paradigms, and sometimes on the grounds that assertions cannot be evaluated adequately using standard scientific methods. By remaining insulated from the peer review process, these proponents forego the opportunity of corrective feedback from informed colleagues.[31]<br>Failure to provide adequate information for other researchers to reproduce the claimed results.[32]<br>Assertion of claims of secrecy or proprietary knowledge in response to requests for review of data or methodology.[33]<br>Lack of progress<br><br>Failure to progress towards additional evidence of its claims.[34] Terrence Hines has identified astrology as a subject that has changed very little in the past two millennia.[35]<br>Lack of self correction: scientific research programmes make mistakes, but they tend to eliminate these errors over time. [36]. By contrast, theories may be accused of being pseudoscientific because they have remained unaltered despite contradictory evidence.[37]<br>Personalization of issues<br><br>Tight social groups and granfalloons. Authoritarian personality, suppression of dissent, and groupthink can enhance the adoption of beliefs that have no rational basis. In attempting to confirm their (confirmation bias), the group tends to identify their critics as enemies.[38]<br>Assertion of claims of a conspiracy on the part of the scientific community to suppress the results.[39]<br>Attacking the motives or character of anyone who questions the claims (see Ad hominem fallacy).[38]<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_science" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo_science</a><br><br>Kindly do some reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I think Padmasambhava is reminding us not to get lost in conduct, thinking that there is "something truly virtuous" to adopt and "something truly nonvirtuous" to abandon in our conduct/actions. This means, while we are adopting virtues and abandoning nonvirtuous we should bear the View of Emptiness in mind, that NO truly existing person is performing any truly existing action towards any truly existing party.<br><br>However, having embraced this View of Emptiness, as what Longchen said, we should not think that we don't need to care about performing virtuous or nonvirtuous actions, because for us the unenlightened beings, we're still bound by karma. So though aware of the "lack of an inherent truly existing nature" of virtues and nonvirtues, we should still try to adopt virtuous behaviour and abandon nonvirtuous behaviour.<br><br>Thanks for all the sharing Longchen, Sinwei and Eternal Now.
