Nevertheless we can surmise that for many people, when they are suffering and miserable, instead of breaking free from the "illusions" that caused it, they create more illusions to try to cure their misery. Very soon their whole life becomes an intractable illusion. Layers of illusions pile on top of more illusions.<br><br>You need to be aware, you need to be mindful.<br><br>You need to be aware of the illusions in your own head.

To cultivate merits and liberation we cannot attach to the notion of self, the notion of giving and the notion of others.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/understa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/understa.htm</a><br><br><strong>Real merits</strong><br><br>Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no4e.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol6no4e.htm</a><br><br><strong>2. What should be the right frame of mind when giving?</strong><br><br>Some years ago, there was group of Jen Chen Buddhism practitioners who were very committed to charity. They were overly enthusiastic about what they did and would leave behind their contact numbers and addresses to those whom they had helped. Several years later, a person whom they had helped before wrote them a letter to see if they could donate some money to help establish a career for his son who had just completed his national service with the army. They sought my assistance on the matter. I have always advised people that whether it is giving or performing acts of merit, they should not attach to the notion that they are performing acts of giving or merits. By leaving behind their contact numbers they were are attached to the notion that they are performing charity. Therefore, that person is asking them for more assistance. They began to understand what this means. Several weeks later, this group of charity workers informed me that they actually visited the family concerned and found the family to be better off than they were themselves!<br><br>Hence, in general giving only provides for the immediate emergency material needs and not necessary save people from their poverty. If there were so many people living in poverty in this world, it would not be possible to relieve everyone of their poverty and give them a prosperous life if they were to depend only on charity. Therefore, Jen Chen Buddhism advocates inspiring others to unfold their wisdom, for example, by providing guidance and training in the areas of vocational skills and knowledge, so that they have the means to improve their living conditions and life style.<br><br><strong>3. Why must people give without attaching to the notion of giving?</strong><br><br>Giving while attached to the notion of giving is also known as 'giving for appreciation'. It is like planting a fruit tree in a pot, just like a bonsai. The plant may bear only a couple of fruits each year for people to appreciate and praise, but not for consumption. Not only is there no merit, the reward of blessings is also negligible. It is therefore important that we truly understand the Buddha-dharma when we are learning and practising Buddhism.<br><br>A student once asked me about the ultimate method of cultivation in Buddhism. The answer is the method of letting go. Not only do we need to practise letting go now, the present, but also the past and future. We have to let go of all the distresses in our mind. Moreover, we have to let go of all notions of possession or attachments that we have. Even when we become Bodhisattvas or attain Buddhahood, the Buddha must be given up too. This is the only way of the true Buddha-Dharma.<br><br>Therefore, we have to remember to cultivate the method of non-attachment to the notion of giving when we give, maintain non-arising and non-cessation of the mind and cultivate the merit of 'not form and not emptiness'. Only thus are we treading on the Bodhisattva Path.<br><br><strong>4. Is there any merit in giving?</strong><br><br>During the time when the Patriarch Bodhidharma was in China, the Emperor Liang Wu-Ti paid him a visit and asked, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated?"<br><br>Without any expression in his face, the Patriarch Bodhidharma replied, "No merits."<br><br>How could it be that after having done so much, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti had not accumulated any merit?<br><br>In Buddhism, merits refer to the non-arising and non-cessation of the mind. Therefore, when we are doing good deeds such as giving, we can only say that there are blessings associated with such deeds, but not merits. When a person who truly understands the Buddha-dharma gives without attaching to the notion of giving, he certainly does not expect other people to thank him. The Diamond Sutra states that if the magnanimity of a giver is as vast as the space, in future the reward of his blessings will be just as vast.<br><br>I remember when we were building the Manjusri Hall; a person contributed a certain sum of money. Two years later, this person visited the Manjusri Hall and went around searching for where his name might be inscribed. I explained to him that many people had contributed financially, materials and other efforts to the building. Since nobody had requested for his or her names to be inscribed, it would be awkward to inscribe just his name. He didn't understand and instead became slanderous. Somebody even remarked that he might be better off giving to those temples where deities are worshipped as they will inscribe his name in the temples. These were temples of superstitious beliefs. He really did so and was no longer interested in learning and practising Buddhism. He no longer seeks to unfold his wisdom. This person was so attached to his act of giving and had unwittingly ended his wisdom life. It is such a pity that he chose to believe in superstition rather than be an authentic practitioner of Buddhism.</blockquote>For more information refer to the third chapter, Chapter III.
