              <p>Hi SJS, there are some Pureland practitioners on this forum. So they can address your questions very well. I just want to make some comments based on my limited knowledge.</p>
              <p>1.  Your rebirth in the next life depends alot on what you do in this life and also from your karma from your past lives.  Your state of mind just before your death also plays a large factor.  Basically, if you have been living in a virtuous state of mind and creating merits and do much positive deeds for others, you help yourself to go to a better rebirth.</p>
              <p>3.  Once a person has died, if he is without realisation from the practice of Dharma when he was alive, he is helplessly driven by the force of his karma.  Just like you have very little control over your dreams at night.  The habitual tendencies will tend to take control.</p>
              <p>4.  There are methods in the Tibetan Vajrayana that can help to influence one's future rebirth and block unfavorable rebirths but that require deep familiarisation prior to death.  Also, if the family creates merits for the deceased and he is aided by realised masters, he can obtain a positive rebirth.</p>

              <p>2. i think without some past karmic retribution involve, the dead would not anyhow disturb the living. hence even dharma protectors also have to give them their "right" to do so. so there's no freedom. what one can do is settle the debt.</p>
              <p>5. it is possible that the dead still cannot let go of their attachment. but normally Amituofo arrives when they have let go and or when they have recited to certain single pointedness. it's like u decided to take a bus/train, and the bus came in front of you, a last minute decision to not board it, is very very rare.</p>
              <p>6. this is a yes and no anwser, depending on one's level of realisation.</p>
              <p><strong>A</strong>- mean æ— no, <strong>mituo</strong> mean <em>finity</em> and <strong>fo</strong> mean Buddha(s). so Amituofo mean Infinity Buddha(s). All in One, one in All.</p>

              <p>The karma of the living will decide the realm they will go rebirth. Sounds like the karma they create after their death is of no relevance. In this sense, the dead can feel free to act as they desire, to be evil or kind after their death.</p>

              <p>like mentioned there's not much freedom for ghost being(and even no freedom for hell beings). as ghosts are very much driven by attachment or hatred.  i am saying about 90-95%, but there's still exception of 10-5%, who may encounter a well practitioner to guide them out of their attachment or hatred. i have see personally a few cases, one is 2 nuns liberating a female ghost from distrubing a living female who own her money.</p>
              <p>Buddha is of all knowing, even those folk believers whom are accurate took their believes from buddhism.</p>
              <p>... but even for hell beings, i would give 99.9% , so there're still 0.1% chance of encountering help per se.</p>

              Hi SJS6638, are you having the misunderstanding that there is one afterlife?
              
              There is not only one next life. We already had countless past lives from without a discernible beginning and will continue such rebirths on and on until we attain nirvana.
              
              So this will answer your question about deeds being done in the next life: they can ripen in the next life itself, or in the next next life, or the next next next life.
              
              Next you must understand that karma is natural cause and effect. It is not imposed by some gods or judges. You may already know this.

              <p>change the word karma to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentional action</span> to better understand the word.</p>
              <p><br> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_in_Buddhism</p>
              <p>In the Nibbedhika Sutta (Anguttara Nikaya 6.63) the Buddha said:
                   "<strong>Intention </strong>(P. cetana, S. cetanÄ�) I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of body, speech, &amp; intellect."[5]</p>
              <p>The word karma derives from the verbal root ká¹›, which means "<strong>do, make, perform, accomplish</strong>." Karma is "the nominative singular form of the neuter word karman, which means '<strong>act, action, performance, deed</strong>.' In grammatical usage, karman refers to the direct object in a sentence, the recipient of the action indicated by the verb."[2]
                   
                  In the Devanagari script karma is rendered à¤•à¤°à¥�à¤®à¤¨à¥�; the PÄ�li variant is kamma. The terms in translation are as follows: Traditional Chinese: <strong>æ¥­, yè,</strong> .</p>
