              I can see myself
              On Wednesday, January 12, 2011, in General, by David
              Narcissism breeds contempt, and if contempt exists then compassion cannot flourish. By eradicating your narcissistic ways you will enable yourself to learn compassion and lead a better more fulfilling life.
              -Stuart Dawsons
              
              Narcissism is the personality trait of egotism, vanity, conceit, or simple selfishness. The word is derived from Narcissus, a character from Greek mythology, that saw his reflection in a pool of water and was so taken by the beauty of his own image that he could not pull himself away. He stayed there until he withered and died.
              As much as I hate to admit it, I am often guilty of this narcissism myself. I wonder if you may be as well.
              
              How is it that most of us learn this behavior? Is it some sort of self-preservation that compels us to elevate the idea of self? Do we think that if do not consider ourselves extra special, than no one else will?
              I think this may be part of it. I think the way our brain works, we feel that if we are not of high value, we must be of low value. But this is irrational thinking. There is no high or low value, we are just who we are. We are human beings.
              Being mindful and compassionate are not things to be rated or commended. Loving kindness in itâ€™s purest form accomplishes benevolence with proper intention. Thought and actions are no longer about me, but are intended to benefit of all living beings.
              But what if you hurt me, steal from me, lie to me? Should I not defend myself or seek justice?
              You see, it would be very easy to make it all about yourself in these types of situations. Because we tend to view this as personal, and all about us and our feelings. Our narcissism kicks in.
              But what if we do nothing when these things occur? What if we are able to view these situations as impermanent and not something we own personally? At that point, you become an observer. With loving kindness and compassion you forgive and accept things as they are. I can see there is no suffering when I eliminate the attachment and the idea of self. It is no longer personal, no longer narcissistic.
              I will share with you, that itâ€™s only recently, that I have been able do this. But I can tell you that it has given me a much greater sense of peace than I have previously had in my life.
              Please understand that this is not to be confused with apathy, as I do care very deeply. In fact, if anything, I feel I have more love and connection to others than ever before. I see they are sad, angry, scared or hurt. And I believe that offering my acceptance without judgment or ego is offering them loving compassion. I have no desire to change or control they way they are feeling.
              
              So I now have begun to notice that when I get emotionally affected by someone else, it is because of my ego. My narcissism makes me think it is about me. My chest gets tight, my breathing becomes labored, my head begins to hurt. And then I think, â€œwhat am I doing?â€�. Ah, the return to mindfulness!
              Slowly, my breathing relaxes and I can feel my entire body relaxing. Now I can be an observer, be present in the moment, and be compassionate. This is my practice.
              I must be patient with myself, as this is still very new to me. But I know that I must start with loving myself and being gentle with my practice. Rome was not built in a day, right!
              
              I wish you peace, mindfulness and compassion.
              And may you always be well, happy and peaceful.

              <p>so if someone is getting bullied by another - they should not take the view of a 'narcissist' and instead try to address he overall situation?</p>
              <p>What if the person doing the bullying keeps on doing so?</p>
              <p>My point/question is, it's fine if you can or are trying to apply this approach, but there are often others around you that don't. Is a person able to successfuly and repeatedly apply this approach without puting themselves in a disadvantaged situation?</p>

              <p>Are you simply unhappy or angry with the person, the bully or are you held hostage by fear and feels isolated?
              If the first, then stand back a bit and take a breather.  When composed, you may then take a position with a more positive outcome, if not for both, at least for yourself!
              If the second, you must break out your own isolation of fear. Most bullies hide behind a false sense of superiority, if physically, usually threatens the victim to silence. If in the internet, behind the veil of anonymity.
              I am sorry that I am unable to be more specific as there variability in bullying and its' victims. Often a bully as exposed as a coward, the bullying will stop. However, I prefer to empower the victim and hopefully not create another bully.</p>

              <p>my post was just an example.</p>
              <p>..but to continue with that example;</p>
              <p>According to the approach, one shouldn't focus on oneself right? That's fine, so u try and do what u can to see the broader issues (e.g. the bully has deeper problems, that's perhaps why he/she is a bully etc etc), but in the meanwhile the vicim is still getting a punch in the head for no reason everytime they cross paths.</p>
              <p>If the bully does so because they don't like the victim's face, whilt the victim keeps on 'stepping back and taking a breather', he/she is putting themselves in a disadvantaged situation by having to bear those hits day in day out.</p>
              <p>I'm not disagreeing with your point. I'm just curious as to how straight fwd it actually is to implement in the world we exist in.</p>

              I am assuming you are refering to a physically bullying, then having confidence and composure is important. Train yourself mentally and physically.
              But if you are talking about office bullying, that a different story. One needs to be adapt socially or extremely competent in one's own field in order not to be held hostage.

              Perhaps I've missed your point.
              
                  Let's say we are having this discussion, somewhere along the way. I feel threatened, since I am narcissistic, it is all about me, my ego, so I go anal  and I start getting personal.I start attacking you,( defending myself), even though it was never your intention in the first place.
                  You get surprised as you did not anticipate this, you retaliate as you are now feeling threatened.
                  The common thing is both of us got emotional because we both felt threatened!
                  With empathy with regards to the other person, one will not get too emotional with the other person, we will have a higher threshold before we start feeling threatened. If possible, try to disarm the person's aggression with your charm! It is not possible if you are threatened and feel angry or afraid! This is about having emotional maturity!
                   Most bullies need to work up an aggressive response before becoming intimidating. They subconsciously size you up by signs mixture of fear and anger. They get their fix by humiliating others.
                  
                  Physically,let's use martial arts as example, when engaging an opponent, one must never lose one's cool, either anger or fear, for it will cloud  our judgement. In the end, the more conscious party will prevail. With an untensed body and mind  one counters the opponent effortlessly!  Think and play taichi!

If possible, try to disarm the person's aggression with your charm! It is not possible if you are threatened and feel angry or afraid! This is about having emotional maturity! Most bullies need to work up an aggressive response before becoming intimidating. They subconsciously size you up by signs mixture of fear and anger. They get their fix by humiliating others. Physically,let's use martial arts as example, when engaging an opponent, one must never lose one's cool, either anger or fear, for it will cloud our judgement. In the end, the more conscious party will prevail. With an untensed body and mind one counters the opponent effortlessly! Think and play taichi!</p>

              <p>With regards the response to bullying, it's not just the singular issue of self preservation at stake.  It's also that the bully will continue with his/her ways if uncorrected.  If the defense is not out of wanting to take revenge or a "you give me a black eye, I give you several broken ribs" sort of attitude, but simply a need to prevent oneself from getting hurt, then I would say a response is called for. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless as people walking the spiritual path, I think it would be preferable where possible, to seek peaceful and "win-win" situations in matters involving conflict.  If we behaved just like some gangster on the streets, then we need to ask ourselves if our personal cultivation has been effective.</p>

              <p>Yep and that's what I'm gettin at - that in practical terms, sometimes a response is called for. If that means that you have to make a conscious decision to go and take up martial arts in order to defend yourself (not beat the bully to a pulp), then that still involves thinking about one's self and hence 'self preservation'....does it not?</p>
              <p>To take the approach of 'impermanent' or 'we do not own these situations personally' is fine....but it may not be practical in the (non idealistic) world that we live in, unless you're willing to be consistently put in a disadvantaged situation.</p>
              <p>Or am I seeing this in a too hostile kind of way...?</p>

              Being a sentient being, being alive, is to preserve oneself, the no other way around the fact!
              My point of view in this instance, derive from oneself being not unhappy. We do what we could to preserve ourselves, in fact everything things we learn in life, one way or another is about preserving ourselves!
              
              Having the right balance,being proactive or passive, like the bow, too tight and it will break, too loose, unable to function, all about the balance.   While it is ok to be proactive as we go about preserving and building, we should not dwell too much mentally  . When we hold a negative or adversarial position, chances are the outcome will be confrontational. Physically ,you can have an upper hand if only you are bigger, better, faster. It is probably better to apply your intelligence on such situations.
              
              You are not being hostile, but defensive upon feeling threatened.We feel threatened and unhappy because we do not have helpful ability to resolve the issue to our satisfaction. It is self preservation, not narcissistic. It is common to adopt an adversarial stance, being reactive.
