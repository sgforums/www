Posting negative comments like the bolded line isn't gonna make people very happy, especially people who are sincerely expecting answers.<br><br>...and various other trollish, prejudiced comments that I slowly and patiently stripped from you until like page 4.<br><br>2a. <strong>Strangely, my meaning was clear. If you believe in one thing, why is there a need to match what people claim and what they do, when all in all, its all against what you believe in?</strong><br><br>Then why are you hanging around in EH? I'm gonna teach you a new word, and it's called curiousity.<br><br>2b. <strong>Thats from his POV. You talk from a third part POV, which is irrelevant to my post. It shouldnt be directed to me, coz I never said Buddhism is false, nor would i want to do that. </strong><br><br>How do you know his POV? Is the data not coming from your memory? And what is your memory based on? Your idea of him is distorted by prejudices, as evident in your posts. You don't even know how to watch your ego, so dont give me the excuse that you can read his mind.<br><br>3. <strong>Again, prove the narrow one tracked and unforgiving mindset? This is the third question on proving, which apparently you cant do.</strong><br><br>Obviously you cannot imagine open-mindedness because you cannot imagine that other people have different backgrounds and therefore different patterns of thoughts. Well what appears real to you may not be another person's reality. People who are wise will know that each person has his own reality, and sometimes they put down their own "reality" and imagine other people's reality as a hypothesis, then see what they can get out of it.<br><br>NT2: "the purpose of this thread is to put together wat buddhist claimed and what i come across. i do not wish to entertain your foolish observations and set of thinking about me.

This analogy is correct.<br><br>True to what I also said about AEN replying his questions unceasingly. Again, you made assumptions. If the remarks so called goad him and hurt him, that is your view, not the truth. He can be unbothered and simply replied what is his point. Somehow, more like you are the one who got bothered, not him.<br><br>Again, you called these as trolling and prejudiced because you said so, yet you cant prove how they are trollish and prejudiced. Imagine I come to you and simply put labels on you simply because I said so, would you be happy with that?<br><br>The part of hanging around in EH, it is irrelevant. You are merely latching on his words to cast personal remarks, not an objective answer.<br><br>Obviously, from your post you have not been reading or know Christianity. Even he said he cannot be tolerant of other 'truths'. Therefore, posting from his POV is correct. Otherwise, you would simply blame me on using my own method of analysis instead.<br><br>last point is together with the point above. from a chrisian POV, buddhism is all wrong. there is not a need to piece together. Its does not add value, even to his own understanding. Which is why i mooted the idea of him joining Buddhism, since he is so curious. Again, nothing wrong.<br><br>Clearly, none of your points is anything on how my posts are trolling. You are merely putting labels into half of your posts. You took one statement and called it trolling. Wow, up to now you have not learnt what is the difference between a statement and a reason.<br><br>Please do study more into this area.<br><br></div>
