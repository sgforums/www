He did post even the same title, AEN was everywhere explaining, even in the topic he posted a Guan Yin picture. Which part of the post say he was a cunning liar? He is, but not within this post of mine. Extra judicial comments..tsk tsk...<br><br>Again, you are doing the same thing, I asked for possibly the third time. How would providing an analogy be trolling? You said it is, so it is? So pray, do tell  where i coming from? Say! How is providing an analogy be trolling? Why you are making guesses about where i am coming from without proving it?<br><br>Still no proof, dont xia shou wei qiang bu saying i would say there is no proof, because your 'proof' doesnt exist...so how to ignore..<br><br>You conveniently ignore my post, whereby a) a Christian would think Buddhism is wrong anyway, so it doesnt matter...b) you even admitted to the point its bo liao, its within the last page, yet now you are going one circle by saying this part?<br><br>"Totally irrelevant, because someone who isn't buddhist isn't gonna automatically know which one is right and which is wrong, and they certainly won't memorize your religion. Posting negative comments like the bolded line isn't gonna make people very happy, especially people who are sincerely expecting answers. "<br><br>Phrasing of answers doesnt matter. Truth is truth. It hurts. to some maybe. Again, no proof this is a trolling statement.</div></blockquote>Now I feel like an idiot for even engaging this argument with you last night. It is so obvious that you were being subtle in riling people up. Anyone with a half brain can see that. Denying proofs by saying nonsense and yet demanding for more proofs just makes you look unreasonable and pathetic. Is your intention to help NT2 understand more about buddhism? Are you being helpful or more of a hindrance here? Are you even a buddhist in the first place? In fact even AEN didn't know what those monks were doing at that place.<br><br>If you are a buddhist, start learning to live in the present.<br>If you are not, why are you here speculating about other people's agenda when you don't even know your stuff?<br><br>And one more thing... "i understand where you are coming from" means I understand what you mean. Please read more serious discussions on other websites' forums instead of posting more crap on sgforums and turning other people's threads into crapboxes before making a fool of yourself again.</div>

You know subtlety or not? I think you are just being selective. In any case, if you feel this argument is dumb, why are you continuing even now? You cant prove, and in this case, bring out the quotes and explain how they are troll, yet you talk about me being subtle and all that? Tsk...you are losing touch. You are putting these labels, because you want it to be, not because you have good reasons to do so.<br><br>Again, are all these what you said relevant? Why does it matter if i know Buddhism or not? This is personal assasination, pls stick to the issue at hand.<br><br>Lastly, you understand what i mean? Seems like the whole time you are just putting labels, take up one sentence, call them trolling, take up another, said they are prejudiced without explaining why.<br><br>Again, for all these, i will reserve the right to call you troll, for you made these baseless allegations without proper proof.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
