              <p>"Monks, these eight worldly conditions spin after the world, and
                                          the world spins after these eight worldly conditions. Which eight?
                                          Gain, loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, &amp;
                                          pain. These are the eight worldly conditions that spin after the
                                          world, and the world spins after these eight worldly
                                          conditions.</p>
              <p>"For an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person there arise gain,
                                          loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, &amp; pain. For
                                          a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones there also arise gain,
                                          loss, status, disgrace, censure, praise, pleasure, &amp; pain. So
                                          what difference, what distinction, what distinguishing factor is
                                          there between the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones and
                                          the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person?"</p>
              <p>"For us, lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root,
                                          their guide, &amp; their arbitrator. It would be good if the
                                          Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement.
                                          Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember
                                          it."</p>
              <p>"In that case, monks, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will
                                          speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "Gain arises for an uninstructed
                                          run-of-the-mill person. He does not reflect, 'Gain has arisen for
                                          me. It is inconstant, stressful, &amp; subject to change.' He does
                                          not discern it as it actually is.</p>
              <p>"Loss arises... Status arises... Disgrace arises... Censure
                                          arises... Praise arises... Pleasure arises...</p>
              <p>"Pain arises. He does not reflect, 'Pain has arisen for me. It
                                          is inconstant, stressful, &amp; subject to change.' He does not
                                          discern it as it actually is.</p>
              <p>"His mind remains consumed with the gain. His mind remains
                                          consumed with the loss... with the status... the disgrace... the
                                          censure... the praise... the pleasure. His mind remains consumed
                                          with the pain.</p>
              <p>"He welcomes the arisen gain and rebels against the arisen loss.
                                          He welcomes the arisen status and rebels against the arisen
                                          disgrace. He welcomes the arisen praise and rebels against the
                                          arisen censure. He welcomes the arisen pleasure and rebels against
                                          the arisen pain. As he is thus engaged in welcoming &amp;
                                          rebelling, he is not released from birth, aging, or death; from
                                          sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, or despairs. He is not
                                          released, I tell you, from suffering &amp; stress.</p>
              <p>"Now, gain arises for a well-instructed disciple of the noble
                                          ones. He reflects, 'Gain has arisen for me. It is inconstant,
                                          stressful, &amp; subject to change.' He discerns it as it actually
                                          is.</p>
              <p>"Loss arises... Status arises... Disgrace arises... Censure
                                          arises... Praise arises... Pleasure arises...</p>
              <p>"Pain arises. He reflects, 'Pain has arisen for me. It is
                                          inconstant, stressful, &amp; subject to change.' He discerns it as
                                          it actually is.</p>
              <p>"His mind does not remain consumed with the gain. His mind does
                                          not remain consumed with the loss... with the status... the
                                          disgrace... the censure... the praise... the pleasure. His mind
                                          does not remain consumed with the pain.</p>
              <p>"He does not welcome the arisen gain, or rebel against the
                                          arisen loss. He does not welcome the arisen status, or rebel
                                          against the arisen disgrace. He does not welcome the arisen praise,
                                          or rebel against the arisen censure. He does not welcome the arisen
                                          pleasure, or rebel against the arisen pain. As he thus abandons
                                          welcoming &amp; rebelling, he is released from birth, aging, &amp;
                                          death; from sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp;
                                          despairs. He is released, I tell you, from suffering &amp;
                                          stress.</p>
              <p>"This is the difference, this the distinction, this the
                                          distinguishing factor between the well-instructed disciple of the
                                          noble ones and the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person."</p>
