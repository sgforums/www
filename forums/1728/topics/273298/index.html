            <div class='col-md body'>Actually this reply was headed for TheGoodEarth's new topic, but I realised his topic title wasn't very suitable so I created my new one to reply one of his and herzog's messages.<br><br>Here is it (original discussions at <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=268114&amp;page=9" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=268114&amp;page=9</a>):<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by TheGoodEarth:<br>I am not following these long arguments between AEN and Herzog. I shall try to focus on propagation. First  we must distinguish between religion and philosophy. To me, both are spread but not necessarily evangelised. More correctly, philosophy is sought, religion is spread.</blockquote>Both philosophy and religion must <strong>BOTH</strong> be sought and spread.<br><br>Because there must first be a seeker of philosophy and religion, then later learning the philosophy and religion. And to learn the philosophy and religion, they must first be spread (I prefer to actually just say 'teach'). The same principle goes to every single academic and non-academic subject in the world. And to spread education and knowledge to the world, we need teachers.<br><br>Anyway, both 'philosophy' and 'religion' cannot quite rightly describe what Buddhism is about, nevertheless, the same principle applies.<br><br><blockquote>There are fundamental differences between Buddhism and Christianity - in form and in practice. Forget for a moment about the moral part.<br>I shall not dwell on the differences. There are many who have done this.<br><br>Christianity and Buddhism are propagated differently. History is full of recorded truths. Christianity rode on wars, conquests and colonisations. There were holy wars and crusades. Missionaries were part of these campaigns in the name of spreading God's word. Indeed there were persecutions and forceful conversions. The Catholic Church itself had persecuted many. These are truths never told or admitted. Christians today read/study the bible without reference to history.<br>Central to Christianity is Creator-God, Sin, Saviour and Eternal Life.<br><br>Buddhism was not considered a religion (depending on how religion is defined). There is no Creator-God or the One God, hence no war was fought in the name of God or for God. Buddhism emphasizes on looking inwards, seeking the way out of suffering. Each individual reach that goal <strong>not</strong> thru a Saviour (if you missed the First, there is a Second).</blockquote>Yes, very true.<br><br><strong>No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"<br><br><blockquote>Buddhism was also spread but not as 'evangelised' as Christianity.</blockquote>Yes, Buddhism does not require evangelism, just as Biology or Physics do not need to be evangelised. Because what Buddhism teaches is based on observable realities and self-realisation and transformation, everyone can do that and see the results.<br><br>But there needs to be enough teachers who can teach the world, just as there needs to be enough teachers and educators to increase the literacy and education level in the developing countries.<br><br>So anyway you're right that Buddhism is also spread but not 'evangelised' as Christianity.<br><br>There are lots of 'developing countries' spiritually (such as the West) and they are developing quite fast (i.e Buddhism is being spread quite fast).<br><br><blockquote>If today you say there are more Christians, then the simple truth is due to the very zealous and even aggressive evangelism. Personally, I see less 'witnessing' by Buddhists than by Christians. Also, Christianity offers an easier way to Eternal Life than Buddhism's offer of Emptiness. It is easier to accept that one has sinned than to accept that 'there is suffering'.<br><br>I speak from experience.</blockquote>Yes, very true, and also have to do with the ignorance of what Buddhism is about... Buddhism is deep and profound and requires a wise person to get the message across.<br><br>Buddhism can be more zealous in trying to spread his own teachings, though not the kind of zealousness or evangelism we see in other religions. Also, our intention must be out of pure compassion to help others, and we must see that person's conditions to apply the right remedy to them.</div>

It is only when experiments are conducted then the student understands the logic behind and accepts the truth from the subjects. Hence Buddhism is indoctrinating people not to accept that suffering is part and parcel of life as per what Prince Siddatha understood in his search of the escape from suffering.</div>

Dharma is being taught in order that others may gain insights and transformation, and liberation. The teachings are taught, not 'evangelised'.<br><br><strong>No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"</div>
