              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Ud 4.4 PTS: Ud 39<br>Juñha Sutta: Moonlit<br>translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu<br></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A cantankerous yakkha hits Ven. Sariputta over the head, and pays the price for his stupidity.</span><br><br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.4.04.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html</a><br><br>I
               have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near 
              RÄ�jagaha at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. And on that 
              occasion Ven. SÄ�riputta and Ven. MahÄ� MoggallÄ�na were staying in Pigeon 
              Cave. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. SÄ�riputta — his head newly shaven —
               was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of 
              concentration.<br><br>And on that occasion two yakkhas who were 
              companions were flying from north to south on some business or other. 
              They saw Ven. SÄ�riputta — his head newly shaven — sitting in the open 
              air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to 
              give this contemplative a blow on the head."<br><br>When this was said, 
              the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. 
              Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding 
              contemplative, of great power &amp; great might."<br><br>A second time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."<br><br>A
               second time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my 
              good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding 
              contemplative, of great power &amp; great might."<br><br>A third time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."<br><br>A
               third time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my 
              good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding 
              contemplative, of great power &amp; great might."<br><br>Then the first 
              yakkha, ignoring the second yakkha, gave Ven. SÄ�riputta a blow on the 
              head. And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or
               eight cubits tall, or split a great rocky crag. But right there the 
              yakkha — yelling, "I'm burning!" — fell into the Great Hell.<br><br>Now,
               Ven. MoggallÄ�na — with his divine eye, pure and surpassing the human — 
              saw the yakkha give Ven. SÄ�riputta a blow on the head. Seeing this, he 
              went to Ven. SÄ�riputta and, on arrival, said to him, "I hope you are 
              well, friend SÄ�riputta. I hope you are comfortable. I hope you are 
              feeling no pain."<br><br>"I am well, friend MoggallÄ�na. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache."<br><br>"How
               amazing, friend SÄ�riputta! How astounding! How great your power &amp; 
              might! Just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head. So great was that 
              blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits 
              tall, or split a great rocky crag. But all you say is this: 'I am well, 
              friend MoggallÄ�na. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache'!"<br><br>"How
               amazing, friend MoggallÄ�na! How astounding! How great your power &amp; 
              might! Where you saw a yakkha just now, I didn't even see a dust devil!"<br><br>The
               Blessed One — with the divine ear-property, pure and surpassing the 
              human — heard those two great beings conversing in this way. Then, on 
              realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion 
              exclaimed:<br><br><br>Whose mind, standing like rock,<br> doesn't shake,<br>dispassionate for things that spark passion,<br>unprovoked by things that spark provocation:<br> When one's mind is developed like this,<br> from where can there come to him<br> suffering &amp; stress?[1]<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span><br><br>1. A variant of this verse is attributed to Ven. Khitaka at Thag 2.36 (verses 191-192 in the PTS edition):<br><br><br>Whose mind, standing like rock,<br> doesn't shake,<br>dispassionate for things that spark passion,<br>unprovoked by things that spark provocation?<br> When one's mind is developed like this,<br> from where can there come to him<br> suffering &amp; stress?<br>My mind, standing like rock,<br> doesn't shake,<br>dispassionate for things that spark passion,<br>unprovoked by things that spark provocation.<br> When my mind is developed like this,<br> from where can there come to me<br> suffering &amp; stress?</p>
