For instance, there may be situation where the information on mediums is of assistance to those who read about it, and through sharing with people who suffered traumatic experience, provided solace, and saved their life. It also provided some valuable insight as alternative on a different and wider approach of interests that beyond science and sociology of secularism. I think Singapore authority would only ban tabloids that promote very violent, brainstorming against the peace &amp; harmonious mind of individual towards Singapore or other countries etc. Buddha Sakyamuni never ban anyone or information, he focused on education of right mindset on multicuralism and religions by imparting his enlightenment experience of non-dualistical peace and harmony, so that the future living beings who aspired to be Buddha would know how to handle appropriately and amicably on information that they relishing on<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> Amitabha!</span></p></div>

              <p>I noticed that too but anyway it is useless for them to do so because the obituaries in the papers tell it all that  prayers do not always come true. My friends who are free thinker do not believe in god religion which says prayers work because they read the obituaries and wonder why the prayers do not work for those who are young and  from god religion. They believe more on karma though they are not ready to accept Buddhism yet but more incline towards Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Agree with you. Those who are not well informed will think badly of Buddhism. So, we true Buddhists should show good examples and also help to spread true Buddhism to people around us.</p>

              <p>I do agree it's good to highlight bad things of religion to the public but why only limit to Buddhism/Taoism ?</p>
              <p>I am sure there are also weird behaviours and cults in other faiths.</p>
              <p>So it gives the public the impression that only Buddhism/Taoism have all these strange behaviours and other faiths are very proper and safe.</p>
