              Relating to Unseen Beings</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">REGINALD RAY | JANUARY 1,
              2001</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">While Westerners
              have tended to view unseen beings as superstition or mere symbolism, Reginald
              Ray argues that communication with unseen beings through ritual is at the very
              heart of tantric Buddhist practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Truth makes
              little sense and has no real impact if it is merely a collection of abstract
              ideas. Truth that is living experience, on the other hand, is challenging,
              threatening, and transforming.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tibetan Buddhism
              is a way of experiencing the world. In many ways, it is quite different from
              the dominant trends not only in the West, but in the “modern, technological
              culture” that is now rapidly encircling the globe. There are many parts of the
              traditional, conservative, medieval culture of Tibet that we will never be able
              to appreciate or understand. But there are other parts, particularly its
              Buddhist heritage, that can help us see with new eyes the limitations and
              possibilities of our own contemporary situation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism is a particularly
              interesting tradition because it has one foot in the past and one in the
              present. On the one hand, it arose at a time when India was undergoing
              transformation from a more primitive to a “high” civilization. Buddhism has the
              same literacy, scholasticism, professional elites, institutionalization,
              hierarchies, political involvements, and monetary concerns as do the other
              “high religions” that evolved after the invention of agriculture and that we
              now largely identify as our own ways of being religious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At the same time,
              the Buddha claimed, “I follow the ancient path,” and by this he meant to show a
              “way back” to a more fundamental experience of human life than the one evolving
              in his day. Tibetan Buddhism, perhaps more than any other form of Buddhism, has
              retained the raw and rugged experience of this “primordiality” as the basis of
              its spirituality. In this sense, it is concerned not with truth that is fixed
              and dead, but with truth that is alive and constantly emerging.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Traditional
              Tibetans lived in a world that is, in many respects, quite different from the
              one assumed in modern Western culture. It is not so much that the classical
              Tibetan worldview contradicts the findings of modern science, but rather that
              it emphasizes different things and has a different overall shape and
              configuration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Most importantly,
              in the classical Buddhist view, the world is defined not only by what we can
              perceive with our physical senses and think about rationally. It is equally
              made up of what cannot be seen, but is available through intuition, dreams,
              visions, divination, and the like. The senses and rational mind provide access
              to the immediate physical world, but it is only through the other ways of
              knowing that can one gain access to the much larger context in which this
              physical realm is set. Can modern people have experience of this traditional
              Tibetan cosmology? Tibetans will tell you that their experience of the universe
              is accessible to anyone who cares to know it. If you know where to look and how
              to look, they say, you will see for yourself what we are talking about.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Tibetan
              cosmos is a vast one, beginningless and endless in terms of time, and limitless
              in extent. Worlds, each inhabited by sentient beings, extend on and on
              throughout space, with no end. This context of infinite space and time, with
              innumerable worlds, provides the arena for samsara, cyclic existence. Samsara
              refers to the condition of beings who have not yet attained liberation, whose
              existence is still governed by belief in a “self” or “ego.” Those still within
              samsara are thus blindly driven, through the root defilements of passion,
              aggression, and delusion, to defend and aggrandize the “selves” that they think
              they possess. This action produces results or karma, that become part of who
              they are. When samsaric beings die, they are subsequently reborn in the same or
              another realm, in accordance with their karma. Normally this process, and the
              cycles of pain and pleasure that it entails, goes on without end. The various
              samsaric worlds are known as “impure realms,” that is, places where the
              condition of samsara prevails among the inhabitants.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The situation is
              not hopeless, however, for there are other realms of being that stand outside
              of samsara. These are the “pure realms,” characterized by enlightenment, the
              abode of the “realized ones,” those who have attained liberation from samsara
              and who dwell in various pure lands. These beings are: the celestial buddhas
              with their various manifestations; the yidams (personal deities), male and female,
              also called wisdom dakinis and herukas; the great bodhisattvas such as
              Avalokiteshvara and Tara, who will come to the aid of beings; the dharmapalas
              (dharma protectors), who watch over and guard the dharma itself and those on
              the path; the enlightened men and women who have passed beyond this world, and
              others. These various enlightened ones represent a state of realization that is
              available to suffering sentient beings. In fact, according to the type of
              Buddhism followed in Tibet—Mahayana Buddhism—the state that they embody is the
              ultimate and final destiny of all humans and other sentient beings. All
              sentient beings are on the path that will one day lead to the attainment of the
              complete and perfect enlightenment of a fully realized buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Although the
              “home” of the buddhas and high-level bodhisattvas is outside of samsara, they
              appear in our world to help us enter the path of liberation and follow it to
              its conclusion. The human Buddha Shakyamuni thus appeared twenty-five hundred
              years ago, bringing the dharma to this world for the first time and founding a
              lineage of the study and practice of the teachings. Likewise, the celestial
              buddhas, bodhisattvas, protectors, dakinis and departed teachers appear in our
              world in various ways, bringing blessings, protection, and guidance on the
              path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The Tibetan
              cosmology, then, is not meant to present a disembodied, abstract “scientific”
              picture. It rather shows us the realms of potential experience that make up
              this cosmos. It describes the various realms of being—only one of which is
              human—that are possible and exist within the totality of being. Some of these
              modes of being are defined by the suffering of samsara, while others represent
              liberation from samsara. Traditional Tibetan cosmology, then, contrasts with
              modern conceptions of the universe that are essentially rationalistic, gained
              by ignoring all experiential data except ones that conform to limited physical
              criteria such as matter, extension and motion, and that can be proven to any
              observer through logical demonstration. The Tibetan picture has been gained
              through different means and includes different “data.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">There are now
              many Tibetan teachers who understand very well the kind of universe that is
              described by modern science. Their response to our ideas is, “Yes, but all of
              this is just the human world. There are other realms, and these are outside of
              and beyond this human realm. You cannot see them by using scientific
              instruments.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Moreover, even
              this realm has more dimensions and subtleties than modern people usually
              ascribe to their world. In the traditional Tibetan view, the animate and
              inanimate phenomena of this world are charged with being, life and spiritual
              vitality. These are conceived in terms of various spirits, ancestors, demigods,
              demons, and so on. Every river and mountain has its spirit embodiment or
              inhabitants. Each human habitation has a spiritual presence as part of its own
              being. As this variety suggests, spirits appear with various levels of
              development and motivation. Some are malevolent; some are neutral, and others
              are generally beneficent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">These traditional
              cosmological perspectives create a uniquely powerful environment for the
              practice of Tibetan Buddhism. The boundless temporal and spatial vistas reveal
              the fragility, brevity and ultimate futility of human life, taken on its own
              terms. The view of the phenomena of this world as spiritually charged allows
              intimacy, relationship and mutuality with the relative world. The understanding
              of samsara as the endless repetition of life followed by death followed by
              life, all governed by karma, suggests that lasting happiness in the ordinary
              sense is not attainable. The introduction of buddhahood as standing outside of
              samsara provides an alternative to this daunting and frightening prospect. The
              fact that buddhahood is not only available but is the ultimate and final
              destiny of all instills fundamental optimism and a sense of the value of life.
              And the limitless time frame in which this can be achieved enables people to
              relax and to take their spiritual journey at its own pace. In this way, Tibetan
              Buddhism has achieved the seemingly contradictory goals of revealing the
              radical inadequacy of samsara, leaving its adherents little option but to look
              to a spiritual path, while at the same time rousing them to a sense of
              confidence, joy and well-being at their human condition and its literally
              infinite possibilities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To what extent
              can the contemporary Western Tibetan Buddhist practitioner dispense with some
              or all of these unseen, nonhuman beings? From the Tibetan point of view,
              relationships with the unseen world are essential to a full and successful
              human life. Ignoring one’s relationships with the whole world of unseen spirits
              and spiritual beings is, in fact, as senseless and counterproductive as
              ignoring the people and conventions of one’s own immediate human society. It is
              simply not possible to live in such a way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Buddhism is
              normally thought of as a nontheistic tradition, and this raises the question of
              how such spirits, gods, and deities are to be understood within the Tibetan
              Buddhist framework. Certainly in Tibetan life, whether it is a question of the
              malevolent mamos, the potentially beneficent hearth god, the deities of the god
              realms, or the dharma protectors or tantric yidams, the nonhuman beings are
              understood at least on one level as more or less independent, objective
              entities. They are beings with whom one must be in constant relation, even
              though they are nonhuman and usually not visible.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">At the same time,
              however, from the point of view of the philosophical and meditative tradition,
              all such nonhuman beings are ultimately seen as aspects of one’s own mind and
              not separate from it. But what does this actually mean? Frequently, particularly
              in the West, this standard Buddhist assertion is taken to indicate that such
              spirits and deities, taken as external beings by ordinary Tibetans, are not
              really external at all; that in fact they are mistaken projections of
              psychological states. This, then, becomes a justification for treating them as
              nonexistent and provides a rationale for jettisoning them from Western
              adaptations of the tradition. The problem with this approach is that it
              reflects a misunderstanding of what is meant by the statement that such
              entities are aspects of mind and inseparable from mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The deities are
              more properly said to be aspects of one’s own innate mind, or reflexes of one’s
              awareness. For example, the buddhas, although apparently objectively existing
              beings, are fundamentally nothing other than our own enlightened nature. The
              protectors are representations of the wrathful and uncompromising energy of our
              own awareness. And the gurus are objectifications of the teaching and guiding
              principle as it exists within each of us. In a similar manner, the various
              samsaric spirits and demons may be seen as embodiments of peripheral states of
              one’s own mind. These apparently externally existent beings, then, are false
              bifurcations of the primordial nondual awareness that lies at the basis of all
              experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So far, so good;
              but here is the really critical point: it is not only the beings of the unseen
              world that have this status, but all of the phenomena of duality. In the
              Tibetan view, ourselves, other people, trees, mountains and clouds—indeed all
              of the phenomena of the entire so-called internal and external universe—are
              nothing other than false objectifications and solidifications of nondual
              awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">To say this is
              not, however, to discount their external and “objective” existence within the
              relative world of apparent duality. The samsaric beings of the six realms, as
              well as the Buddhist deities existing in the state of nirvana, initially make
              themselves known to us ordinary, unenlightened people as external, objectively
              existing beings. In fact, on this level, they can appear as significantly more
              real, vivid and powerful than the ordinary physical universe that surrounds us.
              On one level, then, such beings certainly do exist and are important
              co-inhabitants of our cosmos. Thus to say that they are aspects of mind is not
              to deny their existence on the relative level. Nor does it obviate our
              responsibility to deal with them and relate to them on their own level and as
              they present themselves to us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What, then, does
              it mean to say that these unseen beings are all aspects of mind? It means
              simply that the way we experience and conceive of them has to do with our own
              psychology and level of awareness. Ultimately, the apparent duality of subject
              and object is not given in reality. It is a structure that we, out of fear and
              ignorance, impose on the world. When we see the phenomenal world truly as it
              is, we realize a level of being that precedes the subject-object split. This is
              the true nature of “experience,” “awareness,” or “nondual mind,” understood at
              this point as interchangeable categories. When Tibetans say that the spirits,
              gods and deities are aspects of mind and nothing other than mind, they mean it
              in this sense, that their fundamental nature—as indeed the nature of all phenomena—is
              nondual awareness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">We humans, then,
              are just one part of a vast, interconnected web of relationships with all other
              inhabitants of the cosmos, both those still living within delusion and those
              who are awakened. An awareness of these relationships is critical because, to a
              very large extent, who we are as humans is defined by this network of
              relations. From the Tibetan perspective, to live a genuinely human and fruitful
              life, we need to discover our relation with all these various beings of samsara
              and beyond, and to act in ways appropriate to our connection. The way we do
              this is through ritual.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ritual is action
              that expresses a relationship. It is the vehicle of communication with another
              and is itself that communication. In Tibetan Buddhism, ritual is used in
              relation both to the seen and the unseen worlds, and the essence of Tibetan
              Buddhism is communication with the awakened ones—departed masters,
              bodhisattvas, buddhas, and so on. We call them to mind, open our hearts to
              them, and receive their blessings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In revered
              teachers, a state of realization is embodied in human form. In the celestial
              buddhas and high-level bodhisattvas, however, the embodiment is more ethereal
              and not within the human realm. Nevertheless it is not only possible but essential
              that, as we go along the path, we also discover and deepen our sense of
              communication with these nonmaterial, awakened ones. According to Tibetan
              tradition, in fact, as we mature, the “sky draws closer to the earth,” so to
              speak, and the celestial buddhas and bodhisattvas seem more and more our
              ever-present protectors, mentors, and guides.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One of the most
              common ritual means for communicating with the realized ones is the sevenfold
              offering of mahayana Buddhism: one visualizes the being or beings in question,
              then [1] offers salutation, [2] makes real and imagined good offerings, [3]
              confesses one’s shortcomings and harm of others, [4] rejoices at the existence
              of the awakened being or beings who are the beloved object(s) of devotion, [5]
              requests them to teach, thus expressing one’s openness and longing for
              instruction, [6] asks them to remain in connection with suffering samsaric
              beings and not disappear into nirvana, and [7] dedicates whatever merit or
              goodness one has accumulated to the welfare of all beings. In this simple,
              brief rite, one makes a link with the transcendent ones, affirming and
              actualizing a specific kind of relationship with them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The reason that
              we can do this in the first place is that the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and
              departed masters already represent who we most essentially are and must in fact
              become. This is why, in Tibetan Buddhism, even the most devotional supplication
              to the most seemingly external being is not finally theistic. For, in truth, we
              are longing to meet our deepest selves face-to-face, and we are supplicating
              our own hidden being. The path to this goal is first, to discover our innermost
              being in the other, the awakened one, and then, through relationship with him
              or her, gradually to come to awareness of that transcendent nature within
              ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In Tibetan
              Buddhism, there are many ritual stages along this path to awakening. What they
              share is visualization. We create a mental picture of a departed teacher, a
              high-level bodhisattva, or a buddha. Then we carry out a ritual in which we
              open ourselves and communicate with this being in various ways, ritually
              participating in his or her awakening. In this way, we cultivate our own
              awakened state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This process of
              visualization is a powerful one. For example, in our ordinary life, what we do
              not visualize as existing does not exist for us. If we do not see another
              person as human, then for us their humanity does not exist. The same is that
              much more true for beings who live in nonmaterial forms outside of samsara. We may
              be surrounded by buddhas and bodhisattvas all the time, but until they have a
              shape and a name, we do not see them or have access to a relationship with
              them. For us they might as well not exist. But the moment we give them a form
              in our mind and begin to communicate with them, they exist, and their wisdom,
              compassion, and power can enter into our own systems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It is the many
              ritual forms of Tibetan Buddhism that enable us to do this, and within
              traditional Tibet, the reality of ritual is simply accepted as a matter of
              course. It is assumed that just as there are forms by which to relate to other
              human beings, so there are other forms that are used to communicate with the
              nonhuman and nonmaterial realms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The status of
              ritual among Western followers of Tibetan Buddhism is, however, more in
              question. Many have felt unable to entertain the ideas of reincarnation or of
              the six realms. For them, many of the traditional Tibetan rituals dealing with
              other beings and other realms do not make sense. Sometimes this extends to
              thinking that even talk of nonmaterial buddhas, bodhisattvas and protectors is
              “symbolic,” and that there is nothing that really corresponds to these
              designations. In that case, many of the Tibetan liturgies are seen as directed
              to no real object, but are rather understood as psychological ploys to bring
              about certain effects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Even if we
              Westerners do pay lip service to the traditional Tibetan cosmological ideas,
              often, as Jeremy Hayward has argued, we remain at heart what he calls
              “scientific materialists.” In other words, while we may accept the idea of
              other realms and other beings within and outside of samsara, we do not actually
              believe in them. Instead, we live as if the world were dead and this reality
              the only one that exists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This attitude is
              reflected in many Westerners’ difficulties with Tibetan ritual. Among Western
              practitioners, there is frequently a kind of dead feeling in ritual, and many
              of us fall back on the idea that rote repetition, without any particular
              engagement or feeling, is sufficient. We fall back, in other words, on
              attitudes to ritual learned in our upbringing, where simply to be physically
              present was all that was required. In order to survive the many meaningless
              rituals we may have been subjected to, we also learned to disengage ourselves
              psychologically and to occupy our time with thinking about other things. What
              is missing here is the understanding that ritual is a way of communicating with
              beings who, on the relative plane, really are there and really are important to
              us. This lively and compelling sense of ritual is, at present, sometimes hard
              to come by in Western adaptations of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Through ritual,
              genuinely undertaken, one is led to take a larger view of one’s life and one’s
              world; one experiences a shift in perspective—sometimes subtle, sometimes
              dramatic. This shift feels like a diminishing of one’s sense of isolated
              individuality and an increase in one’s sense of connectedness with other
              people, with the nonhuman presences of our realm, and with purposes that
              transcend one’s usual self-serving motivations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ritual is a way
              of reconnecting with the larger and deeper purposes of life, ones that are
              oriented toward the general good conceived in the largest sense. Ironically,
              through coming to such a larger and more inclusive sense of connection and
              purpose, through rediscovering oneself as a member of a much bigger and more
              inclusive enterprise, one feels that much more oneself and grounded in one’s
              own personhood. Through ritual, one’s energy and motivation are roused and
              mobilized so that one can better fulfill the responsibilities, challenges and
              demands that life presents.</span></p>
