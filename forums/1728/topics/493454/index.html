              decline of Buddhism in Cambodia</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Euan Black February 1, 2017
              Southeast Asia Globe</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              Cambodia modernises and sex and drug scandals rock the monkhood, the famed
              saffron robes no longer command the respect they once did</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In 1959,
              May Mayko Ebihara became the first American to write an anthropological
              dissertation on Cambodian village life. Published in two volumes nearly a
              decade later, Svay: A Khmer Village in Cambodia depicted a pre-modern
              agricultural idyll governed by family and religion, in which monks were seen as
              the “living embodiments and spiritual generators of Buddhism”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              rapid economic development has led to a dramatic restructuring of social
              relations within the Kingdom. Urbanisation is siphoning people away from rural
              life, modernity is slowly consuming tradition, and more and more Cambodians are
              turning their backs on the monkhood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Buddhism
              is not strong like before,” said Bunsin Chuon, a monk since 1996 who splits his
              time between the US and Wat Langka in Phnom Penh. “People have happier lives
              now because technology is so advanced, and fewer people want to become monks
              because to be a monk is not a happy life.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Before
              the Khmer Rouge, pagodas served as the moral, educational and cultural hub of
              village life and thus enjoyed a prominent position within society. Writing in
              Cambodge: The Cultivation of a Nation, 1860 – 1945, the historian Penny Edwards
              describes how the monkhood, or sangha, “offered one of the few paths to power
              outside of birthright”, with completion of at least one Buddhist Lent in the monastery
              considered a male rite of passage. Boys would enter the monkhood as teenagers,
              learn about Buddhism and Khmer culture, then return to adult life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sinen
              Neang, a 29-year-old from rural Kampong Cham province, joined the sangha when
              he was 17 and spent ten years as a monk before using what he had learnt to
              pursue a career as a human rights worker. As the first-born male in his family,
              tradition demanded that he become a monk. But it was the allure of receiving a
              good education – something beyond reach for many of Cambodia’s rural poor –
              that convinced Neang to commit to monastic life. “If I didn’t ordain as a
              Buddhist monk, I had no chance to study at high school and university,” he
              said. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              the growth of non-religious schools and universities in Cambodia has seriously
              undermined the sangha’s social and cultural influence. “Before, if anyone
              wanted to learn literature or any skill, they could go to the temple – there
              was an incentive. But now they have a lot of choice; they don’t need to go to
              the temple,” said Chuon, before estimating that the number of monks at Wat
              Langka in Phnom Penh had fallen from 300 to 100 in five years. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What’s
              more, decades of robust economic growth have rewarded many Cambodians with such
              material and technological advancement that the prospect of joining the sangha
              has become even less appealing, according to Khy Sovanratana, a monk of 27
              years and vice-rector at Cambodia’s Preah Sihanouk Raja Buddhist University.
              “There are more jobs outside the monastery. Young boys can have a family and
              enjoy life, which they see as more attractive than being quiet, circumspect and
              restrained,” he said. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sengkak
              Ly, a 20-year-old student at the National University of Management, laughed
              when Southeast Asia Globe asked if he had ever considered joining the sangha.
              “I have no time to be a monk,” he said. “I have to study so that I can get a
              good job. I’m not really thinking about religion.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              idea of pursuing an ascetic life was also inconceivable for Rin Savath, a
              25-year-old finance student at Build Bright University. “I’ve never been a
              monk, and I never want to be one, because when you become a monk you lose all
              your freedom and are treated differently by society,” he said. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              sangha is also contending with a worryingly high level of criminal activity
              among its ranks. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              June 2016, Vong Chet, the head of a pagoda in Siem Reap’s Kralanh district, was
              found guilty of raping more than ten young novices and sentenced to 15 years in
              prison. The case was not an anomaly – two other monks were charged with raping
              underaged girls and two more were jailed for drug offences in the second half
              of 2015 alone. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              authorities have long brushed off such acts as individual transgressions, but
              this has failed to temper the public’s increasing disdain for monks, who are
              supposed to serve as exemplars of Buddhist behaviour. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              those who do join the sangha often don’t stay long. As a result, few monks
              learn the scriptures to a level that enables them to effectively perform their
              principal role as broadcasters of the Buddha’s teachings, or dhamma.
              Sovanratana described the decline in the standards of monastic education as “a
              major setback to the progress of Buddhism and the standard of monastic life in
              the country”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Concerns
              about modern monks’ limited understanding of dhamma and their lack of
              stringency in following the ten precepts, along with the perception that many
              monks take up the saffron robes purely to gain a free education and live off
              the generosity of others, appear to be gaining traction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Echoing
              the sentiments of other Cambodians Southeast Asia Globe spoke to, Ren, a
              26-year-old massage therapist from Phnom Penh, said monks no longer fulfilled
              their purpose as spiritual leaders. “The monks use monkhood as an occupation,
              but they don’t try to learn the scriptures. We believe in this religion and we
              look up to them, and if they don’t really know anything, then who do we look up
              to?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sovanratana
              said preceptors – monks who are qualified to teach other monks – needed to be
              more robust in checking the background of would-be monks in order to prevent
              “troublemakers” from joining the sangha. “Once the name is put forward, some
              preceptors just sign and perform their rituals. This has led to some problems,”
              he said. “The preceptors must perform background checks of candidates. Drug
              addicts are not easily changed. It’s not like you can possess such a man and become
              a morally behaved person immediately.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              increasing numbers of Cambodians eschewing the monastic life in order to enjoy
              the fruits of capitalist expansion, and more still questioning the authority of
              the sangha, it would be easy to conclude that Buddhism’s influence is on the
              wane in Cambodia. But according to the Ministry of Cults and Religion, 95% of
              the population still identifies as Buddhist. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Philip
              Coggan, author of Spirit Worlds: Cambodia, the Buddha and the Naga, believes
              the decline of the sangha has not greatly impacted Buddhism in Cambodia because
              monks are simply seeking personal salvation and are “almost irrelevant to most
              major-life passages”. Coggan believes modernisation has had a far greater
              impact.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“A
              booming economy brings consumerism (‘shiny objects’) and so the ethical side of
              Buddhism (‘reject shiny objects’) takes a back seat to the ‘magical’ side, in
              which the spirit world is called on to channel ‘luck’, conceived in Buddhism as
              something real and malleable,” he told Southeast Asia Globe in an email.
              “Buddhism’s doing fine. People still turn out in huge crowds for Pchum Ben and
              [Khmer] New Year.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              Chuon believes that those who only go to the pagoda on holy days are not
              following “real Buddhism”. “Many just go to the temple with their parents
              during Pchum Ben or Khmer New Year. They are not practising,” he said. “Going
              to the temple in order to dispel bad spirits when you have a bad dream or have
              bad luck – this is not Buddhism.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Savath
              and Ly are prime examples of such Buddhists. Neither visit the pagoda outside
              holy days – unless down on their luck – and neither follow the five precepts of
              Buddhism, which are regarded by many monks, such as Chuon, as the religion’s
              only non-negotiable ‘rules’. However, neither Savath nor Ly believe these facts
              make them any less Buddhist, with Savath claiming “it’s not necessary to follow
              all the five precepts, as long as you don’t harm others” and Ly defending his
              beliefs by stating that he still “respects the Buddha”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Scott
              Mitchell, who conducts research on Buddhist modernity at California’s Institute
              of Buddhist Studies, said the debate over what constitutes a ‘practising’
              Buddhist would likely never be resolved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              general, most Buddhist cultures define a Buddhist (practising or not) as one
              who has taken refuge in the three jewels of Buddhism – the Buddha, the dhamma
              and the sangha – and/or holds the precepts to some extent,” he wrote in an
              email. “Having said that, I believe it’s up to a religious community to
              determine what it takes, so to speak, to be a practising member of that
              community.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whether
              Buddhism’s influence in Cambodia is weaker than it used to be largely depends
              on how one chooses to define Buddhism. History has shown such definitions to be
              fluid and, according to Mitchell, this is one of the religion’s greatest
              strengths. “Buddhist institutions and communities try to make the dhamma
              meaningful in whatever context they are located. The goal is not, necessarily,
              to change the societies in which Buddhism is located, but to direct individuals
              toward the dhamma,” he said. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              fact that Buddhism survived the Khmer Rouge regime demonstrates that it is
              nothing if not resilient, and Sovanratana believes it will continue to exert a
              strong influence on Cambodian society. “The Buddhist tradition in Cambodia is
              still very strong despite some bad happenings,” he said. “Some may turn their
              backs on it temporarily, but they will come back. Buddhism and Khmer culture
              are almost inseparable.” </span></p>
