              <h1><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #000066;">Kundalini and Sex<br>(kundalini yoga and sex)</span></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Kundalini and sex do not go hand-in-hand! When sexual energy is diverted towards more creative uses... one experienced awakening of kundalini gradually! The raising of kundalini is not all of a sudden! Kundalini awakening is a very slow process... needs practicing patience, persistence and perseverance at its level best!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If we look into history of Hinduism... whenever people indulged in sex... their kundalini awakening got delayed! Take the case of Sage Vishwamitra... a highly accomplished sage of his era... a contemporary of Sage Vashistha! On sighting a maiden woman taking bath in forlorn circumstances in deep dense jungles (forests) fell from grace... he had to repeat practice of celibacy all over again!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The full awakening of kundalini is beset with certain preconditions... foremost of which is practice of absolute celibacy! In absence of practice of absolute celibacy... nothing much in the field of kundalini rising is achieved! A practice of 12 years of Brahmacharya Vrata (the physical part of celibacy) is necessitated for full activation of kundalini.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Absolute celibacy is not all about abstention from sex! Physical celibacy constitutes hardly 10% of the total job. 90% celibacy is always practiced mentally... stopping flow of negative thoughts to our brain is what celibacy is all about! The moment all negative thoughts to our brain stopped in totality... one finally established control over positive thoughts also!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One finally reached stage of no thoughts... stage of absolute nothingness when not a single thought flowed to our brain non-invoked... of its own! At this moment one finally experienced full awakening of Kundalini Shakti... the coiled Serpentine energy lying dormant in base of spine! Kundalini snake... kundalini serpent power is a very powerful form of energy!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If left uncontrolled... it can completely ruin a person! While practicing kundalini yoga one must make sure that absolute sincerity and diligence is maintained all throughout! In absence of strict discipline of yoga meditation... kundalini if let loose is like a dam bursting at its seams! Practice of kundalini demands controlling sexual inhibitions in totality!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Only a very highly sexual person succeeds in awakening of kundalini shakti! It is sexual energy... the most potent of all energies made available to mankind with grace of God almighty... harnessing which human beings reached stage of enlightenment (kaivalya jnana) and finally salvation (moksha)!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The harnessing of Kundalini Shakti involves transmuting sexual energy towards fulfillment of only absolute goal of life! A person not having a goal in life can never awaken kundalini shakti! We need to have a goal... a purpose in life! Only then can we transmute sexual energy towards that goal of life!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In absence of a goal life is like a rudderless boat going round and round in the ocean. It is like a motorboat going berserk in Deep Ocean! Unless we harnessed sexual energy to the hilt... unless we transmuted sexual energy towards the only goal of life... full awakening of Kundalini Shakti would always remain a dream!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">God Almighty ordained a particular quota of sexual energy to every man and woman month after month, year after year! Harnessing this sexual energy towards the only goal of life is what kundalini awakening is all about! Most human beings indulged in indiscriminate sex whiling away this precious sexual energy through pure physical channels!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Youngsters whiled away this cosmic energy through means of masturbation! Whatever the mode... we just cannot drain out this precious sexual cosmic energy through pure physical channels! We have to redirect this energy towards more creative uses and reach end goal of life... the stage of enlightenment (kaivalya jnana)... 8.4 millionth manifestation... the last in cosmic life cycle when human beings finally gained salvation (moksha)!
              </span></p><p>In recent times Acharya Rajneesh (née Osho)... a highly accomplished Jain spiritual master mixed sex with yoga! He desired full awakening of kundalini shakti through means of sexual unison! By indulgence in free sex in a very serene environment Acharya Rajneesh wanted to accomplish the unthinkable... gaining enlightenment through sexual union!</p>
              <p>Momentary feeling of ecstasy does not announce reaching stage of full awakening of Kundalini Shakti! It is a proven fact that only by transmuting sexual energies... Accomplished sages and saints of earlier era reached stage of enlightenment... the stage of absolute nothingness... the stage of Nirvikalpa samadhi!</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Full awakening of Kundalini shakti announces opening of Sahasrara Chakra (thousand petaled Lotus) existing in our brain behind the forehead! Almost 99% of our brain lay dormant. It is only by full awakening of kundalini we activated our brain hundred percent!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The opening of Sahasrara Chakra in our brain announced human beings reaching stage of enlightenment (kaivalya jnana) and finally salvation (moksha) forever! Full awakening of kundalini shakti is a one-way path. One can never revert back to ephemeral phase of life later on. The bud once having become a full-blown flower can never become a bud again!</span></p>

              <p>Kundalini awakenings bring along many undesirable symptoms physically and mentally.</p>
              <p>Many people can get their kundalini just by shaktipat from masters/gura (blessing on the head ) or doing yoga / meditation.</p>
              <p>You have to ask yourself are you ready for it.</p>
              <p>for eg Reiki Class can awake one's energy and kundalini but many of the Reiki Teachers can't handle individual's kundalini problem. They can start the fire for you but they can't tame it.  Or help you to stroke it into a comfortable rosy warmth.</p>
              <p>It's easy to wake up one's kundalini.  The difficult part is the journey and how you may suffer from it.</p>

                  have a goal... a purpose in life! Only then can we transmute sexual
                  energy towards that goal of life!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
                  absence of a goal life is like a rudderless boat going round and
                  round in the ocean. It is like a motorboat going berserk in Deep
                  Ocean! Unless we harnessed sexual energy to the hilt... unless we
                  transmuted sexual energy towards the only goal of life... full
                  awakening of Kundalini Shakti would always remain a
                  dream!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">God
                  Almighty ordained a particular quota of sexual energy to every man
                  and woman month after month, year after year! Harnessing this
                  sexual energy towards the only goal of life is what kundalini
                  awakening is all about! Most human beings indulged in
                  indiscriminate sex whiling away this precious sexual energy through
                  pure physical channels!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Youngsters
                  whiled away this cosmic energy through means of masturbation!
                  Whatever the mode... we just cannot drain out this precious sexual
                  cosmic energy through pure physical channels! We have to redirect
                  this energy towards more creative uses and reach end goal of
                  life... the stage of enlightenment (kaivalya jnana)... 8.4
                  millionth manifestation... the last in cosmic life cycle when human
                  beings finally gained salvation (moksha)!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">In
                  recent times Acharya Rajneesh (née Osho)... a highly accomplished
                  Jain spiritual master mixed sex with yoga! He desired full
                  awakening of kundalini shakti through means of sexual unison! By
                  indulgence in free sex in a very serene environment Acharya
                  Rajneesh wanted to accomplish the unthinkable... gaining
                  enlightenment through sexual union!</span></p>
              <p>Momentary feeling of ecstasy does not announce reaching stage of
                  full awakening of Kundalini Shakti! It is a proven fact that only
                  by transmuting sexual energies... Accomplished sages and saints of
                  earlier era reached stage of enlightenment... the stage of absolute
                  nothingness... the stage of Nirvikalpa samadhi!</p>

              <p>Nirvikalpa Samadhi is simply an initial glimpse of formless Presence. It is not the final realization. It is stage 1 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a></p>
              <p>There is Sahaj Samadhi, which is non dual presence, Thusness Stage 4. But even that is not the final realization.</p>
              <p>I have been through these phases so I know. For liberation, it is important to have the right view of Anatta and Shunyata.</p>
