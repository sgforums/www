              <h3>Joy of Zen</h3>
              <p>By Ven. Jueh Ming</p>
              <h3>Where are you?</h3>
              <p><br> <br> On many an evening after supper, Zen Master Hui-Ming and his lay 
                                      disciple Jen-Ping took a stroll in the woods. The master would often 
                                      utilize these outings to enlighten his disciple. <br> <br> One day after walking some distance, as darkness fell, Jen-Ping suddenly
                                       cried out, "Master! Look. The fireflies. Lots of them, twinkling like 
                                      falling stars."  <br> <br> He was so excited that he could not contain himself.  <br> <br> The master queried sternly, "Jen-Ping! Where are you?" <br> "Master, I'm right here next to you," Jen-Ping answered.<br> "Are you sure?"  The master asked<br> <br> The fact is that Jen-Ping's mind was occupied by what he saw. He was distracted by the fireflies and lost in the illusion.</p>

              <h3>The Fireflies</h3>
              <p><br> <br> Three years past since Jen-Ping studied under Zen Master Hui-Ming's 
                                      guidance. Jen-Ping knew that he had to look inward to develop 
                                      self-controlled judgment. He learned to harness awareness and keep it 
                                      illuminated day in and day out. <br> <br> Jen-Ping worked hard to discipline himself to cultivate every day in 
                                      order to make cultivation a habit. Occasionally he was plagued with 
                                      ignorance and anxiety. <br> When master tested him unexpectedly, he would become sidetracked and 
                                      lose his awareness. Sometimes awareness was within him, but sometimes 
                                      not .<br> <br> One day as usual Jen-Ping accompanied master out for a walk after 
                                      supper. It was gradually getting darker. Master pointed to the fireflies
                                       appearing in the woods and said to Jen-Ping: "Your mind is like a 
                                      firefly. Its light darts and flickers in the darkness."</p>

              <h3>Pines &amp; Water Fowl<br></h3>
              <p><br> One day the Master and his disciples strolled along the lake. Calm 
                                      emerald water, stately immobile century old pines, and iridescent 
                                      playful water fowl created a serene Zen-like picture of nature. <br> <br> "Look what's in front of us!" exclaimed the Master.  <br> "There are pretty ducks chasing each other." answered the disciples.<br> "Well, why didn't you notice the motionless pine trees?" rebutted the Master.<br> <br> The moral of the story is the minds of sentient beings tends to notice 
                                      and cling to what stirres and changes around them. The emerging thoughts
                                       derived from the attachments will dull their awareness. A life attuned 
                                      to sensual stimulation prevents a person from experiencing the 
                                      stationary tranquil Truth around us.</p>

              <h3>The Master's Reproach</h3>
              <p><br> <br> One day the Master was invited to give a Dharma talk in the city. 
                                      Jen-Ping went along to attend and assist the Master. During the talk, 
                                      Jen-Ping carelessly made a minor mistake on the board when he wrote down
                                       the gist of the lecture. <br> <br> Abruptly the Master interrupted the lecture and harshly scolded him 
                                      before the entire audience, "how can you do something like that. It 
                                      shows your lack of attention. Your mistake reflects insufficient effort 
                                      in your cultivating to attain and strengthen your awareness."<br> <br> Suddenly a deadly silence befell the lecture hall. The attendees 
                                      were so astonished by Master's reaction wondering why the Master had 
                                      belittled Jen-Ping so scornful.<br> <br> After the talk one brave follower brought the incident to Master's attention.<br> <br> "The purpose for the disciple to study under any teacher is not so much 
                                      to learn Dharma as it is to learn how to cultivate one's way to 
                                      liberation from the entrapments of mind and the gate of birth-death. <br> <br> If the disciple can not accept his teacher's reproach it will not be 
                                      easy for her/him to tackle birth-death in accordance with the Way and 
                                      become liberated from them. If she/he can not accommodate his teacher's 
                                      groundless criticism, how can she/he handle sentient beings later on ?" 
                                      replied the Master calmly.</p>
