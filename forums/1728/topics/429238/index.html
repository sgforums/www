              <p>"Monks, these <a id="indiv4" name="indiv4">four types</a> of individuals are to be found existing in the world. Which four?</p>
              <p>"There is the case of the individual who has attained internal 
              tranquillity of awareness, but not insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment. Then there is the case of the individual who has
               attained insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, but not
               internal tranquillity of awareness. Then there is the case of the 
              individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity of awareness 
              nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment. And then 
              there is the case of the individual who has attained both internal 
              tranquillity of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment.</p>
              <p>"The individual who has attained internal tranquillity of awareness, 
              but not insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, should 
              approach an individual who has attained insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment and ask him: 'How should fabrications be 
              regarded? How should they be investigated? How should they be seen with 
              insight?' The other will answer in line with what he has seen &amp; 
              experienced: 'Fabrications should be regarded in this way. Fabrications 
              should be investigated in this way. Fabrications should be seen in this 
              way with insight.' Then eventually he [the first] will become one who 
              has attained both internal tranquillity of awareness &amp; insight into 
              phenomena through heightened discernment.</p>
              <p>"As for the individual who has attained insight into phenomena 
              through heightened discernment, but not internal tranquillity of 
              awareness, he should approach an individual who has attained internal 
              tranquillity of awareness... and ask him, 'How should the mind be 
              steadied? How should it be made to settle down? How should it be 
              unified? How should it be concentrated?' The other will answer in line 
              with what he has seen &amp; experienced: 'The mind should be steadied in
               this way. The mind should be made to settle down in this way. The mind 
              should be unified in this way. The mind should be concentrated in this 
              way.' Then eventually he [the first] will become one who has attained 
              both internal tranquillity of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena 
              through heightened discernment.</p>
              <p>"As for the individual who has attained neither internal tranquillity
               of awareness nor insight into phenomena through heightened discernment,
               he should approach an individual who has attained both internal 
              tranquillity of awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment... and ask him, 'How should the mind be steadied?

              other will answer in line with what he has seen &amp; experienced: 'The 
              mind should be steadied in this way. The mind should be made to settle 
              down in this way. The mind should be unified in this way. The mind 
              should be concentrated in this way. Fabrications should be regarded in 
              this way. Fabrications should be investigated in this way. Fabrications 
              should be seen in this way with insight.' Then eventually he [the first]
               will become one who has attained both internal tranquillity of 
              awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through heightened discernment.</p>
              <p>"As for the individual who has attained both internal tranquillity of
               awareness &amp; insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, 
              his duty is to make an effort in establishing ('tuning') those very same
               skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the (mental) 
              fermentations.</p>
              <p>"These are four types of individuals to be found existing in the world."</p>

              <p>On one occasion <a id="ananda" name="ananda">Ven. Ananda</a> was staying in <a id="kosambi" name="kosambi">Kosambi</a>, at <a id="ghosita" name="ghosita">Ghosita's monastery</a>. There he addressed the monks, "Friends!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, friend," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>Ven. Ananda said: "Friends, whoever — monk or nun — declares the

              <p>"There is the case where a monk has developed insight preceded by

               down, and becomes unified &amp; concentrated. In him the path is born.

              <p>The sutta says you can develope samadhi before insight, insight before samadhi, or develope them together.</p>
              <p>I don't know about the last part, as it is not even clear which translation is accurate - there are two translations.</p>
              <p>One is as above, Ven Thanissaro's translation. Another one is Ven Bodhi's translation:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>one's mind becomes seized by excitation about the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Dhamma" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhamma">dhamma</a> and, as a consequence, develops serenity and abandons the <a title="Fetter (Buddhism)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetter_%28Buddhism%29">fetters</a> (<em><span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">dhamma-uddhacca-viggahitaá¹ƒ mÄ�nasaá¹ƒ hoti</span></em>).<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat_%28Buddhism%29#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat_%28Buddhism%29#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <ol class="references">
              <li id="cite_note-18"><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arhat_%28Buddhism%29#cite_ref-18">^</a></strong> Bodhi (2005), p. 268, translates this fourth way as: "a monk's mind is 
                      seized by agitation about the teaching." Thanissaro (1998) gives a 
                      seemingly contrary interpretation of: "a monk's mind has its 
                      restlessness concerning the Dhamma [Comm: the corruptions of insight] 
                      well under control." Thus, it appears possible to interpret the 
                      excitation (Pali: <em>uddhacca</em>, see <a class="external text" rel="nofollow" href="http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:3582.pali">Rhys Davids &amp; Stede, 1921–25</a>) as either something that the future arahant uses to <em>impel</em> their pursuit of the path or something that the future arahant <em>controls</em> in order to pursue the path.</li>
