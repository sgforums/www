              <p>Some random articles I'm taking from the Actual Freedom site, which I found to be good, there are many other good ones. The site owner isn't Buddhist, but his experience is clearly in line with Buddhism Anatta, and does not hold onto any notions of an Atman-Brahman which is rejected in Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Suffice to say, I do not agree with his position that all religions including Buddhism does not go beyond the 'atman-Brahman' experience/realization whether it is the pure objectless I AM or the experience of a dissociative Witness  (Thusness Stage 1) up till the unity of of Subject and Object (Thusness Stage 4) which is clearly not what the Buddha taught and has no scriptural basis. This is clearly his misunderstanding of Buddhist teachings and if anyone has any doubts just take a look at <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Experience on Spiritual Enlightenment</a> or teachings by Buddha such as the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html">Bahiya Sutta</a>, but anyway here are the articles, hope you find it useful:</p>

                              <br> </span> <br> My questioning of life, the universe and what it is to be a human being
                              had all started in a war-torn country in June 1966 at age nineteen –
                              when there was an identity inhabiting this body complete with a full
                              suite of feelings – and a Buddhist monk killed himself in a most
                              gruesome way. There was I, a callow youth dressed in a jungle-green
                              uniform and with a loaded rifle in my hand, representing the secular
                              way to peace. There was a fellow human being, dressed in religious
                              robes dowsed with petrol and with a cigarette lighter in hand,
                              representing the spiritual way to peace.
                              <br> <br> I was aghast at what we were both doing ... and I sought to find a third alternative to being either ‘human’ or ‘divine’.
                              <br> <br>This was to be the turning point of my life, for up until then, I
                              was a typical western youth, raised to believe in God, Queen and
                              Country. Humanity’s inhumanity to humanity – society’s treatment of its
                              subject citizens – was driven home to me, there and then, in a way that
                              left me appalled, horrified, terrified and repulsed to the core of my
                              being with a sick revulsion. I saw that no one knew what was going on
                              and – most importantly – that no one was ‘in charge’ of the world.
                              There was nobody to ‘save’ the human race ... all gods were but a
                              figment of a feverish imagination. Out of a despairing desperation,
                              which was collectively shared by my fellow humans, I saw and understood
                              that I was as ‘guilty’ as any one else. For in me – as is in everyone –
                              was both ‘good’ and ‘bad’ ... it was that some people were better than
                              others at controlling their ‘dark side’. However, in a war, there is no
                              way anyone can consistently control any longer ... ‘evil’ ran rampart.
                              I saw that fear and aggression and nurture and desire ruled the world
                              ... and that these were instincts one was born with. Thus started my
                              search for freedom from the ‘Human Condition’ ... and my attitude, all
                              those years ago was this:
                              <br> <br> I was only interested in changing myself fundamentally, radically, completely and utterly.
                              <br> <br> (Click <a href="http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/june1966.htm">http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/june1966.htm</a> to view picture).</p>
              <p><br> This photograph was taken the day after the Buddhist monk physically self-immolated in protest to the war I was engaged in.
                              <br> <br>What the newly-shaved head indicates (definitely not a common
                              practice for a 19-year-old youth in the sixties generation) is the very
                              aghastness at what we were both doing.
                              <br> <br> <br>For many years I sought genuine exploration and discovery of what
                              it means to live a fully human life, and in October 1992 I discovered,
                              once and for all, what I was looking for. Since then I have been
                              consistently living an incomparable condition which I choose to call
                              actual freedom – and I use the word ‘actual’ because this freedom is
                              located here in this very world, this actual world of the senses. It is
                              not an affective, cerebral or psychic state of being; it is a physical
                              condition that ensues when one goes beyond Spiritual Enlightenment. In
                              September 1981 I underwent a monumental transformation into an Altered
                              State Of Consciousness which can only be described as Spiritual
                              Enlightenment. I became Enlightened as the result of an earnest and
                              intense process which commenced in the January of that year. At
                              approximately six o’clock on the morning of Sunday the sixth of
                              September 1981, my ‘ego’ disappeared entirely in an edifying moment of
                              awakening to an ‘Absolute Reality’. I lived in the Enlightened State
                              for eleven years, so I have an intimate understanding of the marked
                              difference between Spiritual Enlightenment and actual freedom.
                              <br> <br>I travelled the country – and overseas to India – meeting with
                              people from all walks of life in an attempt to discover why Spiritual
                              Enlightenment, which has been within the human experience for thousands
                              of years, had not delivered the Peace On Earth it seemed to promise. As
                              the process of becoming Enlightened is an extreme test of one’s mettle,
                              requiring nerves of steel, it seemed that only a rare few humans were
                              destined to become Self-Realised. The question that commanded my
                              attention was why this was so. I was looking beyond the superficial and
                              questioning even the most closely held ideas and beliefs. Was there
                              something more to discover ... something that lay beyond Enlightenment
                              that would usher in the beginning of a genuine possibility of peace for
                              all? Some Masters hinted at and alluded to ‘Going Beyond Enlightenment’
                              ... yet their Teachings remained exactly the same. Some disciplines
                              suggested that such a condition existed after physical death: when the
                              soul ‘quit the body’. The Hindu Mahasamadhi and Buddhist Parinirvana
                              are two examples of this kind of thought.
                              <br> <br>Over the eleven years I had numerous experiences of a condition
                              that seemed so extreme that one must surely die to attain to it. To go
                              beyond Enlightenment seemed to be an impossibility whilst still alive
                              and breathing. Then at midday on Friday the thirtieth of October 1992 a
                              curious event occurred, due to my intense conviction that it was
                              imperative that someone evince a final and complete condition that
                              would ‘deliver the goods’ so longed for by humanity for millennia. Just
                              like my ego had dissolved, back in 1981, my ‘soul’ disappeared. I was
                              no longer a ‘Self’ existing for all Eternity and transcending Time and
                              Space. I no longer had a feeling of being – or ‘Being’ – and I could no
                              longer detect the presence of The Absolute. There was no ‘Presence’ at
                              all. Since that date I have continued to live in a condition of
                              complete emancipation and utter autonomy ... the condition is both
                              permanent and actual. This is different from Enlightenment in that it
                              is most definitely substantial: there is no longer a transcendence, for
                              I have neither sorrow nor malice anywhere at all to rise above.
                              <br> <br>They have vanished entirely, leaving me both blithesome and benign
                              – carefree and harmless – which leads to a most remarkable state of
                              affairs. The chief characteristics of Enlightenment – The Presence of
                              The Absolute, Union with the Divine, Universal Compassion, Love Agapé,
                              Rapturous Bliss, Ineffable Ecstasy, Exalted Euphoria, The Truth,
                              Timelessness, Spacelessness, Immortality, Aloneness, Oneness, Pacifism,
                              Surrender, Trust, Beauty, and Goodness – being redundant in this
                              totally new condition, are no longer extant. Herein lies the
                              unmistakable distinction between this condition, which I call actual
                              freedom and the Enlightened State: I am no longer driven by a Divine
                              Sense Of Mission to bring The Truth, Universal Love and Divine
                              Compassion to the world. I am free to speak with whomsoever is
                              genuinely interested in solving the ‘Mystery of Life’ and becoming
                              totally free of the Human Condition.
                              <br> <br>Thus, after The Altered State Of Consciousness has manifested
                              itself, the soul is still present as ‘The Self’. No matter how
                              Enlightened or Liberated one may be, an ‘I’ is still in existence ...
                              Timeless maybe, but still an ‘I’, still in the body. The soul, as ‘The
                              Self’, is a psychological entity identifying as being an Enlightened
                              Master. The ego is only half of one’s identity; the other half is the
                              soul. When the ego dies, one has dispelled an illusion – the illusion
                              of a personal self – only to wind up living in a delusion – the
                              delusion of an impersonal Self. To take oneself to be ‘The Self’, the
                              ‘Immortal Soul’, ‘The Supreme’, ‘The Absolute’, or ‘God On Earth’, is
                              nothing short of institutionalised insanity. The delusion must be
                              dispelled in order to be actually free: along with the ‘death of the
                              ego’ there must be a corresponding ‘death of the soul’. Then ‘I’ – the
                              self or ‘The Self’ – do not exist, psychologically speaking, in any way
                              at all. Then the Eternal Present also vanishes – along with all that
                              other capitalised nonsense. Surpassing the Altered State Of
                              Consciousness is the third alternative ... an actual freedom.
                              <br> <br>Spiritual Enlightenment has been around for some thousands of years
                              ... and there is still no peace on earth. Nowadays I know,
                              experientially, why Enlightenment does not deliver the goods ... and,
                              of course, I now know what does. I am not an ‘Enlightened Master’
                              sitting in an exalted position ... and what a relief that is. I am a
                              fellow human being, who happens to live in a condition of perfection
                              and purity, offering my experience to whomsoever is interested. We are
                              all fellow human beings who find ourselves here in the world as it was
                              when we were born. We find war, murder, torture, rape, domestic
                              violence and corruption to be endemic ... we notice that it is
                              intrinsic to the human condition ... we set out to discover why this is
                              so. We find sadness, loneliness, sorrow, grief, depression and suicide
                              to be a global incidence – we gather that it is also inherent to the
                              human condition – and we want to know why. We all report to each other
                              as to the nature of our discoveries for we are all well-meaning and
                              seek to find a way out of this mess that we have landed in. Whether one
                              believes in re-incarnation or not, we are all living this particular
                              life for the very first time, and we wish to make sense of it. It is a
                              challenge and the adventure of a life-time to enquire and to uncover,
                              to seek and to find, to explore and to discover. All this being alive
                              business is actually happening and we are totally involved in living it
                              out ... whether we take the back seat or not, we are all still doing
                              it.
                              <br> <br>In spite of the fact that every single human being has had at least
                              one pure consciousness experience (PCE) – and usually more – in their
                              lifetime, they somehow can not differentiate between that peak
                              experience of apperception (wherein ‘I’, the thought and felt ‘being’,
                              temporarily quits the scene and the actual world becomes apparent) and
                              their pre-conceived notions that everyday reality is an illusion
                              disguising some metaphysical ‘Greater Reality’. The Glamour and the
                              Glory and the Glitz of the Altered State Of Consciousness has a
                              tenacious grip upon the minds and hearts of a benighted humanity. It is
                              indeed strange, to the point of being bizarre, that so many persons
                              will turn their backs on the purity of the perfection of being here –
                              of being alive – at this moment in time. Here in this actual world,
                              which is where this flesh and blood body is living anyway, is the peace
                              that everyone says they are searching for. All that is required is that
                              one comes to one’s senses – both literally and metaphorically – and
                              spend the rest of one’s life without malice and sorrow. One will then
                              be blithe and benign.
                              <br> <br>It is, of course, a bold step to forsake lofty thoughts, profound
                              feelings and psychic adumbrations and enter into the actuality of life
                              as a sensate experience. It requires a startling audacity to devote
                              oneself to the task of causing a mutation of consciousness to occur. To
                              have the requisite determination to apply oneself, with the diligence
                              and perseverance born out of pure intent, to the patient dismantling of
                              one’s accrued social identity indicates a strength of purpose
                              unequalled in the annals of history. It is no little thing that one
                              does ... and it has enormous consequences, not only for one’s own
                              well-being, but for humankind as a whole. With an actualism spread like
                              a chain-letter, in the due course of time, global freedom would
                              revolutionise the concept of humanity. It would be a free association
                              of peoples world-wide; a utopian-like loose-knit affiliation of
                              like-minded individuals. One would be a citizen of the world, not of a
                              sovereign state. Countries, with their artificial borders would vanish
                              along with the need for the military. As nationalism would expire, so
                              too would patriotism with all its heroic evils. No police force would
                              be needed anywhere on earth; no locks on the doors, no bars on the
                              windows. Gaols, judges and juries would become a thing of the dreadful
                              past ... terror would stalk its prey no more. People would live
                              together in peace and harmony, happiness and delight. Pollution and its
                              cause – over-population – would be set to rights without effort, as
                              competition would be replaced by cooperation. It would be the stuff of
                              all the pipe-dreams come true.
                              <br> <br>But none of this matters much when one is already living freely in
                              the actual world. In actual freedom, life is experienced as being
                              perfect as-it-is here on earth. One knows that one is living in a
                              beneficent and benevolent universe – and that is what actually counts.
                              The self-imposed iniquities that ail the people who stubbornly wish to
                              remain denizens of the real world, fail to impinge upon the blitheness
                              and benignity of one who lives in the vast scheme of things. The
                              universe does not force anyone to be happy and harmless, to live in
                              peace and ease, to be free of sorrow and malice. It is a matter of
                              personal choice as to which way one will travel. Human beings, being as
                              they are, will probably continue to tread the ‘tried and true’ paths,
                              little realising that they are the tried and failed ways. There is none
                              so contumacious as a self-righteous soul who is convinced that they
                              know the way to live as revealed in their ancient and revered
                              scriptures ... or in their much-prized secular philosophies and
                              psychologies. So be it.
                              <br> <br>I live in peace and tranquillity, beholden to none. With no loyalty
                              to bind me, I have nothing to defend. With nothing to defend I have no
                              need to attack. I have no sense of mission to ‘change the world’. I am
                              not driven by mystical forces to evangelise, to proselytise, to
                              convert. If anyone is genuinely interested in finding out what the
                              reason for their existence is, I am only too happy to participate in
                              their enquiry. Nevertheless, I can only help those who wish to be
                              helped in the only way that I can help. I am free to be here in the
                              world as-it-is. Unadorned and unencumbered, I can stand on my own two
                              feet, owing allegiance to no-one and nothing at all. I am supremely
                              content with life as-it-is, for perfection can be found in what others
                              call imperfection ... and I have no desire to change anything. To be
                              here, intimately here in this moment in time, where this actual world
                              is such a marvellous place to be alive in, is a satisfaction and
                              fulfilment unparalleled in the chronicles of antiquity.
                              <br> <br>Actual intimacy – being here now – does not come from love and
                              compassion, for the affective states of being stem from separation. The
                              illusion of intimacy that love and compassion produces is but a meagre
                              imitation of the direct experience of the actual. In the actual world,
                              ‘I’ as ego, the personality, and ‘me’ as soul, the ‘being’ – both
                              subjectively experienced as one’s identity – have ceased to exist;
                              whereas love and compassion accentuates, endorses and verifies ‘me’ as
                              being real. And while ‘I’ am real, ‘I’ am relative to other similarly
                              afflicted persons; vying for position and status in order to establish
                              ‘my’ credentials ... to verify ‘my’ very existence. To be actually
                              intimate is to be without the separative identity ... and therefore
                              free from the need for love and compassion with their ever un-filled
                              promise of Peace On Earth. There is an actual intimacy between me and
                              everyone and everything ... actual intimacy is a direct experiencing of
                              the other as-they-are. I am having a superb time ... and it is a
                              well-earned superb time, too. Nothing has come without application –
                              apart from serendipitous discoveries because of pure intent – and I am
                              reaping the rewards which are plentiful and deliciously satisfying.
                              Actual intimacy frees one up to a world of factual splendour, based
                              firmly upon sensate and sensual delight. The candid and unabashed
                              sensorial enjoyment of being this body in the world around is such a
                              luscious and immediate experience, that the tantalising but
                              ever-elusive promise of the mystique of love and compassion has faded
                              into the oblivion it deserves.
                              <br> <br>The search for meaning amidst the debris of the much-vaunted human
                              hopes and dreams and schemes has come to its timely end. With the end
                              of ‘me’, the distance or separation between ‘me’ and ‘my’ senses – and
                              thus the external world – disappears. To be the senses as a bare
                              awareness is apperception, a pure consciousness experience of the world
                              as-it-is. Because there is no ‘I’ as an observer – a little person
                              inside one’s head – to have sensations, I am the sensations. There is
                              nothing except the series of sensations which happen ... not to ‘me’
                              but just happening ... moment by moment ... one after another. To be
                              the sensations, as distinct from having them, engenders the most
                              astonishing sense of freedom and release. Consequently, I am living in
                              peace and tranquillity; a meaningful peace and tranquillity. Life is
                              intrinsically purposeful, the reason for existence lies openly all
                              around. Being in this very air I live in, I am constantly aware of it;
                              I breathe it in and out; I see it, I hear it, I taste it, I smell it, I
                              touch it, all of the time. It never goes away – nor has it ever been
                              away. ‘I’ was standing in the way of meaning.
                              <br> <br> This is an actual freedom. It is possible to be actually free, here on earth, as this body, in this life-time.

                              <br> <br> Description Of Becoming Enlightened
                              <br> </span> <br>In 1980 I had a peak experience wherein I saw that everything was
                              already perfect as-it-is and that ‘I’, the psychological entity, was
                              standing in the way ... and no-one else was preventing me from
                              achieving the ultimate goal of being a human. In that peak experience I
                              saw ‘myself’. ‘I’ was the end product of society and nothing more. ‘I’
                              was an emotional construct of all of the beliefs, values, moral,
                              ethics, mores, customs, traditions, doctrines, ideologies and so on.
              
                              ‘I’ was nothing but an emotional-mental fabrication ... a sense of
                              identity with its conscience. I also saw that ‘I’ was a lost, lonely,
                              frightened – and a very, very cunning – entity. Just as those
                              Christians who are said to be possessed by an evil entity and need to
                              be exorcised, I saw that every human being had been endowed with a
                              social entity ... and it was called being normal. To say that I was
                              amazed rather fails to adequately describe the feeling of relief that
                              after all there was a solution to the human situation here on earth. I
                              was ecstatic.
                              <br> <br>That proved to be my undoing – as far as actual freedom is
                              concerned. Ecstasy led to euphoria and euphoria led to bliss. In the
                              blissful state I manifested and became Love Agapé which led to an
                              emanation of Divine Compassion for all living beings who were suffering
                              and in sorrow by virtue of the fact that they were ignorant of the
                              Divine Order of things ... for an Absolute had been revealed to me in
                              that Love and Compassion – it was that Love Agapé and Divine Compassion
                              – and I had been chosen to bring this self-same Love and Compassion to
                              earth. I was to go through a process, when I returned to normal, that
                              would result in my being well-prepared to usher in this new age of
                              peace and prosperity to all humankind. As this revelation continued, I
                              saw a new ‘me’ coming into existence ... a grand ‘Me’, a glorious ‘Me’
                              and a spiritually fulfilling ‘Me’. I was the Saviour Of Humankind!
                              <br> <br>(As all this was happening, a passing thought occurred to me, which
                              was briefly contemplated ... then banished: Who or what was it that was
                              observing these two ‘me’s – the social ‘me’ and the grand ‘Me’? This
                              trifling question was to be of immense benefit years later when I
                              realised that I was living in a delusion and that there was an actual
                              freedom lying beyond ... but I jump ahead of myself).
                              <br> <br>Three nights later I had a similar experience and what I had
                              witnessed on the first revelation was confirmed. Then nothing untoward
                              happened for the next five months – this had been in late July 1980 –
                              until on the first day of January in 1981 when I began a ‘process’ that
                              was to last for nine months, culminating in my Divine Awakening on that
                              September morning. The ‘process’ was both prosaic and extraordinary: on
                              the one hand I began undoing all the social conditioning that I had
                              been subject to since birth and on the other hand I generated love for
                              all and sundry. I examined all the social traditions and customs etc.,
                              one by one, and released myself from their iron grip. I diminished hate
                              and anger and sadness and loneliness by surrendering to and living in
                              love and oneness ... which is the best that a normal human could do by
                              virtue of the socialisation process. I moved in and out of Sacred
                              States of Heavenly Bliss and Love Agapé and Divine Compassion and
                              immersed myself in the entire ‘process’ with dedication and resolution.
                              I adopted the principle of pacifism (‘turn the other cheek’) and
                              developed Goodness of the highest order. I cleansed and purified myself
                              of all impure thoughts and deeds and worked both hard and industriously
                              in my daily work. I practised honesty and humility in all my
                              interactions with other people and pondered the significance and
                              ramifications of the Divine Order.
                              <br> <br>I totally believed in and had supreme faith in The Absolute and its
                              ability to bring about the Peace On Earth so long promised. That I was
                              to play the central role in this Divine Plan no longer came as a
                              surprise to me, as I began to realise that I had long yearned to be
                              part of the Salvation Process. I understood that I had to die and be
                              reborn and, consequently, went into a catatonic state that resulted in
                              my being carted off to hospital and kept under intensive care for four
                              hours until I came out of it. I was never to be the same again, as
                              Divinity had been working on me whilst I was catatonic and from that
                              date forward I was permanently in a state of human bliss and love ... I
                              could do no wrong. About six weeks prior to the sixth of September 1981
                              I had a revelation that I was going to really die this time, not become
                              catatonic again, and that I was to prepare myself for it. I mustered
                              all of my faith and resolution, renewed all of my trust and dedication,
                              and awaited the day. The night before I could hardly maintain myself as
                              a thinking, functioning human being as a blistering hot and cold
                              burning sensation crept up the back of my spine and entered into the
                              base of my neck just under the brain itself. I went to bed in
                              desperation and frustration at my apparent inability to be good enough
                              to carry this ‘process’ through to its supreme conclusion.
                              <br> <br>The next morning I awoke and all was calm and quiet. Expressing
                              relief at the cessation of the intensifying ‘process’ that had reached
                              an unbearable level the night before, I lay back on my pillows to watch
                              the rising sun (my bedroom faced east) through the large bedroom
                              windows. All of a sudden I was gripped with the realisation that this
                              was the moment! I was going to die! An intense fear raced throughout my
                              body, rising in crescendo until I could scarcely take any more. As it
                              reached a peak of stark terror, I realised that I had nothing to worry
                              about and that I was to go with the ‘process’. In an instant all fear
                              left me and I travelled deep into the depths of my very being. All of a
                              sudden I was sitting bolt upright, laughing, as I realised that this
                              that was IT! was such a simple thing ... all I had to do was die ...
                              and that was the easiest thing in the world to do. Then the thought of
                              leaving my family and friends overwhelmed me and I was thrust back on
                              the bed sobbing. Then I was bolt upright once more laughing my head off
                              ... then I was back on the pillows sobbing my heart out ... upright,
                              laughing ... pillows sobbing ... upright laughing ... pillows sobbing.
                              At the fifth or sixth time something turned over in the base of my
                              brain – in the top of the brain-stem. I likened it to turning over a
                              L.P. record in order to play the other side ... with the vital
                              exception that it would never, ever turn back again.
                              <br> <br>It was over. I had arrived. I had become Awakened to the Greater
                              Reality. I was Love Agapé and Divine Compassion ... there was no
                              separation between me and The Absolute. I had a Divine Sense of Mission
                              to spread The Word and I embarked on fulfilling my Sacred Duty,
                              gathering some disciples on the way, until 1984. Then I started to
                              question just what I was doing and just what had happened to me.
                              Something seemed to be wrong ... this had all been done before by other
                              Masters and Messiahs, Saints and Sages, Avatars and Saviours, to no
                              avail. In fact, instead of bringing Love and Peace, they had left in
                              their wake much bloodshed and hatred ... and I was one of them!
                              Accordingly I travelled to India to find out for myself exactly what
                              was amiss with this whole Enlightenment business by meeting some of
                              these hallowed Gurus and imbibing the centuries of Eastern Spiritual
                              Tradition for myself, instead of merely reading about it in books.
                              <br> <br>It was to take me eleven years to get out of this massive delusion
                              I was living in and go beyond it to arrive at where I am today. It was
                              eleven years of coming to terms with the understanding that what I was
                              living was a massive delusion of grandeur ... and that it was what
                              every human being believed in, in some way, shape or form ... but that
                              is another story. Today, I am no longer an Enlightened Master living in
                              an Exalted State of Being ... I am me-as-this-body only, a fellow human
                              being who has no sorrow or malice whatsoever to transcend; hence I am
                              both happy and harmless. I am what I was on that fateful night in 1980
                              when I asked the question: ‘Who or what was it that was observing these
                              two ‘me’s – the social ‘me’ and the grand ‘Me’?’ I am these sense
                              organs in operation: this seeing is me, this hearing is me, this
                              tasting is me, this touching is me, this smelling is me, and this
                              thinking is me. Whereas ‘I’, the identity, am inside the body: looking
                              out through ‘my’ eyes as if looking out through a window, listening
                              through ‘my’ ears as if they were microphones, tasting through ‘my’
                              tongue, touching through ‘my’ skin, smelling through ‘my’ nose, and
                              thinking through ‘my’ brain. Of course ‘I’ must feel isolated,
                              alienated, alone and lonely, for ‘I’ am cut off from the magnificence
                              of the actual world ... the world as-it-is ... by ‘my’ very presence.
                              <br> <br> Any identity whatsoever is a delusion.

                              <br> <br> Description Of A ‘Glimpse’ Of Actual Freedom
                              <br> </span> <br>I was coming to the end of a time I went through in an endeavour to
                              purify myself which I call my ‘puritan period’. I retreated altogether
                              from civilisation to a group of uninhabited islands in the tropics off
                              the north-eastern Australian seaboard where I stayed for the best part
                              of three months in total silence, on my own, speaking to no one at all
                              and moving from island to island at whim. I had whittled my worldly
                              possessions down to three sarongs, three shirts, a cooking pot and
                              bowl, a knife and a spoon, a bank book and a pair of nail scissors ...
                              I was homeless, itinerant, celibate, vegan, (no spices; not even salt
                              and pepper), no drugs (no tobacco, no alcohol; not even tea or coffee),
                              no hair cut, no shaving, no washing other than a dip in a river or the
                              ocean. I possessed nothing else anywhere in the world and had cut all
                              family ties ... whatever I could eliminate from my life that was an
                              encumbrance and an attachment, I had let go of. In other words:
                              whatever was traditionally seen as an impediment to freedom I
                              discarded. It was there I finally discovered that it was ‘Spiritual
                              Enlightenment’ which was at fault and that I could ‘purify’ myself via
                              these ‘Tried and True’ means until the cows came home ... to no avail.
                              <br> <br>I was already in an Altered State Of Consciousness (this was in
                              1985 and my ego had dissolved in 1981) and living in what has been
                              described as the ‘Unknown’. I had had some serious reservations about
                              the validity of this as an ultimate state and had been to India the
                              previous year to see if I could ascertain why. My discoveries there had
                              led me to consider the possibility that Enlightenment was not the final
                              stage, so I was ripe and ready to plunge into the ‘Unknowable’. I was
                              able to experience what lay beyond Enlightenment several times ... the
                              first of these experiences occurred at maybe three in the morning (I
                              had no watch) and was accompanied by a sense of dread the likes of
                              which I had never experienced even in a war-zone – made all the more
                              acute because I had not experienced fear for four years (I was living
                              in a state of Divine Compassion and Love Agapé which protected me from
                              malice and the underlying fear). This dread contained the existential
                              angst of discovering that ‘I’ was nothing but a contingent ‘being’ and
                              that ‘I’ would cease to ‘be’. Then the condition I went on to
                              experience had the character of the ‘Great Beyond’ – which I
                              deliberately put in capitals because that is how it was experienced at
                              the time – and it was of the nature of being ‘That’ which is attained
                              to at physical death when an Enlightened One ‘quits the body’ ... which
                              attainment is known as ‘Mahasamadhi’ (Hinduism) or ‘Parinirvana’
                              (Buddhism) and so on.
                              <br> <br> It seemed so extreme that the physical body must surely die for the attainment of it.
                              <br> <br>To put it into a physical analogy, it was as if I were to gather up
                              my meagre belongings, eradicate all marks of my stay on the island, and
                              paddle away over the horizon, all the while not knowing whence I go ...
                              and vanish without a trace, never to be seen again. As no one on the
                              mainland knew where I was, no one would know where I had gone. In fact,
                              I would become as extinct as the dodo and with no skeletal remains. The
                              autological self by whatever name would cease to ‘be’, there would be
                              no ‘spirit’, no ‘presence’, no ‘being’ at all. This was more than death
                              of the ego, which is a major event by any definition; this was total
                              annihilation. No ego, no soul – no self, no Self – no more Heavenly
                              Rapture, Love Agapé, Divine Bliss and so on. Only oblivion. It was not
                              at all attractive, not at all alluring, not at all desirable ... yet I
                              knew I was going to do it, sooner or later, because it was the ultimate
                              condition and herein lay the secret to the ‘Mystery of Life’.
                              <br> <br>The ‘death of the ego’ is only for the orthodox-minded people; it
                              is for those who are easily seduced by the Glamour and the Glory and
                              the Glitz of the much-touted Altered State. This is why pure intent is
                              an essential prerequisite to ensure a guaranteed passage through the
                              psychic maze. With pure intent one will not rest until one has gone all
                              the way. One will not be bewitched by the psychic Power and Authority,
                              either. All these allurements are but welcome food for the cunning
                              entity, which wanting only its own survival, readily sublimates itself
                              into The Spirit. With the clarity born of pure intent one can see this
                              play for what it is and move on freely and willingly to what lies at
                              the end of the wide and wondrous path ... the end of ‘being’. With pure
                              intent one will not settle for second best, for it has been seen in the
                              peak experiences that the very best is possible, here on earth. One
                              sees that ‘I’ must disappear entirely. There will be no transcendence,
                              no transmutation, no metamorphosis ... not any of these. For one who
                              goes all the way, no phoenix will exist to arise from the ashes –
                              nothing Metaphysical will remain. There will be no ‘being’ at all. ‘I’
                              will become extinct.
                              <br> <br>I use the word extinct deliberately for it carries a definitive
                              meaning. Physically, death is the end of an individual member of the
                              species, whilst extinction is the ending of the species itself. The
                              psychological annihilation of ‘I’ – in its entirety – is the
                              psychological ending of the species known as ‘humanity’. It is the end
                              of ‘being’ and the end of an illusion. It is also the end of ‘Being’
                              and the end of delusion. The Human Condition, with all its appalling
                              sorrow and malice, can come to an end. All those would-be wise people
                              who state: ‘You can’t change human nature’ are, fortunately, wrong.
                              Because it is possible for ‘me’ to become extinct, thereby releasing
                              the body from the ‘being’ within, I can walk freely in the world
                              as-it-is ... this actual world. I, as this body only, can live in that
                              perfect purity twenty-four-hours-a-day. I can live in a state of
                              benignity, which means a kindly and harmless disposition. Life is a
                              sincere and yet playful game and one is then free to enjoy it all,
                              every moment again.
                              <br> <br>‘Humanity’, which gave birth to ‘me’, is being sustained by ‘me’
                              remaining as a ‘being’. ‘I’ am forever fettered by the Human Condition.
                              The species known as ‘humanity’ has searched for an Ultimate Fulfilment
                              within the arena of the Human Condition for all of history. Such a
                              search is endless and futile, for it is a search within an illusion.
                              Only further illusions – further states of ‘being’ – can be found there
                              ... or delusions. Becoming Divine is a delusion – a state of ‘Being’
                              that is actually an insult to intelligence. ‘I’ will never find the
                              ultimate fulfilment for ‘I’ am standing in the way of the ‘Mystery of
                              Life’ being revealed. There is no way out, ‘I’ am doomed. ‘I’ must,
                              inevitably, cease to ‘be’. Instead of bemoaning ‘my’ fate and vainly
                              searching for an escape, ‘I’ can see ‘myself’ for what ‘I’ am. This
                              seeing is the beginning of the ending of ‘me’. The extinction of ‘me’
                              is the ultimate sacrifice ‘I’ can make to ensure the possibility of
                              peace-on-earth for not only me but for all humankind.
                              <br> <br> Ultimate fulfilment lies beyond extinction.

                              <br> <br> Description Of Becoming Actually Free</span> <br> <br>In late September 1992 a woman, who had been coming to see me on
                              and off for some time, earnestly asked that she be taken on as a
                              disciple ... she seriously wished me to be her master. I was astounded,
                              for I had been at pains to explain that I was not interested in being
                              anyone’s master, for I considered the entire system of the
                              master-disciple relationship, with its attendant surrender, trust,
                              worship and obedience, to be not only insidious, but pernicious as in
                              regards to another person’s freedom. I declined, of course, yet I had
                              to question just what I was ‘putting out’ to people to precipitate such
                              a request. What was my part in all this? What was I doing – indeed what
                              was I being – to encourage another to consider taking this step? I had
                              been dismantling various aspects of the make-up of the Altered State Of
                              Consciousness that I was living in – a state of Spiritual Enlightenment
                              that I called Absolute Freedom – and had thought myself to be virtually
                              free of all that hocus-pocus that goes on in the name of freedom. I
                              asked myself what turned out to be a seminal question:
                              <br> <br> ‘What am I in relation to other people?’
                              <br> <br>I asked the question in such a way so that I would not get a
                              carefully thought-out and reasoned answer. I wanted an experiential
                              result – and I kept the question burning in the depths of my psyche,
                              discarding any intellectual answers that inevitably popped-up in the
                              course of the next five or six weeks. It troubled me deeply that I was
                              in such a situation because I seem to be driven by some force to
                              ‘Spread the Word’ and that was never my intention all those years ago
                              when I first had what is known as a ‘Peak Experience’ which initiated
                              my incursion into all matters Spiritual, culminating in the ‘death’ of
                              my ego and catapulting me into this Absolute State. My intent back then
                              had been to cleanse myself of all that is detrimental to personal
                              happiness and interpersonal harmony ... in other words: Peace on earth
                              in my life-time. Instead of that rather simple ambition, I found that I
                              was impelled on an odyssey to be the latest Saviour of Humankind in a
                              long list of Enlightened Beings ... and this imposition did not sit
                              well with me, as they have all failed in their Divine Work. After
                              something like five thousand years of recorded history, humanity is
                              nowhere nearer to Peace On Earth than before. Indeed, instead of the
                              much-touted Love and Peace, much Hatred and Bloodshed has followed in
                              their wake. This abysmal fate is something I wish to avoid repeating,
                              whatever the personal cost in terms of losing this much-prized State Of
                              Being. My diagnosis was simple: if I were driven by some force – no
                              matter how Good that force be – then I am not actually free.
                              <br> <br>Then in the late afternoon of the day before Friday the thirtieth
                              of of October 1992, whilst out in an abandoned cow-paddock planting
                              tree seedlings, I was struck by the curious fact that at the beginning
                              of my life I had been engaged in chopping down trees to turn the land
                              into cow-pasture. Now the needs of the situation were sharply reversed
                              and so I paused in my task and stood erect, looking about me in this
                              little sub-tropical valley that the ex-dairy farm was nestled in. As I
                              looked I idly mused upon the irony that the change in human needs
                              regarding physical survival had wrought such radical transformation in
                              the attitudes toward the environment during the forty five years I had
                              been upon this planet. In a flash of a moment a vast understanding of
                              the enormity of the Human Condition transfigured my comfortable
                              comprehension of what it was to be an Enlightened Master ... a
                              Self-Realised Being. My entire affective and cognitive configuration –
                              my highly prized state of awareness – was seen at a glance to be
                              nothing more than a passionate mental construct. In other words, my
                              world fell apart.
                              <br> <br>I entered into a repeat of what I had first experienced on an
                              uninhabited island some seven years previously and nervousness and
                              apprehension mounted to a fear that moved rapidly through terror and
                              horror to the dread that I knew so well from long ago. This was what my
                              seminal question had produced and, turning weak at the knees, I sank to
                              the ground ... to no avail. I could not escape my destiny, for I was
                              situated in a living nightmare of what I swiftly came to see was
                              nothing short of institutionalised insanity. Any altered state of
                              consciousness was a delusion born out of the illusion of self ... but
                              only because of humankind’s ignorance. It is truly dreadful to be
                              trapped in a massive delusion for eleven years, unable to find any way
                              out and knowing that no other human being can help, for the altered
                              state has been held up for millennia as being the Summum Bonum of human
                              existence. All the literature on the subject praised the state of
                              consciousness I was in (Enlightenment, Illumination, Moksha, Samadhi,
                              Satori, Nirvana, Sunyata and so on) and yet I just knew it was a mirage
                              that I was living.
                              <br> <br>I had no choice but to retire to my bed for a sleepless night of
                              frozen immobility ... which continued throughout the morning of the
                              next day. I knew that I would – I must – proceed, but how could I be
                              right and all those ‘great’ and revered masters be wrong? Who was I, a
                              mere boy from the farm, to set himself up to be the ultimate arbiter of
                              human experience? The agonizing doubt was virtually unbearable ... I
                              would not wish this upon anyone ... I would want no one to follow in my
                              footsteps, for I had to run the full gamut of dread to break through to
                              what lay beyond the deception. I realised, at about nine in the
                              morning, that eleven years ago I had inadvertently surrendered my will
                              to a god ... the ‘Absolute’ that I cunningly considered to be ‘That
                              Which Lay Beyond’ had turned out to be Divinity in disguise. I took
                              myself up the hill into a pine plantation that I particularly favoured
                              as a contemplative place and spent an hour and a half digging deep into
                              my psyche to regain my ‘surrender’ ... to get my autonomy back. With a
                              shaky will somewhat in place I returned to my home and, mounting the
                              verandah steps, collapsed in a heap on the bare boards. Unable to move,
                              to think or to feel I could but lie there as my very soul fell away. It
                              was about midday when the process was over and I came to my senses –
                              both figuratively and literally. For along with the dissolution of my
                              soul, my feelings – my emotions and passions – disappeared, never to
                              return. My psyche disintegrated and the second ‘I’ died ... ‘I’ became
                              extinct.
                              <br> <br>The Altered State needs to be talked about and exposed for what it
                              is so that nobody need venture up that blind alley ever again. There is
                              another way and another goal. The main trouble with the Altered State
                              is that whilst the ego dissolves, the identity and soul remain intact.
                              No longer identifying as a personal ego-bound identity, one then
                              identifies as an impersonal soul-bound identity – ‘I am That’, ‘I am
                              God’, ‘I am The Supreme’, ‘I am The Absolute’ and so on. This is the
                              delusion, the mirage, the deception ... and it is extremely difficult
                              to see it for oneself, for one is in an august state. This second
                              identity – the second ‘I’ of Mr. Venkataraman Ramana fame – is a
                              difficult one to shake, maybe more difficult than the first; for who is
                              brave enough to voluntarily give up fame and fortune, reverence and
                              worship, status and security? One has to be scrupulously honest with
                              oneself to go all the way and no longer be a someone, a somebody of
                              importance. One faces extinction; ‘I’ will cease to be, there will be
                              no ‘being’ whatsoever, no ‘presence’ at all. It is impossible to
                              imagine, not only the complete and utter cessation of ‘me’ in ‘my’
                              entirety, but the end of any ‘Ultimate Being’ or ‘Absolute Presence’ in
                              any way, shape or form. It means that no one or no thing is in charge
                              of the universe ... that there is no ‘Ultimate Authority’. It means
                              that all values are but human values, with no absolute values at all to
                              fall back upon. It is impossible for ‘me’ to conceive that without a
                              wayward ‘me’ there is no need for any values whatsoever ... or an
                              ‘Ultimate Authority’.
                              <br> <br>Thus I find myself here, in the world as-it-is. A vast stillness
                              lies all around, a perfection that is abounding with purity.
                              Beneficence, an active kindness, overflows in all directions, imbuing
                              everything with unimaginable fairytale-like quality. For me to be able
                              to be here at all is a blessing that only ‘I’ could grant, because
                              nobody else could do it for me. I am full of admiration for the ‘me’
                              that dared to do such a thing. I owe all that I experience now to ‘me’.
                              I salute ‘my’ audacity. And what an adventure it was ... and still is.
                              These are the wondrous workings of the exquisite nature of life – who
                              would have it any other way?
                              <br> <br> I am this infinite and eternal universe experiencing itself as a reflective, sensate human being.

              <p><a href="http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/default.htm">http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/default.htm</a> <br> <br> This Web Page is for anyone sufficiently motivated to explore into just
              what constitutes the Human Condition. It is about what one human being
              searched for in his own life and the discoveries he has made ... and
              what other peoples have done about ameliorating their present
              situation. All the articles on these pages should be sufficiently
              challenging to stimulate, inspire and initiate some preliminary
              investigation and discussion and, although the articles are
              specifically of interest to the spiritual aspirant who wishes to
              further their search into the area that lies beyond enlightenment (and
              any other form of an altered state of consciousness), the general tone
              of the text will be of immense appeal to any one interested in all
              matters pertaining to consciousness studies.
              <br> <br>We are all fellow human beings who find ourselves here in the world
              as it was when we were born. We find war, murder, torture, rape,
              domestic violence and corruption to be endemic – we notice that it is
              intrinsic to the human condition – and we set out to discover why this
              is so. We find sadness, loneliness, sorrow, grief, depression and
              suicide to be a global incidence – we gather that it is also inherent
              to the human condition – and we want to know why. We all report to each
              other as to the nature of our discoveries for we are all well-meaning
              and seek to find a way out of this mess that we have landed in. Whether
              one believes in re-incarnation or not, we are all living this
              particular life for the very first time, and we wish to make sense of
              it. It is a challenge and the adventure of a life-time to enquire and
              to uncover, to seek and to find, to explore and to discover. All this
              being alive business is actually happening and we are totally involved
              in living it out ... whether we take the back seat or not, we are all
              still doing it.
              <br> <br>I, for one, am not taking the back seat ... because it is indeed
              possible for any human being to be totally free from the human
              condition.

              <br> <br>The term ‘Human Condition’ is a well-established philosophical term
              that refers to the situation that all human beings find themselves in
              when they emerge here as babies. The term refers to the contrary and
              perverse nature of all peoples of all races and all cultures. There is
              ‘good’ and ‘bad’ in everyone ... all humans have a ‘dark side’ to their
              nature and a ‘light side’. The battle betwixt ‘Good and Evil’ has raged
              down through the centuries and it requires constant vigilance lest evil
              gets the upper hand. Morals and ethics seek to control the wayward self
              that lurks deep within the human breast ... and some semblance of what
              is called ‘peace’ prevails for the main. Where morality and ethicality
              fails to curb the ‘savage beast’, law and order is maintained ... at
              the point of a gun. The ending of malice and sorrow involves getting
              one’s head out of the clouds – and beyond – and coming down-to-earth
              where the flesh and blood bodies called human beings actually live.
              Obviously, the solution to all the ills of humankind can only be found
              here in space and now in time as this body. Then the question is: is it
              possible to be free of the human condition, here on earth, in this
              life-time, as this flesh and blood body?
              <br> <br>Which means: How on earth can one live happily and harmlessly in
              the world as-it-is with people as-they-are whilst one nurses malice and
              sorrow in one’s bosom?
              <br> <br>For a start, one needs to fully acknowledge the biological
              imperative (the instinctual passions) which are the root cause of all
              the ills of humankind. The genetically inherited passions (such as fear
              and aggression and nurture and desire) give rise to malice and sorrow.
              Malice and sorrow are intrinsically connected and, being based in the
              instinctual passions, are the primary cause of all the wars and murders
              and rapes and tortures and domestic violence and child abuse and
              suicides and the such-like. Malice and sorrow underpin the antidotally
              generated pacifiers of love and compassion which, if sublimated and
              transcended, give rise to Love Agapé and Divine Compassion in an
              altered state of consciousness (ASC) such as ‘Spiritual Enlightenment’.
              This ‘Tried and True’ solution to all the ills of humankind lies within
              the ‘Human Condition’ and, as it has had 3,000 to 5,000 years to
              demonstrate its efficacy, can be discarded as being the ‘Tried and
              Failed’.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>Gone now are the days of having to assiduously practice humility
              and pacifism in an ultimately futile attempt to become free by
              transcending the opposites ... the traditional and narrow path of
              denial and fantasy, negation and hallucination. A wide and wondrous
              path of blitheness and gaiety is now available for one who wishes to
              live in the freedom of the actual world ... because it is very clear,
              to the discerning intellect, that the ‘Enlightened Beings’ have
              squandered their heyday. With this modern era’s rapid and comprehensive
              publication and communications network, none of their gaffes and
              improprieties elude notice. Anyone who is at all astute will have
              perceived that they have fallen short of their own standards ... and
              have failed to deliver the goods so readily pledged to a credulous
              humanity. For thousands of years they have been promising Peace On
              Earth – which is nowhere to be found – and a specious immortality in
              some dubious after-life.
              <br> <br>It will become obvious, as one reads on, that the whole thrust of
              humanity’s wisdom – polluted as it is by belief, faith, trust, hope and
              an uneasy certitude – has been going horribly wrong. Wars, murders,
              tortures, rapes, sadness, loneliness, grief, depression, suicide and
              corruption have been the odious result of such practices for far too
              long to persevere in giving credence to the fantasies and
              hallucinations that pass for sagacity in the real world. Fuelled by an
              emotional imagination, human beings down through the centuries have
              given voice to their passionate dreams and nightmares, with abominable
              consequences. All of humanity’s sublime feeling and profound thought
              has been a purview predicated upon doom and gloom regarding life here
              on this fair earth. The Summum Bonum of all the many and varied
              disciplines – be it philosophy or psychology, physics or metaphysics,
              cosmology or sociology, theology or spirituality – has been to sanction
              the protracted doctrinal assumption that a god, by whatever name, is in
              charge of the universe.
              <br> <br>This god goes under a many and a varied disguise: The Truth, The
              Absolute, The Supreme, The Source, The Origin, The Greatest, The
              Sublime, The Essence, The Most High, The Highest Good, The Self, The
              Higher Self, The True Self, The Soul, The Over-Soul, The Divine
              Presence, The Tao, The Breath Of Life, The Greater Reality, The Ground
              Of Being, Cosmic Consciousness, Mind, Intelligence, Existence, Spirit,
              Presence, Being, Nirvana, Satori, Samadhi, Thatness, Suchness, Isness
              ... and so on and so on. As impressive as all these titles may be, yet
              one must ask: how come, after 3,000 to 5,000 years of a recorded
              history, of the Gurus and the God-Men, the Masters and the Messiahs,
              the Avatars and the Saviours and the Saints and the Sages hawking their
              ‘Divine Solution’ to all and sundry, there is still as much misery and
              mayhem as back then? When one sincerely questions the ‘Teachers’, the
              ‘Teachings’ and the ‘Source’ of the ‘Teachings’ one will indubitably
              unearth this salient point:
              <br> <br> Despite all their rhetoric, peace-on-earth is not actually on their agenda.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>I invite anyone to make a critical examination of all the words I
              advance so as to ascertain if they be intrinsically self-explanatory
              ... and if they are all seen to be inherently consistent with what is
              being spoken about, then the facts speak for themselves. Then one will
              have reason to remember a pure conscious experience (PCE), which all
              peoples I have spoken to at length have had, and thus verify by direct
              experience the facticity of what is written (which personal
              experiencing is the only proof worthy of the name). The PCE occurs
              globally ... across cultures and down through the ages irregardless of
              gender, race or age. However, it is usually interpreted according to
              cultural beliefs – created and reinforced by the persistence of
              identity – and devolves into an ASC. Then ‘I’ as ego – sublimated and
              transcended as ‘me’ as soul – manifest as a god or a goddess (‘The
              Truth’ by any name) and preach unliveable doctrines based upon their
              belief that they are ‘not the body’.
              <br> <br> Doctrines like acceptance, pacifism and unconditional love, for example.
              <br> <br>In my investigations into life, the universe and what it is to be a
              human being living in the world as-it-is with people as-they-are I
              first started by examining thought, thoughts and thinking ... then very
              soon moved on to examining feelings (first the emotions and then the
              deeper feelings). When I dug down into these passions and calentures
              (into the core of ‘my’ being then into ‘being’ itself) I stumbled
              across the instincts ... and found the origin of not only the affective
              faculty but the psyche itself. I found ‘me’ at the core of ‘being’ ...
              which is the instinctual rudimentary animal self common to all sentient
              beings (otherwise mistakenly known as the ‘original face’ and is what
              gives rise to the feeling of ‘oneness’ with all other sentient beings).
              It is a very, very ancient genetic memory ... but hoariness does not
              make it automatically wise, however, despite desperate belief to the
              contrary.
              <br> <br>Being a ‘self’ is because the only way into this world of people,
              things and events is via the human spermatozoa fertilising the human
              ova ... thus every human being is endowed, by blind nature, with the
              basic instinctual passions of fear and aggression and nurture and
              desire. Thus ‘I’ am the end-point of myriads of survivors passing on
              their genes. ‘I’ am the product of the ‘success story’ of blind
              nature’s fear and aggression and nurture and desire. Being born of the
              biologically inherited instincts genetically encoded in the germ cells
              of the spermatozoa and the ova, ‘I’ am – genetically – umpteen tens of
              thousands of years old ... ‘my’ origins are lost in the mists of
              pre-history. ‘I’ am so anciently old that ‘I’ may well have always
              existed ... carried along on the reproductive cell-line, over countless
              millennia, from generation to generation. And ‘I’ am thus passed on
              into an inconceivably open-ended and hereditably transmissible future.
              <br> <br>In other words: ‘I’ am fear and fear is ‘me’ and ‘I’ am aggression
              and aggression is ‘me’ and ‘I’ am nurture and nurture is ‘me’ and ‘I’
              am desire and desire is ‘me’.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>The instinctual passions are the very energy source of the
              rudimentary animal self ... the base consciousness of ‘self’ and
              ‘other’ that all sentient beings have. The human animal – with its
              unique ability to be aware of its own death – transforms this
              ‘reptilian brain’ rudimentary core of ‘being’ (an animal ‘self’) into
              being a feeling ‘me’ (as soul in the heart) and the ‘feeler’ then
              infiltrates into thought to become the ‘thinker’ ... a thinking ‘I’ (as
              ego in the head). No other animal can do this. That this process is
              aided and abetted by the human beings who were already on this planet
              when one was born – which is conditioning and programming and is part
              and parcel of the socialising process – is but the tip of the iceberg
              and not the main issue at all. All the different types of conditioning
              are well-meant endeavours by countless peoples over countless aeons to
              seek to curb the instinctual passions. Now, while most people paddle
              around on the surface and re-arrange the conditioning to ease their lot
              somewhat, some people – seeking to be free of all human conditioning –
              fondly imagine that by putting on a face-mask and snorkel that they
              have gone deep-sea diving with a scuba outfit ... deep into the human
              condition.
              <br> <br>They have not ... they have gone deep only into the human
              conditioning. When they tip upon the instincts – which are both savage
              (fear and aggression) and tender (nurture and desire) – they grab for
              the tender (the ‘good’ side) and blow them up all out of proportion. If
              they succeed in this self-aggrandising hallucination they start talking
              twaddle dressed up as sagacity such as: ‘There is a good that knows no
              evil’ or ‘There is a love that knows no opposite’ or ‘There is a
              compassion that sorrow has never touched’ and so on. Which means that
              the ‘Enlightened Beings’ advise dissociation (wherein painful reality
              is transformed into a bad dream) as being the most effective means to
              deal with all the wars and murders and rapes and tortures and domestic
              violence and child abuse and sadness and loneliness and grief and
              depression and suicides and the such-like. Just as a traumatised victim
              of an horrific and terrifying event makes the experience unreal in
              order to cope with the ordeal, the ‘Enlightened Beings’ have
              desperately done precisely this thing ... during what is sometimes
              called ‘the dark night of the soul’.
              <br> <br>This is because it takes nerves of steel to don such an aqua-lung
              and plunge deep in the stygian depths of the human psyche ... it is not
              for the faint of heart or the weak of knee. This is because past the
              human conditioning is the human condition itself ... that which caused
              the conditioning in the first place. To end this condition, the
              deletion of blind nature’s software package which gave rise to the
              rudimentary animal ‘self’ is required. This is the elimination of ‘me’
              at the core of ‘being’.
              <br> <br> The complete and utter extinction of ‘being’ is the end to all the ills of humankind.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>Thus the single root cause of all the mayhem and misery that
              epitomises the human condition is the persistent feeling of being an
              identity inhabiting the body: an affective ‘entity’ as in a deep,
              abiding and profound feeling of being an occupant, a tenant, a squatter
              or a phantom hiding behind a façade, a mask, a persona; as a subjective
              emotional psychological ‘self’ and/or a passionate psychic ‘being’ (‘I’
              as ego and ‘me’ as soul) inhabiting the psyche; a deep feeling of being
              a ‘spirit’; a consciousness of the immanence of ‘presence’ (which
              exists immortally); an awareness of being an autological ‘being’ ...
              the realisation of ‘Being’ itself. In other words: everything you
              think, feel and instinctually know yourself to be ... is to be an alien
              in an alien world.
              <br> <br>Becoming free of the human condition is a physiological occurrence,
              centred at the nape of the neck (the top of the brain-stem/base of the
              brain), wherein the ‘lizard-brain’ mutates out of its primeval state
              ... but if this mutation is not allowed its completion one becomes
              enlightened. To become spiritually free the ego-self (‘I’ as ego) must
              die/dissolve ... all genuinely enlightened beings point to a single
              edifying moment of awakening (with a variety of descriptions) wherein
              the personal self (or ‘being’) transmogrifies into the impersonal self
              or ‘being’ (or non-self) ... and which ‘being’ (often capitalised as
              ‘Being’) exists timelessly, spacelessly and formlessly. To become
              actually free the soul-self (‘me’ as soul) must also die/dissolve ...
              the total extirpation of ‘being’ (and thus ‘Being’) itself.
              <br> <br>So far in human history one has had only two choices: being human
              or being divine. Given that there has only been one alternative to
              being worldly – being otherworldly – one had to become divine to escape
              from the Human Condition. Thus the ego had to dissolve. Yet the deeper
              identity – the soul, the spirit, the being – remained intact only to
              wreak its havoc once again ... now disguised as ‘The Self’. Once one
              sees that the ‘Tried and True’ is the ‘Tried and Failed’ one easily
              recognises today’s third alternative: actual freedom ... and it
              outstrips any Altered State Of Consciousness. A new way to live life on
              this verdant planet has been discovered which eliminates the need to
              humble oneself in a degrading surrender and servitude to some imagined
              deity. It is now possible to live freely in this newly emerging
              post-spiritual epoch, attaining full and mature use of one’s innate
              faculties ... and easily superseding all of the revered saints and
              sages. Actual freedom is a tried and tested way of being here in the
              world as it actually is ... stripped of the veneer of reality that is
              super-imposed by the psychological and psychic entity within the body.
              This entity is the feeling of identity that inhibits any freedom and
              sabotages every well-meant endeavour.
              <br> <br>In actual freedom one finds that the need for the ‘Ultimate
              Reality’ has vanished along with the ego and soul ... the ‘self’ and
              the ‘Self’.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>Obviously, the physical cause necessitates a physical solution (the
              extinction of the instinctual ‘being’ itself) and this altruistic
              ‘self’-sacrifice will not eventuate unless the temporary absence or
              abeyance of the physically inherited cause (a genetically inherited
              instinctual animal ‘self’) which created the problem of the human
              condition is intimately experienced, remembered and activated. This
              peak experience of one’s potentiality is known as a pure consciousness
              experience (PCE) and is essential to the process of freeing oneself
              from one’s fate and attaining to one’s destiny. The first and most
              important step is to remember a PCE (everybody that I have spoken to at
              length over the last nineteen years – everybody – has had at least one)
              and thus start thinking for oneself (although most people cannot
              initially remember a PCE and may need a lot of prompting to retrieve it
              from their memory). Then each next step becomes obvious of its own
              accord in one’s daily life as one goes about one’s normal business in
              the market place. The pure intent born out of the PCE actively works on
              eliminating the animal ‘self’ bestowed by blind nature each moment
              again.
              <br> <br>One begins by incrementally purging oneself of the social identity
              that has been overlaid – from conception to the present day – over the
              innate self. With cheerful diligence and application born out of pure
              intent, one whittles away at the persistent social identity, abandoning
              the desire for unity, until one arrives at a virtual freedom. In
              virtual freedom one is ninety nine percent free and the other one
              percent causes very little trouble – if any – and with virtual freedom
              operating in every human being there could be a virtual global
              peace-on-earth. Howsoever that may be, the day of destiny ultimately
              dawns wherein one is catapulted into actual freedom ... one has escaped
              one’s fate and universal peace and tranquillity emerges. Being free
              from malice and sorrow, innocence and benignity are one’s constant
              condition. In the consummate perfection of the purity which endlessly
              wells in the utter stillness of the infinitude of this material
              universe, one is this very actual universe experiencing itself in all
              its magnificence as a sensate and reflective human being.
              <br> <br>It is essential for success to grasp the fact that this is one’s
              only moment of being alive. The past, although it did happen, is not
              actual now. The future, though it will happen, is not actual now. Only
              now is actual. Yesterday’s happiness and harmlessness does not mean a
              thing if one is miserable and malicious now ... and a hoped-for
              happiness and harmlessness tomorrow is to but waste this moment of
              being alive in waiting. All one gets by waiting is more waiting. Thus
              any ‘change’ can only happen now. The jumping in point is always here
              ... it is at this moment in time and this place in space. Thus, if one
              misses it this time around, hey presto ... one has another chance
              immediately. Life is excellent at providing opportunities like this.
              <br> <br>There is a wide and wondrous path to actual freedom: One asks
              oneself, each moment again, ‘how am I experiencing this moment of being
              alive’?
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>This can give rise to apperception. Apperception is the outcome of
              the exclusive attention paid to being alive right here just now.
              Apperception is to be the senses as a bare awareness, a pure
              consciousness experience (PCE) of the world as-it-is, which happens
              when the mind becomes aware of itself. Apperception is an awareness of
              consciousness. It is not ‘I’ being aware of ‘me’ being conscious; it is
              the mind’s awareness of itself. Which means that attentiveness and
              sensuousness will facilitate what the wide and wondrous path to an
              actual freedom is on about: a virtual freedom wherein the ‘good’
              feelings – the affectionate and desirable emotions and passions (those
              that are loving and trusting) are minimised along with the ‘bad’
              feelings – the hostile and invidious emotions and passions (those that
              are hateful and fearful) – so that one is free to feel well, feel happy
              and feel perfect for 99% of the time. If one deactivates the ‘good’ and
              ‘bad’ feelings and activates the felicitous feelings (happiness,
              delight, joie de vivre, bonhomie and so on) with this freed-up
              affective energy, in conjunction with sensuousness (delectation,
              enjoyment, appreciation, relish, zest, gusto and so on), then the
              ensuing sense of amazement, marvel and wonder can result in
              apperceptiveness (unmediated perception).
              <br> <br>Now, delight is what is humanly possible, given sufficient pure
              intent obtained from the felicity born of the pure consciousness
              experience, and from the position of delight, one can vitalise one’s
              joie de vivre by the amazement at the fun of it all ... and then one
              can – with sufficient abandon – become over-joyed and move into
              marvelling at being here and doing this business called being alive
              now. Then one is no longer intuitively making sense of life ... the
              delicious wonder of it all drives any such instinctive meaning away.
              Such luscious wonder fosters the innate condition of naiveté – the
              nourishing of which is essential if fascination in it all is to occur –
              and the charm of life itself easily engages dedication to
              peace-on-earth. Then, as one gazes intently at the world about by
              glancing lightly with sensuously caressing eyes, out of the corner of
              one’s eye comes – sweetly – the magical fairy-tale-like paradise that
              this verdant earth actually is ... and one is the experiencing of what
              is happening.
              <br> <br> But refrain from possessing it and making it your own ... or else ‘twill vanish as softly as it appeared.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>The day finally dawns when something irrevocable happens inside the
              skull. In an ecstatic moment of being present, ‘I’ as ego and ‘me’ as
              soul expire. ‘I’ the personality and ‘me’ the being ceases to exist,
              permanently. There is a sensation inside the top of the brain-stem that
              is experienced as a physical ‘turning over’ of some kind ... something
              that can never, ever, turn back. Something irrevocable happens and
              everything is different, somehow, although everything stays the same
              physically ... with the outstanding exception of a perfection and
              purity permeating all and everything.
              <br> <br>Something has changed, although it is as if nothing has happened
              ... except that the entire world is a magical fairy-tale-like
              playground full of incredible joy and delight that is never-ending.
              ‘My’ demise was as fictitious as ‘my’ apparent presence. I have always
              been here, I realise, it was that ‘I’ only imagined that ‘I’ existed.
              It was all an emotional play in a fertile imagination ... which was,
              however, fuelled by an actual hormonal substance triggered off from
              within the brain-stem because of the instinctual passions bestowed by
              blind nature. Thus the psyche – the entire affective faculty born of
              the instincts itself – is wiped out forever and one is finally what one
              actually is: this thinking and reflective flesh-and-blood body simply
              brimming with sense organs, delighting in this very sensual world of
              actual experience.
              <br> <br>Thus the search for meaning amidst the debris of the much-vaunted
              human hopes and dreams and schemes comes to its timely end. With the
              end of both ‘I’ and ‘me’, the distance or separation between both ‘I’
              and ‘me’ and the sense organs – and thus the external world –
              disappears. To be living as the senses is to live a clean and clear and
              pure awareness – apperception – a pure consciousness experience of the
              world as-it-is. Because there is no ‘I’ as a thinker (a little person
              inside one’s head) or a ‘me’ as a feeler (a little person in one’s
              heart) – to have sensations happen to them, one is the sensations. The
              entire affective faculty vanishes ... blind nature’s software package
              of instinctual passions is deleted.
              <br> <br> ----------------------------------------------
              <br> <br>Then there is nothing except the series of sensations which happen
              ... not happening to an ‘I’ or a ‘me’ but just happening ... moment by
              moment ... one after another. To live life as these sensations, as
              distinct from having them, engenders the most astonishing sense of
              freedom and magic. One is living in peace and tranquillity; a
              meaningful peace and tranquillity. Life is intrinsically purposeful,
              the reason for existence lies openly all around. It never goes away –
              nor has it ever been away – it was just that ‘I’/‘me’ was standing in
              the way of the meaning of life being apparent. Now the universe is
              experiencing itself in all its magnificence as an apperceptive human
              being. Life is not a vale of tears; peace-on-earth is an actual freedom
              from the human condition; it is indeed possible to be actually free,
              here on earth, as this body, in this life-time.
              <br> <br> To seek and to find; to explore and uncover; to investigate and discover ... these actions are the very stuff of life!</p>

              <br> <br> What The Words Are And What The Words Are Not</span> <br> <br> Apperceptiveness is a word describing a condition which happens of its
              own accord and attentiveness depicts an activity that one vitalises
              with remarkable verve and vivacity which activates the quality that the
              word sensuousness specifies. What exactly they are will become clearer
              as one goes along ... and it is important to note that this is not a
              matter of ‘a communion of what lies behind the concepts’. This is
              because ‘communion’ is of the affective faculty – and feeling-words are
              devised as the representative symbols of levels in the ‘inner world’ –
              and communion emotes those identities and realities with which
              expressive feelings deal. The word attentiveness articulates a
              cognitive probity and sensuousness is a word indicating a pre-emotional
              fidelity and the word apperceptiveness denotes a pre-identification
              integrity – they are not shackled to irrational intuition and logical
              imagination or prescient revelation – and describe this actual
              sensational environment ... the world of the senses. Sensuousness and
              apperceptiveness of themselves are the actuality ascertained with the
              attentiveness which gives rise to delineation ... thus the words that
              follow are simply a report of the experience of actuality.
              <br> <br>So, it is important to understand that whilst everything written
              here is both descriptive and prescriptive – thus it is going to make
              rational sense – the quality and condition will always remain
              inaccessible to insight, illation and divination ... it is
              inconceivable, unimaginable and unbelievable. Needless to say,
              attentiveness and sensuousness can be experienced – rather easily – and
              along with apperceptiveness they can be adequately described, provided
              one keeps in mind that the words are not feeling-fingers ‘pointing at
              the moon’ ... they are never allusions to that ineffable
              ‘thing-in-itself’ of mystical tradition. In fact, attentiveness and
              sensuousness are subtle processes that one is using at this very moment
              whilst reading these words. Also, although the experience of the actual
              world authenticated apperceptively lies prior to the feelings and thus
              before the identification, this fact does not make one primitive ...
              quite the obverse.
              <br> <br>The actualism method called ‘How am I experiencing this moment of
              being alive?’ that was first put into action in 1981 is a potent method
              specifically aimed at experiencing a condition of uninterrupted
              apperception ... which means that the peace-on-earth that is already
              always here – now – will become apparent.
              <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br> What Attentiveness And Sensuousness
              <br> And Apperceptiveness Are</span> <br> <br>When one first becomes aware of something, there is a fleeting
              instant of the clean perception of sensum just before one recognises
              the percept (the mental product or result of perception) and also
              before one identifies with all the feeling memories associated with its
              qualia (the qualities pertaining to the properties of the form) and
              this ‘raw sense-datum’ stage of sensational perception is a direct
              experience of the actual. Clear perception is in that instant where one
              converges one’s eyes or ears or nose or tongue or skin on the thing. It
              is that moment just before one focuses one’s feeling-memory on the
              object. It is the split-second just as one affectively subjectifies it
              ... which is just prior to clamping down on it viscerally and
              segregating it from the rest of pure, conscious existence. Pure
              perception takes place sensitively just before one starts feeling the
              percept – and thus thinking about it affectively – which takes place
              just before one’s feeling-fed mind says: ‘It’s a man’ or: ‘It’s a
              woman’ or: ‘It’s a steak-burger’ or: ‘It’s a tofu-burger’ ... with all
              that is implied in this identification and the ramifications that stem
              from that. This fluid, soft-focused moment of bare awareness, which is
              not learned, has never been learned, and never will be learned, could
              be called an aesthetically sensual regardfulness or a consummate
              sensorial discernibleness or an exquisitely sensuous heedfulness ... in
              a word: apperceptiveness.
              <br> <br>(Dictionary Definition: ‘apperceptive’ (a.) of or pertaining to
              apperception (the mind’s perception of itself). Thus:
              ‘apperceptiveness’ (n.): the condition or quality of being
              apperceptive; also: ‘apperceptively’ (adv.): the experience of being
              apperceptive and: ‘apperceptivity’: (n.): the capacity to be
              apperceptive).
              <br> <br>In that brief scintillating instant of bare awareness, that
              twinkling sensorium-moment of consciousness being conscious of being
              consciousness, one apperceives a thing as a nothing-in-particular that
              is being naught but what-it-is coming from nowhen and going nowhere at
              all. Apperceptiveness is very much like what one sees with one’s
              peripheral vision as opposed to the intent focus of normal or central
              vision. One experiences a smoothly flowing moment of clear experiencing
              where one is interlocked with the rest of actuality, not separate from
              it. This moment of soft, ungathered sensuosity – apperceptiveness –
              contains a vast understanding, an utter cognisance, that is lost as
              soon as one adjusts one’s mind to accommodate the feeling-tone ... and
              subverts the crystal-clear objectivity into an ontological ‘being’ ...
              a connotative ‘thing-in-itself’. In the process of ordinary perception,
              the apperceptiveness step is so fleeting as to be usually unobservable.
              One has developed the habit of squandering one’s attention on all the
              remaining steps: feeling the percept, emotionally recognising the
              qualia, zealously adopting the perception and getting involved in a
              long string of representative feeling-notions about it. When the
              original moment of apperceptiveness is rapidly passed over it is the
              purpose of ‘How am I experiencing this moment of being alive?’ to
              accustom one to prolong that moment of apperceptiveness – a sensuous
              awareness bereft of feeling content – so that uninterrupted
              apperception can eventuate.
              <br> <br>(Dictionary Definition: ‘sensuous’ (a.): Of, derived from, or
              affecting the senses aesthetically rather than sensually; readily
              affected by the senses, keenly responsive to the pleasures of
              sensation. Also, indicative of a sensuous temperament. Apparently first
              used by Mr. John Milton, to avoid certain associations of the existing
              word ‘sensual’. Thus: ‘sensuousness’ (n.): the quality of being
              sensuous; also: ‘sensuously’ (adv.): the experience of being sensuous;
              and: ‘sensuosity’ (n.): the capability of being sensuous).
              <br> <br>To enable apperceptiveness to haply occur it is essential to allow
              a reflective attention – attentiveness – to one’s psychological and
              psychic world. It is impossible for one to intelligently observe what
              is going on within if one does not at the same time acknowledge the
              occurrence of one’s various feeling-tones with attentiveness. This is
              especially true with the hostile and invidious emotions and passions
              (those that are hateful and fearful). In order to observe one’s own
              fear, for instance, one must admit to the fact that one is afraid. Nor
              can one examine one’s own depression, for another example, without
              acknowledging it fully. The same is true for irritation and agitation
              and frustration and all those other uncomfortable emotional and
              passionate moods. One cannot examine something fully if one is busy
              denying its existence. Whatever feeling one may be having, a fascinated
              attention – attentiveness – freely divulges it ... it is looking with
              discernibleness. All affective feelings are – quite simply – an
              hereditary occurrence, an inborn factor to be acutely aware of. No
              pride, no shame, nothing personal at stake ... what is there, is
              naturally there. There is no clinging to the affectionate and desirable
              emotions and passions (those that are loving and trusting) and no
              fleeing from the hostile and invidious, either (those that are hateful
              and fearful). A contemplative attention views all feelings as
              commensurate – nothing is suppressed and nothing is expressed – as
              attentiveness does not play favourites.
              <br> <br>(Dictionary Definition: ‘attentive’: Steadily applying one’s mind
              or energies; intent, heedful, assiduously alert, aware, watchful. Thus:
              ‘attentiveness’ (n.): the quality of applying the mind, consideration,
              thought; also: ‘attentional’ (a.): of or pertaining to the mental
              faculty of attention, giving heed, noticing; and: ‘attentively’ (adv.);
              experiencing intently, heedfully, observantly).
              <br> <br>Attentiveness gets not infatuated with the good feelings nor
              sidesteps the bad as attentiveness is a non-feeling awareness; a
              sensuous attention. Attentiveness is not sentimental susceptibility for
              it does not get involved with affection or empathy or get hung up on
              mercurial imaginations and capricious intuitions or ephemeral auguries.
              Attentiveness does not register feelings and compare the validity of
              experience according to it ‘feeling right’ or ‘feeling wrong’.
              Attentiveness is an aesthetic alertness that takes place with minimised
              reference to self. With attentiveness one sees the internal world with
              blameless references to concepts like ‘my’ or ‘mine’. Suppose there is
              a feeling of sadness. Ordinary consciousness would say, ‘I am sad’.
              Using attentiveness, one heedfully notices the feeling as a natural
              feeling – ‘There is human sadness’ – thus one does not tack on that
              possessive personal concept of ‘I’ or ‘me’ ... for one is already
              possessed. Attentiveness is the observance of the basic nature of each
              arising feeling; it is observing all the inner world – emotional,
              passionate and calentural – which is whatever is presently taking place
              in the affective faculty. Attentiveness is seeing how any feeling makes
              ‘me’ tick – and how ‘I’ react to it – with the perspicacity of seeing
              how it affects others as well. In attentiveness, there is an unbiased
              observing of the constant showing-up of the ‘reality’ within and is
              examining the feelings arising one after the other ... and such
              attentiveness is the ending of its grip. Please note that last point:
              in attentiveness, there is an observance of the ‘reality’ within, and
              such attention is the end of its embrace ... finish.
              <br> <br> Here lies apperception.
              <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br> The Where And When Of Attentiveness
              <br> And Sensuousness And Apperceptiveness
              <br> </span> <br>Apperceptiveness is current-time awareness in that it takes place
              now at this moment in time and here at this place in space.
              Apperceptiveness is the felicitous observance of what is happening
              right now, at this very moment. Apperceptiveness stays forever current,
              surging perpetually on the crest of the ongoing wave of this moment in
              eternal time. Apperceptiveness is goal-less awareness for one does not
              strain for results ...one is no longer having to accomplish anything.
              When one is apperceptive, one experiences actuality at this moment in
              time in whatever form it takes; thus there is nothing to be achieved.
              In apperceptiveness there is only pure conscious experience of the
              awareness of change at this moment that never goes away.
              Apperceptiveness is observing the moving flow of experience and
              enjoying things as they are changing ... in full appreciation of being
              here and participating in this happenstance. Apperceptiveness is seeing
              the birth, growth, and maturation of all phenomena ... and it is seeing
              all phenomena age, decay and die. Apperceptiveness is its own
              attentiveness moment by moment, continuously ... one is the
              experiencing of the doing of this moment of being alive.
              Apperceptiveness stops one from adding anything to perception, or
              subtracting something from it: one does not enhance anything for one
              does not emphasise anything. One is free to observe exactly what is
              here – now – without distortion.
              <br> <br>Apperceptiveness is sensuous awareness of only what is currently
              occurring and in precisely the way it is happening now – there is
              neither tolerance nor intolerance – with no acceptance or prejudice.
              Apperceptiveness is non-predictive observation in that it is this
              ability of the mind to regard experience without fault-finding
              feelings. With this ability, one sees things without assumption or
              opprobrium ... and one is surprised by everything being extraordinarily
              ordinary. In apperceptiveness everything is in equipoise and one’s
              interest in things is for them to be exactly as they are in their
              actual condition. One does not have to estimate or establish ... one
              totally acknowledges with delight. Apperceptiveness is a dispassionate
              discernibleness that does not take sides nor get hung up in what is
              apperceived ... it is a sensitive fascination. Apperceptiveness is the
              observation of everything occurring as for the first time.
              Apperceptiveness is possible because of attentiveness ... which is not
              analysis that is based on emotional and passionate recollection.
              Apperceptiveness is the immediate sensitive discernment of whatever is
              happening without the medium of feeling – it comes before the
              feeling-tones in the perceptual process – and thought may or may not be
              operating. If one is futilely attempting a reverie of yesterday’s
              sensorial delight, that is feeling-thought memorialising the moment
              gone by. When one then becomes aware that one is remembering
              yesterday’s experience, that is attentiveness.
              <br> <br>The actualist who is allowing attentiveness is concerned with the
              habitual superimposition of the inner ‘reality’ onto the world of
              people, things and events. It is there in all peoples, but in
              actualism, one’s field of study is one’s own feelings, one’s own
              perceptions, one’s own thoughts and one’s own experience. In actualism,
              one is one’s own guinea-pig because attentiveness is participatory
              observation ... the actualist is both participant and experimenter at
              one and the same time. If one examines one’s emotions attentively one
              is feeling them at that very same moment – attentiveness is not just an
              intellectual awareness – for it is an existential experiencing.
              Attentiveness is objective – it is the wakeful experience of life – but
              it is not inconsiderate or uncaring ... it is an alert participation in
              the ongoing process of living. The ‘reality’ within has an enormous
              fund of information containing the reflection of the human condition
              and an examination of this material leads to an actual freedom.
              Attentiveness is extremely difficult to apply as a discipline – not
              because it is complex – but because it is too simple and open. This is
              because apperceptiveness is a non-feeling function and one can feel for
              its presence all day long and one will never come across it – one can
              never feel what it is – as it is a living experience.
              <br> <br>Sensuousness is the wondrous awareness of the marvel of being here
              now at this moment in time and this place in space. Attentiveness is
              the fascination of the reflective contemplation that this moment is
              one’s only moment of being alive – and one is never alive at any other
              time than now. Wherever one is ... now ... one is always here ... now
              ... even if one starts walking over to ‘there’ ... now ... along the
              way to ‘there’ ... now ... one is always here ... now ... and when one
              arrives ‘there’ ... now ... it too is here ... now. Thus attentiveness
              is an attraction to the fact that one is always here – and it is
              already now – and as one is already here and it is always now then one
              has arrived before one starts. This delicious wonder fosters the innate
              condition of naiveté (which is the closest one can get to innocence)
              the nourishing of which is essential if the charm of it all is to
              occur. The potent combination of attentiveness – fascinated reflective
              contemplation – and sensuousness produces apperception, which happens
              when the mind becomes aware of itself. One is intimately aware that
              this physical space of this universe is infinite and its time is
              eternal ... thus the infinitude of this very material universe has no
              beginning and no ending and therefore no middle. There are no edges to
              this universe, which means that there is no centre, either. We are all
              coming from nowhere and are not going anywhere for there is nowhere to
              come from nor anywhere to go too. We are nowhere in particular ...
              which means we are anywhere at all. In the infinitude of the universe
              one finds oneself to be already here, and as it is always now, one can
              not get away from this place in space and this moment in time. By being
              here as-this-body one finds that this moment in time has no duration as
              in now and then – because the immediate is the ultimate – and that this
              place in space has no distance as in here and there – for the relative
              is the absolute.
              <br> <br> In other words: One is already here as it is always now.
              <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br> The Who And How of Attentiveness And
              <br> Sensuousness And Apperceptiveness</span> <br> <br>The intent is you will become happy and harmless. The intent is you
              will be free of sorrow and malice. The intent is you will become
              blithesome and benign. The intent is you will be free of fear and
              aggression. The intent is you will become carefree and considerate. The
              intent is you will be free from nurture and desire. The intent is you
              will become gay and benevolent. The intent is you will be free of
              anguish and animosity. The intent is that, by being free of the Human
              Condition you will experience peace-on-earth, in this life-time, as
              this body ... as is evidenced in the PCE. An actualist’s intent is a
              pure intent and discovering how to blend this pure intent – via
              attentiveness – into one’s conscious life is the process that places
              one on the wide and wondrous path to actual freedom ... this path is a
              virtual freedom. Uncovering how to prolong the condition of virtual
              freedom – via attentiveness and sensuousness – is still another
              process. These are felicitous processes, however, and they are well
              worth the effort for attentiveness and sensuousness are central to
              virtual freedom and the key to the whole condition. Attentiveness and
              sensuousness are both the goal of actualism and the means to that end:
              one reaches apperceptiveness by being ever more sensuous and one
              activates sensuousness by being ever more attentive ... and one
              activates attentiveness by no longer ‘feeling good’.
              <br> <br>Attentiveness reminds one to apply one’s sensuousness to the
              pertinent situation at the opportune time and to implement surely the
              appropriate amount of activity needed to do the job. When this vitality
              is judiciously applied, one stays constantly in a condition of virtual
              freedom. As long as this condition of virtual freedom is maintained,
              those feeling-states called ‘moods’ cannot arise for there is no
              anguish or animosity – virtually no malice or misery – when
              attentiveness is present. Nevertheless, one is still ‘human’ and to be
              ‘human’ is to err ... and most people are very ‘human’ and err
              repeatedly. Despite pure intent, the actualist lets their attentiveness
              slip now and then and one finds oneself stuck in some unfortunate – but
              normal – ‘human’ failure. It is attentiveness that notices that change
              ... and it is attentiveness that reminds one to apply the pure intent
              required to pull oneself out. Slipping into ‘normal’ happens over and
              over, but the frequency decreases with the assimilation of the fact
              that the absence of anguish and animosity in one’s moment-to-moment
              experience allows one’s daily life to be peaceful and harmonious way
              beyond normal ‘human’ expectations. Once attentiveness has exposed
              those affective defilements, sensuousness provides a more considerate
              and carefree condition ... one is happy and harmless for ninety-nine
              percent of the time. It is attentiveness which notices the change from
              ‘normal’ into happiness and harmlessness, and which reminds the
              actualist to maintain the pure intent needed to keep one blithe and
              benign ... and which allows apperception to freely happen.
              <br> <br>Apperceptiveness makes possible salubrity and sagacity. Deeply
              buried in the psyche, there lies an intuitive mechanism which accepts
              what the heart perceives as beautiful and loving experiences and
              rejects those experiences which are perceived as ugly and hateful. This
              mechanism gives rise to those states of being which one is alert to
              avoid ... states like rapture, euphoria, ecstasy and bliss. One chooses
              to avoid narcissistic spiritual entanglements, not because they are
              diabolical in the normal sense of the word, but because they keep
              malice and sorrow subliminally alive; because they take the mind over
              and capture the attention completely; because they keep going round and
              round in atavistic circles of calenture; and because they seal one off
              from this living actuality. Grandiose spiritual involvements cannot
              arise when apperceptiveness is in action. Apperception is its own
              attentiveness to current time actuality, and therefore, directly
              antithetical to the dazzled state of mind which characterises
              mystification. It is only when one lets one’s attentiveness slip that
              the deep mechanisms of one’s heart takes over – grasping, clinging and
              arrogating – then megalomania emerges and obscures one’s awareness. If
              one is too busy with self-aggrandisement, one ignores that such a
              change is taking place as a vainglorious deification of one’s
              inadequate earthly state of ‘being’. While an unaware person will
              continue in this state indefinitely, a competent actualist will soon
              realise what is happening. It is attentiveness that notices any
              grandiose change; it is attentiveness that remembers the warnings
              received; and it is attentiveness that focuses one’s sensuousness so
              that the confusion fades away. And it is attentiveness that then
              intends to maintain sensuousness indefinitely so that the narcissism
              cannot arise again.
              <br> <br>Attentiveness and sensuousness are the specific antitoxins for
              indulgences ... they are both the cure and the preventive measure.
              Fully developed sensuous attention is a condition of total
              non-grandiosity and utter absence of longing for anything in any
              ‘other-world’. If one can maintain this condition, no other method is
              needed to keep oneself free of obstructions and to achieve freedom from
              the human condition via apperceptiveness. Apperception is non-identity
              awareness that sees things clearly and cleanly and purely ... beyond
              the level of feelings and ‘being’ itself. The clear and clean and pure
              awareness of apperceptiveness is a total certainty and complete absence
              of doubt that manifests itself primarily as a constant and unwavering
              fascination which never flags and never turns away. The pure and
              unstained lustrous awareness of apperceptiveness is not only devoid of
              affective indulgences, it lays bare their very mechanism by having had
              them eliminated coincidental to the self-immolation of identity in
              toto. Apperceptiveness is the absence of the heart-felt corruption of
              the mind. The result is a brain which remains unstained and
              invulnerable, completely unaffected by the ‘ups and downs’ of life.
              <br> <br> It is ambrosial, to say the least.
              <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;"> <br> The Why And What of Attentiveness
              <br> And Sensuousness And Apperceptiveness</span> <br> <br>The activity of attentiveness reminds one of why one is doing this:
              in actualism, one puts one’s attention on being here ... now. When
              feelings cause one’s awareness to wander from actualism’s focus, it is
              attentiveness that reminds one that one’s mind is being manipulated ...
              and why one is doing this happening called being alive. It is
              attentiveness that brings one back to the object of actualism:
              apperception. Apperceptiveness is a very actual goal and those who seek
              to actualise the pure consciousness experience (PCE) may be activating
              attentiveness for a period of months or even years. The human habit of
              getting stuck in feelings dates back to the dawn of human history –
              thus the habit will hang on in the most tenacious manner – and the only
              way through it all is to be equally persistent and diligent in the
              activation of constant attentiveness. Awareness occurs without the
              delay of an internal feeling-dialogue ... repeated activation of
              attentiveness in actualism establishes this function as a cognitive
              habit which then carries on automatically for the rest of one’s ‘human’
              life. A sincere actualist is attentive to feelings all the time, day
              in, day out, whether active or resting; whether in association or on
              one’s own; whether there is thinking as well as perceiving or not. When
              attentiveness is actual, one will notice when one becomes stuck in
              one’s feeling patterns; it is that very noticing which allows one to
              back out of the feeling process and free oneself from it. Sensuousness
              returns one’s attention to its proper focus: if one is actualising a
              virtual freedom at that moment, then one’s focus will be the actual
              object of actualism. If one is not in virtual freedom, one’s focus will
              be just a straight-forward application of matter-of-fact attention
              itself, just a simple noticing of whatever comes up without getting
              possessively involved: ‘Ah, this feeling ... what is it ... where is it
              ... where did it come from ... what is it made up of ... what is it
              connected to ...?’. Virtual freedom re-establishes itself easily by the
              attentiveness that it has not been current. As soon as one is aware
              that one has not been attentive then one is experiencing sensuousness
              in virtual freedom ... and thence: Apperceptiveness.
              <br> <br>Apperceptiveness has its own distinct ambience in consciousness: it
              has a flavour – a magical, crystal-clear, scintillating flavour –
              whereas feelings are heady, magisterial and grandiloquent by comparison
              ... finicky and phantasmal and flighty and fantastical. Yet these are
              but descriptive words and one’s own action will show one the difference
              ... then one will probably come up with one’s own words and the words
              used here will become superfluous. Action is the thing as apperception
              is a living actuality that adds nothing to perception nor subtracts
              anything – it distorts not at all – and sees things as they actually
              are. One can apperceive prime characteristics that actual freedom
              factually shows. In psychiatric terms, for example, these are called:
              <br> <br> 1. ‘depersonalisation’ (selflessness ... the absence of an entity that is called ego and Soul or self and Self).
              <br> <br> 2. ‘alexithymia’ (the absence of the affective faculty ... no emotions, passions or calentures whatsoever).
              <br> <br> 3. ‘derealisation’ (the condition of having lost one’s grip on reality ... the ‘real world’ is nowhere to be found).
              <br> <br> 4. ‘anhedonia’ (the inability to affectively feel pleasure ... no hormonal secretions means hedonism is not possible). 
              <br> <br>The characteristics of actual freedom are not present in actualism
              as dogmas demanding hopeful belief with its blind faith and trusting
              surrender. The actualist knows that these facts are self-evident from
              the PCE and are available to anyone who cares to investigate in a
              sincere way. Attentiveness is the method of investigation and
              apperceptiveness has the capacity to reveal the factual character of
              actuality ... all the while freely accessible to any human being’s
              sensuous observation. With this degree of inspection, one sees the
              following factors: (a) it is ‘me’ in ‘my’ totality that is standing in
              the way of the already always existing perfection here on earth; (b)
              all feelings are inherently flawed and are narcissistic by nature; (c)
              every other-worldly truth is, in the end, unable to bring about
              peace-on-earth; (d) there are actually no entities that are unborn and
              undying, timeless and spaceless, birthless and deathless, formless and
              ceaseless, immortal and immutable.
              <br> <br>The activity of attentiveness is not unlike a magnifying glass in
              that one can actually see directly those realities which are at best
              theoretical constructs to the unconscious feeling process.
              Attentiveness is at one and the same time both sensuous attention
              itself and the function of reminding one to pay sensuous attention if
              one has ceased to do so ... one notices one’s own lack of
              attentiveness; and that noticing itself is a result of attentiveness.
              Emotive thought pastes feelings over one’s experience, loads one down
              with ideals and dreams and schemes, immerses one in a churning vortex
              of hopes and worries, fears and fantasies. When sensuously attentive,
              one does not play that game. When one is aware exactly what arises in
              the heart, then one is attentive to the next thing. It is really very
              simple: attentiveness actually sees the illusory nature of everything
              that is felt. It sees the transitory and delusory nature of every ideal
              and dream and scheme and – seeing the inherently unsatisfactory nature
              of all feeling beings – it sees that there is no sense grabbing onto
              any of these passing feelings as peace and harmony cannot be found that
              way. Attentiveness sees the inherent selfishness of all ‘being’ in that
              it sees the way that human beings have arbitrarily selected a certain
              bundle of tender feelings, chopped them off from the rest of the
              surging flow of savage feelings and then realised themselves as unitive
              and enduring entities swimming in the ‘Ocean Of Oneness’. Attentiveness
              actually sees these things ... it does not feel them out, it sees them
              for what they are. Attentiveness is a process, but it does not have to
              take place in steps for it can also be a direct seeing that occurs as a
              totality: when it is fully developed, attentiveness understands those
              factors detailed above intimately and without the intervening medium of
              irrational intuition and imaginative logic or prescient revelation.
              Attentiveness is sensuous attention and sensuousness enables the
              experiencing of things without distorting feelings ... whilst seeing
              the world of people, things and events as-it-is is apperception.
              <br> <br>The condition of apperception sees things as they actually are ...
              in apperception lies only salubrity and sagacity. Apperception is the
              clear and direct experiencing of being here at this place in infinite
              space now at this moment in eternal time – sans identity and its
              feeling-fed realities – and it is a wordless appreciation of being able
              to be here now ... of being alive and awake on this verdant planet. One
              will not instantly attain freedom (an actual freedom from the human
              condition) as a result of one’s first moment of apperceptiveness. One
              comes upon this condition that is germane to actual freedom –
              consciousness being conscious of being consciousness – again and again
              until an inevitability sets in ... which precipitates an oft-times
              alarming but always thrilling momentum that will result in total
              self-immolation. The characteristics already detailed
              (‘depersonalisation’, ‘alexithymia’, ‘derealisation’, ‘anhedonia’) are
              the result of expressing actual freedom in the psychiatric models of
              the human condition – which reflects the ‘human’ struggle to understand
              this fundamentally simple process called consciousness – and are
              inherently arbitrary in that they do not exist as separate items. The
              extinction of identity in its totality with its ensuing loss of reality
              coupled with the inability to affectively feel pleasure along with the
              ending of the feeling faculty all takes place in the space of a few
              glorious moments. Peace-on-earth is the certain result because it is
              already here. Living in this on-going peace-on-earth one is always
              blithe and carefree, even if one is doing nothing. Doing something –
              and that includes thinking – is a bonus on top of this never-ending
              ambrosial perfection of the eternal infinity of this material universe
              ... which infinitude is already always here.
              <br> <br> One is this universe experiencing itself as a sensate and reflective human being.

              <br> <br> (Peace On Earth In This Life Time As This Flesh And Blood Body)
              <br> <br>Here is an actual freedom from the Human Condition, surpassing
              Spiritual Enlightenment and any other Altered State Of Consciousness,
              and challenging all philosophy, psychiatry, metaphysics (including
              quantum physics with its mystic cosmogony), anthropology, sociology ...
              and any religion along with its paranormal theology. Discarding all of
              the beliefs that have held humankind in thralldom for aeons, the way
              has now been discovered that cuts through the ‘Tried and True’ and
              enables anyone to be, for the first time, a fully free and autonomous
              individual living in utter peace and tranquillity, beholden to no-one.

              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">A
                  pure consciousness experience is a temporary, ï¿½selfï¿½-less
                  and sensuous experience of the perfection and purity of the actual
                  universe. A PCE offers a glimpse or window out from the ï¿½realï¿½
                  world everyone is born into (and therefore assumes to be all there is),
                  and one suddenly finds oneself in the unimaginable,
                  magical, fairytale-like actual world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">For
                  a brief period, there is no ï¿½selfï¿½ as a
                  mediator, interpreter, censor or spoiler. All is directly evidenced by
                  the physical senses to be pure, perfect, delightful. Oneï¿½s
                  intelligence is freed of any emotions and affective feelings ï¿½ thinking
                  becomes benign, clear and concise ï¿½ free of malice and
                  sorrow. The already-existing innate purity and perfection that becomes
                  stunningly apparent in this ï¿½selfï¿½-less state instantly
                  renders redundant the need for any morals, ethics or any kind of
                  ï¿½selfï¿½-control. With awareness and intelligence operating
                  totally freed from the Human Condition, ï¿½Iï¿½ can then be clearly seen
                  for what ï¿½Iï¿½ am ï¿½ a parasitical identity who is the
                  source of ï¿½myï¿½ own suffering and ï¿½myï¿½ own malice.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">This
                  physical universe is clearly seen to be already
                  perfect and it is obvious that it is only what goes on in human heads
                  and hearts ï¿½ the Human Condition, manifest in each of us
                  as a personal ï¿½selfï¿½ ï¿½ that is the cause of the appalling human malice
                  and sorrow. It is also clear that the affective
                  instinctual passions ï¿½ the loves and loyalties, the impulses and urges
                  as well as the ideals and beliefs that human beings are
                  willing to fight and kill for, or to suffer and die for ï¿½ are the root
                  cause of human malice and sorrow. Oneï¿½s own ï¿½selfï¿½-inflicted
                  problems lie in the very feelings and emotions that arise from the
                  animal instinctual passions ï¿½ and the PCE experientially
                  confirms this fact.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">For an actualist, the pure consciousness experience
                  becomes oneï¿½s guiding light and to live that pure experience 24 hrs. a day, every day, becomes oneï¿½s pure intent.</span></p>

                  time one reaches adulthood one has a fully developed sense of
                  ï¿½realï¿½-world
                  cynicism. This attitude to life on earth is fuelled by societal
                  spiritual and religious beliefs that life on earth is meant to be
                  a suffering existence and that ultimate peace and happiness is only
                  possible after physical death in a mythical after-life.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">This view is further reinforced and strengthened by the commonly-held ancient belief
                  that children are born ï¿½innocentï¿½ and are corrupted by ï¿½evilï¿½ or ï¿½wrong thinkingï¿½ since birth. These beliefs combine
                  to form the unanimous view that ï¿½lifeï¿½s a bitchï¿½, and ï¿½you canï¿½t change Human Natureï¿½ ï¿½ the deeply cynical concepts
                  that underpin the Human Condition.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Abandoning
                  these cynical ï¿½real worldï¿½ and ï¿½spiritual worldï¿½ beliefs about human
                  existence is essential if one is to even consider becoming free of the
                  Human Condition. In order to begin the process of changing
                  human nature in oneself, one needs to re-activate and cultivate oneï¿½s
                  innate naivetï¿½ ï¿½ the closest one can get to innocence
                  while still remaining a ï¿½selfï¿½.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">In the pure consciousness experience the direct experience of the purity and perfection
                  of the actual world becomes suddenly apparent and ï¿½whoï¿½ one was literally moments before magically fades away as though a
                  distant and discordant memory. Oneï¿½s fears and battles, troubles and worries, anger and sadness disappear along with oneï¿½s
                  very persona, for the PCE is a ï¿½selfï¿½-less state. In the PCE it becomes inconceivable that human beings could be malicious to
                  each other to the point of waging war and sorrowful to the point of suicide whilst living on this delightful, bountiful,
                  paradisiacal planet.</span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">Many people who have had PCEs are subsequently moved to do something
                  about the Human Condition on the planet and then set about attempting to change others, their partners or ï¿½societyï¿½ at large.
                  What they forget, or ignore, is the fact that they have only briefly experienced this state of personal freedom from malice and
                  sorrow when they themselves were in a ï¿½selfï¿½-less state ï¿½ in short that the problem is ï¿½meï¿½ and my passions and not ï¿½othersï¿½
                  and their passions.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">The world already abounds with over 6 billion people all busy trying to change each
                  other according to their own insights, beliefs, whims, morals or ethics ï¿½ an exercise in utter futility that does nothing but
                  further contribute to human malice and sorrow. It is vital to the process of becoming free of the Human Condition that one fully
                  and utterly comprehends that the only person one needs to change, and indeed can change, is oneself.</span></p>

                  is but to fight, battle and seek power over others and when these attempts inevitably fail, disappointment, resentment and anger
                  arise. The perpetual failure of men and women to live together in equity, peace and harmony is a poignant proof of this
                  instinctual emotional pattern in action.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px;"><span style="font-size: normal;">As is evident from the PCE, the only way to evince genuine peace and harmony with oneï¿½s
                  fellow human beings is to have no ï¿½selfï¿½ at all ï¿½ no ï¿½meï¿½ who feels offended, or who instinctually feels the need to
                  fight with others. To become actually innocent, actually free of all feelings of malice and sorrow, is the means to both finding
                  personal peace and happiness and to be able to live in peace and harmony with oneï¿½s fellow human beings.</span></p>

              <p>I have already looked through Richard's objections on Buddhism last month and found that he has a very warped and mistaken view about Buddhism, though he happened to have ripped off articles from Buddhist teachers (I'm not talking about Alan Watts which he later admitted after being questioned, but also Bhante Gunaratana and probably others).</p>
              <p>As my friend Thusness told me, there can be two reasons for claiming exclusivity: either he is trying to emphasize the uniqueness of AF, or he is genuinely misguided by certain Buddhist teachers who aren't there yet and hence thinking the true experience of Anatta is not found in Buddhism. So I wonder if you are willing to test your belief that the AF realisation is truly exclusive to AF-ers and that Richard is the first to have realised this in the world? (Not that I am very bothered or concerned about this, anyway)</p>
              <p>Anyway not that there is anything wrong claiming exclusive realisation IF there is truly no one before that has taught the same things. For example, the Buddha himself claimed to exclusively hold the teaching to freedom and distinguished himself from all other Hindu religions of his days that only reach the Atman-Brahman realisation which is already well written in the ancient Upanishads and Vedas. Buddha however rejected their authority. (and by the way before it is well known that before his enlightenment he had gone to many Hindu teachers and reached formless absorptions/jhanas [infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and neither perception nor non-perception] or what AF would called "Altered States of Consciousness" but realised them as not being the way to liberation and gave up those practices. the way to liberation is by being aware of our sensate reality as it is and realising that there never was a self within or a dissociated observer apart from the flow of sensations).

              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 1.3pt;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;" lang="EN-GB">This is the most unique feature 
                              of Buddhism. It is not found in any other religion in the world. Buddha 
                              formulated this doctrine and gave ample reasons to support it. In all the 
                              other religions there exists a Soul or a Self or Atman in humans. This is a 
                              permanent, unchanging, everlasting essence or entity in man. In some 
                              religions, this soul will end up in heaven or hell eternally after death. In 
                              Hinduism the Atman after many life times of purification will finally unite 
                              with God or Brahman. This Self or soul is the thinker of thoughts, feeler of 
                              sensations and receiver of rewards and punishments. Buddhism reckons that 
                              this soul is the cause of all evils and misdeeds because of the selfishness 
                              of ‘me’ and ‘mine’. Selfishness leads to all other defilements like hatred, 
                              ill will, conceit and pride.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoBlockText" style="margin: 0in 1.3pt 0.0001pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms,arial,helvetica;"> <span style="font-size: 12pt;">Buddha explained that each individual is 
                              composed of five constituents: body, feeling, perception, mental factors 
                              (habitual tendencies) and consciousness. At birth these five constituents 
                              propel the karmic forces to form an individual in this life. At death, the 
                              five constituents break up to leave the forces in the spirit world during 
                              which no individual is in existence. In a subsequent birth these five 
                              separate constituents will reform another individual according to the karma 
                              accrued by that individual in his past life. So the theory goes: in life 
                              these five constituents are inconstant, forever changing and are 
                              impermanent. When impermanent the individual composing of the five 
                              constituents is consistently suffering. These five constituents being ever 
                              changing have no organizing principle or soul or permanent essence apart 
                              from the constituents. This is the rationale of the anatta doctrine.</span></span></p>

                              invented the idea of God and Soul for self-protection and self-preservation. 
                              God is supposed to protect man for safety and security. For 
                              self-preservation, man conceives of a Soul or Atman, which will live 
                              eternally. All other religions cling on to these entities of God and Soul 
                              due to selfish motives.  Buddha argued that these ideas are false and 
                              deep-rooted conjured in the minds of the Brahmins. After his enlightenment 
                              he postulated two theories to counter the concept of God and Atman. These 
                              are the <strong>Five Aggregates</strong> and the <strong>Conditioned Genesis</strong>.</span></span></p>

                              which are 1) the body, 2) feelings, 3) perception 4) mental tendencies and 
                              5) consciousness. Try as hard as one may, one can find no essence or a Self 
                              or an Atman in any of these constituents. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>He also emphasized that there is
