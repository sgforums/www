              with many Buddhist teachers on the topic of mindfulness. What prompted you to
              focus on this topic?</span></strong><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> For years I’ve been puzzled by the discrepancies
              between the descriptions of mindfulness given by many modern Vipassana teachers
              and psychologists who rely on them, on the one hand, and the definitions of
              mindfulness we find in traditional Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist literature
              on the other. When I first noticed this disparity about thirty years ago, I
              thought perhaps it was due to differences between Theravada and Mahayana
              Buddhism. But the more I looked into this, the more it appeared to me that
              traditional Theravada and Mahayana sources are largely in accord with each
              other, and it was the modern accounts of mindfulness that departed from both
              traditions.<br> <br> <strong>In what ways do the modern accounts differ?</strong> While mindfulness <em>(sati)</em> is often equated with bare attention, my conversations with—and recent studies
              of works by—the learned monks Bhikkhu Bodhi and Bhikkhu Analayo, and Rupert
              Gethin, president of the Pali Text Society, led me to conclude that bare
              attention corresponds much more closely to the Pali term <em>manasikara,</em> which is commonly translated as “attention” or “mental engagement.” This word
              refers to the initial split seconds of the bare cognizing of an object, before
              one begins to recognize, identify, and conceptualize, and in Buddhist accounts
              it is not regarded as a wholesome mental factor. It is ethically neutral. The
              primary meaning of sati, on the other hand, is recollection, non-forgetfulness.
              This includes <em>retrospective</em> memory of things in the past, <em>prospectively</em> remembering to do something in the future, and present-centered recollection in
              the sense of maintaining unwavering attention to a present reality. The
              opposite of mindfulness is forgetfulness, so mindfulness applied to the breath,
              for instance, involves continuous, unwavering attention to the respiration.
              Mindfulness may be used to <em>sustain</em> bare attention (<em>manasikara)</em>,
              but nowhere do traditional Buddhist sources equate mindfulness with such
              attention.<br> <br> <strong>Does the Buddha ever mention the term <em>manasikara</em> in his mindfulness
              instructions? </strong>Not that I know of. The term figures most prominently in
              Abhidhamma-based treatises on Buddhist psychology. In the Buddha’s practical
              instructions on both <em>samatha</em> (tranquility meditation) and <em>vipassana</em> (insight meditation), the terms <em>sati</em> and <em>sampajanna</em> appear most
              often. <em>Sampajanna</em> is usually translated from the Pali as “clear
              comprehension,” but this type of awareness always has a reflexive quality: It
              invariably entails a monitoring of the state of one’s body or mind, sometimes
              in relation to one’s environment. For this reason, I prefer to translate <em>sampajanna</em> as “introspection,” which here entails discerning observation not only of one’s
              mind but of one’s physical and verbal activities as well.<br> <br> <strong>What are some of the pitfalls of viewing meditation simply as a process of
              bare attention?</strong> When mindfulness is equated with bare attention, it can
              easily lead to the misconception that the cultivation of mindfulness has
              nothing to do with ethics or with the cultivation of wholesome states of mind
              and the attenuation of unwholesome states. Nothing could be further from the
              truth. In the Pali Abhidhamma, where mindfulness is listed as a wholesome
              mental factor, it is not depicted as bare attention, but as a mental factor
              that clearly distinguishes wholesome from unwholesome mental states and
              behavior. And it is used to support wholesome states and counteract unwholesome
              states.<br> <br> <strong>What, then, is the role of bare attention?</strong> The cultivation of bare
              attention is valuable in many ways, and there’s a rapidly growing body of
              research on its benefits for both psychological and physiological disorders.
              But it’s incorrect to equate that with mindfulness, and an even greater error
              to think that’s all there is to <em>vipassana</em>. If that were the case, all
              the Buddha’s teachings on ethics, <em>samadhi</em> (highly focused attention),
              and wisdom would be irrelevant. All too often, people who assume that bare
              attention is all there is to meditation reject the rest of Buddhism as
              clap-trap and mumbo-jumbo. The essential teachings are dismissed rather than one’s
              own preconceptions.<br> <br> <strong>A frequent claim is that bare awareness will automatically prevent
              unwholesome thoughts from arising. Is there any basis for this notion in the
              texts?</strong> Bare awareness as calm, nonreactive awareness of one’s meditative
              object plays a crucial role in samatha practice, which alleviates such
              afflictive mental states as craving, aversion, dullness, agitation, and doubt.
              There are also many accounts in Buddhist texts of people gaining profound,
              liberating insights through what appears to be bare attention. Perhaps the most
              well-known case is that of the wandering ascetic Bahiya. After becoming a
              highly accomplished contemplative, he recognized that he still hadn’t achieved
              liberation, so he sought out the guidance of the Buddha, who told him, “In
              reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard,
              only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to
              the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself.” And
              Bahiya immediately achieved liberation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We could easily conclude from this that bare
              attention is all that is needed in insight meditation. But we must remember
              that Bahiya’s case was exceptional. He had already achieved a very high level
              of spiritual maturation before he met the Buddha, so these quintessential
              instructions were all he needed to completely purify his mind of all mental
              afflictions. For the rest of us, the rich diversity of theories and practices
              in Buddhism can be a great aid. Bare awareness can play an important role in
              this, and on occasion it may indeed prevent unwholesome thoughts from arising.
              But if we stick to bare attention alone, it can also prevent wholesome thoughts
              from arising! For example, meditations for the cultivation of the four sublime
              virtues of lovingkindness, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity are all
              practiced with mindfulness but not bare attention. Bare attention is not a
              complete practice, and by itself it can be helpful and yet very limiting.<br> <br> <strong>Do the differing definitions of mindfulness have any practical bearing? Or
              is this just a semantic issue?</strong> It’s far more than a semantic issue. In
              common usage the English term <em>mindfulness</em> simply means to be aware, or
              heedful. <em>Sati</em> has a much richer connotation, so those wishing to practice
              Buddhist meditation are well advised to gain as clear an understanding of this
              and other related terms as they can, based on the most authoritative sources
              they can find. Otherwise, Buddhist meditation quickly devolves into a vague
              kind of “be here now” mentality, in which the extraordinary depth and richness
              of Buddhist meditative traditions are lost.<br> <br> <strong>Would it help to standardize the meaning of mindfulness?</strong> Out of respect
              for the integrity of each tradition, it would be a mistake to force them all
              into the same mold. It’s important to be sensitive to differences among
              different schools. But insofar as the discourses attributed to the Buddha and
              the major commentaries agree on the meaning of mindfulness, this should be
              recognized by Buddhists of all schools.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In his classic fifth-century work <em>The Path of
              Purification,</em> Buddhaghosa, the most authoritative commentator in the
              Theravada tradition, begins his explanation of this topic by stating that it is
              by means of mindfulness that we are able to recall things or events in the
              past, which echoes the Buddha’s definition of this term. Its characteristic,
              Buddhaghosa writes, is “not floating,” in that the mind is closely engaged with
              the chosen object of attention. Its property is “not losing,” indicating that mindfulness
              enables us to maintain our attention without forgetfulness. Its manifestation
              is “guarding” or being “face to face with the object,” implying that “the rope
              of mindfulness” holds the attention firmly to its chosen object, whether it is
              a relatively stable, single object or a continuum of interrelated events. Its
              basis is “strong noting,” suggesting its discerning quality, which is crucial
              when closely practicing <em>satipatthana</em> (the Four Applications of
              Mindfulness)—mindfulness of the body, feelings, thoughts, and other phenomena.
              As Buddhaghosa comments that mindfulness should be seen as a post set in its
              object, and as a gatekeeper guarding the doors of perception. On the basis of
              this classic, authoritative account, we can easily see why mindfulness is
              essential for <em>samatha</em> and <em>vipassana</em> in particular and for
              spiritual practice in general. Traditionally, <em>samatha</em> is the primary
              method for cultivating mindfulness, while in the practice of <em>vipassana</em> one applies mindfulness and wisdom (panna) to body, mind, feelings, and other
              phenomena.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In its psychological role as recollection, <em>sati</em> is an ordinary mental faculty we use in daily life. Some of the exercises in <em>satipatthana</em>,
              such as contemplating the anatomical parts of the body, can’t possibly be done
              with bare attention—for example, as <em>satipatthana</em> is used in the practice
              of mentally scanning bodily sensations. In all cases, mindfulness as it is
              cultivated in spiritual practice is applied with discerning intelligence, often
              viewing phenomena within the contexts of Buddhist categories such as the five
              aggregates. This is evident in the Buddha’s primary discourse on <em>satipatthana</em>,
              which goes far beyond bare attention.<br> <br> <strong>What’s the difference between mindfulness and right mindfulness? Is there
              such a thing as wrong mindfulness?</strong> A sniper hiding in the grass, waiting to
              shoot his enemy, may be quietly aware of whatever arises with each passing
              moment. But because he is intent on killing, he is practicing wrong
              mindfulness. In fact, what he’s practicing is bare attention without an ethical
              component. Generally speaking, right mindfulness has to be integrated with <em>sampajanna—</em>again,
              introspection involving clear comprehension—and it is only when these two work
              together that right mindfulness can fulfill its intended purpose. Specifically,
              in the practice of the Four Applications of Mindfulness, right mindfulness has
              to occur in the context of the full Noble Eightfold Path: For example, it must
              be guided by right view, motivated by right intention, grounded in ethics, and
              be cultivated in conjunction with right effort. Without right view or right
              intention, one could be practicing bare attention without its ever developing
              into right mindfulness. So bare attention doesn’t by any means capture the
              complete significance of <em>vipassana</em>, but represents only the initial
              phase in the meditative development of right mindfulness.<br> <br> <strong>There’s a tendency in some circles to favor <em>vipassana</em> practice over <em>samatha</em> practice. Can you say something about that?</strong> The term <em>samatha</em>,
              variously translated as “tranquility” or “meditative quiescence,” refers to a
              wide range of practices for the purpose of achieving <em>samadhi</em>, or highly
              focused attention, or single-pointed concentration. Both mindfulness and
              introspection are integral to all <em>samatha</em> practices, and the
              concentrated awareness one achieves through such practice may be applied to any
              kind of object, small or large, simple or complex, relatively stable or
              changing. <em>samatha</em> practice is often overlooked or at best marginalized
              in many contemporary schools of Buddhism, including Zen, Theravada, and Tibetan
              Buddhism. With its emphasis on “sudden enlightenment,” the Zen tradition
              doesn’t teach <em>samatha</em> as a separate practice. Rather, it’s incorporated
              into the <em>zazen</em> practice of “just sitting” and into meditations on <em>koans.</em> This same trend has recently carried over into the modern <em>vipassana</em> tradition, which de-emphasizes <em>samatha</em>. But in traditional Theravada and
              Mahayana literature, <em>samatha</em> practices take a central role in the
              familiar triad of ethics, mental balance (the broader meaning of <em>samadhi</em>),
              and wisdom. Moreover, the array of Buddhist practices taught in the category of
              <em>samadhi</em> covers much more than just developing single-pointed
              concentration. These practices are aimed at cultivating exceptional states of
              mental health and balance, and all insight meditations are optimally practiced
              on that basis. Without mindfulness, mental balance cannot be developed. And
              without the stability and vividness of attention achieved through <em>samatha</em> practice, Buddhist wisdom practices are bound to be impaired by mental
              agitation, dullness, and other hindrances. Ethics and mental balance support
              each other, as do <em>samatha</em> and <em>vipassana</em>.<br> <br> <strong>Mindfulness as a practice is normally associated with the Theravada
              tradition. What role does it play in Vajrayana practice?</strong> Mindfulness, as
              the faculty of sustaining continuous attention on a chosen object, is
              indispensable for all kinds of meditation. In the many visualization exercises
              included in Vajrayana meditations, mindfulness enables one to sustain such
              imagery with stability and clarity. Vajrayana also includes Mahamudra and
              Dzogchen meditations, and here, once again, stable, luminous, nonreactive
              attention is strongly emphasized, as it is in Zen. But the basis for these
              wisdom practices is still the cultivation of mental balance, including calm,
              vivid attention.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In authentic Mahamudra practice, for instance, one
              first trains in the fundamental teachings of the Four Noble Truths, including
              the practices of ethics, mental balance, and wisdom. Then one ventures into the
              Mahayana teachings, especially those on the Bodhisattva ideal, the “Perfection
              of Wisdom” explanations of emptiness and dependent origination, and the
              Buddha-nature. On that basis, one is initiated into Vajrayana Buddhism, with
              its own unique practices for transmuting one’s body, speech, and mind into the
              body, speech, and mind of a buddha. Finally, one is trained in the specific
              view, meditation, and way of life of the Mahamudra tradition. The meditation
              entails a kind of radical “not-doing,” in which one rests in unstructured
              awareness, releasing grasping onto all kinds of sensory appearances, memories,
              and thoughts. As a result of such practice, all experiences gradually arise as
              aids to one’s spiritual awakening, and finally all phenomena are perceived as
              pure expressions of primordial consciousness, or Buddha-nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The first phase of Dzogchen meditation, known as
              the “breakthrough,” is very similar to Mahamudra, and at first glance they may
              seem identical to the bare attention practiced in the modern <em>vipassana</em> tradition and in Zen. But as we’ve noted in the discussion of right
              mindfulness, the context of one’s practice is crucial, and methods that appear
              the same on the surface may have deep, underlying differences. Traditionally,
              Zen monks, for example, would commonly train in ethics and study the great
              treatises of their tradition for years before they would devote themselves
              single-pointedly to meditation. The same is often true in the Theravada and
              Tibetan Buddhism. Each of these traditions presents the practice of meditation
              within the context of its own worldview, deeply informed by Buddhist insights.<br> <br> <strong>What are some of the distinctive features in the Mahayana and Vajrayana
              worldviews that would make their use of mindfulness different from that of the
              Theravada tradition?</strong> Right mindfulness emerges only within the context of
              right view and right intention, and each of those schools of Buddhism has its
              own distinct interpretation of these latter two elements of the Noble Eightfold
              Path. In Theravada Buddhism, right view focuses on the three themes of
              impermanence, suffering, and nonself. Right intention is a motivation for
              practice based on the recognition of the nature and causes of suffering and the
              yearning to gain irreversible liberation from all mental afflictions that lie
              at the root of suffering. Some contemporary Vipassana teachers seldom emphasize
              right view or right intention, and I think it’s doubtful that the practice of
              mindfulness alone will result in any “world-transcending” realizations. Again,
              if mindfulness as it is commonly understood today were all that is needed to
              achieve liberation, then all the rest of the Buddha’s teachings would be
              pointless.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In Mahayana Buddhism, right mindfulness is
              practiced together with the view of emptiness, dependent origination, and
              Buddha-nature, and with the intention to achieve perfect enlightenment for the
              sake of all sentient beings. Without such a view and motivation, it is said
              that the practice of mindfulness and all related forms of meditation will not
              lead to Buddhahood. In the Vajrayana tradition, right view includes the “pure
              vision” of perceiving all phenomena as expressions of primordial consciousness,
              and right intention is the altruistic motivation to achieve perfect
              enlightenment as swiftly as possible for the sake of all beings. This is the
              same motivation as for Mahayana practice, but it has a greater sense of
              urgency.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In each of those cases, mindfulness takes on a
              distinct flavor, just as it does if it’s practiced with a materialistic
              worldview and a mundane motivation—that is, simply to relieve stress and find
              greater happiness in this lifetime alone. When bare attention is practiced
              within the context of a modern, materialistic worldview, there’s no basis for
              believing it will produce the same results as when it’s practiced within the
              context of Theravada, Mahayana, or Vajrayana Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Over the past century, Buddhism has been undergoing
              a kind of Protestant Reformation, with the decline of Buddhist monasticism and
              the increased popularity of meditation among lay Buddhists. It is wonderful
              that so many people nowadays are incorporating Buddhist meditation into their
              daily lives. But it is important not to overlook the value of devoting years to
              the study and practice of meditation as one’s sole vocation. After all, we
              would not entrust our teeth to someone who had simply taken a number of
              dentistry workshops and practiced for an hour or so a day, so shouldn’t we be
              even more careful about entrusting our minds to meditation instructors without
              years of professional training in the theory and practice of meditation?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It all depends on our view and intention with
              regard to meditation. If what we really want is a kind of meditative therapy to
              help us relieve stress, work through personal psychological problems, and lead
              a more balanced life, we don’t need highly trained meditation teachers. But
              insofar as we set our goals higher—to liberation from the cycle of existence
              and the realization of perfect enlightenment—then we need to rely on those who
              have been professionally trained for years in the theory and practice of
              meditation. Traditionally, monastics have played a crucial role in this regard,
              and I hope they will continue to do so in the future. But for that to happen,
              they need to be supported by the Buddhist laity, as they have been in the past.<br> <br> <strong>With part-time Buddhists in our Western communities, are we unlikely to
              produce enlightened teachers?</strong> If we had only part-time scientists, then no
              branch of science would have progressed to its current level of sophistication.
              Likewise, if we had only part-time doctors and psychotherapists, we would be
              much worse off with respect to our physical and mental healthcare. More
              broadly, imagine the world with only part-time mechanics, electricians,
              farmers, and teachers. If we left all the major professions in the hands of
              amateurs, modern civilization would be immeasurably impoverished.</span></p>

              challenging of all human endeavors and entails the deepest transformation of a
              human being from a deluded, miserable creature to an enlightened sage. If we
              wish to produce enlightened teachers in modern society, then individuals who
              wholeheartedly wish to devote themselves to this path—whether or not they want
              to take monastic ordination—should be given all possible support. This would be
              our greatest gift to future generations.</span></p>

              <p>Mindfulness itself does not lead to liberation it is only one of the required factor  -- right concentration (among the  37 factors to enlightenment) of the 8 fold path.  Mindfulness is absolutely necessary for Meditation, without  concentration and mindfulness and cannot overcome pain, cannot gain wisdom. Mangala Vihara now is running Samatha (or mindfulness concentration) Basic Meditation now into its third lesson. Still can just join in (next tuesday 28 July 2015 2nd floor Managa Vihara -&gt; opp Eunos MRT at 7.30pm, runs once a year) those interested can just join in as still can catch up and ask Bhante Raja he is really good in explaining Samatha Mindfulness Meditation and has good presentation and explaination.</p>
              <p>The advertisement poster does not looks good, but the actual session explaination is good with presentation material. Highly recommended. (Explaination in English/Mandarin) this is the third samatha training couse. after finish this , can go thursday (same place) Vipanasana Meditation (walking and sitting). Then finally can go Meditation retreat 5 days to 10 days.</p>
