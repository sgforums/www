              Politics: The Buddha’s Five Conditions</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Patheos November 16, 2016
              by Domyo Burk </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most of us need to talk to others about political matters. We
              need to vent and process, and try to understand. We need to keep ourselves
              conscious of what’s happening in our world so we can respond appropriately.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the same time, our conversations about politics can get
              exhausting, depressing, agitating, repetitive, divisive, judgmental, and even
              hateful. They can discourage us from staying politically engaged – right when
              we need to stay engaged.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Buddha laid out five things to consider before speaking,
              and implied that if our intended statement doesn’t meet all five of these
              conditions, we should remain silent. 
              These conditions are listed below, along with short commentaries on how
              they apply when we’re talking about political issues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Keep in mind, these are very strict instructions. You may
              think you’ll have to remain silent forever, and be unable to enter into
              political dialogue when it matters. Or that you’ll have to keep your feelings
              bottled up until you get depressed, enraged, or sick. These outcomes are not
              desirable; the best way to practice with these instructions is to simply keep
              them in mind before, during, and after your conversations and honestly ask yourself
              how well your speech met the Buddha’s five conditions. Gradually, your speech
              will change. Courageous speech that meets these conditions is incredibly
              powerful – so let’s practice diligently so we can speak effectively in this
              troubled world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Vaca Sutta, Shakyamuni Buddha teaches that a statement
              is well-spoken when it meets all five of these conditions:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1. It is spoken in truth. If you’re honest with yourself,
              there are very, very few political statements you can confidently speak in
              truth – unless you stick to “I” statements. “I read” or “I heard” or “lately
              I’ve been wondering.” It’s best to avoid absolutes, broad generalizations, or
              predictions about the future. For example, instead of saying, “Corporate greed
              is going to destroy our planet,” I might say, “I have heard so many stories
              about corporations prioritizing profits over the well-being of people and
              ecosystems, I worry about the future of our planet.” For more on speaking
              honestly or truthfully, read my recent blog post on the subject.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2. It is spoken beneficially. Wow, this is a hard one, right?
              Are you really going to benefit the people you are speaking to with your
              statement? Are you going to help them clarify their thoughts and feelings?
              Encourage them? Support them? Inform them? If you hope to inform them, are they
              open to being informed, or are you just going to make them feel defensive? Are
              you preaching to the choir so you can hear yourself speak? Are you just looking
              for people to agree with you so you can feel more secure in your worldview?
              Remember to have compassion for yourself here: You may need to speak in order
              to process or vent, in which case the benefit is to you. That can be okay, as
              long as you acknowledge this – out loud, so the people you are speaking to
              understand the context of your speech. And then watch carefully for the point
              at which the conversation stops being beneficial either for you or for others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3. It is spoken with a mind of good-will. Sure, we experience
              anger. Maybe even outrage, or hatred. These experiences tell you that you
              perceive something needs to be protected from danger. Investigate that
              experience. But when you speak, try to keep in mind that the bodhisattva vow is
              about saving all beings. Some beings need to be saved from their greed, hate,
              and delusion (including us). We’re all in this together. If you’re not in the
              mood to feel sympathy or compassion for your enemy, then keep in mind that
              ill-will only generates more ill-will. At least speak as if you feel good-will
              for your enemy – if for no other reason than you’re more likely to be heard,
              change minds, and get your way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">4. It is spoken affectionately. This about the flavor and
              character of your speech. There are many different ways to say the same thing.
              Err on the side of humility, gentleness, kindness, diplomacy, and compassion.
              In the moment, this effort may feel contrived and less than “honest,” but
              affectionate speech reflects the deeper truth of interdependence. In the moment
              you may feel angry and judgmental, but in reality your well-being is intimately
              connected with the well-being of all, and what you really want is peace and
              real happiness for everyone. Choose your words carefully in order to water the
              seeds of your deeper aspirations instead of your momentary fears and frustrations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">5. It is spoken at the right time. This means to pay
              attention to other people and the situation and be sensitive, kind, and
              compassionate. Watch the faces and body language of the people you are speaking
              to. Are they looking more and more agitated or depressed as the conversation
              goes on? Have they lapsed into silence? Are they fidgeting, slouching, or
              looking at their watch or phone? Is the political conversation involving only a
              few people, while others are captive and unwilling listeners? If you have any
              doubt about how other people are feeling during a political conversation, just
              ask them, “Do you want to change the subject?” Very few of our political
              conversations are critical in determining the future. Sometimes it more
              important to simply connect with people, or be present with them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Carry your Buddhist practice even into your political
              conversations, but remember to use the Buddha’s five conditions to reflect on
              your own speech, not to judge the speech of others. If you are subject to
              speech from others that doesn’t meet these conditions, become mindful of your
              own state of mind and body. Can you listen compassionately and offer something
              beneficial when the time is right? Is it worth putting up with some discomfort
              in order to engage in this conversation? Are you able to refrain from getting
              drawn into harmful speech? Or are you getting more and more agitated,
              overwhelmed, depressed, angry, or anxious and the conversation wears on? If
              necessary, ask people to change the subject. Maybe explain that you just need a
              break from political talk. Or, if you need to (and can), quietly leave the
              conversation in order to take care of yourself.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Talking to one another is important, but we’re never going to
              solve the world’s problems in one conversation. There are many other skillful,
              compassionate ways to respond to suffering, and many of them don’t involve any
              speech at all.</span></p>
