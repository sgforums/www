              show intricacies of culture, identity for refugees</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">November 16, 2016 Phys.Org</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Like the colorful, intricately drawn Tibetan sand mandala,
              Tibet is a rich cultural and religious tapestry that includes both Buddhist and
              Muslim communities. The country is not a monolithic Buddhist society as it is
              often portrayed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Chinese invasion of Tibet and the resulting diplomatic
              battle between India and China over the status of the country's Muslim exiles
              in 1960 may show that, just like the ceremonial destruction of the sand
              mandala, the culture and identity of refugee communities can be both complex
              and fragile, according to a Penn State historian.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"What we are seeing now—within both Tibetan Muslim and
              Buddhist refugee communities—is there continues to be this identity crisis
              about what and who they really are," said David Atwill, associate
              professor of history and Asian studies. "And both groups still struggle to
              hold onto those identities in a challenging situation."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Soon after the Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959, a group of
              Tibetan Muslims—referred to as Khache—petitioned Chinese authorities to allow
              them to leave the country and also went into exile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">China initially courted the Khache and then harassed them
              into accepting the Chinese takeover, while India offered overtures to return to
              Kashmir, the mostly Muslim region of India. The Khache, as the name suggests,
              trace their ancestry back to a group of Muslims who emigrated from Kashmir to
              Tibet in the 15th century, Atwill added.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eventually, with the Dalai Lama gone and the threat of
              Chinese oppression deepening, approximately 1,000 of the 5,000 Khache who lived
              in Lhasa, the largest city in Tibet, decided to leave the country, becoming
              another bargaining chip between China and India in their struggle for regional
              dominance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"When the Dalai Lama and all his followers fled, they
              arrived in India as refugees," said Atwill. "However, because the
              Tibetan Muslims left as Kashmiris and Kashmiris were Indian, they arrived in
              India as Indian citizens."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But, even after their exile and their designation as Indian
              citizens, the Khache clung—and continue to cling—to their identities as
              Tibetans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"When I'm interviewing Tibetan Muslims, they really feel
              that when they came to India, they ceased being Tibetan in the eyes of many
              people," said Atwill. "But, if you talk to them, they believe
              themselves to be Tibetan."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although the Khache, unlike their Buddhist expatriates, were
              granted citizenship in India, their arrival in Kashmir was not idyllic and, in
              many ways, their conditions were worse than those that met the Dalai Lama and
              his followers, said Atwill, who published his findings in a recent issue of the
              Journal of Asian Studies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"As soon as they crossed over into India, then—and
              remember Pakistan and India had just separated—being Muslim in India was not an
              ideal identity to have," said Atwill. "And that gets at the catch-22 of
              the situation. Their Kashmiri identity was the reason they were allowed to come
              into India—and they didn't want to shed that—but they did want to cling to
              their Tibetan identity, too."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Economic conditions in their new homes were also less than
              welcoming.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"A decade and a half after arriving, most Tibetan
              Muslims lacked employment, were deprived access to higher education and
              remained in substandard housing," said Atwill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While most of the world rallied behind the plight of the
              Buddhist exiles, little attention was paid to the Khache, further isolating the
              Muslim community and tearing at their identities as Tibetan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The situation was not much better for Khache members who
              stayed in Tibet. Prior to the Chinese takeover of Tibet, the Khache were
              integrated into Tibetan society, often serving as merchants and government
              advisers. The Khache who remained in Tibet after the takeover tended to draw
              the ire of Chinese administrators, while Muslims who emigrated to Tibet from
              China, became the object of scorn from Tibetan Buddhists, who believed the
              Chinese Muslims were in league with the Chinese rulers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Atwill said the situation, which continues today to be fluid
              and volatile for all communities in both Tibet and India, offers a glimpse into
              the complex relationship between identity and refugee status.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The current situation, I think, raises questions about
              what being a refugee means," he said. "What is a refugee community?
              And when do they stop being refugees and start becoming citizens?"</span></p>
