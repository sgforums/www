              <div id="articleDetailContent" class="articleDetailMediumBody"><em>From
              "The Wonder of Presence" by Toni Packer. (c) 2002 by Toni Packer. By
              arrangement with Shambhala Publications, Inc., Boston, <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/frameset_offsite.asp?pageLoc=http://www.shambhala.com/&amp;query=boardID%3D40857%26pageLoc%3D%2Fstory%2F106%2Fstory%5F10658%5F1%2Ehtml&amp;script=/frameset.asp">www.shambhala.com</a>.</em><br><br> Someone asked, "Does it really matter if we 'wake up' or not?"<br><br> A little while ago I took a walk up a hill. What a delightful morning!
              Warmth and coolness were present at the same time. Gentleness pervaded
              the air, and birds were singing everywhere. Wet, sodden shoes passed by
              the croaking pond where tiny little skimmers crisscrossed back and
              forth on the surface of the water, leaving their ever so delicate
              tracks.
              <p>On the big upper field several deer were grazing. Looking up at the
              intruder, their long white tails twitched a little as we looked at each
              other. Then they kept on grazing. Colors dotted the sun-drenched field,
              and blooming grasses were swaying in the breeze. The fragrance of wild
              roses filled the air.
              If you had walked along with me this beautiful morning, we both would
              have laughed at the question whether it matters if we wake up or not.</p>
              <p>Had we been caught up in anger, worry or frustration, we wouldn't have
              laughed. We would not have seen the lovely vibrant field. We have so
              many questions. Whence do they arise? Are there deeper motives to our
              question? Can we wonder about it and look? Someone asked , "Is there
              such a thing as ultimate, complete and total enlightenment?" Are we
              really asking, "If there is such a thing, can I get it?"</p>
              <p>Where does wondering about complete and total enlightenment come from?
              And from where does wanting it arise? And the frustration about not
              getting it? Doesn't it all come our of our deep inner discontent with
              ourselves, with others, and with the world? Sometimes we can't even say
              what it is that causes it; we just feel painfully out of sync. There is
              an inner meaninglessness, a feeling of hollow emptiness. Not the
              emptiness of vast open space, but a feeling of nothing of value inside,
              feeling lonely, cut off from happiness and alienated from people. There
              may be the fear of abandonment, or feeling unloved. All of these things
              are going on in human beings.</p>
              <p>Out of the desire to fill up the inner depletion and find lasting
              contentment may come questions about enlightenment, and with them the
              yearning to find meaning and not feel isolated from everything and
              everyone. The brain creates endless concepts and fantasies to alleviate
              the inner suffering.</p>
              <p>If
              we become increasingly transparent to these movements of thought and
              feeling, we will realize that inner pain is not dissolved by
              conventional ways of dealing with it, materially or spiritually. Money,
              position, acquisitions or relationships have not brought lasting
              contentment. Religions beliefs may provide illusions of security and
              support, but for many of us they simply have not worked. We have
              wandered from one belief system to another, attracted by promises of
              salvation, liberation, or enlightenment, but real hunger for truth and
              clarity can be stilled only with genuine food.</p>
              <p>The discursive mind is capable of throwing up doubts and skeptical
              questions at any time. Maybe we suddenly find ourselves in quiet
              openness, a profound stillness without any feeling of lack. Then
              thought comes in and begins to wonder: "Will this last? Can I get it
              back? Was it real? Was this enlightenment or is there more? It doesn't
              seem enough." Thinking about a past moment of freedom immediately sows
              the seeds of doubt by asking, "Is this all there is? It can't be! There
              must be a more convincing experience than what I just had!" Thoughts
              grow like clinging vines that choke the living presence. Truly being
              here is being unknown, unknowable, unadorned. Being here is absence of
              doubting or affirming thoughts about myself. It is the absence of me!
              Thoughts that arise about me are just thoughts, with their enormous
              power to obscure clarity.</p>
              <p>Is it our task to find out whether or not there is total and complete
              enlightenment like the Buddha proclaimed? I always liked the Buddha's
              sayings: "I truly attained nothing from complete, unexcelled
              enlightenment, and that is why it is called complete, unexcelled
              enlightenment." <em>No-thing,</em> no one to attain it, spaceless space, no one there to occupy it. Just
              alive presence with the evening star in the sky. Dying to all the stuff
              imagined and clung to about oneself - what I am, what I was, what I
              will be, what I could be, should be...</p>
              <p>Can we see all concepts <em>as concepts</em> with deepening clarity and wisdom? Not immediately lurching toward
              something promised in the future that has its sole existence in
              thought? Can we clearly discern what constitutes thinking and what is
              actually present right here without needing to think it? Can we discern
              it effortlessly?</p>
              <p>The open windows, fresh air touching the skin, bright sunshine
              everywhere, all kinds of twittering sounds, crows calling and
              breathing, pulsating life! <em>Caw, caw, caw, caw</em>...Sensations
              throughout the body, breathing, beholding it, not the words, but the
              aliveness of it all. Can we realize now that "complete unexcelled
              enlightenment" is a concept?</p>
              <p>You may sincerely object, "How can I know for sure that enlightenment is just a concept? Maybe it <em>is</em> real. Lots of enlightened teachers have told and written about it. So -
              shall we then ask together: "What is enlightenment beyond all concepts?"</p>
              <p>Let us delve profoundly into this question, not asking for other
              people's descriptions of experiences, not looking for promises, not
              expecting to know for sure, but questioning out of not knowing,
              inquiring meditatively, deeply, darkly, until we don't know anymore
              what is "enlightened" or "unenlightened"! In silently wondering deeply
              without knowing, the conceptual world is left behind. Are we going into
              the question in this way?</p>
              <p>All too often our yearning for something to alleviate the inner
              suffering gets in the way of deep inquiry. Rather than asking, "What is
              enlightenment?" can we question our inner feeling of insufficiency? We
              have tried to fill it with fantasies of all descriptions, with
              entertainment, acquisitions, achievements, relationships, spiritual
              searching, and solemn vows - anything to fill the aching void. But have
              we ever really explored it directly, unconditionally?</p>
              <p>Becoming conscious of it in or out of retreat, can we be with the ache
              of emptiness, not calling it by any name? Let all labels fly into thin
              air and stay with what is here, discomfort without calling it
              discomfort. Staying here with what's indefinable. Not resisting, not
              fighting, not looking for anything else. Just letting what is here be
              here in its entirety, physically, mentally, totally. Letting it be
              without knowing. Not becoming the doer for or against it. Just this
              quiet presence in the midst of the silence of chaos. In this there is
              an unfolding transparency. It happens when one sits patiently,
              silently, unconditionally. By "sitting" I simply mean being totally
              with what is here. Not moving away or toward something else, just
              remaining with the whole thing - an intense presence that includes all
              the bodily sensations, breathing, wind-storming, raining, sunning,
              birding, coughing, fans humming - everything right here, all at once,
              without a seam. Observing thoughts coming up, emotions about to be
              triggered, physical sensations arising and more thoughts, emotions,
              feelings, sensations unfolding and abating - being with it all. There
              isn't any place to escape to. Everything is here without separation.</p>
              <p>Let thoughts come up, let them reveal themselves for what they are and
              disappear. It all is the stuff of dreams, traces from the infinite
              past. Thoughts may trigger fear, but fear too can become transparency.
              When it arises, here it is. Let it be. Don't call it by name - labels
              attract memories and reactions from the past. No need to have any
              feelings about it - they too are empty. Fear is an unavoidable
              occurence in our habitual self-centered consciousness. We can not
              possibly live the illusion of a separate me without experiencing fears
              about what may happen to it. But illusions and dreams can also be seen
              as just dreams and illusions, even though they can arouse tremendous
              inner turbulence in the form of horror, agony, or pleasure. It is all
              part and parcel of human consciousness manifesting as separate me and
              you.</p>
              <p>Sitting quietly, watching things come up time and time again, a tape
              may be playing: "Is that what meditation is all about? I don't want to
              spend the rest of my meditative life watching endless repetitions of
              garbage." But the important thing is not what is seen but the quality
              of the seeing. When a person asks, "Is watching the comings and goings
              of thoughts and emotions all there is to meditation?" I say that it all
              depends on the quality of the watching. Is it consumed by judging, by
              feeling guilty, ashamed, or impatient? As those mental movements occur,
              see them for what they are and don't be disturbed by them. That is
              choiceless awareness - no separate watcher occupying center stage. The
              inner show is simply displaying itself on its own and needs no
              particular audience, no applause or rejection. Let it all happen as it
              is happening in the infinite space of open presence.</p>
              <p>Is choiceless awareness just another dream, a new illusion? Thought can
              turn anything into a concept by thinking and dreaming about it. See it
              when it happens and don't be fooled by it. Choiceless awareness is not
              an illusion. It is here for human beings like you and me. Tranparency
              unfolds on its own, revealing all there is as it is, in utter
              directness and simplicity, without need for a director.</p>
              <p>Actually, awareness is here even during times of darkness. Presence
              never goes anywhere. This is not a dogmatic statement but a simple fact
              that each one of us can come upon. See the cloud, the darkness! Hear
              the wind! Feel the breathing! Smell the flowers! Touch the swaying
              grasses! Clouds, wind, thoughts, breathing, fragrant flowers, and
              grasses change all the time, but seeing is here without time. Even
              though doubts may obscure it, it is here the instant the mind stops and
              every cell of the body opens to hear and see and be.</p>
              <p>No need to bother one's head about what has been said. Being present is
              all of oneself, not just the head! We are this entire living creation
              from moment to moment without a break. Walk innocently through the
              fields, into the woods, along the ocean beach or in the city streets
              with the sheer joy of aliveness, its infinite movements and sounds and
              fragrance - the love of it all without making a thing out of it!</p>
              <p>Are we here?</p>
