              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 1.231;"></strong><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 1.231; color: #0088cc;"><a style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/contents/authors/pinar-tremblay.html">Pinar Tremblay</a> </span><span style="font-size: 9pt;">August 24, 2015</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> Al-Monitor</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; text-align: justify;">There is a strong bond between men
                  and beads in Turkey. Tesbih — worry or prayer beads — are used by men
                  from all walks of life in Turkey and are an essential accessory to long,
                  passionate debates. Tesbih could be the easiest topic of conversation
                  started in male-dominated coffee houses or upscale social clubs in Turkey.
                  Despite growing female interest in tesbihs, they are still an
                  almost-exclusively male domain. The artisans, designers, salespeople and
                  customers are almost all men. It is even seen as a sign of strong masculinity
                  in different communities in Turkey.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The traditional use
                  of worry beads, or tesbih, thrives in modern times as a tool for personal
                  therapy, a status symbol and a faithful companion.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 9.35pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 18.7pt;">The first time I
                  entered a tesbih store at the famous Grand Bazaar of Istanbul, a middle-aged
                  shopkeeper asked with an uninterested voice, “Who will you buying the tesbih
                  for?” Before I could even answer he said, “If it is your boyfriend, you should
                  not spend much, but if it is your dad or uncle, then I can show you some
                  high-quality tesbihs.” Mustafa Bey, a tesbih salesman for 15 years, said,
                  “Young women buy tesbihs for their novice tesbih-aspiring boyfriends, who fail
                  to appreciate their value. They lose the tesbih promptly, which leads to
                  quarrels between the couple.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Indeed, when you sit
                  down at a cafe or a restaurant in Turkey, briefly watch the men as they put
                  down their cellphones, cigarette packages, lighters and tesbihs. You may appreciate
                  the love and the strong bond Turkish men feel for their tesbihs, keeping them
                  as close as their phones.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The beads have a long
                  and amazing history, and incredible variety. There are basic categories
                  in evaluating a tesbih: the material used to make the
                  tesbih; the number and size of the beads (if there is a piece
                  of a slightly different size or texture, it is called a drunk
                  bead); harmony of color and sound that the beads produce
                  together; originality; and artisanship and the strength of the top piece,
                  called the imame. This is the piece that holds all the others together; it
                  is the first sign of quality artisanship in a tesbih. Most generic products use
                  a silver bead for the imame, but the precious ones use the same material as the
                  beads. The last category is the simplicity factor. Intriguingly, the most
                  precious tesbihs are the least eye-catching ones. As one tesbih lover
                  explained, “it is not jewelry to show off, but a companion.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Worry or prayer beads
                  can be found in almost every culture and religion. <a href="http://www.catholic.org/prayers/rosary.php"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Catholic rosaries</span></a>, the prayer rope of<span> </span><a href="http://www.orthodoxprayer.org/Prayer%20Rope.html"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Orthodox churches,</span></a> Irish marble
                  worry stones and <a href="http://www.yowangdu.com/tibetan-buddhism/malas.html"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Buddhist or Tibetan</span></a><span> </span>prayer beads (malas) are well-known
                  all around the world. But prayer beads go beyond the holy prayer sites in some
                  cultures. For example, in Greece, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH8yiMphCvA"><span style="color: #0088cc;">using worry beads (komboloi)</span></a><span> </span>is seen as a<span> </span><a href="http://www.komboloi.gr/index2e.html"><span style="color: #0088cc;">daily secular activity</span></a>, as it is in Turkey.
                  The beads have long made their way out of the mosques and churches in the
                  region and have become a companion of men.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The traditional
                  materials used to make tesbihs are crucial and continue to be used. Kadir Sukru
                  Karateke, a prominent tesbih artisan master who runs his family tesbih store of
                  61 years in the <a href="http://kapalicarsirehberi.org/cemil-ve-kadir-sukru-karateke-tesbihci-prayer-beads/"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Grand Bazaar</span><span><span style="color: #0088cc;"> </span></span></a>of Istanbul, told Al-Monitor,
                  “Origins of prayer bead materials fall into four broad categories:
                  precious stones, different types of wood, animal products or fossils. The
                  harder the material of the bead, or the rarer it is, the more
                  intricate artisanship will be involved, increasing the value of the tesbih.”
                  Snakewood, olive, sandalwood, palm, tamarind, apple and walnut trees are
                  commonly used. One story<span> </span><a href="http://www.milliyet.com.tr/tespihlerin-insan-sagligina-pembenar-detay-genelsaglik-1801848/"><span style="color: #0088cc;">frequently shared</span></a><span> </span>is about the health benefits of the
                  different materials used. For example, kuka, a tropical fruit pit harder than
                  coconut, was known as the tesbih of medical doctors during the Ottoman era. The
                  kuka pits are known to act as a natural disinfectant, while releasing a
                  pleasant scent when rolled between fingers. Several other tree-based beads are
                  valued for their special scents. Their color also darkens over time, like
                  leather, increasing their worth. Bagh tesbihs made from the shells of the
                  threatened Caretta turtle (loggerhead) are extremely precious, like those
                  from elephant tusks. Although several precious stones are used in tesbih
                  making, amber has gained popularity in the recent years, prized for its
                  beauty and calming effects.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Making tesbihs has
                  been a thriving industry in Turkey in the past decade both for international
                  and domestic markets, said Karateke.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">“Once the customer or
                  the master decides upon the material to be used, then it is all about the
                  patience and dedication," he said. "The traditional styles and
                  methods are still applied today, with certain modern touches. For example, the
                  new trend is to write the name of the owner somewhere either on the stones
                  or the silver or golden tassel.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Even "evil
                  eye" designs can now be seen in unique tesbihs. Karateke explained
                  that the number of beads in tesbihs can vary: Tesbihs used daily
                  are usually short, with 33 beads; others having 99 beads mostly
                  are used for prayer. But he told Al-Monitor, “There are those rare ones made
                  with 500 or 1,000 beads as well.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Every element of a
                  tesbih — each section between the beads, the big piece marking the
                  beginning of the imame, the last piece at the top of the imame called
                  the tepelik, even the way the knot of the string is hidden — has a
                  specific name and will be evaluated by the careful eyes of tesbih lovers.
                  Karateke explained, “Collectors know who the master maker is once they evaluate
                  the tesbih, because each has their own signature in the product.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The number of tesbih
                  collectors is increasing in Turkey. Prominent collectors such as Turkish
                  President <a href="http://www.sabah.com.tr/ekonomi/2011/02/27/gayrimenkul_yerine_tespih_aliyor"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Recep Tayyip Erdogan</span></a> and several
                  other Turkish politicians enjoy posing with tesbihs to connect<span> </span><a href="http://www.cnnturk.com/video/turkiye/bahceli-adana-isi-yapalim-dedi-tesbihini-cikarip"><span style="color: #0088cc;">with their constituencies</span></a>.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Interestingly,
                  tesbihs are popular among the<span> </span><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/new-turkey-nationalists.html"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Gray Wolves</span></a><span> </span>ultranationalist group of Turkey;
                  many members consider tesbihs a must-have for their image.
                  Yet, tesbih can be seen in the hands of almost all Turkish men, from<span> </span><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/11/turkey-government-alevi-demands.html"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Alevi</span></a><span> </span>taxi drivers to Kurdish college
                  professors to Marxist parliamentarians. They can be seen in movie
                  theaters — and soccer matches.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Soli Ozel, a
                  professor of international relations from<span> </span><a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2015/05/turkey-israel-nato-public-perception-of-turks.html"><span style="color: #0088cc;">Kadir Has University</span></a><span> </span>of Istanbul, is a skillful modern
                  tesbih lover who can use his phone and tesbih simultaneously. Ozel told
                  Al-Monitor, “I enjoy the tesbih because it keeps my hands occupied. It has to
                  be just the right size, though; the beads should not be too small or big.” Ozel
                  confessed to misplacing his tesbih from time to time, but also added that he
                  has not received negative reactions for his tesbih dedication, only some
                  curious questions if he is abroad.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">A sign of manhood or
                  piety, a rite of passage — tesbihs are indeed companions. They help pass
                  time, they are part of prayer and their use can become a
                  habit to calm nerves or even to beat an addiction. In the era of iPods,
                  smartphones and tablets, you can still find tesbihs present in coffee
                  houses of poor areas or executive offices of rich neighborhoods. It is quite
                  amazing how a string of beads carries centuries of stories and bonds Turks
                  together culturally.</span></p>
