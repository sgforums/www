              Hi frens out there,
              
              i juz wanna find out more about this yi guang dao in singapore...can any1 brief me?
              
              my dad's maid left &amp; i found in her belongings 2booklets of 'elementary class &amp; advance' from 'chong hua tong tou teck hwee' which out of curiousity, took out &amp; read thru.
              
              the most disturbing matter is the statement that says--'lao mu niang' is 
              - the heavenly Father, Allah, Jehovah, &amp; few others which i will put it aside first.
              
              As i believed &amp; respected all religious groups in Singapore where our Government promote unity in singapore regardless of race, language or religion. but this 'religion' which i made few enquiries after for the first time read their handbook, is yi guang dao. Even my parents were brought in, i never question. as i thought it was juz another religion that promote well being &amp; unity. but after i browse thru my dad's maid's handbook(my mom passed away with cancer not understanding the course of this religion which she asked me at her death bed. which that time concern me alittle.)but after i read my dad's maid's handbook, i am really concern now...
              
              i always understood &amp; believed &amp; respected that the heavenly Father, Allah, Jehovah is the 'He' God. not the lao mu niang(in chinese)saying old mother(in direct english interpretation),the 'she god'.
              
              can anyone advise, comment, etc?
              
              thx

              thx lots...i have just read....then is this so called 'religion' illegal in Singapore? since it distorted truths in Buddhism?why aren't the Government doing something about it? or why was this 'religion' passed &amp; got the license to operate in Singapore? i'm sure the Ministry will go thru their so called man-made scriptures before they allow ygd to be operative in Singapore.but i can't make real sense in their 5religions into one.they don't touch much on christianity(jesus)or islam.they touch more on taoism &amp; buddhism.they mixed the 2 together more.like one of the post that said its rojak.rojak it is!they emphasize 5 religions &amp; my maid was islam.no wonder they able to 'con' or 'persuade' her to join.but my parents(when my mom still alive)first two maids per what i remembered,they refused to join even incessant calling by their members which i had seen before.but i never ask.as i thought it was their own free will to choose.also i understand islam is strict where switching or changing religion is forbidden.&amp; i respect that too.but to think back,the ygd members were very insistent,persuasive,etc to recruit new members.but my parents were neutral.quiet about it.never ask me.but my mom,at her death bed,was in doubt &amp; confuse about the 'true way' in ygd.which that concerned me.but after reading the previous maid's ygd booklets really make me wake up from the fact what my parents are really getting themselves into.
              i know there's no way to stop the operation of ygd in singapore since the Government has approved their license.now my headache is how to get my dad out of this rojak religion....if you have a way,pls do let me know.unless Government found something not right in this rojak religion,then maybe.......................................................

              <p>Their rules are very doubtful. Non converts (non yi guan dao member) are not allowed to see how they pray or enter their temples. Most of the mainstream religions have no such rules. Furthermore, they have vows like strike by thunders if they were to convert to other religion. Tell your dad about these and he will think deeper about it. There are many yi guan dao members converted to Buddhists and they are still well and fine ( not strike by thunders). However, there's one thing that I praise them for is most of the yi guan dao followers are vegetarians.</p>

              <p>Government is impartial about religions. As long as the religion is not disturbing how society works, e.g. Jehovah Witness who defaults NS, then the government will not do anything to stop that religion. It is not their concern whether a teaching is true to Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Yi Guan Dao is distorting Buddhism, they are not true and correct teachings from the perspective of Buddhism. But if their adherents do not harm society and others, then they will be left alone.</p>

              thanks all...will try......
              
              yes,my parents are vegetarians.my mom(passed away)was vegetarian for almost 20years.but at the end,she told me she doesn't know the meaning of taking vegetarian.as she said the ygd tan zhu told her to take,so she took without understanding.
              
              i agree totally ygd distort Buddhism&amp; mislead ppl .for now i see its true ygd does not harm society physically.but i feel they harm the soul(spiritually).
              
              i asked my elder sis that day on ydg after reading what you all good samaritans wrote.then i realized she also attended ygd.but was in questioned when they changed scriptures twice per her knowing &amp; the five words initially wasn't 'wu tai fo mi le'. then we discussed &amp; she stopped going to 'fo tang'.&amp; even stopped her sons too.now the problem is my dad.as i understand from my elder sis that they have a colaborium meant for own ygd ppl.&amp; my mom is put there to 'rest'.&amp; if my dad were to 'come out' from ygd,he will not be put to 'rest' with his wife when his time is up.my elder sis also said that she's sure our dad will be scared of the 'swear' he made too...&amp; of the thunder.we felt that old ppl are more frightened &amp; will not take the risk.&amp; he too has booked a place at their ygd colaborium.but we felt my mom was more gutsy than my dad.as at her death bed,she questioned about ydg.but it was all too late.
              
              that's the real headache.....but will still try &amp; see how....
              
              thanks

              <p>ygd was during the ming dynasty period on political motive. present days ygd is ok, but can't achieve their desired destination. based on the above vow, it's advisable that all ygd relinguishes their faith or confess and ,move into total reformation and restructuring cos it's developing much more demerits points vs their merit points on vegetarianism. yr dad is too aged, go for pureland amitabha. leave the thunder if any for guan yin pusa to handle lah. most of the thunders are from electrodes in cloud that discharge electric current at opportune moment. As for thunder god, it's very rare and occur with meritoracy of others.</p>
