              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">The Death Penalty in South
              Asia</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Jivesh Jha May 18, 2017 The
              Diplomat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nepal,
              Bhutan, and Sri Lanka have effectively abolished capital punishment. The rest
              of South Asia hasn’t.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Many
              that live deserve death. And some that die deserve life. Can you give it to
              them? Then do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment.” So wrote English
              author JRR Tolkein in his popular Lord of the Rings series. India’s Mahatma
              Gandhi put it this way: “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              much of the world has come around to a similar view — that one killing cannot
              be avenged with another — most South Asian states maintain a fondness for
              capital punishment, with Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka as the exceptions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              constitutions of Nepal (Article 16), and Bhutan (Article 7-18) both prohibit
              the death penalty. Interestingly, though the death penalty has a legal
              foundation in Sri Lanka there have been no executions in the Buddhist state
              since 1976. Legal practice shows that the state has moved a step toward
              abolition, following the global trend.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Conversely,
              the South Asian states of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, and
              Pakistan all firmly believe that the death penalty can deter people with evil
              intent. In this context, the Indian legal system fails to buy into the words of
              Gandhi, who is considered to be Bapu (founding father) of the world’s largest
              democracy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Indian Penal Code (IPC)-1860 (amended in 2013) prescribes the death penalty for
              as many as 11 offenses, including waging war against the government, abetting
              mutiny by a member of the armed forces, acid attack, murder, rape, and criminal
              conspiracy. Similar legal frameworks for the death penalty (save for acid
              attack) have been provisioned under the Bangladesh Penal Code.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Pakistan, capital punishment is provisioned for no less than 27 different
              offenses, to include blasphemy, sexual intercourse outside of marriage,
              outraging the modesty of a woman, and smuggling drugs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Afghanistan, various crimes — murder, apostasy, homosexuality, rape, terrorism,
              drug trafficking, adultery, treason, or desertion — are punishable by death
              based on Islamic jurisprudence. The Maldivian legal position on the death
              penalty is similar to Afghanistan’s.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Generally,
              an accused merits the fate of legal death in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
              Maldives, and Afghanistan when the crimes committed meet the threshold of “most
              serious crimes.” Blasphemy, adultery, or drug trafficking do not necessarily
              meet the threshold of “most serious crimes” but are still punishable by death
              in Pakistan and many other Islamic countries, including Maldives and
              Afghanistan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India’s
              Supreme Court, in the landmark case of Bachan Singh vs.State of Punjab (1980),
              forwarded the doctrine of “rarest of rare,” arguing that life imprisonment is
              the rule while a death sentence is the exception. The top court held that the
              death penalty could be imposed “when [society’s] collective conscience is so
              shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power center to inflict
              death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or
              otherwise of retaining death penalty.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              though there is no statutory definition of “rarest of the rare” cases, its
              widely believed that the pre-planned, brutal, cold-blooded, and sordid nature
              of a crime, without giving any chance to the victim, is taken into consideration
              to decide whether a particular case falls within the purview of “rarest of the
              rare.” India’s Supreme Court recently used this metric to award the death
              penalty to the accused in a high-profile 2012 gang-rape case.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              “collective conscience” metric for awarding the death penalty is problematic.
              If a judge feels that the collective conscience is so shocked that it’s
              desirable to inflict the death penalty on the accused, then can he or she hear
              the case entirely on merit? Will the judge ensure a fair trial and presume the
              accused innocent until proven guilty?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Additionally,
              in the 21st century world we live in — fully equipped with 24-hour TV and
              social media on tap — outrage can be manufactured and reality can be distorted.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              collective conscience doctrine is not a very clear-cut concept and its in want
              of a healthy debate in India,” opines Dr. Nidhi Saxena, a faculty member in
              international law at Sikkim Central University, India. She adds that the
              judicial pronouncements may not address the collective conscience, as public
              participation was not ensured in the entire decision making process.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Beyond
              the specific issues with the “collective conscience” rule, many believe that
              the taking of a life by the judiciary is simply unjust and inhuman and its continued
              practice is a stain on a society standing on humanitarian values. Beyond this,
              the death penalty regime is a clear violation Article 6 (right to life) of the
              International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 3 of
              the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. And, interestingly, India, Pakistan,
              Maldives, and Afghanistan are signatories to these conventions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although
              the task remains unfulfilled, the second optional protocol to ICCPR was
              introduced in 1991 with the aim of abolishing of the death penalty globally.
              However, the instrument only succeeded in imposing an obligation on the
              international community to disallow capital punishment in the case of minors
              and pregnant women.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
              this, the Maldivian parliament recently enacted a law that confirms death
              penalty can be applied to a minor who commits an intentional murder or any
              serious crime.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              UN resolution that called for a global moratorium on the death penalty was
              passed by the General Assembly on December 19, 2016. It was supported by 117
              states; 40 voted against it and 31 abstained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Moreover,
              the International Criminal Court, which is situated in The Hague, also slams
              the death penalty and favors life imprisonment even for crimes against
              humanity, such as genocide.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              as the global trend roots for abolition, the states imposing the death penalty
              justify their slated position. They appeal to each state’s sovereign rights to
              determine its own law (as enshrined under Article 2 Paragraph 7 of the UN
              Charter, i.e., the principle of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of a
              state). They also argue that the death penalty is exercised in rare cases and
              insist their legal systems guarantee rule of law and ample procedural
              safeguards for a fair and speedy trial.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              “abolition is now entrenched in human rights discourse and it cannot be limited
              to national criminal jurisprudence. If one makes the ‘sovereignty defense’ then
              its simply a frivolous justification,” says Saxena.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ultimately,
              the “death penalty is not a strong enough deterrent; rather effective laws and
              order are,” Saxena argues. Though a section of the population in India favors
              the death penalty for crimes involving women and children or terrorism,  she believes“the move towards a more
              enlightened approach (i.e., abolition) could be initiated in Parliament.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              criminal jurisprudence of most of South Asia on death penalty falls short of
              international obligations and its high time to rethink their stand on the death
              penalty.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              per the reports of Amnesty International, around 140 countries — more than
              two-third of the world — have abolished the death penalty in law or practice.
              The South Asian states, except Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka, are out of step
              with this global trend.</span></p>
