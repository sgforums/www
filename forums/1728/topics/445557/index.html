              <p>I am sorry to hear what you have been going through. Before we talk about wisdom, I advise you to believe strongly in Goddess of Mercy (Bodhisattva).

You can recite silently in your heart if you don't have the time to sit down and recite. Ask her for whatever help you need to pull through you current situation. You may not see the immediate effect but helps will come in many forms. You may meet people who are willing to help you etc. However, praying alone and do nothing to help yourself is also not right. Bodhisattva will only help those who help themseves.</p>
              <p>If you believe in karma, I would say yes, this is not just your karma but collective karma. Buddha taught us that everything is impermanent, be it good or bad.

              When one is accepting of things/people/world as they are NOT one is accepting of all. Of course, it presupposes that one is always ''dying' to the concepts, the conditioning of what a husband should be, what life should be, 'dying' to the roles as soon as they are finished.
              The so-called problems will remain as long as the above are not reconciled and that includes i dont like this, i like this!
              
              Dying to the past has been misconstrued as keeping what is 'good'' and letting go of what is 'bad''.  No such thing!

              <p>Yes, take Dawnfirstlight's advice to constantly recite the name of Guan Yin Bodhisattva (Namo Guan Shi Yin Pusa).  Dedicate any merits accrued from reciting the Guan Yin's name towards the well-being of yourself and your family.  Guan Yin Pusa is very compassionate and merciful; have faith.  <br><br>For the time being, perhaps the whirlwind of life will not stop just because you want it to, and that's probably all the more frazzling for you.  If possible, take some time out during coffee breaks, at lunchtime or in the evenings after washing the dishes to just allow yourself 5 minutes of thinking nothing, doing nothing... just rest your mind.  <br><br>Anytime you feel despair, you can also try this method of just relaxing and letting your mind rest.  Just be kind to yourself for 5-10 minutes and allow peace to be felt.  <br><br>Like Dawnfirstlight said, you can pull through.</p>

               If one chants any word/mantra/?? in the mind incessantly, ''other'' thoughts end cos they have no space to ''occupy''. One may assume that one is meditating, one is not! 
              
              The continous chanting can be likened to ''autohypnosis'' ( a device that provides for ...);  It does not allow for one to ''awaken'' or be ''englightened"or ...; certainly one is bound to have a good feeling of being well  n .... It is like having taken a shower and of course one feels refreshed and reality is that it does not last. Also, there is no transcending, merely that of suppressing ....(???) and one has to repeat that particualar mantra (or ...) to keep whatever that one does not want to expereince.

              <p>Hi SeekTruth,</p>
              <p>Yes, this is karma, however, it doesn't mean that u should just feel despair and resign yourself to it.  Karma is simple, for eg. someone eats something poisonous, then the result is that she gets sick, so there is a cause for everything.  You need not feel guilty or blame yourself for it.  Instead, tell yourself that you are going to create positive causes for a better future.  </p>
              <p>The main way that Dharma can help you is through releasing the worry and negativity in your mind through deeper understanding, which will indirectly help your life.  One of the main thing about all of life situations is that it is impermanent, you may be going through a rough patch now, but if you can hold yourself together positively, one day, it too can pass.</p>
              <p>If you are interested, you could participate in the following events... </p>

              <p>My husband has not been working for two years and may not be working in the future.  I have two boys in primary school.  The burden of supporting the family is on me and I have poor health.  My two boys have poor results and are very disobedient.  I believe in the teaching of the buddha.  I wonder what will the buddha advise me to do. I have difficulty performing my job as I am troubled by my family problems and am now trying to look for another job.  Every morning, I wake up feeling despair.  I am trying to provide for the family, cope with a troubled husband and try to help my children succeed in their studies.  How can I find the strength and wisdom to balance all these by practising the Dharma?   Is this my karma? Should I accept my karma and accept things as they are? </p>

By accepting things as they are, you may find temporarily respite and a sense of comfort but it is not going to solve your present problems and may lead to a whole cycle of inaction. By all means find solace in the suggestions posted on these thread. But I think you should also try to contact the nearest CDC in your area for advices and help. If they are not able to assist you, they are likely to put you to other relevant organizations which can assist you in some ways.</span></span></p>

              morning and  feel that it gives me a sense of peace and temporary relief

              If you can get your family members to attend some Buddhist classes, help them plant seeds of good affinity.
                  Attend the classes, learn teachings to help you deal with sufferings, that you may face them and deal with them better!
                  Even if any of that does'nt come to do any good, (at least not immediately),surely it will not come to do any harm!
              There will be some advice which will resonate with you, bringing some respite, and avoid creating further negatively if you can! You try to chant parittas, I have personally found them to be effective!
              May you be happy and secure!
              SABBE SATTA SUKHITA HONTU!

              <p>I'm glad that you starting to recite. Regarding your children's poor results, I have something to share with you. Of course, all parents hope that their children score well but some children don't have affinity with books. One of my sibling is one of them. Among us, he dropped out school early but he's now a boss with employees and he earns more than any of us. Although results are important in today's society but it is not eveything and poor results also do not mean no future. Of course, I still encourage you to do something about your children's studies like sending them for tuition. I know Bright Hill Temple and some other organisation are giving free tuition, you may check it out.</p>

              Why the suffering? My guess is that of not accepting of what is at hand (what is not) and worse is that of comparing oneself and the wishing and wanting. The suffering is psychological and till that is acknowledged, understood one''s problems may go away or be resolved but the nature of living is such that something will always come up to .....
              One who compares onself will certainly compare one's siblings one's children and these woould percolate and permeate one's daily living.
              
              It is fine to practice or chant, but one has to be wary of the pitfalls of such a stance, it merely relieves n it does not solve a situational ''problem".

              <p>Our Great Teacher said, before he passes away, "Dhamma pada Sankhara, Appamedena Sampadetha". =&gt; "All Conditioned things are Transient, Strive On Earnestly"</p>
              <p>I know it is hard for you. I may even seem heartless to talk like that. But if you contemplate hard enough, that is the way things is.</p>
              <p>Accept the Karma? I don't think you have a choice.</p>
              <p>What should you do? Strive On earnestly. Imagine a warrior at war, vastly outnumbered but Determination and Faith kept him going.</p>
              <p>In your case, Strive On earnestly (in case you dont know what to do) will mean, continue to look for employment of better prospects, ask Friends and Relatives for help whether to get jobs or financially. Check out Help Groups or Help Instituitions. Is there anywhere that you can educate your boys cheaper? And dont forget to pray and cultivate wholesomeness.</p>
              <p>Do not just stop and cry, because if you do that, then nothing will happen. </p>

              <p>Hi Seek Truth</p>
              <p>We are what WE ARE TODAY is because of our past. What we will be in the FUTURE will depend on WHAT WE ARE DOING. Everyone has our up and down. This is part of living. Sometime life can be unbearable because things did not turn up as per our expectation.</p>
              <p>I am glad that you are taking one step to seek peace from within by whispering, "Namu Guan Shi Yin Pusa". Continue with the practice as you planting a good seed for a future. Things may not suddenly changed overnite but you can share the compassion you received from Kuan Yin to your husband and children through the daily chore. Of course, the human tendency is we will grumble and swear how unfair this it. However, if you take this opportunity to serve and guide them in kind words, you are already accepting your karma and practising the Buddhist teaching. Each act will become a meritous offering the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.</p>
