              <p>Dhamma and Non-Duality (By Bhikkhu Bodhi)<br><br>One of the most
              challenging issues facing Theravada Buddhism in recent years has been
              the encounter between classical Theravada vipassana meditation and the
              "non-dualistic" contemplative traditions best represented by Advaita
              Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism. Responses to this encounter have spanned
              the extremes, ranging from vehement confrontation all the way to
              attempts at synthesis and hybridization. While the present essay cannot
              pretend to illuminate all the intricate and subtle problems involved in
              this sometimes volatile dialogue, I hope it may contribute a few sparks
              of light from a canonically oriented Theravada perspective.<br><br>My
              first preliminary remark would be to insist that a system of meditative
              practice does not constitute a self-contained discipline. Any authentic
              system of spiritual practice is always found embedded within a
              conceptual matrix that defines the problems the practice is intended to
              solve and the goal toward which it is directed. Hence the merging of
              techniques grounded in incompatible conceptual frameworks is fraught
              with risk. Although such mergers may appease a predilection for
              experimentation or eclecticism, it seems likely that their long-term
              effect will be to create a certain "cognitive dissonance" that will
              reverberate through the deeper levels of the psyche and stir up even
              greater confusion.<br><br>My second remark would be to point out simply
              that non-dualistic spiritual traditions are far from consistent with
              each other, but comprise, rather, a wide variety of views profoundly
              different and inevitably colored by the broader conceptual contours of
              the philosophies which encompass them.<br><br>For the Vedanta,
              non-duality (advaita) means the absence of an ultimate distinction
              between the Atman, the innermost self, and Brahman, the divine reality,
              the underlying ground of the world. From the standpoint of the highest
              realization, only one ultimate reality exists — which is simultaneously
              Atman and Brahman — and the aim of the spiritual quest is to know that
              one's own true self, the Atman, is the timeless reality which is Being,
              Awareness, Bliss. Since all schools of Buddhism reject the idea of the
              Atman, none can accept the non-dualism of Vedanta. From the perspective
              of the Theravada tradition, any quest for the discovery of selfhood,
              whether as a permanent individual self or as an absolute universal
              self, would have to be dismissed as a delusion, a metaphysical blunder
              born from a failure to properly comprehend the nature of concrete
              experience. According to the Pali Suttas, the individual being is
              merely a complex unity of the five aggregates, which are all stamped
              with the three marks of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness. Any
              postulation of selfhood in regard to this compound of transient,
              conditioned phenomena is an instance of "personality view"
              (sakkayaditthi), the most basic fetter that binds beings to the round
              of rebirths. The attainment of liberation, for Buddhism, does not come
              to pass by the realization of a true self or absolute "I," but through
              the dissolution of even the subtlest sense of selfhood in relation to
              the five aggregates, "the abolition of all I-making, mine-making, and
              underlying tendencies to conceit."<br><br>The Mahayana schools, despite
              their great differences, concur in upholding a thesis that, from the
              Theravada point of view, borders on the outrageous. This is the claim
              that there is no ultimate difference between samsara and Nirvana,
              defilement and purity, ignorance and enlightenment. For the Mahayana,
              the enlightenment which the Buddhist path is designed to awaken
              consists precisely in the realization of this non-dualistic
              perspective. The validity of conventional dualities is denied because
              the ultimate nature of all phenomena is emptiness, the lack of any
              substantial or intrinsic reality, and hence in their emptiness all the
              diverse, apparently opposed phenomena posited by mainstream Buddhist
              doctrine finally coincide: "All dharmas have one nature, which is
              no-nature."<br><br>The teaching of the Buddha as found in the Pali
              canon does not endorse a philosophy of non-dualism of any variety, nor,
              I would add, can a non-dualistic perspective be found lying implicit
              within the Buddha's discourses. At the same time, however, I would not
              maintain that the Pali Suttas propose dualism, the positing of duality
              as a metaphysical hypothesis aimed at intellectual assent. I would
              characterize the Buddha's intent in the Canon as primarily pragmatic
              rather than speculative, though I would also qualify this by saying
              that this pragmatism does not operate in a philosophical void but finds
              its grounding in the nature of actuality as the Buddha penetrated it in
              his enlightenment. In contrast to the non-dualistic systems, the
              Buddha's approach does not aim at the discovery of a unifying principle
              behind or beneath our experience of the world. Instead it takes the
              concrete fact of living experience, with all its buzzing confusion of
              contrasts and tensions, as its starting point and framework, within
              which it attempts to diagnose the central problem at the core of human
              existence and to offer a way to its solution. Hence the polestar of the
              Buddhist path is not a final unity but the extinction of suffering,
              which brings the resolution of the existential dilemma at its most
              fundamental level.<br><br>When we investigate our experience exactly as
              it presents itself, we find that it is permeated by a number of
              critically important dualities with profound implications for the
              spiritual quest. The Buddha's teaching, as recorded in the Pali Suttas,
              fixes our attention unflinchingly upon these dualities and treats their
              acknowledgment as the indispensable basis for any honest search for
              liberating wisdom. It is precisely these antitheses — of good and evil,
              suffering and happiness, wisdom and ignorance — that make the quest for
              enlightenment and deliverance such a vitally crucial concern.<br><br>At
              the peak of the pairs of opposites stands the duality of the
              conditioned and the Unconditioned: samsara as the round of repeated
              birth and death wherein all is impermanent, subject to change, and
              liable to suffering, and Nibbana as the state of final deliverance, the
              unborn, ageless, and deathless. Although Nibbana, even in the early
              texts, is definitely cast as an ultimate reality and not merely as an
              ethical or psychological state, there is not the least insinuation that
              this reality is metaphysically indistinguishable at some profound level
              from its manifest opposite, samsara. To the contrary, the Buddha's
              repeated lesson is that samsara is the realm of suffering governed by
              greed, hatred, and delusion, wherein we have shed tears greater than
              the waters of the ocean, while Nibbana is irreversible release from
              samsara, to be attained by demolishing greed, hatred, and delusion, and
              by relinquishing all conditioned existence.<br><br>Thus the Theravada
              makes the antithesis of samsara and Nibbana the starting point of the
              entire quest for deliverance. Even more, it treats this antithesis as
              determinative of the final goal, which is precisely the transcendence
              of samsara and the attainment of liberation in Nibbana. Where Theravada
              differs significantly from the Mahayana schools, which also start with
              the duality of samsara and Nirvana, is in its refusal to regard this
              polarity as a mere preparatory lesson tailored for those with blunt
              faculties, to be eventually superseded by some higher realization of
              non-duality. From the standpoint of the Pali Suttas, even for the
              Buddha and the arahants suffering and its cessation, samsara and
              Nibbana, remain distinct.<br><br>Spiritual seekers still exploring the
              different contemplative traditions commonly assume that the highest
              spiritual teaching must be one which posits a metaphysical unity as the
              philosophical foundation and final goal of the quest for enlightenment.
              Taking this assumption to be axiomatic, they may then conclude that the
              Pali Buddhist teaching, with its insistence on the sober assessment of
              dualities, is deficient or provisional, requiring fulfillment by a
              nondualistic realization. For those of such a bent, the dissolution of
              dualities in a final unity will always appear more profound and
              complete.<br><br>However, it is just this assumption that I would
              challenge. I would assert, by reference to the Buddha's own original
              teaching, that profundity and completeness need not be bought at the
              price of distinctions, that they can be achieved at the highest level
              while preserving intact the dualities and diversity so strikingly
              evident to mature reflection on the world. I would add, moreover, that
              the teaching which insists on recognizing real dualities as they are is
              finally more satisfactory. The reason it is more satisfactory, despite
              its denial of the mind's yearning for a comprehensive unity, is because
              it takes account of another factor which overrides in importance the
              quest for unity. This "something else" is the need to remain grounded
              in actuality.<br><br>Where I think the teaching of the Buddha, as
              preserved in the Theravada tradition, surpasses all other attempts to
              resolve the spiritual dilemmas of humanity is in its persistent refusal
              to sacrifice actuality for unity. The Buddha's Dhamma does not point us
              toward an all-embracing absolute in which the tensions of daily
              existence dissolve in metaphysical oneness or inscrutable emptiness. It
              points us, rather, toward actuality as the final sphere of
              comprehension, toward things as they really are (yathabhuta). Above
              all, it points us toward the Four Noble Truths of suffering, its
              origin, its cessation, and the way to its cessation as the liberating
              proclamation of things as they really are. These four truths, the
              Buddha declares, are noble truths, and what makes them noble truths is
              precisely that they are actual, undeviating, invariable (tatha,
              avitatha, anannatha). It is the failure to face the actuality of these
              truths that has caused us to wander for so long through the long course
              of samsara. It is by penetrating these truths exactly as they are that
              one can reach the true consummation of the spiritual quest: making an
              end to suffering.<br><br>In this sequel to the previous essay, I intend
              to discuss three major areas of difference between the Buddha's
              Teaching, which we may refer to here as "the Ariyan Dhamma," and the
              philosophies of non-duality. These areas correspond to the three
              divisions of the Buddhist path — virtue, concentration, and wisdom.<br><br>In
              regard to virtue the distinction between the two teachings is not
              immediately evident, as both generally affirm the importance of
              virtuous conduct at the start of training. The essential difference
              between them emerges, not at the outset, but only later, in the way
              they evaluate the role of morality in the advanced stages of the path.
              For the non-dual systems, all dualities are finally transcended in the
              realization of the non-dual reality, the Absolute or fundamental
              ground. As the Absolute encompasses and transcends all diversity, for
              one who has realized it the distinctions between good and evil, virtue
              and non-virtue, lose their ultimate validity. Such distinctions, it is
              said, are valid only at the conventional level, not at the level of
              final realization; they are binding on the trainee, not on the adept.
              Thus we find that in their historical forms (particularly in Hindu and
              Buddhist Tantra), philosophies of non-duality hold that the conduct of
              the enlightened sage cannot be circumscribed by moral rules. The sage
              has transcended all conventional distinctions of good and evil. He acts
              spontaneously from his intuition of the Ultimate and therefore is no
              longer bound by the rules of morality valid for those still struggling
              toward the light. His behavior is an elusive, incomprehensible outflow
              of what has been called "crazy wisdom."<br><br>For the Ariyan Dhamma,
              the distinction between the two types of conduct, moral and immoral, is
              sharp and clear, and this distinction persists all the way through to
              the consummation of the path: "Bodily conduct is twofold, I say, to be
              cultivated and not to be cultivated, and such conduct is either the one
              or the other" (MN 114). The conduct of the ideal Buddhist sage, the
              arahant, necessarily embodies the highest standards of moral rectitude
              both in the spirit and in the letter, and for him conformity to the
              letter is spontaneous and natural. The Buddha says that the liberated
              one lives restrained by the rules of the Vinaya, seeing danger in the
              slightest faults. He cannot intentionally commit any breach of the
              moral precepts, nor would he ever pursue any course of action motivated
              by desire, hatred, delusion, or fear.<br><br>In the sphere of
              meditation practice or concentration, we again find a striking
              difference in outlook between the non-dual systems and the Ariyan
              Dhamma. Since, for the non-dual systems, distinctions are ultimately
              unreal, meditation practice is not explicitly oriented toward the
              removal of mental defilements and the cultivation of virtuous states of
              mind. In these systems, it is often said that defilements are mere
              appearances devoid of intrinsic reality, even manifestations of the
              Absolute. Hence to engage in a programme of practice to overcome them
              is an exercise in futility, like fleeing from an apparitional demon: to
              seek to eliminate defilements is to reinforce the illusion of duality.
              The meditative themes that ripple through the non-dual currents of
              thought declare: "no defilement and no purity"; "the defilements are in
              essence the same as transcendent wisdom"; "it is by passion that
              passion is removed."<br><br>In the Ariyan Dhamma, the practice of
              meditation unfolds from start to finish as a process of mental
              purification. The process begins with the recognition of the dangers in
              unwholesome states: they are real pollutants of our being that need to
              be restrained and eliminated. The consummation is reached in the
              complete destruction of the defilements through the cultivation of
              their wholesome antidotes. The entire course of practice demands a
              recognition of the differences between the dark and bright qualities of
              the mind, and devolves on effort and diligence: "One does not tolerate
              an arisen unwholesome thought, one abandons it, dispels it, abolishes
              it, nullifies it" (MN 2). The hindrances are "causes of blindness,
              causes of ignorance, destructive to wisdom, not conducive to Nibbana"
              (SN 46:40). The practice of meditation purges the mind of its
              corruptions, preparing the way for the destruction of the cankers
              (asavakkhaya).<br><br>Finally, in the domain of wisdom the Ariyan
              Dhamma and the non-dual systems once again move in contrary directions.
              In the non-dual systems the task of wisdom is to break through the
              diversified appearances (or the appearance of diversity) in order to
              discover the unifying reality that underlies them. Concrete phenomena,
              in their distinctions and their plurality, are mere appearance, while
              true reality is the One: either a substantial Absolute (the Atman,
              Brahman, the Godhead, etc.), or a metaphysical zero (Sunyata, the Void
              Nature of Mind, etc.). For such systems, liberation comes with the
              arrival at the fundamental unity in which opposites merge and
              distinctions evaporate like dew.<br><br>In the Ariyan Dhamma wisdom
              aims at seeing and knowing things as they really are
              (yathabhutananadassana). Hence, to know things as they are, wisdom must
              respect phenomena in their precise particularity. Wisdom leaves
              diversity and plurality untouched. It instead seeks to uncover the
              characteristics of phenomena, to gain insight into their qualities and
              structures. It moves, not in the direction of an all-embracing
              identification with the All, but toward disengagement and detachment,
              release from the All. The cultivation of wisdom in no way "undermines"
              concrete phenomena by reducing them to appearances, nor does it treat
              them as windows opening to some fundamental ground. Instead it
              investigates and discerns, in order to understand things as they are:
              "And what does one understand as it really is? One understands: Such is
              form, such its arising and passing away. Such is feeling...
              perception... formations... consciousness, such its arising and passing
              away." "When one sees, 'All formations are impermanent, all are
              suffering, everything is not self,' one turns away from suffering: this
              is the path to purity."<br><br>Spiritual systems are colored as much by
              their favorite similes as by their formulated tenets. For the non-dual
              systems, two similes stand out as predominant. One is space, which
              simultaneously encompasses all and permeates all yet is nothing
              concrete in itself; the other is the ocean, which remains
              self-identical beneath the changing multitude of its waves. The similes
              used within the Ariyan Dhamma are highly diverse, but one theme that
              unites many of them is acuity of vision — vision which discerns the
              panorama of visible forms clearly and precisely, each in its own
              individuality: "It is just as if there were a lake in a mountain
              recess, clear, limpid, undisturbed, so that a man with good sight
              standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also
              shoals of fish swimming about and resting. He might think: 'There is
              this lake, clear, limpid, undisturbed, and there are these shells,
              gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and
              resting.' So too a monk understands as it actually is: 'This is
              suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of
              suffering, this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.' When
              he knows and sees thus his mind is liberated from the cankers, and with
              the mind's liberation he knows that he is liberated" (MN 39).</p>

              <p>My comments on another forum:</p>
              <p>Just wrote this in another forum's topic on this article:<br><br>Theravada
              is basically a non dual tradition, though it is different from the
              non-dualism (or rather, monism) of Advaita Vedanta and other monistic
              traditions.<br><br>Bhikkhu Bodhi wrote:<br><em><br>"For the Vedanta,
              non-duality (advaita) means the absence of an ultimate distinction
              between the Atman, the innermost self, and Brahman, the divine reality,
              the underlying ground of the world. From the standpoint of the highest
              realization, only one ultimate reality exists -- which is
              simultaneously Atman and Brahman -- and the aim of the spiritual quest
              is to know that one's own true self, the Atman, is the timeless reality
              which is Being, Awareness, Bliss. Since all schools of Buddhism reject
              the idea of the Atman, none can accept the non-dualism of Vedanta. From
              the perspective of the Theravada tradition, any quest for the discovery
              of selfhood, whether as a permanent individual self or as an absolute
              universal self, would have to be dismissed as a delusion, a
              metaphysical blunder born from a failure to properly comprehend the
              nature of concrete experience. According to the Pali Suttas, the
              individual being is merely a complex unity of the five aggregates,
              which are all stamped with the three marks of impermanence, suffering,
              and selflessness. Any postulation of selfhood in regard to this
              compound of transient, conditioned phenomena is an instance of
              "personality view" (sakkayaditthi), the most basic fetter that binds
              beings to the round of rebirths. The attainment of liberation, for
              Buddhism, does not come to pass by the realization of a true self or
              absolute "I," but through the dissolution of even the subtlest sense of
              selfhood in relation to the five aggregates, "the abolition of all
              I-making, mine-making, and underlying tendencies to conceit."</em><br><br><br>Which
              is very true. In Buddhism we do not talk about a metaphysical essence,
              a Self, an Atman. That is not the sort of non-dualism in Buddhism. But
              we must understand that the definitions of non-dualism are many, I can
              at least think of 5 to 10 different explanations and definitions right
              now.<br><br>The experience of no-self is non-dual, the nature of
              experience or anatta means that our experience is always by nature
              non-dual. By 'non-dual' I mean here that it is not split up into a
              subject perceiving or acting upon an object -- in the seeing just the
              seen, no seer. In hearing just sounds, no hearer. Actions happen
              without an actor.<br><br>So as a matter of fact, Bahiya Sutta and so on
              are not talking about something other than 3 characteristics -- it is
              still talking about the 3 characteristics with emphasis on Anatta.<br><br>So
              a person who truly experiences and realises no self experiences
              non-duality, except that he does not reify that experience in any way.
              He does not formulate views of Awareness as some sort of independent,
              permanent Source out of which everything emerges and subsides back to
              while the background remains unchanged and unaffected. That would be
              the 'dualistic' and 'inherent' way of seeing consciousness. That would
              not be the Buddhist way of seeing consciousness but the Hindu,
              eternalist way. That is reifying Consciousness into an inherent
              Universal Self, whereas in Buddhism, consciousness is taught as a
              manifestation of cognizance that dependently originates, nothing
              inherent. Consciousness in Buddhism is also not taught to be an Eternal
              Witness, or a subject perceiving object, but simply a manifestation
              that dependently originates -- so in the seen just the seen, in the
              heard just the heard. They are all manifestation of consciousness not
              making up a Self and hence experience is non-dual.<br><br>In all
              authentic traditions of Buddhism including even the Mahayana and
              Vajrayana, consciousness or buddha-nature is taught to be that way:
              luminous and empty by nature. What is luminous? If all sensations are
              understood as more sensations that are aware where they are, this is
              the luminosity spoken of by those who describe how this happens using
              terms such as primordial awareness or cognizant emptiness, use this
              sort of language to describe that these sensations simply present where
              they are. In this parlance, the primordial awareness is an aspect of
              phenomena, not as a separate thing. Since awareness is intrinsic to all
              phenomena such that all sensations are simply "aware where they are"
              and the luminous awareness aspect cannot be separated from the
              sensation into a separate Watcher or Self, it is non-dual without
              subject-object duality. It is also empty (of inherent existence and
              selfhood) and hence cannot be reified into a universal substratum or
              ontological essence, since consciousness is not an essence but a
              cognizance that dependently originates hence impossible to make up a
              'permanent self'. However, many practitioners including some teachers
              do not get that and fall into the eternalist views of Hinduism. Those
              who experience non-division of subject and object (which itself has
              varying degrees of experience and insight) but cannot overcome the
              deeply inherent and dualistic views of consciousness will get stuck at
              Stage 1 to 4 of Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment ( <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html"><span>http://awakeningtoreality.</span><span>blogspot.com/2007/03/thusn</span><span>esss-six-stages-of-experie</span>nce.html</a> ) Even if he does not experience separation of subject and object, he
              views it as more like the Ultimate Eternal Subject/Self (Consciousness)
              is one with all passing objects, rather than absolutely No-Subject.<br><br>Another
              type of 'non-dualism' that is the deconstruction of views of existence,
              non-existence and so on are also valid and taught by Buddha which
              Element already mentioned. And in fact this applies to Samsara vs
              Nirvana too -- since the nature of Samsara and Nirvana are both
              fundamentally empty and non-dual, views of 'existence, non-existence'
              etc cannot apply to them, nor can we find a Self in or beyond them. In
              the same way the Arhant or Buddha does not find a Self in Samsara, he
              also does not find make Nirvana into something it is not: as an Atman,
              as a Brahman or Source out of which everything emerges from. So again,
              all states whether samsara or nirvana are empty of self.<br><br>As the Buddha says regarding Nirvana as Anatta:<br><br>"He
              directly knows Unbinding as Unbinding. Directly knowing Unbinding as
              Unbinding, let him not conceive things about Unbinding, let him not
              conceive things in Unbinding, let him not conceive things coming out of
              Unbinding, let him not conceive Unbinding as 'mine,' let him not
              delight in Unbinding. Why is that? So that he may comprehend it, I tell
              you."<br><br><br><br>So again, Bhikkhu Bodhi's rejection of certain
              notions of non-dualism especially those of the monistic/eternalist
              traditions is valid but there are other non-dualisms that are valid in
              Buddhism which he did not cover.</p>

                                                  with the Self demonstrated by the non-Buddhists.<br><br> Mahaamati, the Tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those
                                                  grasping to assertions of the Self of the Non-Buddhists, will

                                                  tathaagatagarbha. How else will the sentient beings who have fallen

              <p> </p>
              <p>Loppon Namdrol:<br><br>Were the Buddha to teach such a doctrine, it might be so. However, in the Nirvana sutra is states quite plainly the following:<br><em><br>That
                              is called ‘Buddha-nature’ because all sentient beings are to be
                              unsurpassedly, perfectly, completely enlightened at a future time.
                              Because afflictions exist in all sentient beings at present, because of
                              that, the thirty two perfect marks and the eighty excellent exemplary
                              signs do not exist”.<br></em><br>Here, the Nirvana sutra clearly and
                              precisely states that buddha-svabhaava, the "nature of a Buddha" refers
                              not to an actual nature but a potential. Why, it continues:<br><br><em>"Child of the lineage, I have said that ‘curd exists in milk’, because curd is produced from milk, it is called ‘curd’.<br><br>Child
                              of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there is no
                              butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the curd arises from milk with the
                              conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have the
                              ‘curd-nature’."</em><br><br>So one must be quite careful not to make an
                              error. The Lanka states unequivocably that the tathagatagarbha doctrine
                              is merely a device to lead those who grasp at a true self the inner
                              meaning of the Dharma, non-arising, the two selflessnesses and so on,
                              and explains the meaning of the literal examples some people constantly
                              err about:<br><em><br>"Similarly, that tathaagatagarbha taught in the
                              suutras spoken by the Bhagavan, since the completely pure luminous
                              clear nature is completely pure from the beginning, possessing the
                              thirty two marks, the Bhagavan said it exists inside of the bodies of
                              sentient beings.<br><br>When the Bhagavan described that– like an
                              extremely valuable jewel thoroughly wrapped in a soiled cloth, is
                              thoroughly wrapped by cloth of the aggregates, aayatanas and elements,
                              becoming impure by the conceptuality of the thorough conceptuality
                              suppressed by the passion, anger and ignorance – as permanent, stable
                              and eternal, how is the Bhagavan’s teaching this as the
                              tathaagatagarbha is not similar with as the assertion of self of the
                              non-Buddhists?<br><br>Bhagavan, the non-Buddhists make assertion a Self as “A permanent creator, without qualities, pervasive and imperishable”.<br><br>The Bhagavan replied:<br><br>“Mahaamati, my teaching of tathaagatagarbha is not equivalent with the assertion of the Self of the non-Buddhists.<br><br>Mahaamati,
                              the Tathaagata, Arhat, Samyak Sambuddhas, having demonstrated the

                              signless", etc. as tathaagatagarbha for the purpose of the immature
                              complete forsaking the perishable abodes, demonstrate the expertiential
                              range of the non-appearing abode of complete non-conceptuality by
                              demonstrating the door of tathaagatagarbha.<br><br>Mahaamati, a self should not be perceived as real by Bodhisattva Mahaasattvas enlightened in the future or presently.<br><br>Mahaamati,
                              for example, a potter, makes one mass of atoms of clay into various
                              kinds containers from his hands, craft, a stick, thread and effort.<br><br>Mahaamati,
                              similarly, although Tathaagatas avoid the nature of conceptual
                              selflessness in dharmas, they also appropriately demonstrate
                              tathaagatagarbha or demonstrate emptiness by various kinds [of
                              demonstrations] possessing prajñaa and skillful means; like a potter,
                              they demonstrate with various enumerations of words and letters. As
                              such, because of that,<br><br>Mahaamati, the demonstration of Tathaagatagarbha is not similar with the Self demonstrated by the non-Buddhists.<br><br>Mahaamati,
                              the Tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those grasping to assertions
                              of the Self of the Non-Buddhists, will demonstrate tathaagatagarbha
                              with the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha. How else will the sentient
                              beings who have fallen into a conceptual view of a True Self, possess
                              the thought to abide in the three liberations and quickly attain the
                              complete manifestation of Buddha in unsurpassed perfect, complete
                              enlightenment?"<br></em><br>Thus, the Lanka says:<br><em><br>All yaanas are included<br>in five dharmas, three natures,<br>eight consciousnesses,<br>and two selflessnesses<br></em><br>It does not add anything about a true self and so on.<br><br>If
                              one accepts that tathaagatagarbha is the aalayavij~naana, and one must
                              since it is identified as such, then one is accepting that it is
                              conditioned and afflicted and evolves, thus the Lanka states:<br><em><br>Tathaagatagarbha, known as ‘the all-base consciousness’, is to be completely purified.<br><br>Mahaamati,
                              if what is called the all-base consciousness were (37/a) not connected
                              to the tathaagatagarbha, because the tathaagatagarbha would not be ‘the
                              all-base consciousness’, although it would be not be engaged, it also
                              would not evolve; Mahaamati, it is engaged by both the childish and
                              Aaryas, that also evolves.<br><br>Because great yogins, the ones not
                              abandoning effort, abide with blissful conduct in this at the time of
                              personally knowing for themselves…the tathaagatagarbha-all basis
                              consciousness is the sphere of the Tathaagatas; it is the object which
                              also is the sphere of teachers, [those] of detailed and learned
                              inclinations like you, and Bodhisattva Mahaasattvas of analytic
                              intellect.</em><br><br>And:<br><em><br>Although tathaagatagarbha<br>possesses seven consciousnesses;<br>always engaged with dualistic apprehensions<br>[it] will evolve with thorough understanding.<br></em><br><br>If
                              one accepts that the tathaagatagarbha is unconditioned and so on, and
                              one must, since it is identified as such other sutras state:<br><em><br>"`Saariputra, the element of sentient beings denotes the word tathaagatagarbha.<br>`Saariputra, that word ‘tathaagatagarbha’ denotes Dharmakaaya.<br></em><br>And:<br><em><br>`Saariputra,
                              because of that, also the element of sentient beings is not one thing
                              and the Dharmakaaya another; the element of sentient beings itself is
                              Dharmakaaya; Dharmakaaya itself is the element of sentient beings.</em><br><br>Then
                              one cannot accept it as the aalayavij~naana-- or worse, one must
                              somehow imagine that something conditioned somehow becomes conditioned.<br><br>Other sutras state that tathaagatagarbha is the citta, as the Angulimaala suutra does here:<br><br>"Although
                              in the `Sraavakayaana it is shown as ‘mind’, the meaning of the
                              teaching is ‘tathaagatagarbha’; whatever mind is naturally pure, that
                              is called ‘tathaagatagarbha’.<br><br>So, one must understand that these
                              sutras are provisional and definitive, each giving different accounts
                              of the tathaagatagarbha for different students, but they are not
                              defintive. Understood improperly, they lead one into a non-Buddhist
                              extremes. Understood and explained properly, they lead those afraid of
                              the profound Praj~naapaaramitaa to understanding it's sublime truth. In
                              other words, the Buddha nature teaching is just a skillful means as the
                              Nirvana sutra states<br><em><br>"Child of the lineage, buddha-nature is
                              like this; although the ten powers and the four fearlessnesses,
                              compassion, and the three foundations of mindfulness are the three
                              aspects existing in sentient beings; [those] will be newly seen when
                              defilements are thoroughly conquered. The possessors of perversion will
                              <strong>newly attain</strong> the ten powers (44/b) and four fearlessness, great
                              compassion and three foundations of mindfulness having thoroughly
                              conquered perversion.<br><br>Because that is the purpose as such, I teach buddha-nature always exists in all sentient beings.</em><br><br>When
                              one can compare and contrast all of these citations, and many more side
                              by side, with the proper reading of the Uttataratantra, one will see
                              the propositions about these doctrines by the Dark Zen fools and others
                              of their ilk are dimmed like stars at noon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Namdrol also says:<br><br>There is no teaching in Buddhism higher than
                              dependent origination. Whatever originates in dependence is empty. The
                              view of Dzogchen, according to ChNN in his rdzogs chen skor dri len is
                              the same as Prasanga Madhyamaka, with one difference only - Madhyamaka
                              view is a result of intellectual analysis, Dzogchen view is not.
                              Philosophically, however, they are the same. The view of Madhyamaka
                              does not go beyond the view of dependent origination, since the
                              Madhyamaka view is dependent origination. He also cites Sakya Pandita
                              "If there were something beyond freedom from extremes, that would be an
                              extreme."<br><br>Further, there is no rigpa to speak of that exists
                              separate from the earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness that
                              make up the universe and sentient beings. Rigpa is merely a different
                              way of talking about these six things. In their pure state (their
                              actual state) we talk about the radiance of the five wisdoms of rig pa.
                              In their impure state we talk about how the five elements arise from
                              consciousness. One coin, two sides. And it is completely empty from
                              beginning to end, and top to bottom, free from all extremes and not
                              established in anyway.<br><br>Dzogchen teachings also describe the
                              process of how sentient being continue in an afflicted state
                              (suffering), what is the cause of that afflicted state (suffering),
                              that fact that afflicted state can cease (the cessation of suffering)
                              and the correct path to end that suffering (the truth of the path).
                              Dzogchen teachings describe the four noble truths in terms of dependent
                              origination also.<br><br>Ergo, Dzogchen also does not go beyond
                              Buddha's teaching of dependent origination which Nagarjuna describes in
                              the following fashion:<br><em><br>I bow to him, the greatest of the teachers,<br>the Sambuddha, by whom dependent origination --<br>not ceasing, not arising<br>not annihilated, not permanent,<br>not going, not coming,<br>not diverse, not single,<br>was taught as peace<br>in order to pacify proliferation. </em></p>
              <p>--------------------</p>
              <p>Also, Dharma Dan (Daniel M. Ingram) says:<br><br>Dear Mark,<br><br>Thanks for your descriptions and analysis. They are interesting and relevant.<br><br>I
                              think of it this way, from a very high but still vipassana point of
                              view, as you are framing this question in a vipassana context:<br><br>First, the breath is nice, but at that level of manifesting sensations, some other points of view are helpful:<br><br>Assume
                              something really simple about sensations and awareness: they are
                              exactly the same. In fact, make it more simple: there are sensations,
                              and this includes all sensations that make up space, thought, image,
                              body, anything you can imagine being mind, and all qualities that are
                              experienced, meaning the sum total of the world.<br><br>In this very
                              simple framework, rigpa is all sensations, but there can be this subtle
                              attachment and lack of investigation when high terms are used that we
                              want there to be this super-rigpa, this awareness that is other. You
                              mention that you feel there is a larger awareness, an awareness that is
                              not just there the limits of your senses. I would claim otherwise: that
                              the whole sensate universe by definition can't arise without the
                              quality of awareness by definition, and so some very subtle sensations
                              are tricking you into thinking they are bigger than the rest of the
                              sensate field and are actually the awareness that is aware of other
                              sensations.<br><br>Awareness is simply manifestation. All sensations are simply present.<br><br>Thus,
                              be wary of anything that wants to be a super-awareness, a rigpa that is
                              larger than everything else, as it can't be, by definition. Investigate
                              at the level of bare sensate experience just what arises and see that
                              it can't possibly be different from awareness, as this is actually an
                              extraneous concept and there are actually just sensations as the first
                              and final basis of reality.<br><br>As you like the Tibetan stuff, and to quote Padmasambhava in the root text of the book The Light of Wisdom:</p>

              <div class="quotemain"> "The mind that observes is also devoid of an ego or self-entity.<br> It is neither seen as something different from the aggregates<br> Nor as identical with these five aggregates.<br> If the first were true, there would exist some other substance.<br><br> This is not the case, so were the second true,<br> That would contradict a permanent self, since the aggregates are impermanent.<br> Therefore, based on the five aggregates,<br> The self is a mere imputation based on the power of the ego-clinging.<br><br> As to that which imputes, the past thought has vanished and is nonexistent.<br> The future thought has not occurred, and the present thought does not withstand scrutiny."</div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>I
                              really found this little block of tight philosophy helpful. It is also
                              very vipassana at its core, but it is no surprise the wisdom traditions
                              converge.<br><br>Thus, if you want to crack the nut, notice that
                              everything is 5 aggregates, including everything you think is
                              super-awareness, and be less concerned with what every little type of
                              consciousness is than with just perceiving them directly and noticing
                              the gaps that section off this from that, such as rigpa from thought
                              stream, or awareness from sensations, as these are golden chains.</p>
