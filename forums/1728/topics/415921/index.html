              <p>In my opinion,  beginners need to know the purpose of being a Buddhist is to liberate ourselves from sufferings, not to be reborn in the 6 realms (heaven, humans, demi-gods, hell, ghosts and animals)  but aim to be born in Amitabha's Pureland ï¼ˆæž�ä¹�å‡€åœŸï¼‰</p>
              <p>2) Short Briefing by Ven. Master Chin Kung on 2nd Jan. 2011 from 1.30 pm to 1.45 pm</p>

              <p>Very long time although did not leave us. Haha :D</p>
              <p>His teaching is Chin Kong (Bodhi or ä½›) for ç»­ä½›æ…§å‘½ä»Žæˆ‘å�šèµ· and not his desire for sentient beings to idolise him. Master Chin Kong's teachings and advice for sentient beings is to be a master of their inherent Chin Kong. Having mentioned this, his personal destination is è�½å�¶å½’æ ¹å›žå½’æž�ä¹� from true realization. </p>
              <p>May we pay our homage and namaste to honourable Master Venerable Chin Kong.</p>

              <p>I wonder how many of you guys went for this event . I know æ‰€æœ‰ç›¸çš†æ˜¯è™šå¦„but I'm still too exicited to tell you guys what happened at the event. </p>
              <p>I went and during the 2nd yearning break time, many people crowded around a member who had taken a photo with her handphone during the event and the photo clearly shown Amitabha, Goddess of Mercy and Great Strength Buddha appeared at the event.</p>
              <p>As there were too many people crowded around the person with the handphone, I only managed to see Amitabha. Definitely no illusion as the image of Amitabha was very clear. Amitabha sutra said é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½›èº«é‡‘è‰²ï¼Œit is all true, HE is not only golden in colour, HE is huge and smiling. My friend told me the image of Goddess of Mercy and Great Strength Buddha were also very clear except that they were of smaller size than Amitabha.</p>
              <p>We requested her to send it to us but she said she would not as too many people had requested.</p>
              <p>I believe strongly  in Amitabha and Pureland. To me, the photo just showed me how huge Amitabha is and HE is really golden in colour. However, to my friends who had just taken 3 refuge at the event and seeing the photo gave them greater faith.</p>

              <p>It is good to dream of Buddha. I remember shifu said before, it is not easy for us to see Buddha in our dream.</p>

              <p>btw the pic u sent, and my dream different in hair color, mine are all golden, even the hair. the jesus part, maybe is to say the dream is not made up or too perfect. :)</p>

              Hi guys,
              I would like to share with you all on my last sunday experience. While everyone was sitting in the expo hall waiting for master CK to arrive ard 1.30pm, I was outside the expo hall where the volunteers were splitting into two lines waiting for Master CK to arrive. I was just standing behind the volunteers, trying to see how Master CK look like. Since I have been watching his darma talks online for a few years, I was curious, and in my heart I was wondering if he is tall or younger in real person. But as soon as the car arrived, and Master CK stepped out of the car accompanied by other monks, I started crying or weeping and I couldnt control myself. My intention was just to see him how he look like in real person, not to cry or idolise him. When he walked past me, I cried even more. This kind of feeling, is not that kind of saddness. It's the kind of compassionate energy or æ„Ÿæ�© energyã€‚I was veri paisei becos I was a guy crying in the public. I quickly dried it with tissue paper. I overheard an old lady standing beside me was crying also. Do you all guys have this kind of feeling?   
              
              Dawnfirstlight,
              Can you provide me the pic, I have PM you just now.
              Thanks a lot.

              <p>guess got a bit...i see Amituofo statue/image also sometime got the same feel. :)</p>
              <p>i ever heard even the ghosts realm beings also ask (using a media) for his liberation. normally they would not, unless the master is really well practiced and got real virtue. if not they would not be liberated.</p>

              <p><br>I did not cry but my friend and  a few others in front of me wept. My friend said this was due to his compassionate "magnetic field" ï¼ˆæ…ˆæ‚²çš„ç£�åœºï¼‰.  Last year, a lady who sat beside me knelt down  from the moment Master Chin Kong stepped into the hall till he left the hall.</p>
              <p>Each time I attend this event, I always get the tissue papers ready because I know I will weep whenever they chant the repentance (å¾€æ˜”æ‰€é€ è¯¸æ�¶ä¸šï¼Œã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚ï¼‰. This time was not too bad because Wu Dao Fashi's chanting was not too emotional. I remembered last year led by Wu Xing or Wu Kong (can't remember), his chanting of repentance was very emotional, many people including myself wept from the beginning to the end. You are right , really paisei.</p>
