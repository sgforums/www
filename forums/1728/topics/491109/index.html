              Bhutan’s international airport, at Paro, to<span> </span><a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/search/search-7.1213540?tag_location=Thimphu&amp;article=true"><span style="color: #23517a;">Thimphu</span></a>, the tiny capital, but like almost
              everything in this remote Himalayan kingdom they are distinctly memorable.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">“Don’t be a gama in the land of lama,” the most original one
              instructs. Translation: Don’t drive crazily in the land of Buddha. Other
              road-safety rhyming couplets include “Drive slow to avoid grave below,” “Faster
              spells disaster” and “On the bend go slow friend.”</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Paro Airport has one big and thoroughly stirring arrival route –
              through the Himalayas, with bonus views of Everest – one small airstrip in a
              breathtakingly gorgeous valley, and one small baggage carousel.</span></p>

              between the airport and Thimphu, 50km away. It’s one of very few that is
              surfaced and the only one that appears to have clearly designated lanes. Hence
              the road signs, which are there to warn locals to slow down on a
              near-irresistible stretch of fast going in a country where elsewhere it takes
              hours to travel a few score kilometres.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">My driver, Tschering Wangchuk, who is meticulous everywhere else
              he drives over the next 10 days of my time in Bhutan, speeds along the
              tarmacked surface to Thimphu that first day with undisguised glee. He is
              briefly being a gama in the land of lama, and no signs are going to deter him
              from a rare opportunity to nudge the speedometer upwards.</span></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">High
              value, low volume</span></h4>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #444444;'>I have a driver and a guide because that’s the rule for international
              tourists. This has been the policy since 1974, when Bhutan first opened to
              foreign tourists with a “high value, low volume” ethos. It was probably the
              only country actively seeking low numbers of visitors, albeit high-spending
              ones.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #444444;'>Its visas are inexpensive, and Bhutan does not limit the number
              it issues, but it does impose a daily tariff. This fixes the cost of travel for
              international tourists and so keeps visitor numbers low.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">In high season the tariff is $250 (€230) a day and in low season
              $200 (€185), with supplements for travelling with fewer than two other
              visitors. The tariff covers your guide, driver, accommodation and meals.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">In 1974, 287 tourists visited. By 2008 that number had risen to
              27,000 international tourists and 12,000 regional ones (which is to say people
              from<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.irishtimes.com/search/search-7.1213540?tag_location=India&amp;article=true"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #23517a;">India</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">, Bangladesh and the Maldives, who do not have to pay the
              daily tariff) .</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">On any scale, those figures are minuscule. In 2014 Ireland
              received 7.3 million tourists, a figure the industry is continuously trying to
              increase. Attracting more tourists has long been seen as good for an economy,
              including our own, but Bhutan has always aimed for something radically
              different.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">The Bhutan I arrive in in December is not very different from
              what those first tourists in 1974 would have experienced. True, wifi is almost
              everywhere, but the distinctive square houses are still built in the
              traditional way, and there are no advertisements, international franchises or
              western clothing chains to be seen. Many people still wear national dress, some
              of it woven by hand, and the landscape remains pristine. There is no
              McDonald’s, Starbucks, KFC or Subway.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Bhutan has a royal family, and the monarch, Jigme Khesar Namgyel
              Wangchuck, is called the dragon king. The kingdom is known as the Land of the
              Thunder Dragon or, sometimes, after the Tibetan paradise in James Hilton’s
              novel<span> </span><em>Lost Horizon</em>, as
              the Last Shangri-La.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">The royal family is revered and respected, if singular. The
              fourth king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, who ruled between 1972 and 2006, has four
              wives, all sisters, whom he married on the same day. I see the four sisters’
              beautiful hand-woven wedding<span> </span><em>kiras</em><span> </span>in the textile museum in Thimphu.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Also on display there is a “raven crown”. The raven is the
              national bird, and a startlingly realistic raven’s head is embroidered into
              every king’s crown. The one at the museum is the original crown, conceived more
              as a “magical battle helmet than a symbol of royalty”, according to the text
              beside it, in a line that could have come straight from one of the Grimms’
              fairy tales.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">The fifth king says that Jetsun Pema, whom he married in 2011,
              when he was 31 and his bride was 21, will be his only wife.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Their striking wedding photograph, showing them in yellow
              traditional royal dress, seems to be on the wall of every public space, with
              blown-up versions near many temples and in many town centres. Last November
              they announced that their first child, a son, will be born in February – and
              Bhutan rejoiced for a day and a night.</span></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Zebra

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #444444;'>The only daily publication in Bhutan is<span> </span><em>Kuensel</em>, an English-language

              the recently introduced zebra crossings in Thimphu – reputed to be the only
              capital city without traffic lights.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">The press release explains how pedestrians and motorists should
              behave at the zebra crossings: pedestrians have been lingering on their phones
              at some crossings, and motorists have failed to stop at others. “We feel
              saddened to hear about such inconveniences,” it says, “but it is apparently
              happening because this is a new initiative. As time passes by, we expect people
              to be more aware about how to cross the Zebra Crossing.” I cannot think of
              another capital city where such instructions would be needed in a national
              paper.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">After its four-decade experiment in moderating the number of
              tourists visiting the country, Bhutan is undergoing a change that some fear may
              result in more tourism and damage the country’s so-far-unspoilt culture.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">In 2006 the fourth king, who had initiated the “high value, low
              volume” tourism policy, abdicated in favour of his eldest son and declared that
              he wanted Bhutan to make the transition from absolute monarchy to
              constitutional monarchy with a multiparty democracy. This was a highly unusual
              step in the absence of public pressure, lobbying or unrest, and one for which
              he was much admired.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Bhutan held its first general election in 2008. Since then the
              monarchy has had an essentially symbolic role. Also since then there has been
              much discussion within the government about developing tourism. In 2009 the
              “high value, low volume” policy was changed to “high value, low impact”. The
              government now has a target for attracting international tourists – it hopes to
              see 100,000 a year.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">By 2014 the number had reached 65,480. It’s still a low figure,
              but it had more than doubled in only six years. The question nobody can answer
              is: how much will Bhutan change as a result of developing its tourism industry?</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">During my stay the word that comes to my mind every day is
              “pristine”. There is no other word to describe a country whose natural
              landscape has been so carefully conserved and is so consistently beautiful.</span></p>
              <h4 style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">Tourist
              trail</span></h4>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #444444;'>Bhutan is like most countries in having specific destinations on
              its so-called tourist trail. Here they include the impossibly photogenic
              Tiger’s Nest or Taktsang Palphug monastery, the country’s most sacred site,
              which is built into the side of a mountain that tourists and monks hike to
              daily from Paro.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">But Bhutan is different in that the entire country is a
              destination in itself. The built and natural environments remain so
              astonishingly unspoiled by development that pretty much anywhere in the country
              will reward you equally.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Bhutan’s heritage is also unspoiled. For example, many people
              still wear national dress every day. Men wear a<span> </span><em>gho</em>, which is a kind of
              woollen belted kimono; women wear a<em>kira</em>, a long wrap-around skirt,
              with a short jacket; and many children wear miniature versions. Paro and
              Thimphu have almost as many little fabric shops selling the makings of<em>ghos</em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em>kiras</em><span> </span>as they have shops selling hand
              weavings and prayer wheels to tourists.</span></p>

              like many others, he wears national dress. “For a small country like us, identity
              is very important, and our national dress is part of that identity,” he says.
              “Our identity is our weapon. We don’t have an army.”</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Penjor doesn’t say so, but Bhutan doesn’t have an army because
              it would be all but pointless. A population of 700,000 is never going to be a
              credible threat to its neighbours, such as India, with its 1.3 billion people,
              or China, with its 1.4 billion. This makes it all the more impressive that a
              country that is about half the size of Ireland has never been colonised.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">India is the behemoth at Bhutan’s southern border, supplying it
              with such necessities as cars, lorries, food – the Bhutanese eat meat but do
              not kill the animals themselves – road-widening equipment and pretty much
              everything else that is needed to keep the country running. As the father of a
              guest-house owner in Jakar tells me one evening, “We are dependent on India for
              everything from a pin to an elephant.”</span></p>

              electricity, gives its citizens free access to the country, and pegs its
              currency, the ngultrum, to the rupee. The currencies are interchangeable here;
              sometimes I am given change in rupees.</span></p>

              it was revealed that its tree cover means Bhutan absorbs more than three times
              as much carbon dioxide as its population produces. More than 70 per cent of
              Bhutan remains under native forest – although it looks more like 90 per cent.
              Driving for days through the most pristine – that word again – of forests is an
              experience I’m unlikely to have again.</span></p>

              Trees wash across the mountains and valleys like the waves of a green ocean.
              Depending on the elevation, there are forests of fir, pine, spruce, cedar,
              cypress, magnolia, oak and laurel. The trees shelter countless species of
              wildlife, among them the rare snow leopard, common leopards, tigers, yaks, blue
              sheep, wolves, Himalayan black bears, red pandas and 770 types of bird. The
              forests of Bhutan are one of the last remaining great areas of biodiversity,
              and surely deserving of World Heritage status.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">The lack of pollution results in crystalline air that gives you
              the impression of having preternaturally good eyesight, as you can see across
              vast distances as if you were a kind of human hawk. Lichen, which usually grows
              elsewhere as a thin fuzz around branches, is an indication of clean air; here,
              hanks of it hang from every tree at altitude, like unspun skeins of wool.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Then there are the festivals, the temples and the monasteries
              that permeate every part of Bhutan’s Buddhist life and culture. Prayer flags
              fly over bridges and between trees. Clusters of white prayer flags, in memory
              of the dead, stand like herded ghosts on mountainsides. Wherever there is water
              there will be a tiny building housing a water-powered prayer wheel, which tings
              every 15 seconds or so. Each monastery or temple is revered for a different
              reason. Every town of size has a<span> </span><em>dzong</em>,
              a complex of buildings housing both a monastery and local government buildings:
              Buddhism is stitched into every part of life.</span></p>

              annual festival. Festivals in Bhutan, which are big community occasions, are
              always held for spiritual reasons. This one, I am told, is to drive evil
              spirits from the village.</span></p>

              I see that afternoon, but I am watching something extraordinary. A man in a
              fearsome black wooden mask and a tattered cloak goes through the village,
              ringing a bell to signal that the<span> </span><em>tsechu</em><span> </span>is about to start in the temple. I
              stand in a corner as 50 or so people come in, including many children, who sit
              on the floor. Offerings are made. Monks chant, sing and play long Tibetan horns
              and the upright drums associated with Buddhist rituals. Before now I have seen
              them only in museums.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Successions of dancers in masks and wildly colourful costumes
              whirl like dervishes between the chanting. It is both exhilarating and
              impenetrable, but I am happy to glimpse a famed part of Bhutanese culture. The
              chanting and dancing continue at intervals for two more days.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Then there is Bhutan’s philosophy of a gross national happiness
              index, a concept that the innovative fourth king was behind. According to an
              explanatory board at the National Museum of Bhutan, in Paro, the philosophy
              attempts to harmonise economic progress with the spiritual and emotional
              wellbeing of the people of Bhutan. “The government has implemented the Gross
              National Happiness policies through strict adherence to equitable and sustainable
              socio-economic development, preservation and promotion of culture, conservation
              of environment, and promotion of good governance.”</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">A sceptical westerner might say that coming up with such an
              index is a brilliant way to market and brand a country without spending a cent.
              It is like a dream advertising campaign: who would not want to visit a country
              that promises happiness?</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">This is what I thought before visiting the country. I was wrong.
              The Bhutanese take the index very seriously. It has nothing to do with tourism.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Dawa Penjor says, “It’s not about trying to sell happiness to
              people who come to visit Bhutan. It’s about us in Bhutan as a people trying to
              say that our end goal is wellbeing. We are following a path that will provide a
              certain kind of contentment. It is a very good philosophy.”</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">I spend most of my time in Bhutan with my guide and driver,
              Tashi Tschering and Tschering Wangchuk. I ask them what they think of gross
              national happiness. They each think carefully about their answers. Finally
              Wangchuk says “We should be happy with what we have and not desire for more.”</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Tschering says, “Gross national happiness is about thinking
              about other people and not about ourselves,” and he cites as an example the
              monarchy’s promise to retain 60 per cent of Bhutan’s forest cover in
              perpetuity. “The king wants to conserve our culture, our traditions and our
              forests for the greater happiness of everyone.”</span></p>

              sense of humour of the stickers in many cars’ back windows.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">“After whisky, driving risky,” reads one.</span></p>

              has a team. They regularly hold competitions, with finals in Thimphu. The
              prizes are televisions, mobile phones or fridges. Competitions can go on for
              days, and every archery ground I see around the country is being used.</span></p>

              The 11 archers in each team use simple bows and arrows, aiming for a target,
              140m away, that I can barely see, let alone make out the markings on. Although
              I am standing alongside the archers I cannot see arrows’ trajectory from bow to
              board, as they travel so fast.</span></p>

              ahead until, finally, I glimpse the bamboo slivers passing by, high in the air,
              shooting past like furious little comets.</span></p>

              target. Every time this happens their team-mates at the opposite end of the
              field do a shuffling victory dance in front of the board – a kind of Himalayan
              haka. Bhutanese archery is a mesmerising, almost medieval-looking sport to
              watch against the backdrop of dramatic mountains.</span></p>

              themselves up as a tour company. For international tourists the daily tariff is
              the same no matter which company you choose. On the other side of this
              transaction, however, it is different.</span></p>

              undercutting. Everyone involved in tourism here is meant to get a share of
              business. But several of the biggest tour companies have built their own
              hotels; by booking customers into this company-owned accommodation they profit
              more from each tourist’s daily tariff. And as the companies no longer need to
              buy accommodation from smaller businesses, these traditional, family-run hotels
              and guest houses struggle for business even though more tourists than ever are
              visiting the country.</span></p>

              are now five, with a sixth large hotel – being built by the tour company I booked

              Bhutan’s unique culture from mass tourism. “The media is the most important thing
              in Bhutan right now,” he says. The kingdom has fewer than 200 journalists, most
              of them at one of its five radio stations. There are 11 newspapers, but all
              except<span> </span><em>Kuensel</em><span> </span>are weekly and contain little hard
              news.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">As Penjor points out, it’s a potentially exciting and
              challenging new era for the media in Bhutan. In the past the decisions of the
              absolute monarchy went unquestioned. Now that the country is a democracy it has
              an opportunity to step back from its traditional respect for authority and to
              question ordinary fellow citizens – which is to say elected members of
              government – about important decisions such as the planned development of
              tourism.</span></p>
              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">Are any of the government, for instance, associated with hotels,
              guest houses or any of the 1,700 tour companies? This would be an obvious
              conflict of interest, and an association that would clearly profit by the
              presence of more tourists. If there are links, that important story remains to
              be written in Bhutan, where investigative journalism does not yet exist.</span></p>

              <p class="noname" style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; color: #444444;">What is evident is how successful Bhutan has been in its brave
              experiment to control its tourist numbers: the country remains unspoiled. Its
              unique culture is intact and authentic: a rare combination in a world of
              globalisation. Long may it remain so.</span></p>
