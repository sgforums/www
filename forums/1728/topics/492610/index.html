              dinner recently with a Buddhist scholar Prof. Shizuka Sasaki and his wife (a
              fellow scholar and colleague at Hanazono University) in Kyoto, Japan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>I first met Prof. Shizuka
              Sasaki two years ago as a result of a Templeton science grant initiative on
              faith and science in the Japanese context. I was struck by his keen commitment
              to the historical Buddha’s teaching on enlightenment, including the emphasis on
              non-grasping and non-being. According to Prof. Sasaki, he was trained in
              chemistry as a university student, but later made the switch to Buddhist
              studies. Still, his interest in science continues. For example, scientists have
              been struck by the import of his Buddhist teaching for constructive dialogue
              with scientific explorations. In fact, he is the co-author of a forthcoming
              book with a string-theory physicist from California Institute of Technology;
              the work is a collection of public lectures they delivered together in Japan,
              and which will be published in Japanese. Prof. Sasaki is also the author of<span> </span><em>Kagaku Suru Buddha</em><span> </span>(literally
              translated as<span> </span><em>Buddha Engaging in Science</em>;
              Tokyo: Kadokawa Bunko, 2006, 2013).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Prof. Sasaki claims that the
              historical Buddha’s teaching resonates with contemporary science given their
              mutual affirmation and focus on humanity; in contrast, otherworldly religion
              with its focus on God or gods (absolute being) is incompatible with science. I
              took his consideration of enlightenment to entail such teachings as the Four
              Noble Truths (all life is unsatisfactory/filled with suffering, which is based
              on the passionate hold on life; there is an end to suffering that results from
              movement to a non-grasping, passionless state by way of the Eightfold Path
              involving definitive mental and physical practices of release). For Prof.
              Sasaki, the historical Buddha’s teaching (which he prizes) emphasizes a
              practical mindset and self-discipline. Ninety-nine percent of the historical
              Buddha’s teaching concerns pragmatic mental training. One percent of this form
              of Buddhism involves a sense of mystery regarding the person’s inner mental
              world (<em>Kagaku Suru
              Buddha</em>, page 260). It is this one percent that makes the historical
              or original form of Buddhism a religion for Prof. Sasaki (page 260).<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/uncommongodcommongood/2016/09/will-science-bring-an-end-to-buddhism/#_ftn1"><span style="color: #0066cc;">[1]</span></a></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>For Prof. Sasaki, science will
              eventually be able to provide an updated, contemporary version of Buddhism’s
              delineation of the problem of human existence and the elimination of suffering
              through enlightenment in biological and neurological terms. Given this point of
              view, would not such completion or fulfillment of the historical Buddha’s
              teaching by science bring an end to Buddhism, as we know it? Yes, but not yet.
              Science and Buddhism have not yet become one, but they will at some future
              point, according to Prof. Sasaki. He rejects the claims of those groups that
              assert that science and Buddhism have already merged in their systems of thought
              and practice. For Prof. Sasaki, both science and Buddhism focus on improving
              the human condition. If and when science can explain Buddhist enlightenment
              biologically and neurologically, then Buddhism as a religion will no longer
              exist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>I was surprised by how quickly
              Prof. Sasaki responded in the affirmative, when I asked over dinner if science
              would indeed complete the historical Buddha’s teaching, bringing it, in effect,
              to an end. One of the questions in my mind in reflecting on Prof. Sasaki’s
              claims involved the presumed tension in his thought between his personal
              commitment to Buddhism and his confidence in scientific progress: was his
              personal commitment to Buddhism simply the result of upbringing and possibly
              nostalgia? Though surprised at first by his answer, I found Prof. Sasaki’s
              response consistent with his claims in other contexts: he is willing to abandon
              or move on from any position based on what he takes to be the greater
              explanatory power of another perspective. Again, for him, there is no conflict
              between Buddhism and science; still, the latter will be shown at some point to
              be an advance on the former based on physical, biological and chemical
              explanations of what the Buddha (Gautama) had perceived phenomenologically,
              practiced, and articulated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Beyond resolution of this
              presumed tension, still another question arises in my mind: how would
              natural science lead us toward an ethic of non-grasping or non-being (non-self)
              practices apart from philosophy and religion’s ongoing ethical contributions?
              For example, would not Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection involving
              the survival of the fittest and also Richard Dawkins’ selfish gene model, if
              correct, lead us more than ever toward a state of ultimate grasping? David
              Hume’s distinction between what is (which would include scientific
              deliberations) and what should be (ethical deliberations) is very important
              here: even as science describes the way things often are, that does not require
              of us that we simply follow our biological urges and propensities. Fortunately
              for us, no doubt, Darwin was careful to discern the limits of natural science
              and the need for ethical deliberations arising from other spheres, such as
              religion and philosophy (See for example Darwin’s awareness of the need for reasoning,
              religion and the like—beyond biological considerations—for the cultivation of
              ethics in his “General Summary” in<span> </span><em>The Descent of Man</em>). I appreciate the following
              assessment of Darwin’s position on<span> </span><em>what is</em><span> </span>related to natural selection and<span> </span><em>what ought to be</em><span> </span>related
              to religious and philosophical ethical systems:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>… since our human evolution has
              given us both the sympathy to care for our fellow humans and the intelligence
              to institute laws and social programs to help them, shouldn’t we use those
              mental capacities to try to steer human society in the direction of greater equality?
              Isn’t that more “natural” to us than unflinching adherence to “the survival of
              the fittest”? It would be dangerous, however, to rest our case on the extremely
              slippery concept of what is “natural.” It would be clearer to appeal directly
              to explicit ethical principles about human dignity, equality, needs and rights
              (as in Kant or Marx, and indeed in the New Testament) that cannot be derived
              from any factual statements about evolution (Leslie Stevenson, David L.
              Haberman and Peter Matthews Wright, <em>Twelve Theories of Human Nature</em>, sixth edition
              {Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013}, pages 254-255).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>To the list of ethical systems
              offered in this quotation, I would add Buddhism. Now even if I were to accept
              the slow-dying historiographical conflict thesis involving religion and science
              presented long ago by John William Draper and Andrew Dickson
              White (which I don’t based on such keen historical studies as<span> </span><em>Galileo Goes to Jail and Other
              Myths about Science and Religion</em><span> </span>edited by Ronald L. Numbers {Harvard
              University Press, 2009}, and<span> </span><em>The Territories of Religion and Science by Peter Harrison</em><span> </span>{The
              University of Chicago Press, 2015}, we can never get away from metaphysical
              claims that go beyond empirical data. Contemporary science itself makes all
              kinds of claims that cannot be proven empirically, but are necessary for
              further explorations. See for example Oxford University’s Denis Noble’s work,<span> </span><em>The Music of Life</em><span> </span>(Oxford
              University Press, 2008), in which he claims that neither Richard Dawkins’
              selfish gene atomistic model nor his own systems biological approach model can
              be proven empirically. However, without discounting that there are merits to
              Dawkins’ perspective, Noble maintains that his web-oriented framework has
              greater explanatory power than Dawkins’ gene-centered paradigm for
              comprehending biological life (Refer to Noble’s work, especially pages ix-xi,
              11-13, 17,  52-54).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>No matter how far natural
              science takes us, it will never be natural for it to try to explain everything.
              So, will science bring an end to Buddhism? (Or Christianity, or Islam, or
              Kantianism, or Marxism, for that matter?) Never. We will always need ethical
              and metaphysical collaborative enquiries, such as can be found among Buddhist,
              Christian and Muslim philosophical and religious scholars, in addition to
              others, working with scientists, as in the case of Prof. Sasaki’s robust joint
              ventures. Only then can we truly develop systems of thought that pursue models
              of increasing explanatory aesthetic, imaginative power for the whole of life.</span></p>

              monks, the Mahayanan tradition makes available comfort and peace for the
