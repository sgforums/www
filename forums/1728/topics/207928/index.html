            <div class='col-md body'>Erm anyone read in Shin Min Newspaper that someone places a corpse of a baby under Tua Peh Gong diety statue for cultivating to be a " child ghost " in Chua chu kang near the farmmart ? It was in the news this few days , and somehow more and more pple seem to have go there specially to pray to it for 4d . From todays news , they mention that although the corpse had been removed but the spirit of it may still be lingering ard or haunting his parents . What i want to ask is , is there any way to help such child spirit be released from this kind of ritual or being used for child ghost ? Can see from the photos in the newspaper that many pple went there to pray to the child spirit for 4d after learning of the " news " . And i can tell you pple that such practices are bad for you also as i heard of a story where a man went to a forest to pray to some " thing " and he prayed for 4d nos. Then after winning he went back to to thanks the " thing " and ask what can he do to thank them , and the reply he got was that it wanted a " lamb " . Thinking that what it meant was a real lamb , he agreed and he went to get a real live lamb to it . But to his utmost horrors , the thing tell him that what it really meant was his own daughter whom was born in the year of the lamb . Upon hearing this he panick n beg it to spare his daughters life but it refused , and in the end , his daughter really diead and he swear never to ask for such " favours " agn for the rest of his life .</div>

The most we can do is to dedicate merits.<br><br>And yes, avoid them.</div>
