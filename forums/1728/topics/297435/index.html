            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Spwn07,<br><br>Just to share some of my opinions.<br><br>Bohiruci had covered most of the problems that setting up a cell group would face. The primary problems are the commitment of the buddhists (whom are suppose to attend) and the age group issue. Even though I'm 25, I really have not much of an idea what is 'in' with the teenagers.<br><br>But I will know what are the problems that young working adults are facing.<br><br>My friends and I used to organise such cell group gathering for a centre. The above 2 are the reasons that made us unable to sustain. Because people who come to our group were like still in their secondary schools and I was in the Army, quite 'out-of-touch' already. Being young people themselves, probably they came due to their parents' recommendations, they soon find themselves more interested in going out having fun then exploring the spiritual path.<br><br>I did not attend any cell group before but had attended church and cell groups and caught a glimspe of their manual in handling cell group.<br><br>The purpose of the cell group is a feedback channel from the audience to the church. The sermon is too big and short (considering if the pastor has to answer ALL audience's questions and problems in 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours duration). Therefore if you had attended sermon, you will notice there is not Q and A. Attending sermon is to receive whatever information that the pastor and the church is trying to communicate across to the audience.<br><br>The cell group then manages these crowd in smaller chunks. Effective cell group management are usually smaller in size (same as the classroom management, whereby smaller size means more attention to individual). That also means more cell group <strong>leaders</strong> need to be trained. Cell group would have probably recap what was taught in the last sermon and re-emphasize the essence of the message and clear the doubts of the audience.<br><br>I don't know how City Harvest operates now, but previously the cell group that I went to have 20 over people. To what I know, Faith Community Baptist Church keeps their cell group no more than 13 people.<br><br>The function of the cell group is to provide pastoral care. Pastoral care is not just about preaching about bible but give care and counselling to the members who encountered problem. This is a much of a cultural value that the organisation has to set pace.<br><br>To my experience, christians have the value of sacrifice which is I don't find it from buddhists. When there is an issue, christians will pray and put into actions. Buddhists will just pray and just probably sit and radiate metta and do little or nothing to really alleviate the problem.<br><br>I am currently a volunteer religious counsellor with Singapore Prison Service. It is very 'encouraging' when everytime I go to the prison, one or (at the most) two buddhist counsellors to a group; whereas christian counsellors (at least to the prison I'm visiting) never have less than six. There was once I saw eleven christian counsellors going to the same group.<br><br>They see a problem, they pray, and they become the solution to the problem, or at least they try. I really admire and respect them for this.<br><br>However, bohiruci may have overlooked on point. Megachurches like CHC does combine celebration with other churches in big events. I remember at least twice, they have these prayer rally that is around Christmas some years back, held together with other churches at the National Stadium. I think till present, the head pastor of CHC is still one of the members with the National Council of Churches.<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br><br>Bohiruci was right that different venerables' POV often don't meet eye to eye. This is a serious problem which I think it can only be solved when these venerables decide to put their differences aside.<br><br>Doctrinal-wise, it is more practical for christians to have cell groups than buddhists.<br><br>Firstly, at least to what I had experienced, christian cell groups talk very practical things that can help in life. Buddhist teachings, otherwise, often talks about very abstract of even weird ideas (as experienced when my inmates told me some of what other counsellors had told them). You see, even among buddhists, we probably can't even come to an agreed and concluded teachings to share with others.<br><br>Secondly, there is only one God in christianity. No matter which church you're from; what denominations are you, etc, end of the day you pray to only one God.<br><br>This seems to be definitely a no-no for Buddhism that is from Mahayana onwards. Some will have more affinity to Guanyin, some to Amitabha, some to Manjusri, etc. Now this point has been overlooked but to my observation and understanding, the focus on one icon of worship builds faith that in turn attributes our mental qualities. So christians only has one God to pray to, so they can focus. But Buddhism just have so many, so which one to focus? Or just not being focus, happy-happy today pray to Tara, then another day Amitabha, another day Medicine Buddha, etc? So ritualistic speaking, there cannot be a good conclusion of which icon to focus.<br><br>For the norm buddhist, when they pray for wisdom, go Manjusri; deliverance to Amitabha; healing to Medicine-Buddha, etc. Too scattered as compare to one almighty God. Anything just pray to this one God and it's settle.<br><br>Thirdly, to create a cell group or a network of cell group will take up a lot of time and money. Monetary speaking, it has no return. Besides been well versed in the doctrines, cell leaders has to attend at least some kind of basic counselling skills, to counsel to members who are troubled; time management skills in small group settings (ie. moderate the dialogues in the cell group, not to exceed time etc); oral communications (one may know the Dhamma but may not necessary talk well, know of some venerables, good in speech, bad in writing and vice-versa), etc. So I think in any organisations, seeing that there is no immediate monetary return, they would have probably drop the idea.<br><br>I will say churches are more far-sighted, 'youth is the pillar of the future', we often hear this and the churches are working hard in reaching out to the youth. Not forgetting that churches has regular tidings (some churches no longer make it a mandatory practice), so they will have certain financial basics to fund cell-management activities.<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Lastly, having a cell group would have meant that the members would have a more closer relationship to the cell group than to the preacher. Because the preacher can go on leave and a stand-in will hold the service. As said, sermon is to bring message across, it is the respective cell groups that handles the feedback part. I think this would have definitely be a no-no situation to Buddhism. Where monks still demand respect to them. So if such respect is 'shifted' to a layman (assuming a cell group leader is layman), I think there may be out of questions to many venerables in Singapore. In fact, it has been a culture that norm buddhists have. That monks must definitely know more than layman, which may not be necessary true.<br><br>Okay, I have talked too much. Spwn07, if you're really interested, you will really have to join a church/cell for sometime to observe how they run, then observe some buddhist gatherings and observe how they run. Compare and contrast and you will see the light.<br><br>I don't like buddhist gatherings because when comes to food, it has to be vegetarian. Vegetarian food may not necessary be healthy too. I bet that may be one of the disadvantages that stops young people from coming.<br><br>I think I have heard about the cell group with RC. A truly successful cell-management is that it can really grow like a cell. That's why it is call 'cell group'. Hope all the best to your RC cell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>just to share, actually the idea of "cell-groups" existed, and still exist, in Japanese Buddhism from more than 600 years ago, they are called "Ko" (in chinese, "Jiang" as in "jiang hua" - speak). Currently, most of the "traditional" Buddhist denominations like Jodo, Jodo Shin, Nichiren and "new-age" like Rissho Kosei Kai and Soka Gakkai still have these "cell-groups" meetings. So it is possible for an individual temple in Singapore to have one of its own, even though it may differ doctrinally from another.<br>The churches that were used in example here have their own cell-groups and they do not "mix" with other churches' cell-groups because it is affiliated with members of its parent church, ie CHC cell-groups, NCC cell-groups etc. All of them operate differently and serve different members. Also, sometimes, there are people of different ages and occupations in one, not all are of the same age group at all.<br>However, i agree with Yamizi that it is quite difficult for Buddhists to have cell-groups because most of us tend to talk of very "high" doctrinal stuff like Sunyata (Emptiness) and the like without being able to "bring it down" to the masses. I think it is a reflection and advice we should bring in mind.<br>Gassho</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>But i think Yamizi was also smack-right about the point of too many icons. The groups in Japan so far that have been able to successfully keep the "cell-groups (Ko)" so far are those who emphasise on one icon, either "Namo Amida Butsu (Namo Amitabha)" - Jodo Shu, Jodo Shinshu, those of the Nichiren sects like Nichiren Shu, Nichiren Shoshu and Soka Gakkai, or those based on Kobo Daishi Kukai (founder of the Shingon Esoteric Buddhism in Japan).<br><br>For Jodo Shin where i belong to, many temples were in-fact started off by having these "Ko", and from these "Ko" groups, members started assembling and they reorganized (or had to reorganize) into formal temples during the start of the Tokugawa rule in the 1700s. However, it does not mean that the "Ko" groups died down. Female "Ko" groups, called "Ama-ko" were also huge that they were later reorganized as the "Women's Buddhist Association" in the early 1900s.<br><br>Yamizi also gave the problems that ordained clerics tend to demand "respect", thus making it difficult for Buddhist cell-groups in Singapore to work. In Japan, where most ordained clerics are now also living the same life as their lay counterparts, it is much more easier for them to lend a listening hand and ear to the lay congregation because they also understand and experience the same difficulties - raising children, cost of living, education etc etc. And in Jodo Shinshu where we've had a lay clergy since the inception, ordained and lay both play a part in studying and propagation, and even though most of time it is still the clerics who do the studying and propagation, there is no hindrance to a lay person leading the services or the study sessions. In these, the priests play a supporting role.<br><br>Gassho</div>

That monks must definitely know more than layman, which may not be necessary true.</div></blockquote>I agree with you on most of the points above, but I'm not sure if it's ok to really to use the word 'demand' when respect is a basic virtue to observe regardless of one's religious belief. It is stated in certain scriptures like the Brahma Net sutra that layman should not criticise the monastic order or regard  them poorly based on their human flaws alone.<br><br><blockquote>Okay, I have talked too much. Spwn07, if you're really interested, you will really have to join a church/cell for sometime to observe how they run, then observe some buddhist gatherings and observe how they run.

At least you were willing to spend time to share with me and all of us here what you have observed so far and what you personally feel about the current state of Buddhism locally.<br><br><blockquote>I don't like buddhist gatherings because when comes to food, it has to be vegetarian. Vegetarian food may not necessary be healthy too. I bet that may be one of the disadvantages that stops young people from coming.</blockquote>Could be so, I think, but that might mean more needs to be said and done to let the public know about the purpose of vegetarianism in both religious and non-religious circles.<br><br><blockquote>I think I have heard about the cell group with RC. A truly successful cell-management is that it can really grow like a cell. That's why it is call 'cell group'. Hope all the best to your RC cell.</blockquote>What's rc group? I don't think i can really start a buddhist cell group, cos i seriously lack the capabilities and virtues required of a Buddhist youth cell grp leader.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yamizi:</div><div class="quote_body">Firstly, at least to what I had experienced, christian cell groups talk very practical things that can help in life. Buddhist teachings, otherwise, often talks about very abstract of even weird ideas (as experienced when my inmates told me some of what other counsellors had told them). You see, even among buddhists, we probably can't even come to an agreed and concluded teachings to share with others.</div></blockquote>Agree, that's my experience so far too. However, the basics like the 4 noble truths and the eightfold pathway are common to all. We, as buddhists, should try to brush up up our knowledge and personal cultivation on that. And most importantly, we need to learn more, so that we can give lots of real-life examples to others on how to apply them. Hold lively discussions on how to react and behave for certain moral dilemmas with respects to real-life situations of applying basic Buddhist concepts. I personally feel that venerables, for most of the time, do not understand the difficulties faced by laymen buddhists, even though before they were ordained, they were like us too.<br><br><blockquote>Secondly, there is only one God in christianity. No matter which church you're from; what denominations are you, etc, end of the day you pray to only one God.</blockquote>Apparently, this makes it appealing for the public (young and old) as they are able to understand and practise their faith more easily.<br><br>The many dharma doors caters to the many inclinations and aptitudes of the masses, but yet somehow the unintended side-effect is that we are unable to really unite in our thinking and approaches in spreading the dharma to the public.<br><br><blockquote>Thirdly, to create a cell group or a network of cell group will take up a lot of time and money. Monetary speaking, it has no return. Besides been well versed in the doctrines, cell leaders has to attend at least some kind of basic counselling skills, to counsel to members who are troubled; time management skills in small group settings (ie. moderate the dialogues in the cell group, not to exceed time etc); oral communications (one may know the Dhamma but may not necessary talk well, know of some venerables, good in speech, bad in writing and vice-versa), etc. So I think in any organisations, seeing that there is no immediate monetary return, they would have probably drop the idea.<br><br>I will say churches are more far-sighted, 'youth is the pillar of the future', we often hear this and the churches are working hard in reaching out to the youth. Not forgetting that churches has regular tidings (some churches no longer make it a mandatory practice), so they will have certain financial basics to fund cell-management activities.</blockquote>This boils down to attracting talented yet committed young people to come to contribute to the organisations involved. The whole chain of reaching out to new members, training group leaders and future young venerables, is the most important thing for all Buddhists to take note of and discuss seriously and eventually come to a common agreement on a list of possible effective and practical solutions to the issue.<br><br></div>

I also think the same in that the primary function of the cell group is to create bond among church's members. For without bond, we would just be like colleagues, where the relationship is mostly utility-based. If there's nothing I think you can help me on, I just ignore you. But if I spot even something wrong with you, I'm very quick to point it out even in full view of others.

However, I was just mentioning that there was a sutra that says even if it's a greedy man disguising as a monk to ask for monetary alms, giving him money will have some form of positive karma. Much less one who is trying to lead a pure monastic life as passed down from generations.<br><br>Hence, I am looking at the issue in two aspects; one non-Buddhist view and the other from a Buddhist perspective.<br><br>I have no right to be criticising you (and I have no intention at all to do so), cos I'm a fellow practitioner myself.
