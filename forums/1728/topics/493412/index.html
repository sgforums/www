              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">The
              dharma arrived in Tibet as a wedding present. Legend has it that toward the end
              of the 7th century, the royal families of China and Nepal offered brides to
              Songsten Gampo, the first of Tibet’s mighty kings to unify the country (and
              frighten its neighbors). These two princesses each brought with them an unusual
              dowry: a statue of the Buddha. Soon the great Jokhang temple in Lhasa was built
              to house these precious gifts, which are still proudly displayed in the Tibetan
              capital. And these two remarkable women are remembered as the matriarchs of
              Tibetan Buddhism, together planting the first seeds of Buddha’s teachings in
              the Land of Snows.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">About
              a hundred years later, another king, Trisong Detsen, decided it was time to
              take this new faith even more seriously. He built Tibet’s first Buddhist
              monastery at the base of one of their holiest mountains and called it Samye,
              the Inconceivable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              spirit of ecumenicalism pervaded Samye from the start. At its center stood a
              four-story temple designed to reflect the diverse architectural styles of all
              Tibet’s neighbors. Smaller chapels and stupas populated the grounds around it,
              creating a huge mandala within the monastery’s circular outer walls. Together
              these comprised a model of the entire universe, with every continent and ocean
              represented by the 108 separate structures. Buddhists from a variety of
              traditions were invited to teach there, and monks from both India and China
              soon took up residence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It
              didn’t last. Perhaps inevitably, conflicts arose between the various Buddhist
              schools at Samye. As the noted English Tibetologist Sam van Schaik explained in
              2011 in his masterful book Tibet: A History, the Indian tantric Buddhists
              “insisted on the need to combine meditation with rational analysis and the
              basic practices of ethical conduct,” while the Chinese Zen Buddhists felt that
              enlightenment only required that one “recognized the true nature of one’s own
              mind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              his newest book, Tibetan Zen: Discovering a Lost Tradition, van Schaik now
              revisits this famous, formative dispute in the history of Tibetan dharma. As he
              explains in his introduction, Tibetan scriptures have long included an account
              of how the Indian teachers brought “a graduated path in which tantric and
              sutric teachings were carefully laid out as steps to enlightenment,” while the
              Chinese masters taught “straightforward concept-free meditation.” And then,
              sometime in the 790s, according to traditional histories, doctrinal
              disagreements developed between Indian and Chinese Buddhists at the Tibetan
              court, and the Tibetan emperor called for the situation to be resolved in a
              formal debate. When the debate resulted in a decisive win by the Indian side, the
              Zen teachers were sent back to China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is what Tibetans call the Great Debate at Samye, said to have been held at the
              temple of Jampa Ling at the western edge of the monastery. From that point on,
              conventional wisdom says, “the popularity of Zen declined in Tibet, and its
              original texts were all but forgotten.” While Zen thrived in China, Japan,
              Vietnam, Korea, and almost every other Mahayana country, in Tibet it
              effectively disappeared, and the unique path of Tibetan Buddhism evolved
              exclusively from the Indian tantric lineages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Yet
              van Schaik’s new book vividly demonstrates that these one-sided
              accounts—including the earlier one in his own book—are not the whole story. In
              fact, Zen likely thrived in Tibet for several centuries, taught side by side
              with the tantric approach we now think of as Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Van
              Schaik proves this by translating for the first time several important Tibetan
              Zen texts found in caves outside the Chinese city of Dunhuang. This treasure
              trove of hundreds of Buddhist scriptures discovered in the early 20th century
              includes Tibetan writings from both tantric and Zen masters, alongside a
              seemingly haphazard collection of “notebooks, shopping lists, writing
              exercises, letters, contracts, sketches, and scurrilous off-the-shelf verses.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              other words, the miraculous Dunhuang collection is less a curated library than
              a theological snapshot, a strange time capsule of everyday writings from the
              8th to the 10th century. The presence of Zen and tantric texts there together
              proves that both had continued to be studied by Tibetans long after the usual
              dating of the Samye showdown. Also discovered in those sealed caves was an
              account of the Great Debate from the Chinese perspective. According to the Zen
              side, the debate was carried out by correspondence over several years, rather
              than in person at Jampa Ling—and the Chinese master won.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Many
              of van Schaik’s new translations will resonate with modern students of Zen.
              They can be simple and precise one moment, then descend quickly into some
              familiar paradoxes:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Cross
              your hands and feet. Straighten your back. Don’t move your body. Don’t say
              anything. Turn away without engaging the delusory six gates of the mind with
              their objects, and then look at your own mind. When you do, there is no
              substantiality to mind at all. So do not think of anything. Without engaging in
              the various emotional states, do not conceptualize anything. Once you have
              completely purified the mental sphere in this way, do not abide anywhere. Once
              you have sat for a long time, the mind will stabilize.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              in some cases the visiting Zen masters from China seem to be searching for a
              common ground, attempting to reconcile Zen’s emphasis on a single universal
              method and an instantaneous awakening with the Indians’ more varied teachings.
              Or at the very least, they seem eager to explain their approach without seeming
              to insult their dharma brothers:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Since
              it is important to train in the other stages, things like the eight meditations
              are not to be accomplished all at once; they are to be entered in succession.
              Purifying all the various concepts one by one is like trying to count all the
              grains of sand on earth. Yet if one does not know what the essence of the mind
              is like, there will be no benefit either from negating them instantaneously
              with a single antidote.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              is van Schaik’s most important contribution to the popular understanding of the
              Great Debate—the recognition that the two sides likely had more in common than
              we might imagine today. Buddhist scholars have already questioned the
              conventional Tibetan account for at least 50 years, noting, for example, that
              several Chinese texts were ultimately incorporated into the Tibetan Kangyur and
              Tengyur canons and that both gradual and sudden approaches to awakening are found
              in many of the most ancient Pali sutras. But Tibetan Zen is the first attempt
              to make the evidence accessible to nonspecialists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              tensions in Tibet between Zen and tantric teachings echo debates as old as
              Buddhism itself. The question of whether enlightenment is a sudden or gradual
              experience is explored perhaps most famously within the Zen tradition, in the
              so-called Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, the only Zen text typically
              given the elevated title of “sutra” despite being credited to a master who
              lived a thousand years after the Buddha’s death. Copies of this revered
              Buddhist manuscript were also found in the Dunhuang caves in China, and it too
              describes a contest between competing visions of practice and awakening. But in
              this case, the undisputed winner is the Zen patriarch Huineng and his “sudden
              doctrine” of inherent enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Yet
              the central issue seems far from settled even today. Modern Zen and Tibetan
              teachings appear to offer differing approaches to the fundamental paradox of the
              buddhadharma: If we are all fundamentally enlightened, why don’t we feel
              enlightened? Why do we need to practice at all? And why is practice so hard?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              van Schaik thoughtfully explains, the two apparent alternatives of gradual and
              sudden enlightenment are in many respects a false choice, or at least not a
              choice that any surviving school of Buddhism has made cleanly. Zen Buddhism may
              have aligned itself with the “sudden” side, yet it too has developed a
              sprawling panoply of ritual, practice, and literature over many centuries.
              Tibetan Buddhism may identify with the “gradual” approach, but it too talks of
              moments of unexpected realization, chik charwa in Tibetan, which the American
              scholar David Seyfort Ruegg translates as the “innate spontaneity of Awakening.”
              And this muddying of the waters was even more apparent in the formative years
              of both traditions, from the 8th through 10th centuries, when the Dunhuang
              documents were written. Back then, Zen in China was borrowing from tantric
              traditions at the same time that it was helping inform such traditions in
              Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">About
              80 miles southeast of Lhasa, along a newly paved road that runs beside the
              sandy banks of the broad Yarlung River, the ruins of Jampa Ling still stand.
              Nestled within the rebuilt fortifications of Samye monastery, it seems more a
              construction site than a temple today. Its red stone walls are now caked with
              cinereous dust, and a makeshift wheelbarrow filled with rocks and debris stands
              guard at what was once the front door. Inside, the colorful frescoes of the
              present and future buddhas are draped in bedsheets for protection, and the
              intricate designs painstakingly painted on the tall wooden beams have all but
              faded with age. Dozens of Tibetan monks live in the newly renovated structures
              nearby, but few venture in. Pilgrims, put off by the rubble and mess, generally
              keep away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tibetans
              still recount with pride the victory of tantric Buddhism over Zen in the Great
              Debate at this modest spot, and van Schaik’s meticulous scholarship is unlikely
              to change this. Given the complex and uneasy relationship between Tibet and
              China over the centuries, it is not hard to imagine why they would want to
              emphasize their unique connection to India and proclaim the superiority of
              their own branch of the dharma. Like other native practitioners, most Tibetans
              are born into their faith. They don’t arrive at the tantric way after a
              dispassionate evaluation of all the Buddha’s paths. They accept it rather as
              their birthright, and as self-evidently true.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Here
              in the West, newcomers to the dharma are more likely to compare and contrast.
              Zen and Tibetan Buddhism often seem to stand at opposite cliffs of a great
              chasm, their myriad adherents staring incomprehensibly at each other like
              feuding families across a tumultuous sea. On one side, the austere simplicity
              of zazen, practiced in sober silence by somber monks. On the other, the
              colorful cacophony of the tantric universe, awash in a vast array of ritual and
              relic, overseen by a flamboyant pantheon of gods and demons. It can feel at
              times that we have little common ground beyond a few occasional Buddhist
              festivals—and perhaps a near-universal love for His Holiness the Dalai Lama,
              our one true pan-Buddhist celebrity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But
              as van Schaik reminds us through his fascinating and important work, these two
              great Mahayana traditions were not always quite so far apart. We are more like
              estranged cousins, or even long-lost siblings. We shared a monastery once at
              Samye, in faraway Tibet, waking to the same brilliant dawn and walking the same
              dusty paths. We drank from the same well and were nourished by harvests of the
              same soil. We borrowed each other’s scriptures and tried for a few years to
              bridge the gaps between our teachings. With a little luck and understanding, we
              might share the same paths again.</span></p>
