Pubbekatahetuvada: The belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous karma (Past-action determinism).<br>2. Issaranimmanahetuvada: The belief that all happiness and suffering are caused by the directives of a Supreme Being (Theistic determinism).<br>3. Ahetu-apaccayavada: The belief that all happiness and suffering are random, having no cause (Indeterminism or Accidentalism).<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>"Bhikkhus, adhering to previously done kamma as the essence, there are neither motivation nor effort with what should be done and what should not be done ... Not upholding ardently what should be done, nor abandoning what should be abandoned, those ascetics and Brahmins are as if deluded, lacking a control, incapable of having any true teaching. (Buddha)</strong></span><br><br>In Buddhism, Karma is simply there as a guide and an indication of what your present is and how one's future can be made better by self effort, otherwise, fatalism and pre-determinism is the anti-thesis of the notion of perfection or self-conquest - which is the primary aim of Buddhism.<br><br>The Buddha asserts effort and motivation as the crucial factors in deciding the ethical value of these various teachings on kamma.(P.A. Payutto).<br><br>In the story of the Indra's Net, the light that streams back and forth throughout the display is the analogy of karma. The word "karma" does not mean anything like "the result of a past good or bad action." <strong>"Karma" refers to an action, or, more specifically, to an intentional action, and the Buddhist theory holds that every karma (every intentional action) will bear karmic fruit (produce an effect somewhere down the line).</strong> Volitional acts drive the universe. The consequences of this view often confound our ordinary expectations -- much in the way quantum physics has results that are strongly counterintuitive.<br><br>Therefore, karma is a conditioning factor, not a pre-determining factor. It can be changed and transformed according to human will (cetanaa) in relation with the agent's conditions and efforts as well as his surroundings, whether material, spiritual, educational, cultural, or social.<br><br><blockquote>Kamma is <strong>neither fatalism nor a doctrine of<br>predetermination.</strong> The past influences the<br>present but <strong>does not dominate it</strong>, for Kamma<br>is past as well as present. The past and<br>present influence the future. The past is<br>a background against which life goes on<br>from moment to moment. <strong>The future is<br>yet to be</strong>. Only present moment exists<br>and the responsibility of using the present<br>moment for good or for ill lies with each<br>individual.</blockquote><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Refuting the erroneous view that "whatsoever fortune or misfortune experienced is all due to some previous action", the Buddha said:<br><br>"So, then, according to this view, owing to previous action men will become murderers, thieves, unchaste, liars, slanderers, covetous, malicious and perverts. Thus, for those who fall back on the former deeds as the essential reason, there is neither the desire to do, nor effort to do, nor necessity to do this deed, or abstain from this deed."<br><br>It was this important text, which states the belief that all physical circumstances and mental attitudes spring solely from past Karma that Buddha contradicted. If the present life is totally conditioned or wholly controlled by our past actions, then certainly Karma is tantamount to fatalism or determinism or predestination. If this were true, free will would be an absurdity. Life would be purely mechanistic, not much different from a machine. Being created by an Almighty God who controls our destinies and predetermines our future, or being produced by an irresistible Karma that completely determines our fate and controls our lifeÂ’s course, independent of any free action on our part, is essentially the same. The only difference lies in the two words God and Karma. One could easily be substituted for the other, because the ultimate operation of both forces would be identical.<br><br>Such a fatalistic doctrine is not the Buddhist law of Karma.<br><br>According to Buddhism, there are five orders or processes (niyama) which operate in the physical and mental realms.<br><br>They are:<br><br>1. Utu Niyama - physical inorganic order, e.g. seasonal phenomena of winds and rains. The unerring order of seasons, characteristic seasonal changes and events, causes of winds and rains, nature of heat, etc., all belong to this group.<br>2. Bija Niyama - order of germs and seeds (physical organic order), e.g. rice produced from rice-seed, sugary taste from sugar-cane or honey, peculiar characteristics of certain fruits, etc. The scientific theory of cells and genes and the physical similarity of twins may be ascribed to this order.<br>3. Karma Niyama - order of act and result, e.g., desirable and undesirable acts produce corresponding good and bad results. As surely as water seeks its own level so does Karma, given opportunity, produce its inevitable result, not in the form of a reward or punishment but as an innate sequence. This sequence of deed and effect is as natural and necessary as the way of the sun and the moon.<br>4. Dhamma Niyama - order of the norm, e.g., the natural phenomena occurring at the advent of a Bodhisattva in his last birth. Gravitation and other similar laws of nature. The natural reason for being good and so forth, may be included in this group.<br>5. Citta Niyama - order or mind or psychic law, e.g., processes of consciousness, arising and perishing of consciousness, constituents of consciousness, power of mind, etc., including telepathy, telaesthesia, retro-cognition, premonition, clairvoyance, clairaudience, thought-reading and such other psychic phenomena which are inexplicable to modern science.<br><br>Every mental or physical phenomenon could be explained by these all-embracing five orders or processes which are laws in themselves. Karma as such is only one of these five orders. Like all other natural laws they demand no lawgiver.<br><br>Of these five, the physical inorganic order and the order of the norm are more or less mechanistic, though they can be controlled to some extent by human ingenuity and the power of mind. For example, fire normally burns, and extreme cold freezes, but man has walked scatheless over fire and meditated naked on Himalayan snows; horticulturists have worked marvels with flowers and fruits; Yogis have performed levitation. Psychic law is equally mechanistic, but Buddhist training aims at control of mind, which is possible by right understanding and skilful volition. <strong>Karma law operates quite automatically and, when the Karma is powerful, man cannot interfere with its inexorable result though he may desire to do so; but here also right understanding and skilful volition can accomplish much and mould the future. Good Karma, persisted in, can thwart the reaping of bad Karma, or as some Western scholars prefer to say Â‘action influenceÂ’, is certainly an intricate law whose working is fully comprehended only by a Buddha. The Buddhist aims at the final destruction of all Karma.</strong></blockquote></div>

When you are enlightened and have attained nirvana (which is not overnight) that you can pass such karmic event and be in birthless and deathless. Now isn't that changeable by one's mean? It's no longer fate you are discussing but it's changing one's destiny by own's means. So what is death to you? Is it physical or spiritual that you are referring to? If physically with the mental state of passing through death, then can you change your cause &amp; effect of getting a cut and bleed to death? So what do mean by your sentence.
