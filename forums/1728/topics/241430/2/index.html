            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:<br><br>If Buddha is a human being, then he cannot stop creating karma accidentally.</blockquote>Karma requires <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">intentional</span> actions</strong>. A Buddha has totally liberated from intention and mind (thinking happens but not dualistic thinking, therefore <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>no-mind</strong></span>)<br><br><blockquote>If Buddha is a spiritual being, then he does not exist, thus has no karma.</blockquote>My definition of Spiritual is different from yours. For me, spirituality is to realise our Buddha Nature, the "primordial reality". It has nothing to do with being an invisible spirit or angel or whatsoever.<br><br><blockquote>If Buddha is truly enlightened, then he would have sense the microbes(living things) present in the food and would have not eaten them.</blockquote>Do you know that the Buddha once held a cup of water and said that there are 84000 (meaning uncountable) microorganisms in that cup of water? Of course nobody understood what he meant and his claim was not proven until the microscope was finally invented thousands of years later.<br><br>Obviously he knew what he had eaten was going to trigger some sort of illness. He knew it but he let it happen, just as Mogallana who is the most skilled disciple in Supernatural Powers knowingly allowed some people to throw rocks and kill him, because it has to do with their karma and supernatural powers <strong>cannot supercede karmic effects</strong>. I can show you a story regarding this. In fact it is very difficult to thwart certain karmic effects, and the more you try to prevent it, it just delays but eventually it will happen. Anyway the Buddha has already finished his job by establishing the Sangha and teaching the dharma, so it is time for him to leave. The mara invited him to pass into Parinirvana 3 months ago but he refused, and said it will happen only when his job is done. So 3 months later it's done and he wants to clear his remaining karma.<br><br><blockquote>Are my above points logical enough to understand?</blockquote>No. It just shows your utter ignorance of Buddhism.</div>
