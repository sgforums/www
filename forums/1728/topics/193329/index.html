Miller, GlobeSt.com, May 23, 2006</span></span><br><br><strong>LAS VEGAS, Nevada (USA)</strong> -- Casino-resort developer Steve Wynn is all about big ideas and happy people. Keynoting a luncheon Monday afternoon at the International Council of Shopping Centers annual trade exposition, the Buddhist billionaire touched on his religion and anthropology in explaining the creative process that led to his namesake resort, Wynn Las Vegas.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/lav_stevewynn2.jpg"><br><strong>Steve Wynn</strong><br><br>Before anything, Wynn says he started with a big idea. Â“If you start with the stuff, youÂ’ll be in trouble,Â” he says. Â“You need to start with a big idea, a great idea, so if you are 70% successful you still have something.Â”<br><br>Wynn has had many big ideas. He is known as a trendsetter who reinvented Las Vegas Boulevard by developing Mirage and Treasure Island, the first of the mega-resorts to generate the bulk of their revenue from non-casino operations. His work jump-started a boom in casino-resort development that has kept Las Vegas in hyper-growth mode for more than 15 years.<br><br>In explaining his goal of making Wynn Las Vegas something that Â“resonates with human aspiration,Â” Wynn tapped into his anthropology studies at the University of Pennsylvania. He spoke of the Precambrian Explosion that created plant an animal life and made our species possible.<br><br>Â“Plants, water, the natural light of the sun, primordial stuff, thatÂ’s how the creative process began,Â” he says. Â“What sustains life on this planet; I started with that idea, and if you go through Wynn, youÂ’ll notice skylights everywhere, sunshine filtering through etched glass, ceramic and mosaic tiles with flowers from MatisseÂ’s Persian Robe.Â”<br><br>Architecture and design alone will not make a casino-resort competitively advantaged and enduring, however, he says. The other key ingredient is happinessÂ—happy employees and happy customers--and Wynn takes it more seriously than most. As a Buddhist, Wynn believes that true satisfaction and enduring happiness is only gained by making a better life for other people.<br><br>There is evidence that his actions are in line with his belief. Nearly 100,000 people applied for the 10,000 jobs at Wynn Las Vegas because Wynn is known as a union-friendly boss who offers top pay and benefits in exchange for the attention to detail.<br><br>Â“I canÂ’t get an advantage with a building, and neither can you, because everybody copies; youÂ’ve got maybe 60 months, maybe 40 months before everybody sees it and does it.Â” he says. Â“You get competitive advantage because of people, and my leadership is defined by my ability to convince the eight-, nine-, 10,000 employees of the Wynn that they have the ability to change the course of the history every day.<br><br>Â“On the creative process, thatÂ’s everything IÂ’ve learned,Â” he concludes. Â“Maybe youÂ’re not too impressed, but I am.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Jackson, who has led the Bulls to numerous NBA titles and recently became the first coach to lead his team to 70 wins in one season, will surely be named as one of the most successful coaches in history. The Bulls most prominent players Michael Jordan, Scotty Pippen and Dennis Rodman, as well as an odd assortment of projects and castoffs, are managed through Jackson's new age philosophy. Using a mixture of American Indian philosophy and Zen Buddhism, Coach Phil Jackson has managed to keep the disparate elements of the team playing in harmony.<br><br>His approach emphasizes awareness, compassion and selfless team play to achieve victory. Jackson believes that the essence of teamwork is interconnectedness and selflessness in action. One of the most important characteristics of a leader, he concedes, is to listen without making judgments. In order to create a true team and build an acceptable level of trust, one must have intimacy and an open forum where every member can fully express his thoughts and feelings. Jackson uses this concept of mindfulness to assist his players in paying exact attention to what is happening on the court moment by moment. Jackson encourages his players to practice Buddhist philosophy off the court as well. He teaches players meditation so they can relax more fully. Meditation allows his players to make the correct decisions during extremely tense and chaotic times on the basketball court, Jackson contends.<br><br><img src="http://mud.mm-a1.yimg.com/image/182466603"></div>

She is a dancer and speaks five languages. He loves Nova Scotia. She's never been here.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/wedding.jpg"><br><strong>Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, the spiritual leader of the Shambhala Buddhist movement weds Tseyang Palmo in Halifax</strong><br><br>They met in a Buddhist monastery in India last year. Her dance company was performing and he was teaching. He fell instantly for the graceful dark-haired beauty and arranged to meet her family the next day for tea.<br><br>Next Saturday, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, who is the spiritual leader of the Shambhala Buddhist movement, will wed Tseyang Palmo in Halifax in a lavish three-day wedding ceremony being billed as a "royal wedding" among Nova Scotia's Buddhist community.<br><br>The happy event is a coming-out party, of sorts, for Nova Scotia's Shambhala Buddhists, who number about 600 and arrived here in the early 1980s, mainly from the United States, on the urging of their teacher, ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa, the groom's late father. In the late 1970s, Mr. Trungpa picked Halifax to be the world headquarters for Shambhala Buddhism.<br><br>Mr. Trungpa, who is credited with introducing Tibetan Buddhism to the Western world, died in 1987. His U.S.-raised son, the Sakyong, has continued his father's work. Although based in Halifax, the Sakyong travels most months of the year, holding seminars on meditation and promoting his books.<br><br>Next week's elaborate wedding ceremonies will be an amalgam of Asian and Celtic-Canadian culture; purple-robed monks will mingle with kilted bagpipers from Nova Scotia's fabled 78th Highlanders. A Japanese bow maker will perform an archery presentation just before the daily firing of the noon gun atop Halifax's Citadel fortress.<br><br>The boomer-aged Buddhist wedding planners in Halifax lend a New Age twist to the tradition-steeped ceremonies.<br><br>"We're trying to remember to breathe," said Shambhala practitioner and Haligonian Richard Peisinger.<br><br>Over the week ahead, Mr. Peisinger and fellow planners must also remember to pick up the 40 dozen Digby scallops and 40 dozen curry chicken tikka skewers for the reception dinner on June 10.<br><br>The wedding has mushroomed to 1,100 from 500 guests, who will be arriving from India, Nepal, Tibet, Europe and the United States.<br><br>The wedding is the talk of this foggy East Coast city, and organizers are praying -- or meditating -- for good weather for the first ceremony next Thursday, a lhasang, in which juniper is burned to purify the environment. It's to be held outdoors at Halifax's historic Citadel and will be open to the public. The wedding ceremony is in a downtown convention centre.<br><br>Among the guests will be Buddhist monks from Tibet, Nova Scotia MP Alexa McDonough, Lieutenant-Governor Myra Freeman and comedian Cathy Jones, who practises Shambhala Buddhism.<br><br>Halifax Mayor Peter Kelly has joined the Buddhist wedding bandwagon, declaring June 10 Blossoming of the Sun Day.<br><br>Mr. Peisinger and fellow planner Wendy Friedman are organizing cars, hotel rooms and billets for the foreign guests. They say it's the first public event Buddhists have held since arriving in Nova Scotia a quarter-century ago.<br><br>"For us, it's an offering to the couple, but also to the community," Ms. Friedman said. "To share it with everyone in Nova Scotia." Ms. Friedman, who owns a clothing store, is a native of South Carolina. Mr. Peisinger is from Westchester, N.Y.<br><br>"It's just been fun to have a big celebration," Mr. Peisinger said. "Everyone is getting a big charge out of it. There's a great sense of sharing."<br><br>Ms. Friedman added that the wedding is also a way for Halifax's Buddhists to express affection for Nova Scotia.<br><br>"It's a way for us to say, 'We're not mysterious. We're open. If you want to know more about us, just come on down.' "<br><br>Relations between residents of Halifax and the Buddhists weren't always rosy in this Maritime province, where Nova Scotia's renowned friendliness is extended to tourists but not necessarily to outsiders with unfamiliar beliefs.<br><br>"There has always been a thin line between Nova Scotia's famous hospitality and xenophobia," said David Swick, who wrote a book about Nova Scotia's Buddhists.<br><br>"We are now less xenophobic and more confident," Mr. Swick said. After arriving in Halifax, Buddhists opened ethnic restaurants, cafÃ©s, bookstores and other businesses.<br><br>Mr. Swick said that the Buddhists and Nova Scotians benefited from the influx. The Buddhists made Halifax more cosmopolitan and Haligonians helped Buddhists "achieve what they wanted, which was to rub off some of the more aggressive and unsavoury aspects of American culture." Halifax also gave them "a sane place to practise."<br><br>The groom's father fled Tibet in 1959 after the Chinese invasion, settling first in India, then England. The Shambhala tradition, which he followed in Tibet, emphasizes meditation and urges people to work for an enlightened society.<br><br>Mr. Trungpa is credited with introducing Tibetan Buddhist principles to the Western world. In 1970, he moved to Colorado, where in Boulder he established North America's only Buddhist university.<br><br>By the late 1970s, Mr. Trungpa was dissatisfied with U.S. society. On a trip to Nova Scotia, he found a down-to-earth people who valued friendships and family, Ms. Friedman said.<br><br>Mr. Trungpa urged Shambhala practitioners to follow him, and hundreds did.<br><br>The Shambhala movement has about 175 learning centres in the Western world, with about 7,000 members.<br><br>The Sakyong and his wife will live in Halifax, in Kalapa Court, a waterfront home owned by the Shambhala Buddhists. It's undergoing a $370,000 renovation in preparation for Ms. Palmo's arrival. Wedding guests have been asked to donate $100 each to the new home.<br><br></div>

"I could tell he knew me through and through.<br><br>"Then he clapped his hands and called in eight nuns and said to them, 'This is your mother. She will build you a home.' "<br><br>Build a home she did. As the karmapa's new American secretary, she raised $21,300 Â— enough to build a convent, which opened in Rumtek in 1985.<br><br>Mrs. McLeod, who converted to Buddhism in the late 1940s, was a leader for three and a half decades in producing English-language study materials for Seattle Betsuin Buddhist Church and other temples in Buddhist Churches of America.<br><br>She died at 98 on Aug 12.<br><br>Born in Anacortes on Nov. 9, 1907, as Grace Vivian Clem, Mrs. McLeod was the granddaughter of Charles William Beale, who was among the first permanent group of white settlers in the Anacortes area.<br><br>She was raised a Catholic, graduating from St. Ann's Academy in Vancouver, B.C., Pius X School of Liturgical Music at College of the Sacred Heart in New York, and Holy Names Academy and Normal School in Seattle.<br><br>From age 17 to 20, Mrs. McLeod routinely sat on the edge of her chair in order to leave room for her guardian angel, her daughter, Rosalie Jacobson, wrote.<br><br>For 11 years Mrs. McLeod taught at Sacred Heart Villa (now Villa Academy) in Laurelhurst and wrote a curriculum for elementary education in Catholic schools. Daughter Rosalie, who now lives in Southern California, was born in 1938.<br><br>advertising<br>Mrs. McLeod converted to Buddhism in 1948 after she and her husband, Hugh McLeod, a longtime Buddhist, studied world religions together through the Theosophical Society. Mr. McLeod died in 1978.<br><br>By 1950, as a member of Seattle Betsuin Church, also known as Seattle Buddhist Temple, she had begun writing stories, poems and articles about Buddhism for the church's predominantly Japanese-American children whose first language was English.<br><br>Jacobson recalled her mother working late into the night on publications such as "Buddhist Reader" and "Teen Tempest" and "Dharma School Teacher's Handbook." Her publications were circulated for 36 years to every U.S. temple in the Jodo Shinshu branch of Buddhism.<br><br>Mrs. McLeod also taught in the dharma school, trained teachers, and developed a course of study for the Karuna Award for Buddhist members of Camp Fire Girls.<br><br>She was in her seventies when she met the 16th Karmapa in Portland and he asked her to visit him in India, saying, "I have work for you."<br><br>During that visit to Rumtek she agreed to raise funds for the nunnery. She traveled to India four times as she raised money to build schools and to assist projects for lepers and the poor. She also visited Thailand, Japan and Nepal.<br><br>"I think she was captivated by Tibetan Buddhism initially and then she came to realize there's as much politics in Tibetan Buddhism as anyplace else.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="color: green;">The Zen professor</span></span><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="font-style: italic;">by PHYLLIS McGUIRE, Bennington Banner, September 5, 2006</span></span><br><strong>Bennington, VT (USA)</strong> -- Over a span of 16 years, Thomas Redden earned the titles of doctor, professor and priest. "But people just call me Tom," said Redden, with a smile, during an interview in August.<br><br>With fair skin, a full head of brown hair, dressed in slacks and sport shirt with open collar, Redden was not the stereotype of a Buddhist priest, as pictured by many Americans.<br><br>Redden, the oldest son, second of eight children, was raised a Catholic.<br><br>"I was very much into religion. I liked going to church," said Redden. The Redden family lived in Connecticut near a Catholic church and school. "My mother is a devout Catholic."<br><br>His eyes misted as he added, "My father died when I was 11."<br><br>Now Redden, 51, lives in Newfane with his wife of 24 years and their two daughters, 14 and 10. On school days, he drives to Southern Vermont College, where he teaches history and politics. He holds a bachelor of arts degree from Williams College; two masters degrees, one from Central Connecticut University, one from the University of Geneva, Switzerland; and a doctor of philosophy degree from the University of Connecticut.<br><br>Redden was about the same age as his students when he became interested in Buddhism.<br><br>"I studied religion - Hinduism, Buddhism ... at Williams College," Redden said. "And at a winter study program, I took a course in Zen Buddhism. We skied and swam to develop mindfulness."<br><br>When people engage in a repetitious activity, their ability to focus is heightened, Redden said.<br><br>After graduating from Williams College in 1977, Redden lived in Japan about two years and traveled around the world.<br><br>"I was able to go to Japan because I had gotten a job teaching English there," Redden said. He considered himself very fortunate to have that opportunity because he had wanted to live in Japan ever since he had taken a Japanese history class in high school.<br><br>In Japan, Redden went to a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto, the religious center of the country, and started a meditation practice.<br><br>When he returned to the United States, he began to practice at the Zen Community of New York, located in the suburbs of New York City, which later became the Zen Peacemaker Order.<br><br>"I was ordained a priest there," Redden said. "People came from New York City. They were thrilled. And my mother was very happy for me."<br><br>At the ordination ceremony, Redden undertook the 10 precepts.<br><br>"Some are a bit obscure, but the five core ones are: not killing, stealing, lying, misusing sex, or misusing intoxicants like drugs and alcohol. The presumption being that if you live an ethical life, you will be able to develop spiritually to be loving and kind," Redden said.<br><br>The teacher at the Zen Peacemaker Order moved west with the bulk of the community and Redden eventually went to the Zen Mountain Monastery in the Catskill Mountains of New York.<br><br>"I became a formal student of (Zen Master) John Daido Loori there," said Redden. "You have a teacher all your life."<br><br>A year and a half ago, Redden became a formal member of the Mountains and Rivers Order, an American order founded by Loori in 1980.<br><br>Redden goes on retreat several times a year for three to seven days.<br><br>"It's very rigorous," he said. "You get up about 3 a.m. There is total silence for 12 hours a day." Retreats usually begin with meditation to "still the mind."<br><br>Redden has meditated an hour or two every day since 1978. "I have an altar at home," he said.<br><br>"A high percentage of converts in America meditate because that's how they were introduced to Buddhism. And they do not have the support of the cultural milieu in which Buddhism is recognized as an integral part of life. In Japan, they observe the holidays ... they live Buddhism. It is a religion based on what Buddha argued is the nature of life; suffering (dukha) is mainly caused by clinging to ourselves - being very caught up in our own ideas, opinions, preferences, etc. These very subjective views of the world lead to frustration, resentment, anger ... We all know a lot of people who cling so dearly to their own ideological positions, be they liberal or conservative, that they really get worked up just at the thought of some things," said Redden.<br><br>Scientists have evidence that Buddhists are happier and calmer than other people, as reported in New Scientist magazine.<br><br>Redden has found that Buddhism allows him to create stability and equilibrium in his life. "It's a great gift," he said.<br><br>"I come to school in a good state of mind. I can bring forth the compassion and deep affection I have for the kids and my job. It is a huge responsibility to create a positive educational environment for the kids. Compassion, patience and clear thinking is what it takes to be an effective teacher."<br></div>

It was almost immediate. Before reading the book I had felt I was on my own....The main message I got out of the book was that in order to make myself happy, I have to make other people happy. It's all about trust, friendship and the fundamental things in life we take for granted. They're the only way we can find true happiness," the Daily Mail quoted her, as saying.<br><br>"Once you strip down the other things that bother us - society and the way we live - it's very materialistic. Don't get me wrong, I love having a nice house and being able to pay my mortgage. But it's dangerous if they become the main focus in life, because how can that ever lead to, you know, nirvana?" she said.<br><br>And though the book brought a sense of peace into her life, Lucker said that it was her encounter with the Dalai Lama that had the most profound effect on her.<br><br>"When I first saw him my whole body just went into this weird state. We'd just trekked the Himalayas and there was this huge sea of people waiting to see him. Yet it was incredibly serene. Then he walked past us, about 3ft away, and waved. It's the first time I've ever been starstruck," she said.<br><br>"Essentially, it comes from the people I met - people who have nothing, but who are constantly smiling. It's very humbling," she added.<br><br>The trip was documented for a two-part ITV show titled Â‘Date With The DalaiÂ’, and will be broadcast in the UK during the week.<br></div>

It should transcend personal God and avoid dogma and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things natural and spiritual as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this description. If there is any religion that could cope with modern scientific needs it would be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Buddhism</span>.[38]<br>I came Â— though the child of entirely irreligious (Jewish) parents Â— to a deep religiousness, which, however, reached an abrupt end at the age of twelve.[39]<br>I do not think that it is necessarily the case that science and religion are natural opposites. In fact, I think that there is a very close connection between the two. Further, I think that science without religion is lame and, conversely, that religion without science is blind. Both are important and should work hand-in-hand.[40]<br>A Jew who sheds his faith along the way, or who even picks up a different one, is still a Jew.[41] </blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

(Though he only collects it if itÂ’s agreed heÂ’s produced meaningful results. Generally, he collects it.)<br><br>But mostly, IÂ’m thinking about money because my debt to this corporate guru is growing by the minute.<br><br>See, to operate according to Goldsmithian principles is to follow a number of simple rules. Things like: Be a good listener. DonÂ’t make excuses. DonÂ’t pass judgments or make destructive comments. Say Â“Thank youÂ” and Â“IÂ’m sorry,Â” and learn to ask for forgiveness.<br><br>WhatÂ’s getting me into trouble at the moment is one of GoldsmithÂ’s favorites: DonÂ’t start a sentence with Â“But,Â” Â“NoÂ” or Â“However.Â” He likes this one so much he charges his clients $20 every time they do it, a practice that over the years has raised $300,000 for charity.<br><br>These Â“negative qualifi ers . . . secretly say to everyone, Â‘IÂ’m right. YouÂ’re wrong,Â’ Â” he writes in his new book, Â“What Got You Here WonÂ’t Get You There: How Successful People Become Even More Successful.Â”<br><br>As we speak, my habit of starting sentences with Â“ButÂ” is racking up a hypothetical debt so fast I might as well sign my paycheck over to him right now. He silently clocks it every time I do it, and occasionally interjects a tally. As in, "That's $160."<br><br>But if you'd assume that by now I feel like taking the aforementioned coffee and dumping it in Goldsmith's lap, you'd be wrong. A longtime Buddhist who has an easy laugh and favors khakis and moccasins, Goldsmith has an important gift for a man in his line of work: a jovial, almost goofy bonhomie that makes him impossible not to warm to even as he's gently busting your chops.<br><br>As a coach, Goldsmith doesn't sharpen clients' negotiating skills, or delve into their psyches. He just helps them get along better with the people they work with - to be seen as less judgmental, or more receptive to others' ideas, or just plain more civil and pleasant to be around.<br><br>Turns out, the coach to the industry stars just wants us all to get along.<br><br>Of course "civil" and "pleasant to be around" aren't always prized attributes in Fortune 500 boardrooms, and Goldsmith has a reputation for cracking some hard cases. One of his favorites started out with a percentile rating of 0.1 for personability, meaning that out of 1,000 people at his company, he ranked dead last. (He turned himself around, and after a year hit the 57th percentile.)<br><br>Goldsmith's method for helping such people is deceptively simple. "Simple, but not easy," he likes to say. First, he solicits "360-degree feedback" from colleagues, bosses and underlings to identify what they perceive as the client's negative traits. (Sometimes family members are consulted as well.) He presents the client with the results, and zeros in on the behaviors that are holding him or her back.<br><br>Then he trains the client to cease those behaviors and replace them with more benevolent ones - like, say, thanking an underling who presents an idea and promising to think about it, instead of shredding it on the spot.<br><br>More often than not, what holds people back, he writes, "are simple behavioral tics - bad habits that we repeat dozens of times a day in the workplace - which can be cured by (a) pointing them out, (b) showing the havoc they cause among the people surrounding us, and (c) demonstrating that with a slight behavioral tweak we can achieve a much more appealing affect."<br><br>In the book, he highlights 20 of the most annoying workplace habits; among them "clinging to the past," "playing favorites," "withholding information" and "failing to express gratitude." Such habits are "transactional flaws performed by one person against another ... that make your workplace substantially more noxious than it needs to be."<br><br>With his book riding high on the business best-seller lists, we sat down with Goldsmith to find out how the methods he uses on the country's top tycoons can help make your work life easier and your workplace happier.<br><br>Part of your job is to walk into the offices of very successful people and confront them with the divide between how they think people perceive them and the way they're actually perceived. What's the typical reaction to that?<br><br>Well, when we hear what we don't want to hear, our first reaction is, "They're confused. They don't understand, the problem isn't me, it's them." It's hard to realize that sometimes other people can see things in us that we can't see in ourselves.<br><br>Which traits tend to be the least recognized?<br><br>One I talk about, that's somewhat counter-intuitive, is the idea of winning too much. Because we're so geared to winning. And especially the people I work with. These are winners. The derby of life, they won. What's hard for them is to not always win everything.<br><br>Here's an example I give: Say you go out to dinner with your wife or significant other, and you want to go to X and she wants to go to Y, and you get into an argument. Then you go to her choice, and the food tastes like crap and the service is awful - what do you do? Do you critique the food, or do you shut up? We should shut up, but what do most people do? They critique the food and try to be right.<br><br>Isn't the need to win part of what got these people where they are?<br><br>Parts of it are, and parts of it are not. That's the classic problem: "I behave this way, I am successful, therefore I am successful because I behave this way." Wrong. That's the success delusion. They're where they are because they do many things right, and in spite of screwing things up. And what I try to do is help people sort out "because of" and "in spite of."<br><br>How much can you separate these things? Take "goal obsession," which you say underlies many of the negative behaviors in your book. That's something a lot of successful people share. At what point does it become a problem?<br><br>When the goal becomes more important than the mission. And that happens. People get so wrapped up in achieving a goal that they forget the mission.<br><br>I worked with a guy on Wall Street who was working 80 hours a week, and I asked him, why are you working 80 hours? He said, "Because I need money." I said, why do you need money? He says, "I've been married three times, and I need to pay alimony." Well, why have you been married three times? "My wife didn't understand how hard I had to work."<br><br>See what I mean? It's crazy. And stuff like that happens all the time. We're so wrapped up in winning and proving how smart we are that we forget that this battle is not worth winning.<br><br>If someone has a lot of natural aggression and drive, and that makes them good at what they do -<br><br>Let's stop there. Parts of that are probably making them good. Parts of that are probably not making them good. And by the way, I'm not saying you shouldn't try to win. Win big things, don't win trivial things.</div>
