              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Yatish Yadav 04th June
              2017 The New Indian Express</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">NEW
              DELHI: China has scored a major victory in soft power diplomacy by quietly
              launching its own Nalanda University while the original Nalanda campus in Bihar,
              planned almost a decade ago, is still stuck with 455-acre dead space.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">China’s
              education ministry had managed to keep the plan a secret till a few weeks ago
              when it formally announced the enrolment for Nanhai Buddhist College in Hainan
              province in May. The first batch is set to take off from September with a
              strength of 220 students to occupy the vacant Buddhist diplomacy space. Nalanda
              in 2014 had started with just 14 students and 11 teachers. Sources said the
              secrecy is baffling since China was part of the global team, which first
              promoted the idea of reconstructing Nalanda University in the ancient Indian
              city in 2006.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nalanda
              was hit by the careless approach of its mentors, including Nobel laureate
              Amartya Sen and his team, since the beginning of 2007 when the Manmohan Singh
              government appointed them to work out the plan for the institution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              2011, China had given a million-dollar cheque as donation for reconstruction of
              Nalanda. It appears now that Chinese were working in parallel to create the Buddhist
              university. Such sprawling campus cannot be built in one or two years. They
              must have started construction in 2012,” sources said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Chinese Nalanda version is a sea-facing structure located on scenic Nanshan
              Mountains spread across 618.8 acres. Chinese have rechristened the university’s
              coastline as “Brahma Pure Land”, a concept borrowed from ‘Yoga Vashistha’ and
              Mahayana Buddhism. The Chinese Nalanda will offer courses in three
              languages—Pali, Tibetan and Chinese in six departments—Buddhism, Tibetan
              Buddhism, and the Buddhist Architectural Design and Research Institute.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Chinese Buddhist university is closely linked to the Buddhist centres in
              Thailand, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Cambodia, which is seen as an attempt to
              completely sideline the Indian side in soft power diplomacy. The China has
              appointed monk Yin Shun as the dean of the university, who is interestingly
              abbot of Lumbini-based Zhong Hua Buddhist temple. Lumbini is the birthplace of
              Buddha, and China has been aggressively pushing to promote Nepalese pilgrimage
              site to counter India’s Sarnath and Bodhgaya, where Gautama Buddha is said to
              have attained enlightenment. Since early 2010, Yin Shun has been advocating
              “the South China Sea Strategy” and had closely worked with Thailand and Nepal to
              create Buddhist ‘One Belt and One Road’ (OBOR).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is a known fact that India recently boycotted China’s high-profile economic
              design flagging sovereignty concerns over China-Pakistan Economic Corridor
              (CPEC), which passes through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). The plan,
              according to sources, is to link Lumbini, Wuxi and Hainan through Buddhist
              OBOR, usurping Buddhist legacy of India. Wuxi, near Shanghai, has been turned
              into permanent venue of world Buddhist forum by the Chinese government.
              According to sources, students as far as South American countries are applying
              to the Chinese university, which, along with knowledge, promises to provide
              best air and seawater quality in entire South Asia.</span></p>
