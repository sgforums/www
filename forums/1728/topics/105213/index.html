The fact is, before Buddhism becomes the dominant religion in Thailand, Brahmanism is the dominant religion (I think). Brahmanism in fact, has highly influenced Thai Buddhism (e.g Thai Amulets derived from Brahmanism). Some practices by certain monks that are considered superstitious other non-thai buddhists. However, this is not to say that Thai Buddhism is not as good as other types of Buddhism, in fact most Buddhist sects are more or less influenced by their local culture and traditions. Most important is that their Dharma remains intact and doesn't lose purity.<br><br>I'm not very good at Hinduism, so I'll quote from a website:<br><br><blockquote>Looking at the four directions, the four faces of Brahma symbolize the four Vedas as well as the cardinal points of the compass.</blockquote>The scriptures of Vedas (and many other hindu texts) are rejected by Lord Buddha Shakyamuni. Buddha Shakyamuni had many instances of meeting the Brahma, in fact, it was Brahma who begged Buddha Shakyamuni to teach the dharma. However, this Brahma is also under the illusion that he was the Creator of all. Buddha had dealt with Brahma and his ideology several times in his scriptures. There are also many interesting stories revolving the Brahma.<br><br><blockquote>The stories of a Buddha going to teach a brahma take place on the plane of Maha Brahma, the third of the fine-material planes (No. 14). Many people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods.<br><br>The Buddha has directly seen the origins of Maha Brahma and understands what it requires to be reborn in his world. In the Brahmajala Sutta (DN 1) the Buddha describes how a supposed Creator God came to believe himself omnipotent and how others came to rely on his sovereignty. </blockquote><a href="http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma/devas.html#ch2" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma/devas.html#ch2</a></div>

A large numbers of his believers are Buddhist without denial. "Phra Phom" is full of kindness, mercy, sympathy, and impartiality. These four precepts comprise the "Conscientious Behaviour" corresponding to Buddhist teaching which instructs Buddhists of the four Dharma.<br><br>Firstly i would like to clarify that "Phra Phom" is not of a Pagan Religion although a small minority of Pagans do worshipped him. Likewise with all Patheons of all religions there are always believers of them not necessary of the Religion of his/her origin.<br><br>Well in almost all cultures &amp; beliefs, peoples prayed to various patheons &amp; do included Animal God/Goddess like Egyptian Goddess Bast, Taoist Fox Deity or "Hui Xian", Shinto Deity Inari &amp; so on. Snake are not only worshipped by Thai neither limited to only one religion, its evidental in almost all Religions, Hindu Snake Goddess Nagalata Devi, Buddhism Naga &amp; so on. In thailand, there are also worshippers of "River God/Goddess", "Crocodile God" &amp; so on. Patheons can take on different forms &amp; enamations of any creatures &amp; living being on this Earthly Plane. Native Religions are always around &amp; most Major Religions these days started from minor native religions. Shinto is one of the most prominent Japan Religion &amp; as old as Japan herself. Shinto are deeply rooted in the heart Japanese people &amp; tradition with quite mystical origins with Beliefs of " Sacred Spirits " which take the form of things and concepts important to life, such as wind, rain, mountains, trees, rivers, fertility &amp; animals. Accordling to Legends, some Shinto Priests happened to be Descendants of Humans &amp; Spirits blessed with Spiritual Powers, Believe it or not is up to your own perspective...ha ha ha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Hope all these answer your queries &amp; doubts, Have a nice week ahead...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Worshipping these deities can invoke attention from gods or deities or spirits, these beings may have spiritual powers, however, Buddhists should not be too superstitious over such beings. These gods and deities are not freed from Samsara, the 6 realms. They have yet been liberated, and therefore not able to bring you liberation. Those who are overly superstitious over spirits may fall into the Ghost realm. The ones "worthy of offerings" in Buddhism are Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, Tathagathas...<br><br>There is nothing wrong paying reverence to these deities and gods, there is also nothing wrong paying reverence to anyone you know, but hope people are not superstitious over them. Buddhists should focus on our Dharma practise and Liberation from Samsara.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally I don't have too much knowledge about the Four-Faced Buddha, but  usually the four-faced buddha is placed under a shrine. I think maybe people don't feel too good to put the Four-Faced Buddha at an altar because one or more of the sides will face the wall. Or you can say in another way, since the Four-Faced Buddha has 4 faces, must as well put it in an open area so can face people at all directions. Maybe if you have space and put a shrine in the middle of your living room it may seem better. (but who has the space?)<br><br>I would also like to hear from others who knows more about this. This is only my guess.<br><br>For me, at my altar is just a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha, one-sided, the original form which he manifests to preach the dharma to sentient beings like you and me. It is much more common to see the common statue of Shakyamuni Buddha situated at a Buddhist altar inside a monastery.<br><br>I don't think they are any rules as to whether the Four-Faced Buddha should be pay reverence indoor or outdoor. The act of bowing for Buddhists is an act of reverence. We pay reverence to people because we respect them, irregardless of where he appears at, not because of <strong>where</strong> they appear. But it would be disrespectful and unappropriate if for example, the buddha statue is placed in the toilet. Of course we should not do this.</div>
