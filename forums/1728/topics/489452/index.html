                          Catholics, Protestants and others) are legally "non-existent." And as
                          you cannot conduct a census on a group of people who are legally "non-existent,"
                          you just count them as "Sunni Muslims."</span></p>

                          Yildirim.</p>
              <p style=" margin-left: .5in; text-indent: -.25in;  "><span style="text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 1.231;">      One hears that "Islam is a religion of
                          peace." But what many Westerners fail to understand is that this
                          "peace" takes place only </span><em style="text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 1.231;">after</em><span style="text-indent: -0.25in; line-height: 1.231;"> everyone has converted to
                          Islam. No other ideology has enjoyed the luxury of being praised as the
                          "religion of peace" while providing exactly the opposite.</span></p>
              <p>Once upon a time, Asia Minor, now called Turkey, as well as the rest of the
                          Middle East, was for centuries a real cradle of civilization, where many
                          different religions and cultures flourished. But today these tiny, dwindling
                          communities are not able to enjoy any freedom of religion or conscience.</p>
              <p>"Peaceful coexistence," it seems, is a concept truly foreign to
                          Islamic supremacists. It is this missing concept that keeps them in dark ages.
                          They might still go to shopping malls, or use mobile phones, computers and
                          other technological devices, but their minds and souls are trapped in dark
                          ages. Ironically, most of the high technology and science they utilize was
                          invented by the people whose places of worship they like to destroy.</p>
              <p>Why is there not a single Islamic country that operates in harmonious
                          co-existence with everyone instead of domination of everyone? And why is it
                          that in most majority-Muslim countries, non-Muslims suffer from persecution or
                          discrimination? Why are they not recognized as equal citizens with equal
                          rights?</p>
              <p>"The Latin Catholic community is not able to prove its ownership of
                          churches it has possessed for hundreds of years due to lack of legal
                          recognition of its existence," according to the scholar Mine Yildirim.
                          "This results in a continuing loss of property. ... Since it has no legal
                          personality at all in addition to not being able to own property, the community
                          cannot go to court when it loses ownership of property on account of this very
                          lack of a legal personality."</p>
              <p>Yildirim, after including Protestants and Jehovah's Witnesses in the same
                          problem, notes that, "The Syrian Orthodox community, which has grown in
                          recent years due to migration from South-East Turkey, has been waiting for over
                          three years for a decision on its application to open a second church in
                          Istanbul. ... The importance of having a legally-recognised place of worship
                          cannot be underestimated given the widespread intolerance in Turkish society
                          towards other religions. ... As far as the legislation is concerned,
                          worshipping in a building that does not have legal status or calling a building
                          a <em>cem house</em>, church or similar may lead to prosecution."<a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/6155/turkey-non-muslim-worship#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
              <p>Social intolerance and even physical attacks can also cause a non-Muslim
                          place of worship to be closed down. In the own of Inegol, for instance, a
                          church and synagogue in a shopping mall which opened on May 10 were closed down
                          about two weeks later due to "pressure."</p>
              <p>The founding president of the shopping mall, Haluk Ozbek, stated: "As
                          we feel the well-deserved pride of introducing such a big project with
                          international identity to our Inegol, we have been exposed to ugly and
                          meaningless attacks that we do not deserve at all by some groups, because there
                          were also foreign places of worship in our shopping mall project as well as a
                          mosque," <a href="http://www.agos.com.tr/tr/yazi/11649/avm-deki-kilise-ve-sinagog-cevre-baskisi-gerekcesiyle-kapatildi">according</a> to the Cihan News Agency.</p>
              <p>Ozbek said that since the mall has been exposed to physical attacks, as well
                          as to attacks in the media, "they have decided to halt their decision
                          regarding the foreign places of worship for now."</p>
              <p>On June 10, Muhammed S. aged 25, shouting "We have finished with
                          Christianity and Judaism... Allahu Akbar!," <a href="http://capul.tv/kadikoyde-kiliseye-saldiri/">set fire</a> to the entrance
                          of the largest Greek Orthodox Church on the Asian shore of Istanbul, the Hagia
                          Triada Church.</p>
              <p>"The suspect said that he had seen 'Prophet Jesus' in his dream,"
                          Kostandin Kiracopulos, a representative of the Association of Greek
                          Foundations, with which the church is affiliated, <a href="http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/kadikoyde_kilise_kapisi_atese_verildi-1376210">told</a> reporters. The government-run Anatolian Agency reported that the man had been
                          undergoing a treatment at a hospital for mental disorders.</p>
              <p>This church was "lucky" -- it was not razed to the ground. Many
                          historic churches in Turkey were. One, in Bodrum, the <a href="http://www.radikal.com.tr/radikal2/aya_nikola_kilisesini_nasil_yiktik-904332">Hagia
                          Nicholas Church</a>, had been named in honor of Saint Nicholas, a historic
                          4th-century Christian saint who was born in Myra, a town situated in present
                          day Turkey. In 1923, after many Greeks of Asia Minor were forcibly driven out
                          of their homes during the forcible population exchange between Turkey and
                          Greece, the Hagia Nicholas Church no longer had a congregation. So, it began to
                          be used as a cinema, and then as a sponge storehouse. Then, in 1969, the
                          authorities decided to tear down the church. First, they tried to destroy it
                          with digging tools, but the building was so solid it would not fall. So they
                          blew it up it with dynamite.</p>
              <p>Other churches in Asia Minor, after the 1915 slaughter of the Armenians,
                          were also dynamited or bombarded with cannons, <a href="http://www.ihd.org.tr/ermeni-soykiriminin-100-yilina-dogru-yeter-inkara-son/">according</a> to the Human Rights Association of Turkey.</p>
              <p>In September 1955, the Turkish government orchestrated a systematic attack
                          that included the <a href="http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=8516">destruction</a> of the majority of the churches, monasteries and cemeteries of Istanbul's Greek
                          community.</p>
              <p>Such attacks have led to the destruction of the Christian culture in the
                          region. Unfortunately, this seemingly old tradition in Turkey is still in full
                          swing. In April 2015, in the province of Mardin, which until the 1914-1925
                          slaughter of Assyrians had been an important center for Assyrian Christians,
                          the Association of Assyrian Unity was abolished because the concept
                          "co-presidency" in its charter -- a term also used by Kurdish
                          organizations -- as well as the word "unity" in its name "are
                          against the law." The head of the Assyrian Association, Yuhanna Aktas, <a href="http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/suryani_dernegi_esbaskanliktan_kapatildi-1327576">said</a> that its members will object to the decision, but if nothing changes, they will
                          take the case to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
              <p>Now that there is only a tiny Christian community left in Turkey, its
                          Islamic authorities do not often resort to their usual aggressive methods.
                          Instead, many of the surviving churches have been used for various insulting
                          purposes other than as places of worship, but this practice only makes the
                          persecution of churches more invisible.</p>
              <p>A historic church, for instance, which before 1915 had been in a
                          majority-Armenian village of Germus, is now used as a stable. The church had
                          been <a href="http://www.gaphaberleri.com/haber/3605/urfa-da-kilise-ahir-oldu.html">restored</a> by Armenians just 11 years ago.</p>
              <p>A detailed <a href="http://www.protestankiliseler.org/?p=787">report</a> in
                          2014, by the Association of Protestant Churches in Turkey, revealed hate crimes
                          and violations of the Christians' right to build and maintain places of
                          worship, to share their faith, and other forms of discrimination to which they
                          were exposed. The report is filled with stories of violence or threats of
                          violence that churches or church members experienced in Turkey in 2014 alone.
                          In many cities across Turkey, churches, Christian community leaders or church
                          members have been continually subjected to threats, harassment or psychical
                          attacks.</p>
              <p>The Protestant church in the province of Antep was sealed because "it
                          was an illegal workplace." In Mardin, another church was apparently
                          infiltrated by two police officers for years. The result was the deportation of
                          some of the church members. In the Uskudar district of Istanbul, members of the
                          Protestant community were made to leave their church and told they would be
                          given a new place of worship. They are still waiting for it. In the
                          Bahcelievler district in Istanbul, the Presbyterian Grace Church was threatened
                          on social media with attacks. Police could not find the source of the threats.
                          In the province of Kayseri, some people threatened and tried to kidnap a
                          Christian university student. When he sought help, nothing was done, so he had
                          to drop out of school.</p>
              <p>Turkey also has an Alevi community, estimated in the tens of millions, but
                          the number is only approximate. Alevis in Turkey are also legally
                          "non-existent." And as you cannot conduct a census on a group of people
                          who are legally "non-existent," you just count them as "Sunni
                          Muslims."</p>
              <p>Cem houses, the places of worship of the Alevis in Turkey, are also victims
                          of Islamist supremacy. They have never been recognized as places of worship,
                          either during Ottoman rule or under the Turkish Republic.</p>
              <p>According to a parliamentary <a href="http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/81_ilin_31inde_cemevi_yok-1125396">report</a> in 2013, there are 82,693 mosques in Turkey, whereas there are only 937 cem
                          houses. And more than half the provinces in Turkey do not have a single cem
                          house.</p>
              <p>As public policy expert John C. Sawhill is alleged to have said, "A
                          society is defined not only by what it creates, but also by what it refuses to
                          destroy."</p>
              <p>Sadly, the Islamist supremacists do not seem to be capable of respecting
                          people of other faiths or with no faith. Many pious Muslims seem to think that
                          if Islam is the only true religion, why should one need the immoral, untrue
                          religions or philosophies that lead people astray?</p>
              <p>They also, as one can see, try to invalidate or destroy religions that came
                          into the world hundreds or thousands of years before theirs -- even if these
                          religions do not disrespect or try forcibly to convert anyone. To them,
                          non-Muslims are <em>kafirs</em> -- what Islamic scriptures call the unbelievers.</p>
              <p>"The language of Islam is dualistic," <a href="http://www.politicalislam.com/kafir/">notes Bill Warner</a>, the director
                          of the Center for the Study of Political Islam. "Humanity is not seen as
                          one body, but is divided into whether the person believes Mohammed is the
                          prophet of Allah or not." And according to the <em>Quran</em>, a Muslim is
                          not the friend of a <em>kafir</em> (3:28).</p>
              <p>The Koran defines the <em>kafir</em> as: hated (40:35), mocked (83:34),
                          punished (25:77), beheaded (47:4), confused (6:25), plotted against (86:15),
                          terrorized ( 8:12), annihilated (6:45), killed (4:91), crucified (5:33), made
                          war on (9:29), ignorant (6:111), evil (23:97), disgraced (37:18), unclean
                          (9:28), and cursed (33:60).</p>
              <p>"Only the word 'kafir,'" according to Warner, "shows the
                          common political treatment of Christian, Jew, Hindu, Buddhist, animist, atheist
                          and humanist."</p>
              <p>As Muslim jihadist armies, as well as many Muslim civilians, continue to
                          destroy or attack the places of worship and other cultural or religious values
                          of people of other faiths, they create their own legacy. With each church,
                          synagogue, cem house, Buddhist temple or other non-Muslim place of worship they
                          destroy, attack or ban, they destroy their own identity, value and worth.</p>
              <p>Is this the legacy that they wish to be remembered with throughout
                          generations? Apparently, it is.</p>
              <p>At the same time, one hears claims that "Islam is a religion of
                          peace." But what many Westerners fail to understand is that this peace
                          takes place only <em>after</em> everyone has converted to Islam.</p>
              <p>When future descendents of today's Muslims understand that, and look back at
                          what their ancestors have done, they may well not see a past or heritage to be
                          proud of.</p>
              <p>Why is it so dangerous -- all around the world -- to criticize the Islamic
                          ideology?</p>
              <p>No other ideology has enjoyed the luxury of being praised as the
                          "religion of peace" while providing exactly the opposite.</p>
