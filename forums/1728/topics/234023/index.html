Not even one in millions.  Yet in deep sleep, all has to let go.  How can one be denied such a precious state of beingness.<br><br>For a person that has experienced no-self (non-duality), deep sleep is even more important.  It is the completion of a full cycle of non-duality and natural beingness.<br><br>But this may not be the case for one that clings to the "Eternal Witnessing".  There is a very subtle holding in them for mantaining this witnessing subconciously thereby denying them from naturally going into deep sleep.  If it reaches a point that presents itself as a problem, it is a signal to the practitioner that it is time to let go and dissolve the holding of the Witness, the center.  It will be tough to simply try just "let go" of the center and if this is the case, an insight into our "emptiness nature" may help.<br><br>Only after going through a full cycle of natural non-duality and beingness in all three states will a practitioner sleep be shorten.  I called this the second cycle of non-duality.<br><br></div>

It is also this vitality aspect of Presence that took over the main role during deep sleep.  For me it has been ongoing till now, powerfully presence.  When the mind is not making interpretations and the pure energy felt directly in its raw state, it is felt as vibrational, continuously dancing.  In a pool of saliva, at the back of forehead, at crown center, on top of your head, tongue, all cells seem dancing vibrantly everywhere.  It is as if you have touched 'pure life' and brings whatever in contact to life. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The 'beingness' is charged powerfully by this vitality.  It forms part of the clarity, bliss and joy.</span></strong>  It is one of the core aspects of Presence, not just the knowingness.  When the aspects of clear knowingness, vitality and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>self propensity</strong></span> are fused, Presence is shaped and seemed to come from a 'center', that 'center' in actual case it is rather a  sensation of a 'mysterious depth', it should not be localized.  Drop that Â‘centerÂ’, allow the flow to arise from the mysterious deep of nowhere, from the beingness of the arising phenomena itself, no attempt is made to sink back to a center; there is no need to; it connects All.<br><br>ps: knowingness and vitality cannot be separated, it is for discussion sake that i separate them.</div>

No.<br><br>In the past, I would have thought that it existed... as our true self. Not anymore.<br><br>So what causes the impression of the Witness?<br><br>From deep meditative observation, the witness is realised to be just an impression that is caused by subtle knowingness and sequential observation. Moment to moment arises in lightning fast speed. The second moment got a subtle imprint of the recently preceded one. This sequential change causes the sense of Subtle Witnessing known as the Eternal Witness.<br><br>There is no permanent unchanging Witness, but ever changing moment to moment witnessing. In another word, no permanent 'Eternal Witness' exist. </blockquote>Edit: Articles by longchen of his insights and experiences on his spiritual path can be read at <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/articles-path.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamdatum.com/articles-path.html</a></div>

Vipassana, as a quality of mind, is related to all seven, but most directly with the first: "seeing," i.e., seeing events in terms of the four noble truths and the duties appropriate to them. The remaining six approaches cover ways of carrying out those duties: restraining the mind from focusing on sense data that would provoke unskillful states of mind; reflecting on the appropriate reasons for using the requisites of food, clothing, shelter, and medicine; tolerating painful sensations; avoiding obvious dangers and inappropriate companions; destroying thoughts of sensual desire, ill will, harmfulness, and other unskillful states; and developing the seven factors for Awakening: mindfulness, analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture, serenity, concentration, and equanimity.<br><br>Each of these approaches covers a wide subset of approaches. Under "destroying," for instance, one may eliminate an unskillful mental state by replacing it with a skillful one, focusing on its drawbacks, turning one's attention away from it, relaxing the process of thought-fabrication that formed it, or suppressing it with the brute power of one's will (MN 20). Many similar examples could be drawn from other discourses as well. The overall point is that the ways of the mind are varied and complex. Different fermentations can come bubbling up in different guises and respond to different approaches. One's skill as a meditator lies in mastering a variety of approaches and developing the sensitivity to know which approach will work best in which situation.<br><br><strong>On a more basic level, however, one needs strong motivation to master these skills in the first place. Because appropriate attention requires abandoning dichotomies that are so basic to the thought patterns of all people Â— "being/not being" and "me/not me" Â— meditators need strong reasons for adopting it. This is why the Sabbasava Sutta insists that anyone developing appropriate attention must first must hold the noble ones (here meaning the Buddha and his awakened disciples) in high regard. In other words, one must see that those who have followed the path are truly exemplary. One must also be well-versed in their teaching and discipline. According to MN 117, "being well-versed in their teaching" begins with having conviction in their teachings about karma and rebirth, which provide intellectual and emotional context for adopting the four noble truths as the basic categories of experience. Being well-versed in the discipline of the noble ones would include, in addition to observing the precepts, having some skill in the seven approaches mentioned above for abandoning the fermentations.<br><br>Without this sort of background, meditators might bring the wrong attitudes and questions to the practice of watching arising and passing away in the present moment. For instance, they might be looking for a "true self" and end up identifying Â— consciously or unconsciously Â— with the vast, open sense of awareness that embraces all change, from which it all seems to come and to which it all seems to return. Or they might long for a sense of connectedness with the vast interplay of the universe, convinced that Â— as all things are changing Â— any desire for changelessness is neurotic and life-denying. For people with agendas like these, the simple experience of events arising and passing away in the present won't lead to fivefold knowledge of things as they are. They'll resist recognizing that the ideas they hold to are a fermentation of views, or that the experiences of calm that seem to verify those ideas are simply a fermentation in the form of a state of being. As a result, they won't be willing to apply the four noble truths to those ideas and experiences. Only a person willing to see those fermentations as such, and convinced of the need to transcend them, will be in a position to apply the principles of appropriate attention to them and thus get beyond them...</strong></span></div>
