When we tok about awareness it has to be only One, this is what Awareness is and it has to be so, non-dual by nature.  Therefore opening up is to give up all and everything relating to 'self'.

            <div class='col-md body'>Many advaita masters have advised ppl to experience the 'Self' but the essence of liberation is not in experiencing the Â‘SelfÂ’.  One can experience the Â“I AMnessÂ”, the pure sense of existence a million times yet does not help in any aspect of enlightenment regardless of how mystical and transcendental the experience can be.<br><br>More harms are done if such experience enhanced our dualistic thought.  In fact the wrong conclusion that awareness is a changeless, permanent entity is the result of distorting a non-dual experience due to the inability of our mind to go beyond its habitual dualistic thinking mechanism.  When the dualistic mind attempts to understand this experience, it projects this Â‘SelfÂ’ as the background to fit the non-dual experience into its dualistic framework.  Such experience cannot lead to liberation because it is dualistic in nature.  Any form of separation is non-liberating.<br><br>Therefore emphasis must be placed correctly on the 'no-self' aspect of awareness.  Awareness is by nature non-dual.  Being non-dual it is impermanent, ceaselessly and spontaneously manifesting as All.  This is the clarity that must come from direct experience.  There is no compromise regarding these aspects of our pristine nature.  It must be thoroughly clear to experience the self-liberating nature of awareness.<br></div>

It is also the same as no subject-object split. 'No subject-object split' means the illusion of an observer and the being observed is being understood and removed.<br><br>Below is a description of how non-duality feels like.<br><br>I have noticed that non-duality (or non dual experience) has various depths and degrees.<br><br>Certain times there are more mental thoughts, certain times less and this give rise to different degrees of vividness and sense of Oneness.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At times, sense of being at a location can be greatly diminished... instead what is being felt are all the sensations that made up 'here-ness'... For in truth, 'here-ness' is really made up of perceptions and sensations... For example, the sensations of pressure of the feet against the floor... they are just that..sensations. Likewise, the visual perceptions and hearing and so on so forth are just that.</span></strong><br><br>For in truth, 'location-space', 'individuality-self', ' inner-outer', etc are impressions.<br><br>There is also a spacious or all-pervading quality to the experience of non-duality and this is what was meant as a sense of Oneness. At times, objects and surroundings can be 'de-cognated' ( that is ... freed from being perceived as such) and a free-ing joyful and vitalising feeling can be felt. This feels like the mind has finally comes to a must-needed rest from its incessant mental activities.<br><br>Also, in the deeper range of non duality, brightness becomes stronger. This brightness is the result of mind's deconstruction which allows for intense penetration into consciousness. The Brightness can be so intense that it is truly stunning.<br><br>Please understand that all along our existence has been non-dual. There is no attaining to non-duality... It is only the 'sense of self' that created the impression of duality. Even when the 'sense of self' is there, existence is still non-dual. We never live out of non-duality.<br><br>Also, there is another point to add...<br><br>Non-duality is NOT the same as a state of Witnessing Presence observing Phenomenality. An Eternal Witnessing Presence that is apart from Phenomena cannot be said to be non dual as there are two components here (witness and phenomena). This experience is characterised by a non-judging watcher observing the world and mind. I had this experience before. And now, I must say that true non-duality is distinctively different from this. The witness/watcher is really not separated from the rest of the world . It (this witness) is not unchanging, but is simply a knowingness that is not apart from the flow of phenomenality.<br><br>Non duality can only be stably experienced when the 'sense of self' and the 'Eternal Witness' are correctly understood for what they are.<br><br>For your necessary ponderance.
