Ever since she was young, she has spirits that approached her and asked her to pass messages. She was terrified and refused. Sometimes, they would become 'violent' and she would wake up with bruises on her arms etc. Eventually she said she went to temple for help, and monk taught her a buddhist chant which she would chant whenever the spirits come near her.<br><br></div>

Cos this can open up the channel for medium.<br><br>I am told by a friend.. thusness, that <span style="font-style: italic;">There are several reasons, it can arise due to karmic affinity, it can arise due to karmic debt, it can arise due to wrong practices.  If he practice concentration without proper guide especially focusing in between the eyebrown, it might open up the channel for medium.  Without proper guidance, this could happen.</span><br><br>If it is due to karmic affinity and karmic debt, then i think it is easier to solve as the experience negotiator can do something about it.

Often this needs to be done.. if you want to overcome yourself without such help with negotiators, then you must be prepared to suffer many years, it can take years and depending on your practice... no doctors can help. We must start practising the dharma diligently ourselves to overcome such situations. If you practice no-self and is able to experience presence in the correct way, it does not affect you. Because there will be no entry point. When we are constantly authenticated by Presence and there is no entry for that trance level to take place.  That level of consciousness does not exist.  No external forces can forcefully create that communication unless it is open due to some reason.  Due to lack of proper practices.<br><br>Thats wat i learnt from thusness.</div>
