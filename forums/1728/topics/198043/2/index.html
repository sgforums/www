Certain Deities who have affinity with the person would pick him or her to be their Medium. Its seem like everything don't go their way or smoothly unless they become the Medium of the Deity usually for a period of time depending on what the Particular Deity request. There is no way to resolve it unless with the help fo a Taoist Priest to make a petition to the Deity unless the Particular Deity comes with agreement with it then everyting will be back to normal. But in course of it usually you got to fulfil the Deity other requests, may be in form of certain offerings or vows. If not, in the course of your daily lives, trance may happen suddenly trigger by external factors &amp; conditions randomly. Untill you accede the Deity's request if not there will not be a day of peace in your life unless you agreed to embark on your Spiritual Task as medium. Chanting will only keep the Trance at bay cannot eradicate it, sooner or later one will give in as they are mentally &amp; physically tired over the whole thing. "Big &amp; Small Uncle", the Black &amp; White Deities of Underworld has different emanations &amp; post at different level of Hell. Each of the 18th levels of Hell has their own governing spirits of these 2 Deities together with their "Generals" who are their assistants. It varies with each Level with consideration of their Power &amp; Strength.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, luckily you have asked this question in the buddhist forum.<br><br>1) My dharma teacher has a disciple which has similar problem. Sometimes, she will see some hands crawling in front of her.<br>When she asked him about how to solve this. His reply is simply "calm yourself down and look at it". She did that, and the unknown hands just disappear hereafter.<br><br>2) There are many other ways also, like what AEN has said, to share merits and of good deeds with them.<br><br>3) Another way is chanting mantra, for me, I will chant "da2 bei1 zhou2", if on urgency that you can't bring a book to chant the whole mantra which is rather long, nevermind, chant the essence of it "om vajra dharma hrih", this mantra is very powerful.<br>Remember this mantra is not supposed to chase them away, but rather teach them to be good or even convince them to become buddhist.<br><br>If your intention is to chase them away, that won't solve the problems from root, they might come back again. Spirits can feel your intention. Who knows, they might be your parents how many kalpas ago, pity them and help them.<br><br>4) Another way is keep your 5 precepts, it is said that buddhist who keep 5 precepts will always be protected by dharma protectors. Hence, no need to worry at all.<br><br>5) Or you can go and ask a monk for help, sometimes just by talking with an enlightened monk, you will find that the next day, your problems are solved already.<br><br>I am looking forward to hear you happily solving this problem.<br><br>Jus to share with you all, the HDB flats sometimes got the sound like someone playing with marble, my friend told me that the marbles are placed during construction so that the spirits will play the marble instead of the residents. Don't know is it true or not. Next time when you hear this, chant a mantra and see how.<br></div>

That is also one of the way by petitioning to the higher order of the Deity. Of coz there is a need to have some offerings. There are many "Sin Tua" around, its best not to be overly involve in them, just go to Temple with sincere heart &amp; pray that is good enough. As for the question of Superiority, Quan Zhen Sect is one of the Orthodox Taoist Faction, Mao Shan Sect  is considered Unorthodox Taoist Faction but they do have many branches too like "San Shan" Sect &amp; "Jin Ying" Sect, interm of their Prowess, irregardless those deemed Orthodox or Unorthodox has their good &amp; bad.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm an eternal way , what you say about the concentration between the eyebrows interest me . Can you elaborate more on that ? i really wanna know can ? Cos i think i got attempt at that but it was for the sake of my friend cos when she was hospitalised , i visited her and her mother told us to visualise something like dew or what raining onto her is like curing her let her recover faster . i tried that and find that it was quite easy for me to do that . Perhaps this prompted the whole incident . Or perhaps you can give me a book toking abt that ?<br>And hor what does this concentrating between the eyebrows actually do ? What will it lead to ? And what does it call ? I really interested to know , any name for this practise ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's what Thusness has been afraid of. There are many names to the third eyes but it is normally not advisable to practice concentrating in between the eyebrow.<br><br>Have you seen anything yet? Or just told by your taoist temple. If your third eye is open you will be able to see them.<br><br>Third eye is the most sensitive chakra and can be open easily for certain type of ppl which is not a good thing. Very often it starts from concentration on the lower abodment of the body. In taoist, they call it the lower tan dian, the middle tan dian is the one between eye brown. Normally practices do not start from there... it is through circulation  that it is being raised there. Even in the hindu and kundalini practices, it is also practice that way.<br><br>Not easy....to just suka suka focus, if that person astrological chart is low yin and from the observation of the 5 factors a master guage that he/she is indeed low yin, and the purpose is not for mediumship, he will not start with the upper dan tian, or the agnya chraka.<br><br>Often an experience master will decide based on 6 factors:<br><br>1.  The intended purpose<br>2.  The Chi of that person<br>3.  Se (Color)<br>4.  Shen (Spirit)<br>5.  Srength of the voice<br>6. Astrological chart<br><br>But if you haven't seen things so far it should be OK.<br><br>as advised by thusness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh now all is clear as the purest water , today while i was working , the medium and her husband came to yo my house to " test water " and also to check out who helped me out . But after some debate which the medium keep feiging ignorance and make up stories , they were defeated thoroughly by my angry mother over what they trying to do and cover up . Being dumbstruck by my mother they find excuse to go back .<br>The fact is actually the real person whom is supposed to be the ki tong is their own son . But because they know how tough it is so they push the medium thing to me n even tried to use force on me to make me submit . Too bad they think too highly of themself and never expect me to have other taoist friend outside whom can help me counter them . Now they know i will never helop them out and their son will sure to be ki tong so today they die die must pretend dunno come to my house to test . So much for so called " holy pple agn "  The more the person think they are holy , the further they are away from that term .<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To tell you the truth , there was a duration of time where i can really see them in flashing images . Which means i can see them in flashing images like those flashes from cameras but not very clear though . So perhaps during that time i was too stressed and exchausted and always beside them so maybe sort of absorb their chi without knowing .<br>But during that time i really can see them a few times once when i was in a pub with my friend when i suddenly have this feeling of them being come to check on me n i can see them walking in through the door only to disappear after walking past me to the counter . The second time was i was in the middle of the session where i have a feeling the hei wu chang coming and even able to see him walking towards my direction . And not long afterwards the bai wu chang left the medium body and hei wu chang possed the medium body to tok .<br>So whats the conclusion ? Do i need to seek treatment although no i longer see them with my eye ?<br></div>
