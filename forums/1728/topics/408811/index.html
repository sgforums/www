              <p></p>
              <p>ya, depend on affinity 'yuan'. there are a few examples in either circumstances.</p>
              <p>one is Culapanthaka who is toward lacking of understanding side also can reach enlightenment through mind disciplining.</p>
              <p>Cudapanthaka, The Door Watching Arhat (16): (Also called Culapanthaka, or Pantha the Younger) This is the younger brother of Panthaka above; his name means "Little Panthaka," or Road-born. There are two famous stories about him. One is that he was slow-witted, and unable to learn even a single verse. But the Buddha, using skillful means, taught him to sweep (in some versions, to wipe) and repeat a simple verse, such as "Sweeping broom," to focus his mind. This simple method led him to Enlightenment. Another story says that he used to knock roughly on people's doors to beg for food. Once, he knocked on an old, rotten door, and it fell to pieces! So the Buddha gave him a ringed staff (like that held by Bhadra next to him) and told him to pound the ground with it, instead of pounding on the door with his fist. Through this (and the sweeping association) he came to be thought of as one who guards the doors of the senses, letting only pure things in.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, when Ananda listened to Buddha teach the Shurangama Sutra, He was able to understand the meaning/Insight, and he was just a 1st stage stream entry but those 4th stage Arahats who practice samathi meditation, were not able to understand the idea of Mahayana. There was "yuan" affinity involve.</p>
              <p>Another example is from Huineng. A nun who had been reciting Lotus Sutra for decades, but she was not able to understand it, but Huineng heard a few chapters and straight away can understand. this tell us if u recite with the mind scattering around, is of no use. ""å�£å¿µå¼¥é™€å¿ƒæ•£ä¹±,å–Šç ´å–‰å’™ä¹Ÿæž‰ç„¶"ã€‚"</p>
              <p>so if can understand, good, if cannot understand, no need to force.</p>
              <p>Note that knowledge in Buddhism is different from Wisdom/Insight in Buddhism. It's å­¦ä½› learn to be like the Buddha, not ä½›å­¦, learn Buddhism to take examination.</p>

              <p>Master Shen Kai once said - chanting sutra is not as good as understanding sutra, understanding sutra is not as good as practicing sutra, practicing sutra is not as good as attaining/realizing the sutra.</p>
              <p>So better than chanting is to study, learn, understand the meaning of the sutra. Better than studying sutra is to put the sutra into practice. And even higher level is to attain and realize the essence of the sutra.</p>

              <p><br>very Possible. like in Lotus sutra, Buddha explain those with affinity can believe, those without like the Arahats, don't believe mean don't believe, no matter how hard u try to explain to them. same with Amitabha Sutra, too simple become a obstacle of doubt.</p>
              <p>anyway the main thing of reciting is to stop the mind from wandering. if u think it can help you stop the mind from wandering æ‘„å¿ƒ, then by all mean. Different people have different ways of getting a good result. some use samadhi/concentration, while some use insight.</p>
              <p>Old Master Chin Kung told us, He can't do Nianfo for too long, He rather READ Sutra and commentaries from passed Grand Masters And also do Dharma Talk daily to keep the mind occupied and focus. we think He's talking to the audience, He said, actually, He's teaching Himself. like i'm posting this, i'm also learning.</p>
              <p>So yea, if the sutras are not easy to understand due to the way the chinese (æ–‡è¨€æ–‡) are put, you can read commentaries by well established Masters. They are explained in layman term for people of today to understand.</p>
              <p>but since my chinese reading is not good, i prefer <strong>listen</strong> to Old Master Chin Kung explain to us better. i also cannot do chanting/reciting for too long with the time schedule i have. but listen. yes. either when taking a bus/mrt, working in the office. then like AEN mentioned, it's even more important to made it into practice after attaining/understanding.</p>
              <p>then i'll say of all the understanding, all and all the Buddhadharma teach us to get rid of attachment. some ppl don't know this and become attached to Buddhism. Buddha taught to get rid of attachment, not switch the object of attachment from worldly to Dharma. fyi. anyway happy learning. :)</p>

              <p>Even though you asked questions under false pretenses, your  questions have merit and warrant a reply.</p>
              <p>Even though you've apologized(twice as I recall), without sincerity or any remorse over your actions, your questions have merit and warrant a relpy.</p>
              <p>Why?  Because of others online who are genuinely interested in Buddhism, however, do not or unable to pose a question, therefore bears merit and warrant a reply.</p>

              <p>Generally, living beings may not live until that long or the privilege lest they has the blessings to recite the sutra at 12 hours every day, just concentrating on one sutra. It also depends on its roots. There was instance of a Venerable who renounced at the age of 7 years old during the period of Master Hui Neng where he recited on only one very large sutra - Lotus Sutra for 3000 times, one time a day, the period should be about ten years, still not even enlighten, needless to mention attain supreme. It is not the matter of recitation, but sentient beings' blessings,  its root and affinity (yuan).</p>
