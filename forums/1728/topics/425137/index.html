              <p>Lama Zopa Rinpoche wanted to send this message out to all Centers and students that may be affected by the tsunami. Rinpoche is advising to recite the Ksitibharba mantra and prayer and also to recite Buddhas name mantra, taking strong refuge and making strong prayers. Rinpoche said this is beneficial to for others who are being affected, even if you are not. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guru Shakyamuni Prayer and Mantra </p>
              <p>La ma tön pa chom dän dä</p>
              <p>De zhin sheg pa dra chom pa </p>
              <p>Yang dag par dzog päi sang gyä</p>
              <p>Päl gyäl wa shakya thub pa la </p>
              <p>Chhag tshäl lo chhö do kyab su chhi wo</p>
              <p>Jin gyi lab tu söl </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To the guru, founder, bhagavan, tathagata, arhat, perfectly completed buddha, glorious conqueror Shakyamuni Buddha, I prostrate, make offerings, and go for refuge. Please grant me your blessings. Recite as much as you can (not just 3 times) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kshitigarbha Practice </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I prostrate, go for refuge, and make offerings to the bodhisattva Kshitigarbha who has unbearable compassion for me and all sentient beings who are suffering and whose minds are obscured, who has qualities like the sky and liberates sentient beings from all suffering and gives every happiness. Please grant blessings! (3x) </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With hands folded in prostration, you can visualize doing the prostration to all the buddhas and bodhisattvas – that becomes prostration when you say the word “prostration.” When you say “refuge,” think that you are asking to be free from the two obscurations (to be able to achieve enlightenment). When you say the word “offering,” think all the offerings that you have are then offered. Then, when you ask for “blessings,” think in the mind the whole path to enlightenment – this is the blessing to be received. So the extensive benefits of this mantra will be translated. This is the mantra that Kshitigarbha heard from buddhas equaling the number of sand grains of the river Ganga (in India). He made offerings to them and then received this mantra. This is the story of the mantra – how to receive all of the benefits. This mantra is to be used for any difficulties of problems. It is the best one to do for any problems in any situation. Even reciting it only four or five times – just a few times – is very powerful. It speaks so much of power, showing how important the bodhisattva is. Even to recite or just to think of the name of the bodhisattva is very, very powerful. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Long Mantra:</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Short Mantra: OM AH KSHITI GARBHA THALENG HUM </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha’s Praise of Kshitigarbha You have generated stability of thought and the pure altruistic thought of bodhichitta and have eliminated the sufferings of immeasurable sentient beings. I see (sentient beings) receiving happiness as from a wish-granting jewel, and like the vajra you cut the nets of others’ doubts. You offer holy offerings to the foe destroyers, the qualified ones gone beyond, with great compassionate thought and perseverance. You liberate sentient beings from their sufferings with oceans of wisdom. Because you have no fear (delusions), you have gone beyond samsara. Brahma heard this mantra and then said to the entire assembly, “Please rejoice in the mantra I have now said.” And Buddha said, “Great, great.”  </p>
              <p>This practice is especially beneficial for those who have heavy problems, serious health problems, big projects, or financial difficulties. I suggest it is extremely powerful to recite every day for protection, at least four or five times or more, depending on how crucial it is. This practice is effective even to grow crops well and to protect land and crops. In the sutra of the bodhisattva Kshitigarbha are explained the extensive benefits and qualities: they are like the sky, like skies of benefit to all beings. There have been experiences, similar benefits (to those spoken of in the sutra) received by those who practice Kshitigarbha.</p>
