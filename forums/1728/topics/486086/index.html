              <p>by Neil Jalaldeen</p>
              <p>The most important catalyst for triggering Awakening to no-self is to
               investigate our Direct Experience. Direct Experience is what is 
              noticed, here and now.<br> We can skilfully divide d.E., for the purposes of investigation, into 3 main aspects:</p>
              <p>1) <strong>thought</strong></p>
              <p>2) <strong>sensations</strong><br> seeing<br> hearing<br> smelling<br> tasting<br> feeling [tactile + kinesthetic)</p>
              <p>3) <strong>an unmistakable sense of Aliveness </strong><br> (presence, being)</p>
              <p>The illusion of separation is maintained by a stream of self 
              referencing thoughts that are based on past conditioning. The most 
              common reference point is a thought-created center referred to as “I” / 
              “me” / “self”. There is no such center, and those self-labels refer only
               to other thoughts, or to some aspect of Experience.</p>
              <p>By referring to d.E., one is able to deconstruct any assumptions of 
              separation or self, and see that there is just an Experience. There may 
              be thoughts about Experience that conceptually divide certain aspects of
               Experience into a “me” and other aspects into “the outside world”, yet 
              those thoughts are also just a part of Experience, and as such there is 
              ONLY Experience.</p>
              <p>There is an assumption that there is an experience-er that 
              experiences. This is propagated by a belief, as expressed by a thought 
              such as “I experience”. We investigate this in d.E. by looking for this 
              “I”. Is there a separate “I”, or is there just an Experience that 
              thought conceptually divides as such: “I” + “what is experienced”?</p>
              <p>There is an assumption that there is a perceive-er that perceives. 
              This is propagated by a belief, as expressed by a thought such as “I am 
              the perceiver”. We investigate this in d.E. by looking for this 
              perceiver. We can see that there is no such thing as a perceiver, just a
               perception and thought dividing it in to an “I” + “body” + “perception 
              through the senses”.</p>
              <p>A sound is heard, then there is a thought “I hear a sound”. We can 
              investigate and see that there is no hearer of sounds, just sound. If 
              there is something felt and assumed to be the hearer, or self, is it 
              anything more than some other sensations? or that sense of Aliveness? or
               another thought?</p>
              <p>“I feel my body against the chair” a thought says. So, we investigate
               d.E. and see that there are sensations that are habitually labelled 
              “body” and other sensations we refer to as “feeling of chair against 
              body”. When we investigate where this “I” is that claims these 
              sensations, it cannot be found, as there is either another 
              self-referencing thought, some sensations or another aspect of 
              Experience.</p>
              <p>We can pick up an object, and look at it. We might say “I am looking 
              at the object”. We then test this conclusion to see if it correlates 
              with d.E., and what we find is that there is a sensation of seeing, and 
              maybe some sensations that we usually label ‘head’ or ‘eyes’, or even 
              other feeling-sensations labelled “body”. A thought may arise with the 
              conclusion that these are inherently separate, and that one is “self” 
              and the other is “what is observed”. When we test this out we see that 
              there is never an “I” looking, never a watcher, never a seer. There is 
              only seeing, only feeling, only Experiencing. We can say that it is 
              simply Experience experiencing itself.</p>
              <p>We look deeply in to Experience, and see that the assumptions of 
              separation, self, “I”, perceive-er or an experience-er are just 
              references to Experience. There is never an actual separate object, just
               the perception of such, and thoughts labeling it. We deconstruct all 
              these assumptions of there being a watcher, or a looker, or a hearer, 
              and find that there is only Experience, never an actual separate self.</p>
              <p>Is it possible there is just Experience, with no separate experience-er?</p>
