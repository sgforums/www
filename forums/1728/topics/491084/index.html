              begin with the Buddha himself. The Buddha didn’t remain silently seated under
              the Bodhi tree, keeping his awakening to himself, hidden in his soul’s depths.
              Rather, he went out into the world, and the<span> </span><em style="word-wrap: break-word;">dharma</em>began to engage with its culture and
              society of 2500 years ago.</span></p>

              kind of community of resistance to the existing caste and hierarchical system.
              In itself, it was a model of community and community development. The Buddha
              also taught about worldly affairs. Yet we must recognize that the Buddha taught
              not only perennial truths about the human condition and the way to happiness.
              He also articulated his understanding of human suffering (<em style="word-wrap: break-word;">dukkha</em>)
              in the Iron Age world where society was viewed essentially as a collection of
              individuals (Stephen Batchelor,<span> </span><em style="word-wrap: break-word;"><a style="word-wrap: break-word;" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/030020518X/counterpunchmaga"><span style="color: #333333; letter-spacing: 0pt;">After Buddhism: rethinking the dharma for a secular age</span></a></em><span> </span>[2015], pp. 1-28).</span></p>

              Buddhist scholars argue that the socially engaged Buddhist movement is really
              the creation of modernity. That is, the central preoccupation of Buddhist Asian
              civilizations has not been the “saving of the world.”</span></p>

              societies understood themselves within the narrative of progress. They had
              hard-won traditions of human rights, liberal democracy and collective welfare.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>These were
              also societies that had been secularized. Religion gradually receded and
              relinquished its control over all domains of existence, and came to be imagined
              as a mostly private matter or concern.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>Moreover,
              these western liberal democracies suffered from the “malaise of modernity”:
              loss of meaning, feelings of alienation and powerlessness, unhappiness in the
              midst of the glut of material possessions, despair over deepening discrepancies
              between rich and poor, social fragmentation, moral confusion and pervasive
              personality disorders and addictions, plus an ever degrading eco-structure.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>For many
              western Buddhists, then, it certainly seemed that any spirituality that focused
              exclusively on the cultivation of the inner world would not speak to the
              anguish of modernity. Buddhists in both the West and the East were forced to
              examine their own traditions and practices as they sought, and struggled, to be
              an integral part of the conversation about the future of their societies.</span></p>

              Buddhism is an international movement whose participants seek to apply the
              Buddhist ideals of wisdom and compassion to present-day social, political, and
              environmental issues. Although Buddhism has typically given priority to the
              spiritual liberation of the individual, engaged Buddhists look for ways to
              expand the notion of spiritual liberation to other arenas (without abandoning
              the essential role of individual enlightenment)” (p. 9).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'> </span></p>

              provides us with a working definition: “Engaged Buddhism entails both inner and
              outer work. We must change the world, we must change ourselves, and we must
              change ourselves in order to change the world. Awareness and compassionate
              action reinforce each other” (p. 10). Left humanist visionaries must take this
              challenge to heart.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>Socially
              engaged Buddhist thinkers and practitioners reject the idea perpetuated by some
              comparative religion scholars (like Max Weber) that Buddhism is a
              world-denying, world-rejecting religion. “Sitting practice” is not set off
              against “non-sitting practice.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>The main
              reason for the rejection of the dualism—contemplation and action—has to do with
              the profound insight into the relationship between the Buddha’s teaching on
              suffering as part of our existential condition and suffering that is produced
              by social arrangements.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>Ken Jones, author of one the first texts on socially engaged

              Buddha’s axial teaching that the root cause of our suffering is “divisive and
              delusive self-need” (p. 194), observes that we live in “socio-historical
              conditions which institutionalize alienation, ill-will, aggressiveness, and
              acquisitiveness” (ibid.). In turn, these societal conditions are karmically
              inherited by each new generation.</span></p>

              suffering this way. “Greed, anger, and delusion—known as the ‘three poisons’ in
              Buddhism—need to be uprooted in our personal lives, but they have to be dealt
              with as social and political realities. Throughout the world today, large-scale
              systems cause suffering as surely as psychological factors cause suffering.
              Traditional Buddhism focused on the latter; engaged Buddhism focuses on both”
              (1999, p. 10).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>Put
              differently, social structures and ideological systems can be understood as the
              institutionalization of the three poisons. This means that the pursuit of
              enlightenment is a dual project. Buddhists insist that we must confront our own

              socially-engaged Buddhists, meditation is not a turning away from society. The
              Buddha is teaching us, they say, that without healing our own alienation and
              delusions, we won’t be able to develop the necessary insight into social
              dukkha. Our efforts to effect social change will only be undermined. Here, it
              seems, Buddhism speaks to secular activists who often proceed to try to change
              particular social or political or cultural arrangements without any inner work.
              The great Canadian humanist adult educator, Watson Thomson, said that radical
              activists had to “be what they were attempting to build anew in the world.”</span></p>

              attending to what is going on in the world. However, it does seem that the cultivation
              of “aspirational compassion or loving-kindness” could remain just that, an
              aspiration, inner experience that softens and opens our hearts to the anguish
              of the world, but leaves it at that.</span></p>

              American Zen poet and environmentalist Gary Snyder states, rather scathingly,
              that: “Although Mahayana Buddhism has a grand vision of universal salvation,
              the actual achievement of Buddhism has been the development of practical
              systems of meditation toward the end of liberating a few dedicated individuals
              from psychological hang-ups and cultural conditioning. Institutional Buddhism
              has been conspicuously ready to accept or ignore the inequalities and tyrannies
              of whatever political system it found itself under. This can be death to
              Buddhism, because it is death to any meaningful function of compassion. Wisdom
              without compassion feels no pain”.</span></p>

              acknowledges that there were individuals who engaged in acts of compassionate
              action. But the record, he says, “consists mainly of individual acts of

              with helping hands” as represented in the final frame of the Ten Ox herding

              go into the reasons for this world-withdrawal. But proponents of “Critical
              Buddhism” in Japan have proposed that the reason lies in the Ch’an and Zen
              teaching of “original enlightenment”—the understanding that “sentient beings
              are originally Buddha’s.” Thus, if slaves and clear-cut hillsides are Buddha’s

              this contentious debate within Buddhism alerts us to the way Buddhist notions
              could be interpreted to justify withdrawing from engagement with various forms
              of exploitation and oppression. Karma is a good example: misinterpreted, karma

              gears, let’s look at six specific contributions that Buddhism makes to social

              cultivating certain psycho-spiritual qualities—breaking with one’s own fear and
              self-protection and desire for vengefulness—so that one can be present in the
              face of anger and violence with a deep calmness and compassion. This is the
              practice of equanimity. Joanna Macey’s early book,<span> </span><em style="word-wrap: break-word;"><a style="word-wrap: break-word;" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0865710317/counterpunchmaga"><span style="color: #333333; letter-spacing: 0pt;">Despair and Power in the Nuclear Age</span></a></em><span> </span>(1983), worked innovatively with the
              Buddhist idea that one had to face, and move through one’s own fears, before
              one could be a peace activist.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; word-wrap: break-word; max-width: 560px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #111111;'>2) The Buddhist cultivation of selflessness. Mahayana
              teachings—the way of the bodhisattva—emphasize the fundamental importance of
              “getting ourselves out of the way” to be present with the suffering of others.
              So selflessness and compassion are two sides of the same coin. The difficult
              and c0ntroversial Tibetan practice of<span> </span><em style="word-wrap: break-word;">tonglen</em><span> </span>shatters
              the dualism of good self/evil other by taking the evil imaginatively into one’s
              heart space and, by so doing, breaking any sense of “superior/inferior self”.</span></p>

Both Christianity
              and Buddhism are non-violent in origin. Neither is, however, without blemish in
              its historical actions. Buddhism teaches that hating and acting violently earns
              negative karma as individuals and as a society. So, they insist that we must
              refrain from violent acts and hateful thoughts (For an incisive commentary on
              Buddhism and violence, see Bernard Faure, “Part III: Buddhism and society,” in<span> </span><em style="word-wrap: break-word;"><a style="word-wrap: break-word;" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1405180641/counterpunchmaga"><span style="color: #333333; letter-spacing: 0pt;">Unmasking Buddhism</span></a></em><span> </span>[2009]).</span></p>

              “karmic seeds.” Buddhist contemplative practices move us inwardly in ways that
              go against our cultural conditioning, and tendency to solidify ourselves
              through defining the other as threatening and fearful. Many Buddhist teachings
              and writings analyze how we can “transform anger”. This is a particularly
              essential practice for those struggling for social justice. One might argue
              that unless we expel the oppressor within our anger fueled by injustice will
              replicate the patterns we are trying to transform. That was Paulo Freire’s
              point, too, in his classic text,<span> </span><em style="word-wrap: break-word;"><a style="word-wrap: break-word;" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826412769/counterpunchmaga"><span style="color: #333333; letter-spacing: 0pt;">Pedagogy of the Oppressed</span></a></em><span> </span>(1970).</span></p>

This axiom links to the
              notion of selflessness and non-violence. Our sense of being a separate self is,
              at root, the source of adversarial relations and aggressive action. It is not
              easy to learn that my good is your good; your good is my good. But the global
              Buddhist community, it seems to me, must think deeply about how those who have
              Power are confronted, given that they hold on to it against the wishes of those
              who are suffering from oppression and exploitation.</span></p>

              particular social and political actors? How do they (and others too) respond on
              the geo-political front to the genocidal actions of groups? Is a violent

              This attitude of embracing all sentient beings, of seeing interconnectedness or
              inter-being is the epistemological basis for Buddhist social and ecological
              action. There is a growing, and increasingly sophisticated, literature on the
              dharma and ecology. Indeed, many Buddhists are very active in various kinds of
              environmentally-oriented social movements.</span></p>

The radical
              teaching of emptiness, once grasped, may loosen attachments to various
              perceptions and actions that become dogmatic. Dogmatism hardens approaches, and
              accentuates conflict between those inside the dogma, and those outside.</span></p>

              widespread dukkha. The delusion and oppression built into those structures must

              asserts both a freedom from the “constraints of self-centred confusion and
              turmoil, from the craving for a fixed identity, from the compulsion to contrive
              a perfect situation, from identification with preconceived opinions, and from
              the anguish that originates in such attachments” (p. 94).</span></p>

              also asserts a freedom “to creatively realize [the world’s] possibilities
              unhindered by the cravings that had previously determined his choices, freed to
              imagine an appropriate response to the anguish of others, freed to cultivate an
              authentic path that embraced all aspects of human life, freed to form a
              community of friendships, and free to create a culture of awakening that would
              survive long after his death” (ibid.).</span></p>

              promoting their awakening, western Buddhists need to incorporate that vision

              two extremes: one, that of inner mysticism which simply abandons profound
              attention and care for the socially created world (perhaps arguing that, well,
              everything is impermanent anyway, why engage in social action), and two,
              accommodation to oppressive political arrangements (even supporting
              state-initiated violence against minorities).</span></p>

              faces many challenges as it migrates into the west and takes up residence. Many
              well seasoned Buddhist practitioners and teachers have issued warnings that the
              dharma could accommodate itself to the advanced, individualism and consumerism
              of contemporary American materialism. That is, it takes its place as one
              exquisite spiritual brand amongst many in the crowded self-help and
              self-improvement market offering salve for the wounded.</span></p>
