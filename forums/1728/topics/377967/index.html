              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Early one morning Buddha 
                    and one of his chief disciples, Ananda, set out from Jetavana to seek alms. 
                    They came to the city of Sravasti. As they entered the city gate and were 
                    walking along a path by the city wall, they saw an aged couple.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Their backs were 
                    crooked and they could neither straighten themselves nor move about. They 
                    were dressed in rags, appearing unhygienic and well worn with age: frail, 
                    toothless, grey hair, hard of hearing and poor eyesight. They lived next 
                    to a pile of rubbish by the derelict wall of a sleazy alley. They crouched 
                    close to each other, facing a normal fire for warmth. With eyes only for 
                    each other, they resembled a pair of old swans that cannot bear to part.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Buddha turned 
                    his head and asked Ananda, "Did you see that aged couple by the wall 
                    and the warmth of the burning cow dung?"<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Ananda replied, 
                    "World Honoured One, I see them."</span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Buddha continued, 
                    "If this old couple had been determined and diligent when they were 
                    young and strong, regardless of the nature of their work as long as it is 
                    legitimate, perhaps at this age they are already amongst the wealthiest 
                    class of people in Sravasti. On the other hand, if they had chosen to renounce 
                    their worldly life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, 
                    perhaps they would have already attained the Arhat [2] by now.<br> <br> Even if they were not that determined when they were young, but are ambitious 
                    and diligent only at a later age and they work with the Right Action, perhaps 
                    they are already amongst the second wealthiest class of people in Sravasti. 
                    Similarly, if on the other hand, they had chosen to renounce their worldly 
                    life to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they 
                    would have already attained the Anagami [2].<br> <br> Worse still, should they only realise about diligence and progress when 
                    they are already at their middle age, and only then began to work with the 
                    Right Action, perhaps they are already amongst the third wealthiest class 
                    of people in Sravasti. If they had chosen to renounce their worldly life 
                    to learn and cultivate the right path with diligence, perhaps they would 
                    have already attained the Sakrdagamin [2].<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">However, they 
                    did none of the above. Instead, they spent their life times loving and possessing 
                    each other, and wasted the most useful time of their lives. That is why 
                    today they are helpless and have no way out of their predicament. They live 
                    in poor conditions, are penniless and there is nothing that they can do. 
                    For them it is a living death, having to face the retribution of their own 
                    doing, and nobody took any pity on them. What meaning is there in a life 
                    like this?"</span><br> <br>

                    people not to fall into the same predicament, the Buddha said, "Ananda, 
                    always remember to advise and guide people:<br> <br> <em>In youth, be determined, diligent, and thrifty and strive to acquire 
                    knowledge.</em><br> <br> <em>Maintain a mind that is distant and unchained from desire and be focused 
                    on building a career during the prime of life.</em><br> <br> <em>In middle age, realise a stable career that is based on diligence, zeal, 
                    progress and Right Action.<br> <br> Always use the wealth meaningfully to benefit self and others.</em><br> <br> <em>Do not wait till old age and rely on the people's benevolence like the 
                    aged swan."</em><br> <br> The above incident demonstrates the compassion of the Buddha in caring for 
                    sentient beings and encouraging people to be determined in striving for 
                    progress, regardless of whether one is concerned with building a career, 
                    or one who has renounced the worldly life to learn and cultivate the right 
                    path. His only wish was for all sentient beings to be distant from suffering 
                    and attain happiness in life. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <em>Notes:<br> [1] Noble Eight-fold Path: <br> 1.
