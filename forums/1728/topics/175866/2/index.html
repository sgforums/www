            <div class='col-md body'>I posted here on the Afterlife Knowledge Forum a couple weeks ago :<br><a href="http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=afterlife_knowledge;action=display;num=1138917286" rel="nofollow">http://www.afterlife-knowledge.com/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=afterlife_knowledge;action=display;num=1138917286</a><br><br>In cases of *identical* twins, because the physical body &amp; brain is genetically identical (after fertilization by a single sperm with a single ovum, the resultant zygote for various biochemical reasons split into two, both of which develop into viable foetuses), and thus being vibrationally similar for the occupying soul, it is a possible option (one that is sometimes, not always, exercised), for the same human soul to occupy both bodies at once.<br><br>Thus, in such a case, the two individuals would have the same soul or higher self. Some souls might choose this (prerequiste being, of course, there are suitable upcoming identical twin biological bodies, whose upcoming life/lives present an appropriate karmic option for the soul in question, in terms of karmic connection with family members, compatibility with the soul's existential program or planned objectives for the lifetime), because to the soul, it means greater opportunity to accomplish learning and work within the same amount of time, akin to multi-tasking.<br><br>Extremely rarely (though theoretically possible, but not practically advisable), does a single human soul incarnate simultaneously into two or more physical bodies, because of the increased difficulty or challenging nature, for the higher self or soul to simultaneously operate or function as two individuals at once (note that we're referring to the level of the individual soul, not the oversoul or disk/disc level). But in the case of genetically identical twins, this becomes less strenous for the soul to do so, and thus, it becomes more feasible of an option.<br><br>Obvious advantages to simultaneously incarnating as identical twins, would be gaining more experience, furthering more relationships, getting more karmic work done, within the same lifetime span.<br><br>Note that this is only an option, which is in practice, rarely exercised. Certainly not all genetically identical twins have the same soul or higher self. But in cases in which genetically identical twins might have curious synchronicities, for instance both experience events with great personal or emotional significance at around the same time, or discarnate/depart from the physical at round the same time, and other such coincidences that goes beyond normal telepathy or psychic attunement.<br><br>In such cases which might seem otherwise enigmatic to the observer, understanding the possibility or mechanism of identical twins having the same soul or higher self, will allow for greater intuitive understanding on the curious synchronicities.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is what i read from late Venerable Master Hsuan Hua as his disciple Dharmamitra state below:<br><br><blockquote>What he did state, apparently based on what he had actually observed in meditation, was that the lowest levels of animal ghosts (as I recall, I believe he was referring to low-level animal ghosts who were in the process of falling yet farther down into the abyss of bad karma) might manifest as swarms of insects, which would help discharge the karmic retribution accumulated by the very low level animal. Presumably, after a time then there would be rebirth again as one of these very low level animals and then gradual ascent back up towards the human realm, a process which could even take kalpas.<br><br>Another instance: He spoke of instances of a single being taking rebirth as a small group of animals, this involving apparently a paying off of some of the heaviest karma, apparently followed by a re-integration either into a higher animal or a preta or eventually, a person.<br><br>The above cases are indeed controversial. But Master Hua's meditative experiences were not what you or I encounter on the meditation cushion. He would not have spoken of these sorts of cases if he had not personally observed them to be the case.<br><br>You may have encountered yet other sorts of reports in his writings that I wasn't around at the time to hear. Can't imagine though that he would ever state this to be the case of one human being reborn as multiple humans.<br><br>Dharmamitra</blockquote>/\<br></div>
