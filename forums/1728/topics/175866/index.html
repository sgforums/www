What we call 'our personality' is the 'sense of self'. It is a continuous stream of thoughts pulsed from the 'soul' that is interfaced with the biological 'form'. Personality is the expression of 'soul'. Just like a radio broadcast station, one 'soul' can pulse into more than one body (radio- 'sense of self').<br><br>Also, space, time, physical location, 'sense of self' are illusions. They, in the deepest sense, do not exist. That could be a reason why simultaneous incarnation is possible.</div>

For example you remembered yesterday you did something, and you think 'That was ME doing it!' Therefore you believe in an eternal Self entity... When the 7th consciousness disappears, then 8th consciousness will kind of lose its function<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The eighth consciousness would be quite useless without the seventh consciousness. It would be nothing more than a receptacle to take things out of and to put things into. It is through the action of the seventh consciousness that our self-identified karmic seeds are stored, and we are kept moving from life to life in the realm of samsara.</span><br><br>In reality, the essence is beyond time and space, its nature is True Suchness.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">We now come to the last skandha, consciousness. I have explained earlier that this is really the eighth consciousness, and that it is the storehouse for the karmic seeds planted by our perceptions, conceptions, and activations. But as I have shown, these perceptions, conceptions, and activations are themselves false and unreal, and thus the seeds that they generate have no real existence. The eighth consciousness, therefore, is really a storehouse of illusions. Nothing within it is real.<br><br>The storehouse itself is none other than True Suchness, Buddha-nature. It is itself Buddhahood.<br><br>Does this mean that we have already attained Buddhahood? If in fact everything is an illusion, can't we assume that we have achieved all that there is to achieve and that we can do whatever we like? Can we not rob and kill with impunity? Are we not already Buddhas? Is this the point of the sutra?<br><br>No, the sutra sets forth a path for us, it does not give us license to do whatever we feel. We must try to free ourselves from illusions, to understand our own minds, and to progress ever higher in the practice. We must be responsible for our actions. We must keep the precepts. We must practice samadhi to attain wisdom, and we must achieve purity of mind. Tathagatagarbha will then be the same as True Suchness. But until we reach the point where our mind is truly undefiled, our Tathagatagarbha will continue to store the karmic seeds of our actions, and we will continue to bear the responsibility for this karma; and we will continue to have perceptions that are rooted in illusion: of happiness, joy, love, hatred, worry, indifference.</span></div>

But ordinary beings move in the wheel of the cyclic existence by the force of their karma keeping the unity of their "santana" -- individual continuality of their psyco-phisical experience.</div>

Both will have this feeling.  The situation you described above is also possible.</div>
