Also when you mention "trying hard to change destiny", what actually you do to achieve this. Ever talk to any master on their guidance?<br>I can introduce you some if you can't find any.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Only dharma, and through dharma, can we change our 'fate' -- but we must not have expectations and put the blame on something else because whatever befalls on us is the fruition of our conditions (i.e karmic conditions). We have to learn to see them as what it is -- conditions -- and experience them with acceptance. Everyone experiences 'bad things' in lives and though you can try your best to change it, it is impossible to avoid <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of them altogether. This is a fact of life -- pain and troubles do happen. But liberation is also in the midst of these life situations, if you know how to grasp the principle of dharma and practice. We have to be able to be 'unmoved by the eight worldly winds' (see next post)<br><br>When bad things happen, we have to learn the lessons with acceptance and walk on. There is no need to rely on fortune telling or mediums. Buddhism teaches us to change our fate through wisdom, not superstitions. For that you have to practice the dharma.<br><br>A summary of a talk given by my dharma teacher some years ago:<br><br><img src="http://img47.imageshack.us/img47/7159/changinglifeiq7.jpg"></div>

Just be good to others and yourself can liao la....</blockquote>Nobody is too ignorant to understand Buddhism.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...One of my favorite stories is about the Arhat Chunda. He was quite stupid. When his brother became a monk, Chunda just wanted to do what his brother did. So he went to Ananda, Buddha's attendant. But holy Ananda said, "Sorry. You're too stupid." Ananda thought this kid was too stupid to become a monk because he couldn't remember the rules, the chants, the teachings. So the elder brother and his stupid little brother went to the Buddha, for the Buddha was extremely wise, kind, and compassionate. He scanned the past lives of this young, stupid boy, Chunda. He saw in there one tiny root of merit that could help him get enlightened. He said it didn't matter how dull-minded he was. It didn't matter that he couldn't memorize anything. It didn't matter if he could remember even one rule. The Buddha said to Ananda, "Ananda, you're not the Buddha, so you couldn't see that this kid can get enlightened. But I'm the Buddha and I'm going to ordain him because he can get enlightened. He has one good root of merit from a past life. He can do it, too. Watch over this little child." (This story always brings tears to my eyes.)<br><br>So Buddha ordained the kid. The kid couldn't remember even one rule, or how to wear his robes. You know, it's complicated to be a monk. All the monks were studying and memorizing. There were a lot of teachings. There were 253 rules of monastic ordination. But the stupid, youthful Chunda couldn't remember anything.<br><br>Finally, the brethren gave him the job of cleaning off the sandals of the monks. Chunda cleaned the sandals while the other monks were getting teachings. Since there weren't any books in those days, 2500 years ago in India, nothing was written down; the monks had to memorize the teachings. Chunda wanted to practice like the other monks, and get this enlightenment thing he heard about every day. So he asked the Buddha how he could get this enlightenment thing. The Buddha said, "When you're scraping mud and sweeping the floors, just think, 'Now I am purifying all the obscurations of the mind.'" So he gave him a little two-line verse. "With each cleaning of the sandals, I am cleaning off the obscurations of the shining, perfect mind." The Buddha asked him to repeat it. He repeated it. The Buddha said, "Can you remember that?" He said, "Yes."<br><br>Then dumb Chunda went out and tried to repeat the verse. "With each scraping of the dirt, I am cleaning..." And he couldn't remember it. But he had good karma and had gentle Ananda around to remind him of the verse. Still, Chunda forgot again. Then Sariputra the learned came out, and Chunda asked him to remind him. Finally, the Buddha came back and said to Chunda, "Are you cleaning the sandals?" He said, "Yes." Buddha asked, "Are you cleaning the dust off the floor?" Chunda said, "Yes." And Buddha asked, "Have you cleaned the obscurations off the shining, perfect mind?" Suddenly Chunda was enlightened! He realized that the sandals with the dirt are still the sandals. The floor even with the dust is still the floor. Everything is just as it is. He became an arhat, a fully liberated sage.<br><br>In those days, wherever the Buddha went, the people would always try to serve lunch, the main meal of the day, to him and the arhats. They thought if they gave Buddha lunch they would get the most merit, and if they gave the arhats lunch they would get almost as much merit. But if they couldn't catch any arhats, they would feed the ordinary monks and get a little less merit. Everyone knew how stupid Chunda was, and they didn't believe he was an enlightened arhat. But wherever Buddha went, he saved a seat for Chunda, because he said he was the purest-minded, least proud arhat. Purest-minded because he didn't know anything. And least proud because he was so simple, so humble, so undemanding and easy to be with.<br><br>Unfortunately, we are not that stupid. We know too much. Or should I say, we think so much, we know so little. If we could just be ourselves, and take the path that is genuinely for us, it would be so easy. Imagine if Chunda was trying to become a Buddhist scholar, he never would have gotten enlightened. But he was content to clean the monks' shoes because he loved his brother and Buddha and the other monks. And it had to be done, so he did it. And he had a little teaching, a little verse that fit into that. That's why Thich Nhat Hanh gives everybody a little verse. He has a little verse for eating, for waking up, for toilet, for going to sleep, because one little verse can be enough to fully awaken you to the fullness and richness of the present moment.<br><br>Spiritual life has nothing to do with how smart you are. In fact, being smart can be an obstacle. You can become proud and have more clutter in your brain.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote> So the elder brother and his stupid little brother went to the Buddha, for the Buddha was extremely wise, kind, and compassionate. He scanned the past lives of this young, stupid boy, Chunda. He saw in there one tiny root of merit that could help him get enlightened. He said it didn't matter how dull-minded he was. It didn't matter that he couldn't memorize anything. It didn't matter if he could remember even one rule. The Buddha said to Ananda, "Ananda, you're not the Buddha, so you couldn't see that this kid can get enlightened. But I'm the Buddha and I'm going to ordain him because he can get enlightened. He has one good root of merit from a past life. He can do it, too. Watch over this little child.</blockquote>I wonder if I should mention this... some time ago I had some minor meditative experience. Thusness asked me do you know why you had such experience... I don't know. He told me it was due to the ripening of my merit of helping a particular person gain right understanding of dharma.. I will leave out the details here.<br><br>Last time Thusness asked me do certain things... I told him why don't you do it (i thought he wld be more appropriate to do tat)... he became serious and 'stern' and told me straight away that I do not have the conditions/merits for enlightenment... then I suddenly realised that all along he has been trying to lead me subtly to plant certain conditions in my mind.<br><br>When conditions ripen, fruition occurs. Clever or not clever doesn't matter... so practice hard.</div>
