              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>(From: "Gems of Buddhist Wisdom", <br>Buddhist Missionary Society, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 1996)</strong></span></p>
              <hr>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Let us discuss a question often asked by many people: What is the difference between Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism? To see things in their proper perspective, let us turn to the history of Buddhism and trace the emergence and development of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The Buddha was born in the 6th Century B.C. After attaining Enlightenment at the age of 35 until his Mahaparinibbana at the age of 80, he spent his life preaching and teaching. He was certainly one of the most energetic man who ever lived: for forty-five years he taught and preached day and night, sleeping for only about 2 hours a day.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The Buddha spoke to all kinds of people: kings and princes, Brahmins, farmers, beggars, learned men and ordinary people. His teachings were tailored to the experiences, levels of understanding and mental capacity of his audience. What he taught was called <em>Buddha</em> <em>Vacana, </em>i.e. word of the Buddha. There was nothing called Theravada or Mahayana at that time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">After establishing the Order of monks and nuns, the Buddha laid down certain disciplinary rules called the <em>Vinaya </em>for the guidance of the Order. The rest of his teachings were called the <em>Dhamma </em>which included his discourses, sermons to monks, nuns and lay people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>The First Council</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Three months after the Buddha's <em>Mahaparinibbana, </em>his immediate disciples convened a council at Rajagaha. Maha Kassapa, the most respected and elderly monk, presided at the Council. Two very important personalities who specialised in the two different areas - the <em>Dhamma </em>and the <em>Vinaya - </em>were present. One was Ananda, the closest constant companion and disciple of the Buddha for 25 years. Endowed with a remarkable memory, Ananda was able to recite what was spoken by the Buddha. The other personality was Upali who remembered all the <em>Vinaya</em>rules.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Only these two sections - the <em>Dhamma </em>and the <em>Vinaya - </em>were recited at the First Council. Though there were no differences of opinion on the <em>Dhamma </em>(no mention of the <em>Abhidhamma) </em>there was some discussion about the<em>Vinaya </em>rules. Before the Buddha's <em>Parinibbana,</em> he had told Ananda that if the <em>Sangha </em>wished to amend or modify some minor rules, they could do so. But on that occasion Ananda was so overpowered with grief because the Buddha was about to die that it did not occur to him to ask the Master what the minor rules were. As the members of the Council were unable to agree as to what constituted the minor rules, Maha Kassapa finally ruled that no disciplinary rule laid down by the Buddha should be changed, and no new ones should be introduced. No intrinsic reason was given. Maha Kassapa did say one thing, however: "If we changed the rules, people will say that Ven. Gotama's disciples changed the rules even before his funeral fire has ceased burning."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">At the Council, the <em>Dhamma </em>was divided into various parts and each part was assigned to an Elder and his pupils to commit to memory. The <em>Dhamma </em>was then passed on from teacher to pupil orally. The <em>Dhamma </em>was recited daily by groups of people who often cross check with each other to ensure that no omissions or additions were made. Historians agree that the oral tradition is more reliable than a report written by one person from his memory several years after the event.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>The Second Council</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">One hundred years later, the Second Council was held to discuss some <em>Vinaya </em>rules. There was no need to change the rules three months after the <em>Parinibbana of</em> the Buddha because little or no political, economic or social changes took place during that short interval. But 100 years later, some monks saw the need to change certain minor rules. The orthodox monks said that nothing should be changed while the others insisted on modifying some rules, Finally, a group of monks left the Council and formed the <em>Mahasanghika - </em>the Great Community. Even though it was called the <em>Mahasanghika,</em> it was not known as Mahayana, And in the Second Council, only matters pertaining to the <em>Vinaya</em>were discussed and no controversy about the <em>Dhamma </em>is reported,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>The Third Council</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">In the 3rd Century B.C. during the time of Emperor Asoka, the Third Council was held to discuss the differences of opinion among the bhikkhus of different sects. At this Council the differences were not confined to the <em>Vinaya </em>but were also connected with the <em>Dhamma. </em>At the end of this Council, the President of the Council, Moggaliputta Tissa, compiled a book called the <em>Kathavatthu </em>refuting the heretical, false views and theories held by some sects. The teaching approved and accepted by this Council was known as <em>Theravada. The</em> <em>Abhidhamma Pitaka </em>was included at this Council.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">After the Third Council, Asoka's son, Ven. Mahinda, brought the <em>Tripitaka </em>to Sri Lanka, along with the commentaries that were recited at the Third Council. The texts brought to Sri Lanka were preserved until today without losing a page. The texts were written in Pali which was based on the Magadhi language spoken by the Buddha. There was nothing known as <em>Mahayana</em> at that time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>Coming of Mahayana</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Between the 1st Century B.C. to the 1st Century A.D., the two terms Mahayana and Hinayana appeared in the<em>Saddharma Pundarika Sutra </em>or the Sutra of the Lotus of the Good Law.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">About the 2nd Century A.D. <em>Mahayana </em>became clearly defined. Nagarjuna developed the <em>Mahayana</em> philosophy of Sunyata and proved that everything is Void in a small text called <em>Madhyamika-karika.</em> About the 4th Century, there were Asanga and Vasubandhu who wrote enormous amount of works on <em>Mahayana. </em>After the 1st Century AD., the Mahayanists took a definite stand and only then the terms of <em>Mahayana</em> and <em>Hinayana </em>were introduced.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">We must not confuse <em>Hinayana</em> with <em>Theravada</em> because the terms are not synonymous. <em>Theravada</em> Buddhism went to Sri Lanka during the 3rd Century B.C. when there was no <em>Mahayana </em>at all. <em>Hinayana </em>sects developed in India and had an existence independent from the form of Buddhism existing in Sri Lanka. Today there is no <em>Hinayana </em>sect in existence anywhere in the world. Therefore, in 1950 the World Fellowship of Buddhists inaugurated in Colombo unanimously decided that the term <em>Hinayana </em>should be dropped when referring to Buddhism existing today in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, etc. This is the brief history of <em>Theravada, Mahayana</em> and <em>Hinayana.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>Mahayana and Theravada</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Now, what is the difference between <em>Mahayana and Theravada?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">I have studied Mahayana for many years and the more I study it, the more I find there is hardly any difference between<em>Theravada and Mahayana with</em> regard to the fundamental teachings.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">- Both accept Sakyamuni Buddha as the Teacher.<br>- The Four Noble Truths are exactly the same in both schools.<br>- The Eightfold Path is exactly the same in both schools.<br><em>-</em> The <em>Paticca-samuppada </em>or the Dependent Origination is the same in both schools.<br>- Both rejected the idea of a supreme being who created and governed this world.<br>- Both accept <em>Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta</em> and <em>Sila,</em> <em>Samadhi, Panna </em>without any difference.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">These are the most important teachings of the Buddha and they are all accepted by both schools without question.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">There are also some points where they differ. An obvious one is the <em>Bodhisattva </em>ideal. Many people say that<em>Mahayana </em>is for the <em>Bodhisattvahood </em>which leads to Buddhahood while <em>Theravada </em>is for Arahantship. I must point out that the Buddha was also an Arahant. Pacceka Buddha is also an Arahant. A disciple can also be an Arahant. The Mahayana texts never use the term Arahant-yana, Arahant Vehicle. They used three terms: <em>Bodhisattvayana, Prateka-Buddhayana, and Sravakayana. </em>In the Theravada tradition these three are called <em>Bodhis.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Some people imagine that Theravada is selfish because it teaches that people should seek their own salvation. But how can a selfish person gain Enlightenment? Both schools accept the three Yanas or <em>Bodhis</em> but consider the<em>Bodhisattva </em>ideal as the highest. The <em>Mahayana </em>has created many mystical <em>Bodhisattvas</em> while the <em>Theravada</em>considers a <em>Bodhisattva </em>as a man amongst us who devotes his entire life for the attainment of perfection, ultimately becoming a fully Enlightened Buddha for the welfare of the world, for the happiness of the world.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong>Three Types of Buddhahood</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">There are three types of Buddhahood: the Samma Sambuddha who gains full Enlightenment by his own effort, the Pacceka Buddha who has lesser qualities than the Samma Sambuddha, and the Savaka Buddha who is an Arahant disciple. The attainment of Nibbana between the three types of Buddhahood is exactly the same. The only difference is that the Samma Sambuddha has many more qualities and capacities than the other two.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Some people think that Voidness or <em>Sunyata</em> discussed by Nagarjuna is purely a <em>Mahayana </em>teaching. It is based on the idea of <em>Anatta </em>or non-self, on the <em>Paticcasamuppada </em>or the Dependent Origination, found in the original Theravada Pali texts. Once Ananda asked the Buddha, "People say the word <em>Sunya. </em>What is <em>Sunya?"</em> The Buddha replied, "Ananda, there is no self, nor anything pertaining to self in this world. Therefore, the world is empty." This idea was taken by Nagarjuna when he wrote his remarkable book, <em>"Madhyamika Karika". </em>Besides the idea of Sunyata is the concept of the store-consciousness in Mahayana Buddhism which has its seed in the Theravada texts. The Mahayanists have developed it into a deep psychology and philosophy.</span></p>
