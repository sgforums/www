              <p>For the meditator who sees things as they really are, explains 
              the late <strong>Mahasi Sayadaw</strong>, there is no “I” or “being”—only mental 
              and physical phenomena coming together in the present moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <hr>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>Seeing the mind (mental phenomena, which incline toward 
              sense-objects) and body (physical phenomena, which change) as they 
              really are is the purification of view.<br><br>—<em>Visuddhimagga</em> 2,
               222</blockquote>
              <p>A meditator will rarely have wandering thoughts once concentration 
              becomes strong. Instead, there will be an uninterrupted flow of pure 
              noting mind most of the time. If a wandering thought does enter the 
              mind, the meditator will be able to note it immediately and the thought 
              will pass away. The meditator sees physical phenomena as they really 
              are: that they are subject to alteration and that they are not able to 
              know or experience anything. They are insensible (<em>abyakata</em>), 
              inanimate, just like a log or stone.</p>
              <p>As the meditator is noting, it becomes obvious that the noting mind 
              resembles running to and sticking with the noted object. Likewise, it 
              becomes obvious that the six types of consciousness—seeing, hearing, 
              smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking—seem to go to their respective
               sense objects. The meditator is seeing and understanding mental 
              phenomena as they really are, seeing their characteristic of inclining, 
              or being drawn toward, sense objects.</p>
              <p>For the meditator who sees things as they really are, it is obvious 
              that the mental and physical phenomena are different. They are not taken
               as one and the same anymore, as they were before the practice of 
              meditation. When the meditator observes the rising movement (of the 
              abdomen when breathing in), he or she can at least discern between the 
              rising movement and the noting mind. Similarly, the meditator can 
              differentiate between the falling movement (of the abdomen when 
              breathing out) and the noting of it; the sitting posture and the noting 
              of it; the intention to bend, the bending movement, and the noting of 
              it; the intention to stretch, the stretching movement, and the noting of
               it; the visible form, the eye, the seeing, and the noting of it.</p>
              <p>Before a drum is beaten, its sound does not exist in the drum itself,
               the drumstick, or anywhere in between. Even though a sound occurs when 
              the drum is beat, the sound does not originate from the drum or the 
              drumstick. The physical phenomena of drum and drumstick are not 
              transformed into a sound nor does the sound originate from anywhere in 
              between drum and drumstick. In dependence on the drum, the drumstick, 
              and the hitting of the drum, the sound is a completely new phenomenon 
              each time the drum is hit. The drum and the stick are different from the
               sound.</p>
              <p>In the same way, before you see something or someone, seeing does not
               exist in the eye, in the visible form, or anywhere in between. The 
              seeing that takes place neither originates in the eye nor in the visible
               form. The seeing consciousness neither originates in the eye nor in the
               visible forms, which are physical phenomena. It also does not originate
               from anywhere in between. Seeing is actually a new phenomenon that 
              arises due to the combination of the eye, the visible form, light, and 
              your attention. Thus, the eye and the visible form are different from 
              the seeing. The same is true for the other senses.</p>
              <p>When you understand the difference between mental and physical 
              phenomena, you are likely to reflect that neither the mind nor the body 
              alone can perform actions such as sitting, standing, walking, bending, 
              stretching, seeing, hearing, and so on. Only the mind and body together 
              can perform these activities.</p>
              <p>Because of this, the mind and body together are mistaken for “I.” One
               thinks, “I am sitting; I am standing up; I am going; I am bending; I am
               stretching; I am seeing; I am hearing,” and so on. In reality, there is
               no “I” or “being” that sits, stands up, and walks, but only mental and 
              physical phenomena. That is why the <em>Visuddhimagga</em> (2, 231) says:</p>
              <blockquote>In reality, mind conditions matter, and matter conditions 
              mind. When the mind wants to eat, drink, speak, or change posture, it is
               the body that actually eats, drinks, speaks, or changes posture.</blockquote>
              <p>When we expand on this, we can say:</p>
              <blockquote>The volition to eat is mental, but what actually eats is the
               body.
              <p>The volition to drink is mental, but what actually drinks is the 
              body.</p>
              <p>The volition to speak is mental, but what actually speaks is the 
              body.</p>
              <p>The volition to sit down is mental, but what actually sits down is 
              the body.</p>
              <p>The volition to stand up is mental, but what actually stands up is 
              the body.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Some meditators may use similes to describe their experience of 
              mental and physical phenomena. The <em>Visuddhimagga</em> (2, 228) gives 
              these similes:</p>
              <blockquote>A coach is so called because of the way that its components 
              are assembled: the axles, wheels, body, and shafts. However, if you 
              examine each component separately, there is no coach to be found. A 
              house is so called when its materials, posts, beams, etc., are fit 
              together. Other than these materials, however, there is no house that 
              can be found. A tree is so called because it includes a trunk, branches,
               and leaves, and so on. But apart from these parts, no tree can be 
              found. <br> <br>In the same way, a being is so called because he or she is composed 
              of the five aggregates of clinging, i.e. mental and physical phenomena. 
              However, if you pay attention to each of these phenomena separately, you
               will no longer have the conceit that, “I am so and so,” or the wrong 
              belief that, “I am a person.” You realize that, in terms of ultimate 
              reality, there is no being that exists. All that exists is the mind, 
              which is able to incline to the object and know the object, and matter, 
              which is not able to know the object and is subject to alteration. This 
              realization is called “seeing things as they really are.”</blockquote>
              <p>Being able to come up with a good simile, however, doesn’t matter. 
              Without thinking deliberately, while you are simply noting, you are able
               to discern between mental and physical phenomena, and you understand 
              that in this body there are only mental phenomena that are <em>able to 
              know objects</em> and physical phenomena that are <em>not able to know 
              objects</em>. Besides these two phenomena, there is no being, I, soul, or
               self. This understanding comes naturally and is the peak of the insight
               knowledge of mental and physical phenomena. This insight knowledge in 
              turn is called “the purification of view,” as it helps to remove the 
              deluded view that a being really exists (<em>atta-ditthi</em>). That is 
              why the <em>MahÄ�tÄ«kÄ�</em> [the commentary to the <em>Visuddhimagga</em>] 
              says:</p>
              <blockquote>The phrase “seeing mind and matter as they really are” means
               seeing them as just phenomena and not a being by observing their 
              individual characteristics, thus: “This is mind; this much is mind; 
              there is nothing more than this (i.e., no being). This is matter; this 
              much is matter; there is nothing more than this (i.e., no being).” This 
              is purification of view, as it eliminates the deluded view that a being 
              really exists. Thus should it be understood.</blockquote>
              <p>The individual characteristics of physical phenomena (such as 
              alteration or roughness and hardness) and individual characteristics of 
              mental phenomena (such as inclining toward the object, mental contact 
              with the object, feeling, perceiving, or knowing of an object) only 
              really exist in the moment they occur—not before or after. That is why 
              you can only be truly aware of the specific characteristics of mental 
              and physical phenomena when you observe them from moment to moment. In 
              this way, you understand that there is no “I” or being, but only mental 
              and physical phenomena. This understanding is called the purification of
               view. It means that this understanding can eliminate the wrong view of a
               person or being.</p>
              <p>When the characteristics of mind and matter have been understood as 
              they truly are by noting the presently arising objects, the meditator 
              comes to see the causes of those phenomena. With this, the insight 
              knowledge of conditionality will arise: the realization that certain 
              causes give rise to certain phenomena, whether in the past, present, or 
              future. This insight knowledge can take various forms, depending on a 
              person’s aspiration, spiritual maturity, and intellectual ability. The <em>Visuddhimagga </em>identifies five forms, which are explained in the sections below.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The First Way of Seeing Conditionality</h2>
              <h3>Seeing the Causes of Matter</h3>
              <p>Some meditators see the causes of matter. They see that physical 
              phenomena have been continuously occurring, from birth up to the present
               moment, due to the four causes of ignorance, desire, clinging, and 
              volitional actions in the past. They also see that the nutrition they 
              receive in the present preserves the body, and that the desire to sit, 
              bend, and so forth results in the physical actions of sitting, bending, 
              etc. As well, they see that hot and cold environments give rise to hot 
              and cold physical sensations.</p>
              <p>A meditator can empirically observe the present causes for physical 
              phenomena, such as nutrition, consciousness, and weather. But one cannot
               directly observe the causes from the past, such as ignorance, desire, 
              clinging, and volitional actions. However, even before beginning 
              meditation practice, a vipassana meditator has already accepted 
              intellectually that wholesome actions lead to a good life and beneficial
               results, whereas unwholesome actions lead to a bad life and 
              unbeneficial results. Therefore, when one practices and empirically 
              observes ignorance, craving, clinging, and volitional actions in the 
              present<em>, </em>one will inferentially realize that they were also 
              operating in the past.</p>
              <p>The mental and physical phenomena that make up our lives are all 
              unsatisfying. Attachment to them is the cause of suffering. Not knowing 
              this truth is called “ignorance of suffering and its cause.” Believing 
              that the phenomena of life are actually satisfying and the cause of 
              happiness is called the “delusion of pleasure and its cause.” These two 
              kinds of delusion are deeply rooted in the hearts of ordinary people. 
              They devote themselves day and night to enjoying as much pleasure as 
              possible. Day and night, they do everything they can to get the most out
               of their present life and to enjoy better lives in the future. These 
              delusions, therefore, cannot be overcome simply through study.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the cessation of the defilements and volitional 
              actions as the causes of suffering leads to the complete cessation of 
              all mental and physical phenomena at the time of entering parinibbana. 
              One is no longer reborn as a human or deva, man or woman. This is called
               the truth of cessation.</p>
              <p>Ignorance of the peace and happiness of nibbana, as well as ignorance
               of insight practice and the path (the causes of happiness and peace), 
              can be called “ignorance of suffering and its cause.” Believing that 
              nibbana must be awful and that insight practice and the path are causes 
              of suffering can be called the “delusion of pleasure and its cause.” In 
              other words, these are distorted and wrong understandings of the truths 
              about the cessation of suffering and the way leading to its cessation.</p>
              <p>If these two kinds of ignorance are very strong, one may actually 
              fear nibbana, thinking that after parinibbana nothing will arise, 
              nothing can be known or experienced, and one cannot meet others anymore.<em> </em>One may even make disparaging comments about liberation, saying, 
              “Nibbana is complete annihilation. It can’t possibly be good. Practicing
               to attain it is simply going to a lot of trouble, mentally and 
              physically, to attain annihilation!” For ordinary people, this active 
              form of ignorance and wrong understanding of the four noble truths 
              occurs only at certain times. However, it occurs in its dormant form 
              along with every object that is not noted. Therefore, if ignorance is 
              noted at the time of its occurrence, it can be empirically seen by the 
              meditator.</p>
              <p>In addition, if these mental and physical phenomena are mistakenly 
              believed to be satisfying, liking and attachment arises. As a result, 
              the desire to become more prosperous arises. This is clinging. Because 
              of clinging, various activities—volitional actions—are performed.</p>
              <p>Craving, clinging, and volitional actions can be seen by noting them 
              as they are occurring and by recollecting them from the past. When the 
              meditator sees in practice how volitional actions have their origins in 
              ignorance, craving, and clinging, he or she realizes that because of 
              volitional actions in the past there is continuous arising of physical 
              phenomena in this life starting at the moment of rebirth-linking (the 
              consciousness that gives rise to rebirth after death based on karmic 
              accumulation). At the same time, the meditator understands that these 
              physical phenomena also arise because of ignorance, craving, and 
              clinging. We call this “realizing the causes of physical phenomena 
              empirically and inferentially.”</p>
              <h3>Seeing the Causes of Mind</h3>
              <p>When seeing is noted, the meditator understands and comprehends that 
              seeing occurs when there is the eye and a visible form. Or the meditator
               understands and comprehends that with the meeting of the eye, the 
              visible form, and the seeing, there is contact between the object and 
              the mind. The same is true for all the senses. Furthermore, when a 
              meditator notes “seeing,” or “hearing,” or “touching,” or “thinking,” 
              etc., he or she can see that contact with the object arouses pleasure or
               displeasure in the body or mind.</p>
              <p>Pleasure is enjoyed and therefore the desire for continuous enjoyment
               arises. The meditator wants to get rid of the displeasure and wants 
              pleasure instead. The clinging to pleasure causes actions of body, 
              speech, and thoughts with the aim of gaining enjoyment. In this way, the
               meditator empirically sees the causes of the mind in an adequate 
              manner.</p>
              <h3>Inferential Knowledge Regarding the Past and Future</h3>
              <p>Once a meditator has empirically seen the causes of mental and 
              physical phenomena in the present life, he or she concludes with 
              inferential knowledge that they must be the same in the past and future:
               “In the past, there were only these mental and physical phenomena which
               occurred due to certain causes. In the future, there will only be these
               mental and physical phenomena which will occur due to certain causes.”</p>
              <h3>Overcoming the Sixteen Kinds of Skeptical Doubts</h3>
              <p>A meditator who understands and comprehends that in the past, future,
               and present, there are only mental and physical phenomena that give 
              rise to other mental and physical phenomena can abandon and overcome the
               belief in a self and the related sixteen kinds of doubts, which are as 
              follows:</p>
              <p>Five doubts about one’s existence in the past:</p>
              <p>1. Did I exist in previous lives? (the notion that the “I” has 
              existed forever)</p>
              <p>2. Did I not exist in previous lives? (the notion that the “I” only 
              exists in this present life)</p>
              <p>3. What was I in previous lives? (rich or poor, lay, ordained, 
              Myanmar, Indian, <em>brahma</em>, <em>deva</em>, human or animal, etc.)</p>
              <p>4. What did I look like in previous lives (tall, short, fat, thin, 
              fair, dark, etc.), and who or what created me in previous lives (God, 
              Brahma, or another celestial being or did I spontaneously come into 
              existence)?</p>
              <p>5. What type of person was I in previous lives?</p>
              <p>Five doubts about one’s existence in the future:</p>
              <p>6. Will I have another life after death? (the notion that the “I” is 
              indestructible and eternal)</p>
              <p>7. Will I not have another life after death? (the notion that the “I”
               will disappear after death)</p>
              <p>8. What will I be in my next life?</p>
              <p>9. What will I look like in my next life, and who or what will create
               my next life?</p>
              <p>10. What type of person will I be in my next life?</p>
              <p>Six doubts about one’s existence in the present:</p>
              <p>11. Is there an “I” (being, self, soul, spirit) in this body?</p>
              <p>12. Is there not an “I” in this body?</p>
              <p>13. What is this “I”? (rich or poor, lay, ordained, Myanmar, Indian, <em>brahma,
               deva</em>, human, or animal, etc.)</p>
              <p>14. What does this “I” look like?</p>
              <p>15. From where or what previous life did this “I” transmigrate?</p>
              <p>16. To where or what future life will this “I” transmigrate?</p>
              <p>These sixteen kinds of doubt only arise in those who believe in the 
              existence of a “self.” They do not arise in those who understand that 
              there is only a succession of mental and physical phenomena based on 
              cause and effect—devoid of a “self” or an “I.”</p>
              <p>One can only have doubts about whether or not a rabbit has horns if 
              one does not really know what a rabbit looks like. If one has actually 
              seen a rabbit, however, it would not be possible to entertain this 
              doubt.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Second Way of Seeing Conditionality</h2>
              <p>Some meditators experience the conditionality of mental and physical 
              phenomena arising as follows:</p>
              <blockquote>I see due to the eye and visible forms. I hear due to the 
              ear and sounds. I smell due to the nose and odors. I taste sweet, sour, 
              and so forth, due to the tongue and flavors. I know touching sensations 
              due to the body and tangible objects. I think, reflect, and note objects
               due to the heart-base and various mental objects. Due to wise 
              attention, living in a suitable place, associating with virtuous people,
               listening to the dhamma expounded by the wise, and having mature <em>paramis </em>(virtues or perfections), there arises wholesomeness and the 
              ability to practice insight meditation. Due to unwise attention, living 
              in an unsuitable place, associating with evil people, listening to the 
              words of immoral people, and having poorly developed <em>paramis</em>, 
              there arises unwholesomeness.
              <p>Wholesome volitional actions based on delusion, craving, and clinging
               result in a fortunate rebirth, in good and pleasant objects at all six 
              sense doors, and in many beneficial results. Unwholesome volitional 
              actions based on delusion, craving, and clinging result in an 
              unfortunate rebirth, in bad and unpleasant objects at all six sense 
              doors, and in many unbeneficial results.</p>
              <p>The physical phenomena that make up the heart-base, eye, ear, and so 
              on, have been arising continuously since the first moment of this life 
              due to past volitional actions.</p>
              <p>The physical activities of sitting, walking, bending, and so on are 
              caused by the intention or desire to do so.</p>
              <p>The temperature of the external environment causes physical 
              sensations of heat or cold. The nutrition in the food one eats gives 
              energy to the body…</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Meditators who understand and comprehend that in the present, there 
              are only mental and physical phenomena that give rise to other mental 
              and physical phenomena, inferentially understand that the same is true 
              for the past and the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Third and Fourth Ways of Seeing Conditionality</h2>
              <p>Some meditators see the arising, presence, and disappearance of 
              conditioned phenomena while observing presently arising objects. From 
              this, they understand that the first arising of the mind in this life is
               just another moment of arising of the mind. They also understand that 
              death is just another moment of disappearance of the mind. They 
              understand that aging is the successive presence of mental and physical 
              phenomena. Therefore, the causes for mental and physical phenomena are 
              understood. It can be understood in this way:</p>
              <blockquote>For aging and death, first there must be <em>arising</em> or <em>rebirth</em>.<br> <br><em>Arising</em> or <em>rebirth</em> in turn is generated by volitional 
              actions. <br> <br><em>Volitional actions</em> are generated by clinging.<br> <br><em>Clinging</em> is caused by attachment to mental and physical 
              phenomena.<br> <br><em>Attachment</em> results from pleasant and unpleasant sensations.<br> <br><em>Sensations</em> are brought about by contact between the mind and 
              sense-objects<br> <br><em>Contact </em>originates from the sense-bases, the sensitive matter
               of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind (i.e., because of the 
              eye-sensitivity and the mind, seeing occurs, and so on).<br> <br>The <em>sense-bases </em>come into existence due to the mental and 
              physical phenomena on which they depend (i.e., the sensitive matter of 
              eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body are based on the physical organs, and 
              the mind is based on its physical base and the other mental elements).<br> <br><em>Mental and physical phenomena</em> are generated by various types 
              of consciousness, such as rebirth-linking consciousness, the 
              life-continuum and sense-consciousness.<br> <br><em>Consciousness</em> has its origin in volitional deeds that one has
               performed in past lives for one’s well-being.<br> <br><em>Volitional actions</em> arise from ignorance and delusion. </blockquote>
              <p>Noble beings, such as bodhisattas, fully realize conditionality in 
              this way, by seeing dependent origination (<em>paticcasamuppÄ�da</em>) in 
              reverse order. Ordinary meditators are also able to realize 
              conditionality this way and overcome the sixteen kinds of doubt. This is
               the third way of seeing the conditionality of mental and physical 
              phenomena.</p>
              <p>Other meditators realize conditionality by seeing dependent 
              origination in forward order. That is, they realize that ignorance and 
              delusion generate volitional actions, and that volitional actions 
              generate consciousness, and so on. Noble beings, such as bodhisattas, 
              fully realize conditionality in this way. Ordinary meditators are also 
              able to realize conditionality this way and overcome the sixteen kinds 
              of doubt. This is the fourth way of seeing the conditionality of mental 
              and physical phenomena.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h2>The Fifth Way of Seeing Conditionality</h2>
              <p>Some meditators see the conditionality of mental and physical 
              phenomena in terms of the relationship between volitional acts and their
               results. This relationship between volitional action and its results is
               divided into the cycle of volitional actions (<em>kamma-vatta</em>) and 
              the cycle of results (<em>vipÄ�ka-vatta</em>). The cycle of volitional 
              actions includes ignorance and delusion, volitional action, attachment, 
              clinging, and existence based on volitional actions <em>(kamma-bhava)</em>.
               The cycle of results<em> </em>includes consciousness, mental and physical
               phenomena, the sense-bases, mental contact, and feeling.</p>
              <p>If a meditator considered conditionality in detail, he or she would 
              see each of the five causal factors and the five resultant factors. If a
               meditator considered it in general, he or she would not differentiate 
              each individual cause and result. Instead, he or she would simply see 
              volitional action as the cycle of volitional acts, and would see the 
              kammic results of volitional actions as the cycle of results.</p>
              <p>In the following sections, I explain how the <em>PatisambhidÄ�magga, </em>in
               the Pali Canon, explains the cycle of volitional actions and the cycle 
              of results.</p>
              <h3>Causal Factors from Previous Lives</h3>
              <p>The volition generated as one plans to perform a wholesome or 
              unwholesome action is <em>sankhÄ�ra</em>. It is the volition that compels 
              one to perform that action right away. However, the volition that is 
              generated while actually performing the wholesome or unwholesome action 
              is <em>kamma-bhava</em>.</p>
              <p>Here’s an example of <em>kamma-bhava</em>: while giving something to 
              someone, you let go of the thing and hand it over to the recipient so 
              that he or she can do with it as he or she pleases. In the case of 
              killing, you do that act so that the other being dies. In this way, the 
              action is completed. It is just the same with other wholesome or 
              unwholesome deeds.</p>
              <p>There are five causal factors that occur as follows:</p>
              <blockquote><em>Ignorance </em>and<em> delusion</em>lead to craving<br> <br><em>Craving</em> leads to clinging<br> <br><em>Clinging </em>leads to volition involved in preparing to act<br> <br><em>Preparing to act</em> leads to volition involved in carrying out 
              the act<br> <br>After <em>carrying out the act </em>one mistakenly thinks that the act
               is a cause for happiness and that the result to be experienced will be 
              happiness </blockquote>
              <p>With this, ignorance is generated again, followed by craving, 
              clinging, and so on. In this way, volitional actions, supported by 
              ignorance<em> </em>and craving, can lead to rebirth.</p>
              <h3>Resultant Factors in the Present Life</h3>
              <p>When a meditator is noting mental and physical phenomena from moment 
              to moment, it is obvious that successive moments of consciousness 
              (seeing, hearing, etc.) are part of an ongoing mental process. In the 
              same way, the moment of rebirth-linking consciousness of this present 
              life can be understood as the successor to the last moment of 
              consciousness (i.e., death) of the previous life.</p>
              <p>If a meditator notes phenomena continuously from moment to moment, he
               or she will see new phenomena coming into existence. He or she can then
               realize inferentially that the phenomena at the moment of rebirth arose
               in the same manner. The same is true for the six senses, contact, and 
              feeling. These resultant phenomena eventually give rise to the five 
              causal phenomena when the six sense-bases mature.</p>
              <h3>Causal Factors in the Present Life and Resultant Factors in Future 
              Lives</h3>
              <blockquote>When the sense bases become mature in this present life, the
               five causal factors are generated: ignorance or delusion, wholesome or 
              unwholesome volition, craving, clinging, and volitional action that 
              result in new life. These five factors are generated when performing 
              volitional acts in the present life and are the causes of future 
              rebirth. <br> <br>—<em>PatisambhidÄ�magga</em>, 30</blockquote>
              <p>These present causal factors lead to the arising of the five 
              resultant factors in the future:</p>
              <blockquote>In the future, there will be rebirth-linking consciousness, 
              mental and physical phenomena, the six sense-bases, contact between the 
              mind and sense-object, and feeling or sensation. These five resultant 
              factors will arise in future existences caused by volitional acts 
              performed in this life.<br> <br>—<em>PatisambhidÄ�magga</em>, 51</blockquote>
              <h3>Inferential Knowledge</h3>
              <p>The five causal factors that were generated in past lives are the 
              same as those generated in the present life. Also, the five resultant 
              factors that will be generated in future lives will be the same as those
               generated in the present life. Therefore, if one empirically perceives 
              the causal and resultant factors in the present life, one will also 
              inferentially realize the causes generated in past lives and the results
               that will be generated in future lives.</p>
              <p>These five resultant factors are all contained within <em>one moment 
              of consciousness</em>. Therefore, if one is aware of these resultant 
              factors in a general way, one will see all of them together as a whole. 
              For example, when one notes a pleasant or unpleasant object, one is 
              aware that the sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, or thought simply 
              arises of its own accord as the result of past volitional action. One is
               not aware of each resultant factor separately, noticing, “This is 
              consciousness; these are the mental and physical phenomena,” and so on.</p>
              <p>Instead, one experiences all five of the causal factors together 
              during a single moment of noting, seeing that they are the past causes. 
              One then realizes that all volitional activities performed for the sake 
              of one’s well-being, whether physical, verbal, or mental, whether in 
              this life or the next, constitute volitional action that will lead to 
              rebirth. However, one doesn’t see the resultant factors separately as, 
              “This is ignorance; this is volitional action,<em>” </em>and so on.</p>
              <p>Because the meditator finds only the causal and resultant factors at 
              the time of noting, he or she concludes, “In past lives too, there was 
              only volitional action and its result. In future lives too, there will 
              only be volitional action and its results. There is only volitional 
              action and its results, and no individual or personality who produces 
              volitional action or enjoys or suffers its results.”</p>
