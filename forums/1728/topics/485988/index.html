              <p>The Advantages of the Mindfulness of Breathing Meditation<br> From the Diipa Sutta (the Discourse on the Lamp), SN 54.8</p>
              <p>"…  I too, monks, before my awakening, when I was an unawakened 
              bodhisatta, frequently remained with this abiding. When I frequently 
              remained with this abiding, neither my body was fatigued nor were my 
              eyes, and my mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released 
              from fermentations.</p>
              <p>"So if a monk should wish: 'May neither my 
              body be fatigued nor my eyes, and may my mind, through lack of 
              clinging/sustenance, be released from fermentations,' then he should 
              attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of 
              in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May my memories 
              &amp; resolves related to the household life be abandoned,' then he 
              should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness 
              of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I remain 
              percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what is not loathsome,' 
              then he should attend carefully to this same concentration through 
              mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 
              'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in the presence of what is 
              loathsome,' then he should attend carefully to this same concentration 
              through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should
               wish: 'May I remain percipient of loathsomeness in the presence of what
               is not loathsome &amp; what is,' then he should attend carefully to 
              this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I remain percipient of unloathsomeness in
               the presence of what is loathsome &amp; what is not,' then he should 
              attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of 
              in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I — in the 
              presence of what is loathsome &amp; what is not — cutting myself off 
              from both — remain equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert,' then he should 
              attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of 
              in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I — quite 
              secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — enter 
              &amp; remain in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from 
              seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation,' then he 
              should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness 
              of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with 
              the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enter &amp; remain 
              in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, 
              unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — 
              internal assurance,' then he should attend carefully to this same 
              concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a
               monk should wish, 'May I, with the fading of rapture, remain 
              equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, sense pleasure with the body, and 
              enter &amp; remain in the third jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 
              "Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding,"' then he should 
              attend closely to this very same concentration through mindfulness of 
              in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish, 'May I, with the 
              abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of
               elation &amp; distress — enter &amp; remain in the fourth jhana: purity
               of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain,' then he 
              should attend closely to this very same concentration through 
              mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 
              'May I, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) 
              form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not 
              heeding perceptions of diversity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' enter 
              &amp; remain in the dimension of the infinitude of space,' then he 
              should attend carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness 
              of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with 
              the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, 
              (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' enter &amp; remain in the 
              dimension of the infinitude of consciousness,' then he should attend 
              carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out
               breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete 
              transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, 
              (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' enter &amp; remain in the dimension of
               nothingness,' then he should attend carefully to this same 
              concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a
               monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the 
              dimension of nothingness, enter &amp; remain in the dimension of neither
               perception nor non-perception,' then he should attend carefully to this
               same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing.</p>
              <p>"If a monk should wish: 'May I, with the complete transcending of the 
              dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enter &amp; remain 
              in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling,' then he should attend 
              carefully to this same concentration through mindfulness of in-&amp;-out
               breathing.</p>
              <p>"When concentration through mindfulness of 
              in-&amp;-out breathing is thus developed, thus pursued, then if he 
              senses a feeling of pleasure, he discerns that it is inconstant, not 
              grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of pain, he discerns 
              that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a 
              feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he discerns that it is inconstant,
               not grasped at, not relished. If he senses a feeling of pleasure, he 
              senses it disjoined from it. If he senses a feeling of pain, he senses 
              it disjoined from it. If he senses a feeling of 
              neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he senses it disjoined from it. When sensing a
               feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling 
              limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling limited to life, he 
              discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.' He discerns that
               'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, 
              everything that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right
               here.'</p>
              <p>"Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil &amp; 
              wick; and from the termination of the oil &amp; wick — and from not 
              being provided any other sustenance — it goes out unnourished; in the 
              same way, when sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 
              'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.' When sensing a feeling 
              limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to 
              life.' He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the 
              termination of life, everything that is sensed, not being relished, will
               grow cold right here.'"</p>
