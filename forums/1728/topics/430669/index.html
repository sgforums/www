              <p><span style="font-size: small;">A poster I've been communicating from <a href="http://www.ruthlesstruth.com/">RuthlessTruth</a> woke up and shared his account with me.</span></p>

                   have experienced the intensity of luminosity. I like  the word 
                  luminosity for it. It's like the pristineness, the silent, still, and  
                  radiant aliveness of the universe, the !-ness of reality. It almost 
                  shimmers  with the awesomeness of aliveness. I can sense where this 
                  differs from the  undivided unity of Being experience which is still a 
                  thought-form. It still  holds onto a concept of a higher power, or a 
                  God. And as the world begins to  synchronize with my intentions and 
                  purposes, I attribute this to the higher  power, and communicate with 
                  it. But this is different. It's like the unity of  Being as a thought 
                  form brought into the foreground as pure sensation. There's a  
                  recognition that "this is what I am," as I walk around the house and see
                   the  couch, the faucet, the kitchen counter. There's a feeling of total
                   oneness. Not  so much "there is this One and I am experiencing it, I 
                  understand it." There's  an unmistakable recognition that I am the 
                  Universe, and I'm not experiencing  myself from any particular vantage 
                  point. I just Am the whole thing, and  anything I look at, there I am. I
                   am the metal. I am the cold. I am the  blueness. I am the night and 
                  day. There doesn't seem to be an inquiry  appropriate to deepening the 
                  luminosity. It's just a noticing and cultivating  that noticing.</span></span></p>

                   been all the way through to the end of this  journey a couple times. It
                   lasted almost a month once when I was off working at  a retreat center.
                   I think I started malfunctioning in certain obvious ways that  I 
                  ignored about a week into it. I had seen and was experiencing the truth,
                   but I  hadn't picked up on enough of the implications and found an 
                  integrity to it yet.  I was just celebrating the absence of time, 
                  meaning, etc. I watched X-files, got  drunk, and ate bacon every night. 
                  Very strange way for an "enlightened" person  to act. So yeah, the 
                  vision of truth was there, but I was out of harmony with  it. Then I 
                  crashed really hard and had to pick a bunch of pieces up. Then  another 
                  one lasted only a few hours but was so fucking intense and thorough. I  
                  knew what Nisargadatta and Ramana were saying. I WAS Nisargadatta and 
                  Ramana.  And I crashed again, and had a new set of stuff to clean up. 
                  And then I joined  Ruthless Truth and they pushed me over into a new 
                  sort of experience, which also  came with a crash, but my time here 
                  really came to fruition when Ciaran told me  to focus on What K <em>(name omitted)</em> actually is. The "unique and intimate stunning reality of  who you are 
                  (as a real fiction)." Then all that stuff I was cleaning up from  before
                   started cleaning up much faster. I came to appreciate my existence as  K </span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><em><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande','Trebuchet MS',Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">(name omitted)</span></em></span><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande','Trebuchet MS',Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span>.
                   I saw how utterly complex I am, within the context of this utter  
                  simplicity of only now-ness. And then this insight a couple weeks ago 
                  spread to  other people as well. I have a better sense for the 
                  importance of identity and  how it's essentially the best way the 
                  universe has come up with so far (on this  planet) to recognize itself, 
                  and FUCK that's amazing. So a lot of my resistance  to "unconsciousness"
                   fell away. I just see it as part of the unfolding of  consciousness. My
                   resistance to rigidity and ignorance in others had diminished  
                  significantly and so my own peace with the universe  increased.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: 'Lucida Grande','Trebuchet MS',Verdana,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span>Anyway,
                   that's a lot of story telling. What's up with  that luminosity? I 
                  appreciate you guiding me in the right direction. I can feel  that this 
                  is the correct way to be going as there's a deeper sense of peace and  
                  less fabrication happening. I keep "disappearing" throughout the day. I 
                  cease to  exist within the universe. This is pleasant. It's not that I'm
                   uninvolved in the  drama. It's that I'm not even here to experience it.
                   And the body, which looks  so impersonal, just goes about its day doing
                   shit, even feeling insecure for  hours at a time, and in reflection, it
                   doesnt' seem like I was there for any of  it, experiencing or 
                  collecting these experiences in some central place called  "me."</span></span></p>

              <p>Just want to add that there are over 100+ people enlightened in RuthlessTruth over just a period of half a year and it is pretty impressive. But not everyone is enlightened to anatta (a considerably large number are though, including the guy I pasted here...)</p>
              <p>Which means the direct inquiry into anatta they used there has been pretty efficient. It also happens to be rather similar to Thusness's direct inquiry into anatta.</p>
