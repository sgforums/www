Taoism, as taught today, is also caught up in magic and alchemy. There are little of the real teachings of either Lao or Chuang in it.

            <div class='col-md body'>From Chit Chat forum, year 2002 (the oldest and first Taoist thread in sgforums) - and also the best introduction to Lao Tzu I found in sgforums.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=13568" rel="nofollow">Lao Tzu: Father of Taoism</a><br><br><strong>Lao Tzu - founder of Taoism</strong><br><br>Although ascetics and hermits such as Shen Tao (who advocated that one 'abandon knowledge and discard self') first wrote of the 'Tao' it is with the sixth century B.C. philosopher Lao Tzu (or 'Old Sage' -- born Li Erh) that the philosophy of Taoism really began. Some scholars believe was a slightly older contemporary of Confucius (Kung-Fu Tzu, born Chiu Chung-Ni). Other scholars feel that the Tao Te Ching, is really a compilation of paradoxical poems written by several Taoists using the pen-name, Lao Tzu. There is also a close association between Lao Tzu and the legendary Yellow Emperor, Huang-ti.<br><br>According to legend Lao Tzu was keeper of the archives at the imperial court. When he was eighty years old he set out for the western border of China, toward what is now Tibet, saddened and disillusioned that men were unwilling to follow the path to natural goodness. At the border (Hank Pass), a guard, Yin Xi (Yin Hsi), asked Lao Tsu to record his teachings before he left. He then composed in 5,000 characters the Tao Te Ching (The Way and Its Power).<br><br>Confucius.<br><br>Whatever the truth, Taoism and Confucianism have to be seen side-by-side as two distinct responses to the social, political and philosophical conditions of life two and a half millennia ago in China. Whereas Confucianism is greatly concerned with social relations, conduct and human society, Taoism has a much more individualistic and mystical character, greatly influenced by nature.<br><br>In Lao Tzu's view things were said to create "unnatural" action (wei) by shaping desires (yu). The process of learning the names (ming) used in the doctrines helped one to make distinctions between good and evil, beautiful and ugly, high and low, and "being" (yu) and "non- being" (wu), thereby shaping desires. To abandon knowledge was to abandon names, distinctions, tastes and desires. Thus spontaneous behavior (wu-wei) resulted.<br><br>The Taoist philosophy can perhaps best be summed up in a quote from Chuang Tzu:<br><br>"To regard the fundamental as the essence, to regard things as coarse, to regard accumulation as deficiency, and to dwell quietly alone with the spiritual and the intelligent -- herein lie the techniques of Tao of the ancients."<br>One element of Taoism is a kind of existential skepticism, something which can already be seen in the philosophy of Yang Chu (4th century B.C.) who wrote:<br><br>"What is man's life for? What pleasure is there in it? Is it for beauty and riches? Is it for sound and colour? But there comes a time when beauty and riches no longer answer the needs of the heart, and when a surfeit of sound and colour becomes a weariness to the eyes and a ringing in the ears.<br>"The men of old knew that life comes without warning, and as suddenly goes. They denied none of their natural inclinations, and repressed none of their bodily desires. They never felt the spur of fame. They sauntered through life gathering its pleasures as the impulse moved them. Since they cared nothing for fame after death, they were beyond the law. For name and praise, sooner or later, a long life or short one, they cared not at all."<br><br>Contemplating the remarkable natural world Lao Tzu felt that it was man and his activities which constituted a blight on the otherwise perfect order of things. Thus he counseled people to turn away from the folly of human pursuits and to return to one's natural wellspring.<br><br>The five colours blind the eye.<br>The five tones deafen the ear.<br>The five flavours dull the taste.<br>Racing and hunting madden the mind.<br>Precious things lead one astray.<br>Therefore the sage is guided by what he feels and not by what he sees.<br>He lets go of that and chooses this.<br><br>The central vehicle of achieving tranquillity was the Tao, a term which has been translated as 'the way' or 'the path.' Te in this context refers to virtue and Ching refers to laws. Thus the Tao Te Ching could be translated as The Law (or Canon) of Virtue and it's Way. The Tao was the central mystical term of the Lao Tzu and the Taoists, a formless, unfathomable source of all things.<br><br>Look, it cannot be seen - it is beyond form.<br>Listen, it cannot be heard - it is beyond sound.<br>Grasp, it cannot be held - it is intangible.<br>These three are indefinable, they are one.<br>From above it is not bright;<br>From below it is not dark:<br>Unbroken thread beyond description.<br>It returns to nothingness.<br>Form of the formless,<br>Image of the imageless,<br>It is called indefinable and beyond imagination.<br><br>Stand before it - there is no beginning.<br>Follow it and there is no end.<br>Stay with the Tao, Move with the present.<br><br>Knowing the ancient beginning is the essence of Tao.<br><br>Lao Tzu has Yin Xi appear to the Barbarian as the Buddha.<br><br>Lao Tsu taught that all straining, all striving are not only vain but counterproductive. One should endeavor to do nothing (wu-wei). But what does this mean? It means not to literally do nothing, but to discern and follow the natural forces -- to follow and shape the flow of events and not to pit oneself against the natural order of things. First and foremost to be spontaneous in ones actions.<br><br>In this sense the Taoist doctrine of wu-wei can be understood as a way of mastering circumstances by understanding their nature or principal, and then shaping ones actions in accordance with these. This understanding has also infused the approach to movement as it is developed in Tai Chi Chuan.<br><br>Understanding this, Taoist philosophy followed a very interesting circle. On the one hand the Taoists, rejected the Confucian attempts to regulate life and society and counseled instead to turn away from it to a solitary contemplation of nature. On the other hand they believed that by doing so one could ultimately harness the powers of the universe. By 'doing nothing' one could 'accomplish everything.' Lao Tzu writes:<br><br>The Tao abides in non-action,<br>Yet nothing is left undone.<br>If kings and lords observed this,<br>The ten thousand things would develop naturally.<br>If they still desired to act,<br>They would return to the simplicity of formless substance.<br>Without form there is no desire.<br>Without desire there is tranquillity.<br>In this way all things would be at peace.<br><br>In this way Taoist philosophy reached out to council rulers and advise them of how to govern their domains. Thus Taoism, in a peculiar and roundabout way, became a political philosophy. The formulation follows these lines:<br>The Taoist sage has no ambitions, therefore he can never fail. He who never fails always succeeds. And he who always succeeds is all- powerful.<br><br>From a solitary contemplation of nature, far removed from the affairs of men, can emerge a philosophy that has, both in a critical as well a constructive sense -- a direct and practical political message. Lao Tzu writes:<br><br>Why are people starving?<br>Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes.<br>Therefore the people are starving.<br>Why are the people rebellious?<br>Because the rulers interfere too much.<br>Therefore they are rebellious.<br><br>Why do people think so little of death?<br>Because the rulers demand too much of life.<br>Therefore the people take life lightly.<br><br>Having to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.</div>

I did not study Taoism much, but what I read from Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu - I found it very worth reading and in line with the Buddhist teachings. Taoism's very essence (the Tao taught by Lao Tzu) in fact, is not at all different from Buddhism. Thusness and Sinweiy from our forum is more experienced than me in it.

It is very difficult to Â‘follow' Taoism for this reason.<br><br>i hope tis will help you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>That is because of ignorance and lack of understanding - I certainly do not see that Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu taught things like 'Some of these folks feel that passing gas, belching and all other Â‘natural' forms of being human should never be controlled but expressed fully'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> That is just plain silly and misses the essence of what Naturalness is...<br><br>I personally think a person who studies Buddhism can appreciate the teachings of Lao Tzu better - instead of dwelling on other practises and misunderstandings. Just from my own opinion.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Besides, we all talk of 'me.' How do you know what is this 'me' that we speak of? You dream you are a bird, and soar to heaven, or dream you are a fish, and dive into the ocean's depths. And you cannot tell whether the man now speaking is awake or in a dream. "A man feels a pleasurable sensation before he smiles, and smiles before he thinks how he ought to smile. Resign yourself to the sequence of things, forgetting the changes of life, and you shall enter into the pure, the divine, the One."<br><br>- Chuang Tzu (Lao Tzu's successor)</span><br><br>In essence, Naturalness/Not-doing means Surrender to the NOW.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh, found Chuang Tzu's biography - same source and website as the Lao Tzu's one  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><a href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Philosophy/Taichi/lao.html" rel="nofollow">Lao Tzu</a><br><a href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/Philosophy/Taichi/chuang.html" rel="nofollow">Chuang Tzu</a><br>-------<br><br>Chuang Tzu (399 - 295 B.C.) has always been an influential Chinese philosopher. His writing is at once transcendental while at the same time being deeply immersed within everyday life. He is at peace while at the same time moving through the world. There is a deep vein of mysticism within him which is illuminated by his very rational nature. His style of writing with its parables and conversations both accessible while at the same time pointing to deeper issues.<br><br>Chuang Tzu took the Taoist position of Lao Tzu and developed it further. He took Lao Tzu's mystical leanings and perspectives and made them transcendental. His understanding of virtue (te) as Tao individualized in the nature of things is much more developed and clearly stated. There is also a greater and more exact attention to Nature and the human place within it which also leads to his greater emphasis on the individual.<br><br>A very interesting and new notion which he brought into Chinese philosophy is that of self-transformation as a central precept in the Taoist process (an understanding that has also penetrated to the heart of Tai Chi Chuan). He believed in life as dynamic and ever changing, making him akin to both Heraclitus and Hegel in these regards. In general, our contemporary understanding of Taoist philosophy is deeply predicated on a very thorough intermingling of the ideas of Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu.<br><br>Chuang Tzu believed that life is transitory and that the pursuit of wealth and personal aggrandizement were vain follies, which distracted from seeing and understanding the world and contemplating its meaning. He strove to see nature with new eyes. For instance:<br><br>"Do the heaven's revolve? Does the earth stand still? Do the sun and the moon contend for their positions? Who has the time to keep them all moving? Is there some mechanical device that keeps them going automatically? Or do they merely continue to revolve, inevitably, of their own inertia?<br><br>"Do the clouds make rain? Or is it the rain that makes the clouds? What makes it descend so copiously? Who is it that has the leisure to devote himself, with such abandoned glee, to making these things happen?"<br><br>Chuang Tzu felt it was imperative that we transcend all the dualities of existence. Seeing Nature at work and the way in which it reconciled these polar opposites pointed the way to the Tao where all dualities are resolved into unity.<br><br>"The universe is the unity of all things. If one recognizes his identity with this unity, then the parts of his body mean no more to him than so much dirt, and death and life, end and beginning, disturb his tranquillity no more than the succession of day and night."<br><br>And:<br><br>"The sage has the sun and the moon by his side. He grasps the universe under his arm. He blends everything into a harmonious whole, casts aside whatever is confused or obscured, and regards the humble as honorable. While the multitude toil, he seems to be stupid and non-discriminative. He blends the disparities of ten thousand years into one complete purity. All things are blended like this and mutually involve each other."<br><br>As to the nature of the Tao itself Chuang Tzu's conception was remarkably similar to that of Lao Tzu.<br><br>"Tao has reality and evidence but no action or physical form. It may be transmitted but cannot be received. It may be obtained but cannot be seen. It is based in itself, rooted in itself. Before Heaven and Earth came into being, Tao existed by itself for all time. It gave spirits and rulers their spiritual powers. It created Heaven and Earth. It is above the zenith but is not high. It is beneath the nadir but is not low. It is prior to Heaven and Earth but is not old. It is more ancient than the highest antiquity but is not regarded as long ago.'<br><br>One of Chuang Tzu's continuing interests was the issue of the interchangibility of appearance and reality. He sometimes asks (almost in a Cartesian way), 'How can we be sure of what we are seeing?<br><br>"Those who dream of the banquet may weep the next morning, and those who dream of weeping may go out to hunt after dawn. When we dream we do not know that we are dreaming. In our dreams we may even interpret our dreams. Only after we are awake do we know that we have dreamed. But there comes a great awakening, and then we know that life is a great dream. But the stupid think they are awake all the time and believe they know it distinctly.<br><br>"Once I, Chuang Tzu, dreamed I was a butterfly and was happy as a butterfly. I was conscious that I was quite pleased with myself, but I did not know that I was Tzu. Suddenly I awoke, and there was I, visibly Tzu. I do not know whether it was Tzu dreaming that he was a butterfly or the butterfly dreaming that he was Tzu. Between Tzu and the butterfly there must be some distinction. [But one may be the other.] This is called the transformation of things."<br><br>By exploring such paradoxes Chaung Tzu reveals that much of the meaning of the world is bound up in apparent contradictions.<br><br>Taoist philosophy exerted a great influence on the developing school of Chan (Zen) Buddhism in China. Many of the understandings of Taoists and Zen Buddhists are very similar.<br><br>"The mind of the perfect man is like a mirror. It does not lean forward or backward in response to things. It responds to things but conceals nothing of its own. Therefore it is able to deal with things without injury to [its reality]."<br><br>This is a very similar metaphor to that of Zen (and for that matter Confucianism). The difference is that for Zen Buddhists it indicates a reality which has to be transcended to attain enlightenment, whereas for Taoists and Confucians it is a metaphor for reality which needs to be responded to faithfully (like a mirror).<br><br>Finally, of death:<br><br>"The universe gives me my body so that I may be carried, my life so I may toil; my old age so I may repose, and my death so I may rest. To regard life as good is the way to regard death as good. A boat may be hidden in a creek or a mountain in a lake. These may be said to be safe. But at midnight a strong man may come and carry it away on his back. An ignorant person does not know that even when the hiding of things, large or small, is perfectly well done, still something will escape you. But if the universe is hidden in the universe itself, then there can be no escape from it. This is the great truth of things in general.<br><br>We posses our body by chance and we are already pleased with it. If our physical bodies went through ten thousand transformations without end, how incomparable would this joy be! Therefore the sage roams freely in the realm in which nothing can escape and all endures. Those who regard dying a premature death, getting old, and the beginning and the end of life as equally good are followed by others. How much more is that to which all things belong and on which the whole process of transformation depends (that is, Tao)?"<br><br>It is worth noting that there is no sign in either Lao Tzu or Chuang Tzu of a religious inclination (ascribing events and processes to a pantheon of deities, etc.) of the kind which later adherents beset Taoism with. Taoism evolved as a philosophy without the religious trappings that later followers felt they had to add to the movement.<br><br>It is also free of any trace of divination, alchemy, searches for an elixir of life and all the other strains of occultism that later attached themselves to this philosophy.</div>
