              <p>Sirs,</p>
              <p>Having read many Buddhist literature recently after having read many Hindu philosophies I don't understand many things.Christianity is vague and doesn't go deep,so it's not included.Hopefully some one can clarify it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ol>
              <li>In Hindusim Karma is bound with soul and it goes from body to body,which depending on effect gets a good or bad life. Once it's finished the soul is liberated. However in Buddhism there is no soul,but there is Karma.Where is Karma stored in between bodiesand how dies it find this changing mind stream in new body?</li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li>Creation in Hinduism is done by a God, Brahma and he dissolutes it after much time and a new universe is created and so on. In Buddhism it is said from ignorance everything came into being and dependent origination caused this universe and other worlds. Ignorance just became all these lifes,bodies and things?How did it happen and where did this ignorance come from?<span style="line-height: 1.231;">Most importantly how did this well arranged system of Karma it's effects,different lifes(God,demigod,human,hungry ghost,hell etc) came into being and why is one forced to be in the clutches of Karma. It seems some rules can be followed(like meditation) and escape fromt his 'samsara/prison',but then again it's following a pre-written possibility by someone or something.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;"><br></span></li>
              <li>Last step in Hindusim is dissolution in Brahman,where the soul looses the individual identity and cease to exist. In Buddhism this is one of the first step and last stage is seen as emptiness where the aggregates causing self cease to exist and becomes empty. Then what happens?</li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li>In Buddhism everything has a Buddha state which can be achieved. How can animals achieve it?</li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li><strong>Intention: </strong>If one fire a gun and its bullet kills some one,that bad karma goes to doer,if intentionally done.However if its un intentional it's not the case.The physical actions are same in both cases.But the effect on doer is very different,why?</li>

              <p>1) "Kamma being a form of energy is not
                          found anywhere in this fleeting consciousness or body. Just as
                          mangoes are not stored anywhere in the mango tree but, dependent on
                          certain conditions, they spring into being, so does kamma. Kamma is
                          like wind or fire. It is not stored up anywhere in the Universe but
                          comes into being under certain conditions."</p>
              <p>~ K Sri Dhammananda</p>
              <p>I also wrote recently:<span> <em>So you see dependent origination Directly, not just as an
                          inference, but you see ignorance in action - what does ignorance
                          means? What does karmic propensities mean? Many of us think of
                          karmic propensities and ignorance as being some kind of ghostly,
                          hidden, almost mystical force hiding somewhere and affecting our
                          lives from a hidden 'subconscious' component of consciousness
                          stored away from sight. That is having an inherent view, a
                          self-view of ignorance and karmic propensities. We need to directly
                          See that cause of suffering and that suffering as the total
                          exertion of our experience in seamless
                          dependencies.</em></span><em> </em><span><span>- <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2014/05/early-buddhisms-model-of-enlightenment.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2014/05/early-buddhisms-model-of-enlightenment.html</a><br></span></span><br><br>Also see what I wrote: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2013/11/total-exertion-of-karmic-tendencies.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2013/11/total-exertion-of-karmic-tendencies.html</a><br><br>2) No one 'forced' you into anything - things arise due to dependent origination, there is no creator. There is nothing pre-written by someone or something.<br><br>Ignorance manifest due to taints, and taints arise due to ignorance, so it is a cyclic momentum. <br><br>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.ntbb.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.009.ntbb.html</a>:</p>

              <p>64. Saying, "Good friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in the
                           Venerable Sariputta's words. Then they asked him a further question: 
                          "But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble disciple is 
                          one of right view... and has arrived at this true Dhamma?" — "There 
                          might be, friends.</p>
              <p>65. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands ignorance, the 
                          origin of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way leading to 
                          the cessation of ignorance, in that way he is one of right view... and 
                          has arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>
              <p><a id="p66">66</a>. "And what is ignorance, what is the origin of 
                          ignorance, what is the cessation of ignorance, what is the way leading 
                          to the cessation of ignorance? Not knowing about suffering, not knowing 
                          about the origin of suffering, not knowing about the cessation of 
                          suffering, not knowing about the way leading to the cessation of 
                          suffering — this is called ignorance. With the arising of the taints 
                          there is the arising of ignorance. With the cessation of the taints 
                          there is the cessation of ignorance. The way leading to the cessation of
                           ignorance is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view... 
                          right concentration.</p>
              <p>67. "When a noble disciple has thus understood ignorance, the origin 
                          of ignorance, the cessation of ignorance, and the way leading to the 
                          cessation of ignorance... he here and now makes an end of suffering. In 
                          that way too a noble disciple is one of right view... and has arrived at
                           this true Dhamma."</p>
              <h4><a id="asava">Taints</a></h4>
              <p>68. Saying, "Good, friend," the bhikkhus delighted and rejoiced in 
                          the Venerable Sariputta's words. Then they asked him a further question:
                           "But, friend, might there be another way in which a noble disciple is 
                          one of right view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in
                           the Dhamma and has arrived at this true Dhamma?" — "There might be, 
                          friends.</p>
              <p>69. "When, friends, a noble disciple understands the taints, the 
                          origin of the taints, the cessation of the taints, and the way leading 
                          to the cessation of the taints, in that way he is one of right view, 
                          whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma and has
                           arrived at this true Dhamma.</p>
              <p>70. "And what are the taints, what is the origin of the taints, what 
                          is the cessation of the taints, what is the way leading to the cessation
                           of the taints? There are three taints: the taint of sensual desire, the
                           taint of being and the taint of ignorance. With the arising of 
                          ignorance there is the arising of the taints. With the cessation of 
                          ignorance there is the cessation of the taints. The way leading to the 
                          cessation of the taints is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, 
                          right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right 
                          livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration.</p>
              <p>71. "When a noble disciple has thus understood the taints, the origin
                           of the taints, the cessation of the taints, and the way leading to the 
                          cessation of the taints, he entirely abandons the underlying tendency to
                           lust, he abolishes the underlying tendency to aversion, he extirpates 
                          the underlying tendency to the view and conceit 'I am,' and by 
                          abandoning ignorance and arousing true knowledge he here and now makes 
                          an end of suffering. In that way too a noble disciple is one of right 
                          view, whose view is straight, who has perfect confidence in the Dhamma 
                          and has arrived at this true Dhamma."</p>
              <p>That is what the Venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Venerable Sariputta's words.</p>
              <p><br>3) First of all realizing the emptiness of self and phenomena does not mean they cease immediately, but rather their nature is 'empty' even when they are manifesting. In hearing a sound, there is no hearer just sound, sound is vivid luminosity and even sound is dependently arisen, empty and non-arising.<br><br>Also, what you asked is an inappropriate question. This is because, as Sariputta explains,</p>
              <p>[Sariputta:] "The statement, 'With the remainderless stopping &amp; 
                          fading of the six contact-media [vision, hearing, smell, taste, touch, 
                          &amp; intellection] is it the case that there is anything else?' 
                          objectifies non-objectification.<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.174.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> The statement, '... is it the case that there is not anything else ... 
                          is it the case that there both is &amp; is not anything else ... is it 
                          the case that there neither is nor is not anything else?' objectifies 
                          non-objectification. However far the six contact-media go, that is how 
                          far objectification goes. However far objectification goes, that is how 
                          far the six contact media go. With the remainderless fading &amp; 
                          stopping of the six contact-media, there comes to be the stopping, the 
                          allaying of objectification.</p>
              <p>- <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.174.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.174.than.html</a><br><br>The mind is very quick to grasp on something. It wants something to exist eternally, be it 'Brahman', 'Awareness', etc. This craving and objectifying/subjectifying of metaphysical entities is mental proliferation itself and will prevent freedom. This will prevent letting everything go.<br><br><br>4) Karma is intentional action, therefore, if there is intention to kill arising from the defilement of aggression, that in itself is very unwholesome karma. Unwholesome karma results in unwholesome consequences or rebirth, that is how rebirth works - the ripening of karmic actions. <br><br>If a baby presses the trigger and hurts someone because he thinks it is a toy and the parents didn't put the gun in its proper place, then it is not an action with the intention to harm others. Karma IS intentional action. Therefore if you step on ants unknowingly while walking down the road, it is a neutral action.</p>

              <p>1) In Buddhism, we do not deny 'awareness', but since we realize that 'in seeing just the seen, no seer, in hearing just sound, no hearer', then awareness is always only manifestation and never a background Self/agent/perceiver underlying experience or hiding behind experience. Just the experience alone is clarity, is self-luminous, is self-aware. Our nature of mind is the union of luminous clarity and emptiness. <br><br><span class="null">The insight of anatta allows one to see the true face
                                           of Awareness as the self-illuminating appearance, rather than 
                                          experiencing Pure Awareness/Pure Consciousness etc as a hidden 
                                          ghost/standalone thing/subject and mistaking it as actual.. it does not 
                                          deny luminous clarity but is the only way
                                           which allows for the total, uncontrieved, direct non-referential 
                                          experience of clarity in all moments without holding to images or 
                                          dissociation. Then after this, we can further penetrate the dependent origination and non-arising/emptiness of all foreground manifestation, that completes the twofold emptiness (of subjective self and objective phenomena).<br></span><br>Hindus and mystics of other religions only realize the aspect of luminous clarity, which does not 
                          liberate. One must realize our nature of mind to be the union of 
                          luminosity and emptiness, only then it can liberate.<span class="null"> </span></p>
              <p>In fact a few days ago I was listening to the 
                                          'Daniel Ingram - Buddha at the Gas Pump Interview' and towards the end I
                                           think he related anatta, awareness, transience and manifestation pretty
                                           well. (Daniel Ingram is a hardcore meditation teacher in the Theravadin
                                           Buddhist tradition authorized to teach by the Mahasi Sayadaw lineage).</p>
              <p>Daniel:
                                           "So you have these two extremes - both of which I find pretty annoying 
                                          (laughs) - and uhm, not that they are not making interesting points that
                                           counterbalance each other. And then, from an experiential point of 
                                          view, the whole field seems to be happening on its own in a luminous 
                                          way, the intelligence or awareness seems to be intrinsic in the 
                                          phenomena, the phenomena do appear to be totally transient, totally 
                                          ephemeral. So I would reject from an experiential point of view, 
                                          something in the harshness of the dogma of the rigid no-selfists that 
                                          can't recognise the intrinsic nature of awareness that is the field. If 
                                          that makes sense. Cos they tend to feel there's something about that's 
                                          sort of (cut off?)..."</p>
              <p>Interviewer: "And not only awareness..."</p>
              <p>Daniel:
                                           "Intelligence. Right, and I also reject from an experiential point of 
                                          view the people who would make this permanent, something separate from, 
                                          something different from just the manifestation itself. I don't like the
                                           permanence aspect because from a Buddhist technical point of view I do 
                                          not find anything that stands up as permanent in experience. I find that
                                           quality always there *while there is experience.* Because it's 
                                          something in the nature of experience. But it's not quite the same thing
                                           as permanence, if that makes sense. So while there is experience, there
                                           is experience. So that means there is awareness, from a certain point 
                                          of view, manifestation - awareness being intrinsically the same thing, 
                                          intrinsic to each other. So while there is experience, I would claim 
                                          that element (awareness) is there - it has to be for there to be 
                                          experience. And I would claim that the system seems to function very 
                                          lawfully and it's very easy to feel that there's a sort of intelligence,
                                           ok, cool... ...the feeling of profundity, the feeling of 
                                          miraculousness, the wondrous component. So as the Tibetans would say, 
                                          amazing! It all happens by itself! So, there is intrinsically amazing 
                                          about this. It's very refreshingly amazing that the thing happens, and 
                                          that things cognize themselves or are aware where they are, 
                                          manifestation is truly amazing and tuning into that amazingness has 
                                          something valuable about it from a pragmatic point of view."</p>

              <p><br><br>2) Liberation of bardo is not just a matter of "thinking it as unreal". It is about waking up to the true nature of mind/experience/appearance as luminous and empty. It is about direct apprehension of our true nature. Liberation is dependent upon awakening/enlightenment/realizing true nature/whatever you want to call it. Thinking about it is definitely insufficient, just like your thinking of 'emptiness' right now is not sufficient to liberate your afflictions. Otherwise anyone who intellectually understood emptiness would have attained Nirvana, but that is never the case as they are only dealing with concepts. Only true awakening makes a difference. Is waking up on dying an easier path? I don't think so, I think if one cannot wake up now, how sure can one be that one will wake up when dying? Especially when death presents a more fearful and uncertain condition for an inexperienced run-off-the-mill person. We must seize our opportunity in life to practice. Death is too late. <br><br>3) Actually there is no beginning of samsara. That's the point. Ignorance depends on taints, taints depends on ignorance, and the whole cycle of 12 links went on and on without a beginning.

From ignorance manifest the 11 other afflictive links of dependent origination. However, there is also the transcendental links of dependent origination which culminates in release, liberation, nirvana: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel277.html</a><br><br>5) The attainment of rainbow body is the goal of Dzogchen teachings.

He told me this 
                              personally. Not only me, but others. He did realize rainbow body. 
                              Rainbow body, in Dzogchen, does not mean that your body disappears. This
                               is a huge misconception....it is stupidly simple -- once you reach the 
                              end of the fourth vision, everything is a display of the five lights, as
                               it is put in the classical text earth, rocks, mountains and cliffs 
                              vanish and instead one sees only the five pure lights.....In other 
                              words, rainbow body in essence is actually a realization...."</span><br> <span class="userContent"><span class="text_exposed_show"> <br> ...<br> <br> "No, but I have heard (from ChNN among others) that the disappearance 
                              of the body is not necessarily a sign of the body of light.<br> <br> Hindus also gain control over the four elements, also Arhats can gain 
                              control over the four elements. Gaining control over the four elements 
                              is mundane siddhi, it is not excellent siddhi, nor is it reserved for 
                              Vajrayana and Dzogchen people. However, if someone has not studied in 
                              detail, they might think that many mundane  siddhis are 
                              profound. So yes, what I am telling you is that I do not consider the so
                               called rainbow body to much more than a display of mundane siddhi to

                              students gathered around him: "You don't realize this, but I am actually
                               Guru Rinpoche and you are his twenty-five disciples. I have reached the
                               stage of exhaustion of phenomena (cho nyi zepa). In truth there is for 
                              me no form, no sensation, no perception, no karmic formation, no 
                              consciousness, no form, no smell, no sense consciousness or object of 
                              sense consciousness and so forth; there is no self or other and no 
                              distinction of 'Buddhas' and 'sentient beings'; everything remains in 
                              the naturally perfect state of pure equality. From the depths of my 
                              heart I wish there were some way you could all be made to understand the
                               truth in this, but you do not see it."<br> <br> Then Rinpoche went silent and tears fell from his eyes."<br> <br> Also, maybe not many of you here knows this - Malcolm (Loppon Namdrol) was asked to teach Dzogchen by KDL but he refused.</span></span></div>

              <p><br> Thusness said to me:</p>
              <blockquote> "As I suspected (thumbs up) I mean the rainbow body. That can only be
                               done after realization of twofold emptiness and intensity of luminosity
                               into the three states (waking, dreaming, deep sleep)... you are doing 
                              pretty well. The integration has
                               been progressing well of the non-dual bliss into your deep sleep state,
                               in view of the short period after your realization of anatta. The inner
                               
                              core must completely disappear and the intensity of luminosity must 
                              heighten... Sensations will become transparent and crystal sharp clear.<br> <br> At
                               present the core center is gone... You write too much and have too 
                              little rest. Your mind must have enough time to rest in 
                              non-conceptuality of the 6 entries and exits. Otherwise it will not be 
                              easy for you to penetrate further. After realizing the twofold emptying 
                              there is no more boundaries between mind, appearances and apparent 
                              objects and experience becomes seamless... All is mind or this 
                              integrated activity. Then we should actualize and integrate this 
                              realization.<br> <br> In touching, both subject and object are both emptied
                               and deconstructed into a single activity of touch and the intensity of 
                              luminous clarity must be strong... is it strong now? Or just like 
                              passing thoughts with no intensity.</blockquote> <blockquote> Now penetration of the 3 
                              states is only supported by the strength of your view and realization, 
                              not by the intensity of your non-conceptual experience.<br> <br> "In essence rainbow body is a realization..." Maybe actualization of 
                              realization (would be better), in essence it is an actualized state."<br> <br> <br> my comment: Dzogchen practitioners use the term 'Realization' 
                              differently than I and Thusness, 'Realization' could mean something like
                               full actualization or Buddhahood for them and not just an initial 
                              insight/recognition/experience.</blockquote>

              <p>Bhagavan is referring to Buddha. It is a Mahayana sutra that talked about bardos.<br><br>Karma is not a 'rule', it is just mental, verbal and bodily actions, and these actions have causal effects. Not only does karma have causal effects - many other things have causal effects, for example body has its own sets of causality, our biosphere has its own set of causality, and now humans are upsetting the intricate web of environment interconnectedness due to the emissions of carbon dioxide which releases methane trapped under the ice in Greenland which further exacerbates the warming cycle. Basically, it is just plain simple causality, and yet our world is so vastly and intricately interconnected that one thing, one change can set a whole chain of effect throughout the globe.<br><br>There is no creator of the environment, or the body, scientists tell us our body is the result of evolution and natural selection, and our environment has evolved over billions of years to make it suitable for life or intelligent lifeforms like us (and we are probably a very lucky few planets in the universe to be able to support life). Likewise our karma is constantly 'evolving' or rather, manifesting and giving forth new realities from moment to moment through dependent origination, but there is no creator of karma.<br><br>As for 'Is it Karma that is born,dies and
                                      continues this cycle?' -- well you just need to keep in mind that Karma is the 2nd link of the 12 links of dependent origination which ends with 'ageing... death'. The 12 links describes the process or cycle of samsara. In other words it is a causal process, a total exertion of various afflictive dependencies that sets forth the process of birth, ageing, sickness and death and the whole cycle of samsara.<br><br>I have not read Journey of Souls so I cannot comment on it. What is it that you would like to compare with Buddhism?</p>

              <p>The notion of karma is rather different from what's usually understood as 'destiny'. It doesn't arise from divine will, as in Hinduism, nor does it arise by chance. It's the result of our actions. We harvest what we sow. Nothing forces beings to reincarnate in a particular way except the accumulated patterns of their actions, 'actions' here covering all our thoughts, words and deeds, positive or negative. It's the equivalent of good and evil, but it's important to remember that good and evil are not absolute notions. Our thoughts and actions are considered good and evil according to whether their motivation is to help or to harm, and according to their result, our own and others' happiness and suffering.</p>
              <p>For one it may be morals and yet for another ethics, but it is actually a matter of the very mechanisms of happiness and suffering. In every instant, we are experiencing the result of our past actions, while our present thoughts, words and deeds are shaping our future. At the moment of death, the patern of all our actions hitherto is what determines the kind of existence we will find ourselves in next. The seeds we've planted germinate, into flowers or hemlock. Another metaphor sometimes used is that of a bird landing on the ground. The bird's shadow - our karma - which was hitherto invisible, suddenly appears. A more modern metaphor might be that at the moment of death we develop the film we've been shooting all our life, a film that also incorporates everything filmed during all our previous lives.</p>
              <p>During this present life, which is coming to an end, we have been able to add or remove positive or negative actions to that accumulated karma and modify it, either purifying it or making it worse. After death comes a transitory state that we call bardo, during which the following life takes form and becomes clearer. In the bardo, the consciousness is swept along like a feather in the wind, as a function of the results of our positive and negative actions, and the outcome will be an existence that's happy, unhappy, or a mixture of the two. In fact, that gives us a very sane attitude towards whatever happens to us - we alone are to blame for what we are, as we're the result of our past, and the future is in our own hands.</p>

              <p>Alfred Foucher, the author of 'The Life of Buddha according to the Texts and Monuments of India', had said, comparing ideas about the immortality of the soul and life after death in Christians and Buddhists, 'For Christians, the hope of salvation and imortality is the hope to survive. For Buddists, it's the hope to dissappear'. Unfortunately, this explanation is the old Western idea about Buddhism as nihilistic still being handed down...</p>
              <p>The 'Middle Way' is so called because it avoids the two extremes of nihilism and eternalism. What does "dissappear" is ignorance, the belief in a self, but as it does so the infinite qualities of enlightenment appear in all their fullness. It's true that one's no longer reborn under the influence of negative karma. But one continues to appear in the conditioned world, through the force of compassion and wisdom, for the benefit of others, without being trapped there. Nirvana is translated by a Tibetan term meaning 'beyond suffering'. If anything is extinguished, it's certainly suffering and the confusion that it engenders.</p>
              <p>According to the Mahayana, or Great Vehicle, to which Tibetan Buddhism belongs, someone who attains Buddhahood resides neither in samsara nor nirvana, both of which are desingated as extremes. One doesn't stay in samsara because he's free of ignorance and is no longer the plaything of karma leading him to reincarnate endlessly. Nor does he stay suspended in the peace of nirvana, because of the infinite compassion he conceives for all the beings still suffering. Rather, he puts into action the vow he took at the dawn of his enlightenment to continue to manifest deliberately - not under the constraint of karma but by the force of his compassion - until the conditioned world is emptied of all sufferings, or in other words for as long as there are still beings imprisoned in ignorance. So he's free of samsara but doesn't remain in nirvana.</p>
              <p>This is why we talk about Buddhas and Bodhisattvas manifesting in numerous forms to accomplish the good of beings and guide them on the path to enlightenment. Amoung them are counted the great teachers who are perfectly realized.</p>

              <p>Sir</p>
              <p>Why karma has result?For me it sounds like a program destined to
              do things.Eg: good things and good result,bad actions and bad
              result.Then as you said at death a reel of all these,why it is like
              this?Why Bardo and why the next life and so on?What is karma and
              where is it stored?Some energy?If so can it not be converted like
              others?</p>
              <p>I find it difficult to imagine that all of this well planned
              system just originated from ignorance.</p>

              <p>We share the same affinitity for a contemplative life and, yes, I wholeheartedly agree that the whole notion of karma can be quite disconcerting. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Furthermore, it is particularly disconcerting in the case of someone who seems completely innocent, like a severely ill child, or someone with many admirable qualities who's nevertheless going through some terrible tragedies.</span></p>
              <p>Nevertheless, whatever happens to us, it teaches, is never just by chance. We've created the causes of our present sufferings ourselves.  We're a result of a complex set of causes and conditions, a mixture of actions that are sometimes unwholesome or destructive. Bit by bit, little by little, these causes ripen into results and are expressed as our successive lives unfold. From within a different metaphysical framwork, of course, it would be difficult to see how our present happiness and suffering could be the result of our distant past. But in the context of Buddhism that accepts the idea of numerous rebirths, it all makes sense. So we have no reason to rebel against what happens to us. But nor should our attitude be one of resignation, because we now have the chance to redress this situation. The idea is, therefore, to recognize what we need to do, or to avoid, in order to construct our happiness and escape from suffering. If we understand that negative actions lead to suffering both for ourselves and others, and that positive actions lead to happiness, it's up to us to act now in such a way as to build our own future by sowing 'good seeds'.</p>
              <p>There's a saying that goes, 'As long as you keep your hand in the fire, it's no good hoping not to be burnt.' It's not that we'll be 'rewarded' or 'punished' - we're simply subject to the law of cause and effect.The Buddha gave numerous examples of karmic effects. Neverthess, there are, as you can undoutedly imagine, an infinite number of such combinations. It is said that only the omniscience of a Buddha can perceive the compexity of any individual's karma.</p>
              <p>In his first teaching, the Buddha set out what are known as the 'Four Noble Truths' - the truth of the suffering of the conditioned world, the truth of the source of suffering (ignorance and the negative emotions that build up karma), the truth of the possibility of putting an end to suffering, and the truth of the path that leads to that cessation of suffering. Suffering here includes, of course, the suffering of birth, aging, illness, and death; of encountering adversaries, losing those dear to us, and so on. This isn't to be pessimistic about life, rather it simply stresses the need to become aware of suffering so that we can apply the proper remedy to it. Indeed, if there was no such remedy, there'd be no point in worrying about suffering.</p>
              <p>I have heard it said that the continuity of consciousness ensures that there's a link between the moment of an action and the moment of its consequences, whether happy or unhappy. So what's the point of avoiding evil and doing good? To that challange, Buddism replies with a parable. A man drops a flaming torch from a high terrace where he'd been eating his supper. The fire catches the thatch of his own roof and soon sets the whole village ablaze, house by house. When accused of causing the fire, he replies to his judges, 'It wasn't my fault. The fire of the torch I was eating by wasn't the same as the fire that burned the village.' But, of course, he's found to be responsible for the fire. So even in the absence of an individual self seen as an independantly existing entity, what we are at present is the result of our past. Acts certainly bear their results. The most important point is therefore the continuity, not the identity. A negative act isn't translated into happiness, just as a hemlock seed doesn't grow into a lime tree. Consequently, the fact that a positive or negative action has a corresponding result, in terms of happiness or suffering, justifies our undertaking or avoiding it, even if the person who experiences the result doesn't have an eternal self.</p>

              <p>Thanks for this. Makes sense in many ways.However though i still don't understand why it is so?For example every action has a reaction,why?Who made it like this?there re many realms where ghosts to gods live each seperated,how did it come?All of this by random?</p>
