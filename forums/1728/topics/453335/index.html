              <p>"<a id="sheaf" name="sheaf">Suppose</a>, monks, that a sheaf of 
              barley were thrown down at a large four-way intersection, and six men 
              were to come along with flails in their hands. They would thrash the 
              sheaf of barley with their six flails. Thus the sheaf of barley would be
               thoroughly thrashed with the six flails. Then a seventh man would come 
              along with a flail in his hand. He would thrash the sheaf of barley with
               a seventh flail. Thus the sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly
               thrashed with the seventh flail.</p>
              <p>"In the same way, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is thrashed
               in the eye by charming &amp; pleasurable forms... thrashed in the ear 
              by charming &amp; pleasurable sounds... thrashed in the nose by charming
               &amp; pleasurable aromas... thrashed in the tongue by charming &amp; 
              pleasurable flavors... thrashed in the body by charming &amp; 
              pleasurable tactile sensations... thrashed in the intellect by charming 
              &amp; pleasurable ideas. And if that uninstructed run-of-the-mill person
               forms intentions for the sake of further becoming in the future, then 
              he — that foolish person — is even more thoroughly thrashed, just like 
              the sheaf of barley thrashed with the seventh flail.</p>
              <p>"Once, monks, the devas &amp; asuras were arrayed for battle. Then <a id="vepacitti" name="vepacitti">Vepacitti</a>,
               the lord of the asuras, addressed the asuras: 'If, dear sirs, in the 
              battle of the devas arrayed against the asuras, the asuras win and the 
              devas are defeated, bind Sakka, the lord of the devas, neck, hand, &amp;
               foot and bring him before me in the city of the asuras.'</p>
              <p>"As for <a id="sakka" name="sakka">Sakka</a>, lord of the devas, he 
              addressed the devas of the Thirty-three: 'If dear sirs, in the battle of
               the devas arrayed against the asuras, the devas win and the asuras are 
              defeated, bind Vepacitti, the lord of the asuras, neck, hand, &amp; foot
               and bring him before me in the righteous assembly of the devas.'</p>
              <p>"Now, in that battle the devas won. So the devas of the Thirty-three 
              bound Vepacitti, the lord of the asuras, neck, hand, &amp; foot and 
              brought him before Sakka in the righteous assembly of the devas.</p>
              <p>"So there was Vepacitti, the lord of the asuras, bound neck, hand, 
              &amp; foot. When the thought occurred to him, 'The devas are in the 
              right and the asuras are in the wrong. I'm now going over to the city of
               the devas,' then he viewed himself as freed from that fivefold bond. He
               was fully provided with the fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality. 
              But when the thought occurred to him, 'The asuras are in the right and 
              the devas are in the wrong. I will go over to the city of the asuras,' 
              then he viewed himself as bound with that fivefold bond, deprived of the
               fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality. That's how subtle the bonds of
               Vepacitti were. But the bonds of <a id="mara" name="mara">Mara</a> are even more subtle. Anyone who construes is bound by Mara. Anyone who doesn't construe is freed from the Evil One.</p>
              <p>"'I am' is a construing. 'I am this' is a construing. 'I shall be' is
               a construing. 'I shall not be'...'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I 
              shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall 
              not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient'
               is a construing. Construing is a disease, construing is a cancer, 
              construing is an arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 
              'We will dwell with an awareness free of construings.'</p>
              <p>"'I am' is a perturbation. 'I am this' is a perturbation. 'I shall 
              be' is a perturbation. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of 
              form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be 
              percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither 
              percipient nor non-percipient' is a perturbation. Perturbation is a 
              disease, perturbation is a cancer, perturbation is an arrow. Therefore, 
              monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an awareness 
              free of perturbations.'</p>
              <p>"'I am' is a wavering. 'I am this' is a wavering. 'I shall be' is a 
              wavering. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall
               not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be
               percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is a 
              wavering. Wavering is a disease, wavering is a cancer, wavering is an 
              arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell 
              with an awareness free of waverings.'</p>
              <p>"'I am' is a objectification. 'I am this' is a objectification. 'I 
              shall be' is a objectification. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be 
              possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be 
              percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither 
              percipient nor non-percipient' is a objectification. Objectification is a
               disease, objectification is a cancer, objectification is an arrow. 
              Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an 
              awareness free of objectifications.'</p>
              <p>"'I am' is an act of conceit. 'I am this' is an act of conceit. 'I 
              shall be' is an act of conceit. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be 
              possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be 
              percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither 
              percipient nor non-percipient' is an act of conceit. An act of conceit 
              is a disease, an act of conceit is a cancer, an act of conceit is an 
              arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell 
              with an awareness free of acts of conceit.'"</p>
