            <div class='col-md body'><p>Ösel Khandro Duwi Ling, The Gathering Place of the Dakinis, is located 17 miles south of Grants, New Mexico, in the Zuni Mountains. This small, simple, and remote retreat center of Bhakha Tulku Rinpoche is at an altitude of just under 8,000 feet. <br><br>It is situated in a grassy meadow surrounded by a vibrant Ponderosa pine forest—a place of peace and solitude, yet full of power and promise. Days are warm and pleasant; nights are cool. It is accessible via a well-maintained and easily drivable dirt road.<br><br>The retreat land is located 20 miles southwest of Grants, NM, off I-40. The nearest airport is Albuquerque, 70 miles east of Grants on I-40. If coming from the west, Grants is 70 miles east of Gallup, NM. Due to weather conditions at this altitude, the retreat land is open only between May and early October. Because the stupa is situated on private land, visits must be arranged by appointment<br><br>Ceremonies and retreats are held in the stupa’s shrine room. At this point in the development of the retreat land, the facilities are simple but very pleasant. Retreatants should be prepared to camp (bring all your own gear) in a designated pine-forest camping area; there are also various motels in Grants, 20 miles away by a good road. The retreat land has a small sangha kitchen where wholesome and delicious food is served during retreats, as well as a bathhouse and toilets. There are no telephones (but there is some cell-phone reception).<br><br>http://www.zunimountainstupa.org/retreatland.html<br>The Zuni Mountain Stupa is envisaged as being fifty feet in height and will be constructed in the Dudul Choten, "subduing of evil forces," style. It will house a shrine room and will contain buried weapons, relics of enlightened beings, millions of mantras, tsa tsas, and numerous other precious substances. All aspects of its construction will be done in the traditional manner, consecrated by Bhakha Tulku Rinpoche and other lamas.<br><br>The retreat land, accessible by an unpaved road in the Cibola National Forest, is at an altitude of 8000 feet, where the Ponderosa pines tower and a wide variety of wildflowers bloom through a fragile desert crust embedded with crystals. It is in an area that was a traditional inter-tribal hunting area for the various Native peoples who have inhabited this region. Nearby Mt. Taylor, known as Tsoodzil to the Navajo people, is one of the four sacred mountains between which they live.<br><br>Bhakha Tulku Rinpoche holds many lineages, including the Pema Lingpa lineage, the Dzogchen lineage of the Namchoe tradition, the Longchen Nyingthig, and the Chetsung Nyingthig. He received the Rinchen Terzod and many other teachings from H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche. He studied at Mindroling, the great Nyingma center of learning in central Tibet, but fled Tibet to Bhutan in 1959 during the Chinese Bhaka Tulku Rinpocheoccupation. He studied at the school for young Tulkus in Dalhousie, India and served H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche for a number of years. He has also received many teachings from other great masters including H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche and Dodrup Chen Rinpoche. He has since done much translation work for westerners and has served H.H. Penor Rinpoche, the current head of the Nyingma School, and H.H. Chatral Rinpoche, the great Dzogchen master. Bhakha Tulku Rinpoche's teaching and practice activities have taken him to India, Nepal, Bhutan, Tibet, Taiwan and the United States over the past 10 years.</p></div>
