You can see the past, you can't change the past.<br><br>Anyway here's the full story of Mogallana attempting to save the 500 people:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://honsing.com/Disciples.htm" rel="nofollow">http://honsing.com/Disciples.htm</a><br><br><strong>Mogallana (Also Moggallana, Maha-Maudgalyayana, foremost in possessing supernatural powers)</strong><br><br>Mogallana followed the Buddha together with Sariputra.  Mogallana gained Enlightenment within 7 days and attained supernatural powers.  Why did Mogallana have such great supernatural powers?  This is because in a previous live, Mogallana gave a treat to a Pacceka Buddha.  The Pika Buddha was not very eloquent in explaining the Dharma through words, hence he illustrated using supernatural powers.  Mogallana was impressed and vowed that he too would achieve in supernatural powers to propagate the Dharma.<br><br>Supernatural powers were quite common among Buddha's disciples.  However the display of it was always discouraged by the Buddha, all except for Mogallana, he was even praised for using supernatural powers in propagating the Dharma.  There were many interesting stories, including one giving rise to the Buddhist festival of Ullambana.  However I shall mention one that is less heard of.<br><br>There was once where Kapilavastu was to be attacked by King Virudhara from the Kingdom of Kosala King.  Buddha tried to prevent the war by sitting at the pathway leading to Kapilavastu on 3 separate occasions.  King Virudhara always retreated whenever he saw Buddha.  However King Virudhara's revenge and hatred could not be subdued.  Buddha knew that there was no way to prevent the Karma further, thus he left them alone.<br><br>Mogallana had been successful in all his supernatural powered deeds.  Hence he thought that more could be done in this case.  Buddha explained to him that this was due to the past bad Karma of the people in Kapilavastu.  The people remained arrogant, non-rependent, deceitful, and did not amend their ways, hence there was no way of substituting the fruits of Karma.  Mogallana was unconvinced.  The army surrounded Kapilavastu such that no one could escape.  Mogallana used his supernatural powers to fly into the city, found 500 great men, transform them into his alms bowl, and flew out of the city to a safe spot. However when he opened the bowl to recover the men, he found a bow of blood water instead!  Mogallana realized that supernatural powers cannot overcome Karma. (For more details, check out here for more details: http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Courtyard/1652/Massacre.html.)<br><br>This was a lesson for Mogallana.  Finally one day Mogallana was ambushed by some Jain followers.  They pushed rocks from a hill onto Mogallana.  Mogallana knew this was his Karma and he did not use supernatural powers to overcome it.  He died under the rocks.  This was before Buddha's final Nirvana.</blockquote></div>

So even if the army died, the 500 men will still turn to blood because of their karma. Also, Mogallana who is an Arhat couldn't possibly kill someone.
