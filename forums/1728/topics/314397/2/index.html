              <p>2) it's suppose to be 10000 practice 10000 achieve, ä¸‡ä¿®ä¸‡äººåŽ». yet now due to improper practice, it's good just to get 1 out of 100 or 3 to 5 out of 10000.</p>
              <p>3) practice well, and this life is all it takes. if miss this chance, u'll have to wait for another life, or life after next etc....it could even continue for aeons in the cycle of samsara when this chance is gone, then until another great bodhisattva make another vow like that of Amitabha, then can catch this "train" again.</p>

              <p>My answer is totally different from your answer</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">4) Amitabha used to be human called <strong><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Dharmakara </span></strong> and

                                      Buddha before Gautama.</strong> </span></p>
              <p>My highlighted one is definitely wrong .Whoever get four stages of enligtenments of nibbana, he never comes back to suffering life of any 31 abodes (heaven, pureland,hell,animal,human life). If he is already a buddha before Gautama, he is not in pureland.He is definitely in Nibbana.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">He's able to teached the four

              <p>Amitabha is in pureland .This means he is waiting the time to become buddha in the future. Before Amitabha become Buddha, how can he teach four stages of enlightenments? If Amitabha know the four stages of enlightenments, he already become Buddha.If Amitabha becomes Buddha, he is not staying in pureland.definitely in Nibbana.</p>
              <p>All the answers should be relevant in Dhamma.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One day,</span><span style="color: #ff6600;"> When Gautama Buddha and his group of Sangha(monks) arrive to mountain called Waebula (ancient name), Buddha told </span><span style="color: #ff6600;">his group of Sangha(monks) about history of Waebula mountain.Before Gautama Buddha becomes buddha, at the moment of previous Cathapha Buddha , the people near the mountain takes 3 days to walk from the bottom of mountain to top of mountain.When Gautama becomes Buddha , the people near the mountain takes 4 days to </span><span style="color: #ff6600;">walk from the bottom of mountain to top of mountain.Buddha said the mountain becomes piled up with the decomposed bones and ashes of dead tree, dead animals and dead human.The climate also modified the surface of earth.<br> </span></p>
              <p>1) The duration time between previous Cathapha Buddha and Gautama Buddha is you have to wait for the level of earth ground will pile up to which you take 1=(4-3) day to walk from earth ground level at Cathapha's time  to earth ground level at Gautamma 's time.It cannot be counted by years.</p>
              <p>2)Let say the best chance to meet the Amitabha Buddha, When the Amitabha become Buddha , you are in pureland or in heaven.While you stay in pureland or heaven, you change your mind to meet Amitabha Buddha, because I like to enjoy the pleasure of all the sensible things and I don't want to listen his Dhamma to go Nibbana.</p>
              <p>Between the time Gautama Buddha and Cathapha Buddha, you can commit very bad evil Karma.Gautama Buddha Dhamma are left for 5000 years. 2560 years already passed through and has been over. Now (5000-2560) =2440 years still left for the present and future people to practice his Dhamma. After 2440 years will be over in the future,what will happen in the world? Nobody can teach you how to go to Nibbana.Hence most people will go through the wrong Dhamma.Almost all people will go to hell after they die.</p>
              <p>3) You have to die with amount of your decomposed bones and ashes piled up becomes mountain between present Gautama 's time and next Amitabha Buddha.The amount of bones and ashes are counted in human life only. You have to go through animal, hell, etc.Can't imagine this amount of suffering.</p>
              <p>Because of very frighening suffering in cycles of counterless lifes in the coming future, <span class="ygrp-grdescr">Theravada Buddhism rejected the wrong path to go heaven or pureland.Some of the famous Sayadaw ( Arahat  monk) from myanmar want to go nibbha in present life and don't want to go through </span>very frighening suffering in cycles of countless lifes in the coming future.They already have practised and meditated in the forest and already proofed to people with  their Dhamma teaching and evidence of their body relics.</p>

              <p>Sorry, what you wrote may be according to pali canon, but not according to Mahayana canon. In mahayana, All Buddha have the triple bodies. They are the embodiment of truth, embodiment of nirvanic bliss and the manifestation bodies. the manifestation bodies still re-enter the 31 realms to deliver sentient beings. manifestation bodies can be in any form like human, animals, devas, arahants, bodhisattvas etcs.</p>
              <p>i don't think nirvana is about <strong>extinction/annihilation</strong>. extinction of passion/3 poisons yes. Buddha or Pali use fire to explain nirvana. like fire, it's somewhere out there, yet when conditions are right, it'll still appear. Pureland also have this nature.</p>
              <p>So Amitabha achieved Buddhahood ten (maha)kalpas ago is definitely Correct as stated in Amitabha Sutra.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Moreover, Shariputra, since Amitabha realized Buddhahood,<strong> ten kalpas</strong> have passed. --Amitabha Sutra</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">what "appear" in Pureland is just the manifestation body. embodiment of nirvanic bliss is <strong>Amitayus</strong>.  </span></p>
              <p>Moreover in the Lotus Sutra Chapter16. even Gautama is still dwelling "here". we cannot see Him is because of our defiled mind.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>So they enter the Buddha Way. <br>And throughout these limitless eons, <br>In order to save living beings, <br>I expediently manifest Nirvana. <br>But in truth I do not pass into quiescence. <br>I remain here, always speaking the Dharma. <br>I always stay right here, <br>And using the power of spiritual penetrations, <br>I cause inverted living beings, <br>Although near me, not to see me. <br>The multitudes see me as passing into quiescence.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060519131953/www.buddhistdoor.com/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus16.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20060519131953/www.buddhistdoor.com/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus16.htm</a></p>
              <p>Noted that to enjoy the pleasure of all the sensible things in Pureland, won't lead one to Pureland...period! it'll only lead to heaven, not pureland/nirvana. pls don't mix pureland with heaven. it's misinterpretation.</p>
              <p>Also if ordinary people are to sit beside Buddha, what ordinary people see is samsara, but what Buddha see is "Pureland". When the mind is pure, the land is pure. Buddha achieve Enlightenment at the age of 35, and during 35 to parinirvana, He's dwelling in Puremind, Pureland.</p>
              <p>Pureland is non-conceptual, Equality, Serene, neither form nor formless, and neither suffering nor pleasant. why it's called "Land" of "Ultimate Bliss"?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Further, good sons, there are three kinds of sensation: first, painful sensation; second, pleasant sensation; third, sensation that is neither painful nor pleasant. It is said that what is neither painful nor pleasant is in fact painful. <strong>Although nirvana/(Pureland) is neither painful nor pleasant, it is called great pleasure. </strong>Because it is great pleasure, it is called great nirvana. ---</em></span> MahaNirvana Sutra</p>
              <p> It'll be best to leave the external label of "Nibanna or Pureland" aside and really see it's <strong>content</strong>.</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>According to Pali ,ture original language of Buddhs scripture, there is no pureland abode. There are total of 31 abodesin this universe. All the living things with body and mind staying in 31 abodes must die in one day after the life span ofeach abode.Anyone who come out from the outside of suffering 31 abodes is only Nibbana. The next comingbuddha in the future is now in the Thutitar abode (3 level of  heaven in pali) .I assume this abode is Pureland (3 levelof heaven)according to what you described in the statement (Amitabha is the next coming buddha).</p>
              <p>From your statement</p>
              <p>Also if ordinary people are to sit beside Buddha, what ordinary
                                      people see is samsara, but what Buddha see is "Pureland". When the
                                      mind is pure, the land is pure. Buddha achieve Enlightenment at the
                                      age of 35, and during 35 to parinirvana, He's dwelling in Puremind,
                                      Pureland.</p>
              <p>According to Pali , When Buddha achieve Enlightenment at the age of 35, he mind can cling to Nibbana at any time</p>
              <p>When his mind is cling to Nibbana, all the arising and perishing of his mind and body ceases for during the cling</p>
              <p>moment of his Nibanna.After Buddha passed away, he reached to his Nibbana that he already clinged before his</p>
              <p>death.All these 31 abodes and Nibbana are only existed in this thousand of universe.All the abodes and Nibbana </p>
              <p>can be seen in the body and mind by doing practical correct meditation for verification of wriitten Dhamma in the</p>
              <p>book. After Gautamma Dhamma pass away , among Sangha(group of monks) , some monks want to keep all Buddha Dhamma is original and no changes and modification of Buddha every words in the scripture for any reason and conditon. some monks want to change some part of words in the Dhamma scripture. Hence for me , I don't believe every words written in Dhamma Scripture. I believe only what my body and mind told me during the practical meditation.Buddha extract his dhamma from his body and mind.</p>

              <p>After I read this link , this is very good.</p>
              <p>I found same things in Pali. Practice of  this Dhamma is to see the Dhamma nature of body and mind .It is not  to see  Shakayamuni Buddha or Amitabha Buddha.</p>

              <p><em>AvihÄ�, <br>AtappÄ�, <br>SudassÄ�, <br>SudassÄ« and <br>AkanitthÄ� (E.g., D.iii.237). <br>There anÄ�gÄ�mÄ« are born, and there they attain arahantship; such anÄ�gÄ�mÄ« are divided into twenty four classes (See, e.g., KhA.182f.; of. PSA. 319; Vsm.710).</em></p>
              <p><em>Bodhisattas are never born there (SNA.i.50; BuA.224).</em></p>
              <p><em>The SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� are described as buddhÄ�nam khandhÄ�vÄ�ratthÄ�nasadisÄ�. Sometimes, for asankheyyas of kappas, when no Buddhas are born, these worlds remain empty (AA.ii.808; cf. MA.i.30).</em></p>
              <p><em>The Buddha is mentioned as having visited the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� (E.g., D.ii.50). When a Buddha is about to be born, the inhabitants of the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� insert a knowledge of the signs of a Great Being in the Vedas and teach this among men in the guise of brahmins, calling such knowledge buddhamanta. Men learn it and are thus able to recognize a Great Being (MA.ii.761; SNA.ii.448). The inhabitants of the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� know how many Buddhas will be born in any particular kappa by observing the number of lotuses which spring up on the site of the Bodhi-pallanka when the earth gradually emerges after the destruction of the world (DA.ii.411). It is the SuddhÄ�vÄ�sÄ� BrahmÄ�s who provide the four omens which lead to a Bodhisatta's renunciation in his last lay life. See, e.g., DA.ii.455f.</em></p>

                                words in the Dhamma scripture. Hence for me , I don't believe every
                                words written in Dhamma Scripture. I believe only what my body and
                                mind told me during the practical meditation.Buddha extract his
                                dhamma from his body and mind.</p>

              <p>There's a saying among Theravadins that Mahayana Pure Land corresponds to the 4th jhana abode. However, Mahayanist will not agree to this because (and Theravadins may not agree to this as well) pure land is seen to be beyond the 31 planes of existence and the 6 realms and is not a realm of samsara. Once one is born there one will be on an irreversible path to enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Another thing is that Bodhisattvas in Mahayana are seen as Aryas, though they have not yet attained full enlightenment of Buddhahood. There are altogether 10 bhumis/grounds (so called '10 paths'), and there are various correspondence between the bhumi system and the arhat 4 path systems (an Arhat may be generally considered in Mahayana to be 6th-8th bhumi in terms of realisation). In Theravadin, little or none is spoken about the status of the Bodhisattva nor the 10 paths/grounds/bhumis, and it is generally thought that a Bodhisattva is not an arya until he attains Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>p.s. Arhat is the sanskrit equivalent of Arhant in pali</p>

              <p>pureland is neither an abode nor not an abode. it's very difficult to explain, like it's difficult to explain nirvana.</p>
              <p>and no, i never say Amitabha is the next coming Buddha. you are the one keep saying He is.</p>
              <p>like mentioned in the Amitabha sutra of Mahayana. Amitabha already attain Budhhahood 10 kalpas ago! Like Gautama attained Buddhahood at age 35.  But the different is Amitabha has not enter parinirvana yet, while Gautama enter parinirvana at age 80.</p>
              <p>Amitabha dwell not in this earth, but on another world system far far away. hence i say Amitabha is still preaching Now.The life span of Gautama is shorter and RELATIVELY Amitabha's life span is much much longer.</p>
              <p>anyway, it's quite difficult to mix pali canon of achieving Arahanthood and sanskrit canon of achieving Bodhisatta/Buddhahood.</p>

              <p><br><em>The Buddha said to Bhadrapala, "If you hold to this method of practice, you will attain the samadhi in which all the present Buddhas appear before you. If a bhiksu, bhiksuni, upasaka or upasika wants to practice according to the prescribed method, he or she should strictly observe the precepts, dwell alone in a place and contemplate Amida Buddha of the western quarter where he lives now.ã€€According to the teaching received, one should remember: ten million kotis of Buddha-lands away from here, there is a land called <strong>'Sukhavati</strong>.'<span>14)</span>ã€€<strong>Contemplate this land with singleness of mind, for a day and night up to seven days and nights. ï¼´he seventh day having passed,</strong> <strong>one will see it</strong>.It is as though one sees things in a dream without discerning day and nighht or inside and out; one sees them even though they are in the dark and there are many obstacles in between.ã€€O Bhadrapala, bodhisattvas should do this contemplation. Then high mountains, Sumeru mountains, or whatever dark places there are in the Buddha-lands (between here and Sukhavati), will all give way and will not cause any hindrance. It is not that these bodhisattvas see with a divine eye, hear with a divine ear or reach the Buddha-land with divine feet. It is not that they die here and are born (in order to see the Land).<strong> But they see all this while sitting here.</strong></em></p>

              <p><strong>world systems</strong></p>
              <p><em>The Buddha taught that the earth is not the center of the universe and is not the only planet with intelligent life.</em> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He taught that there are an infinite number of world-systems, that some of those worlds are inhabited by intelligent life, and that on some of those worlds other Buddhas also teach the Buddhadharma.</span></em></p>
              <p><em>II. A GREAT WORLD SYSTEM OF A BILLION WORLDS </em></p>
              <p><em>A thousand world-systems of four great continents, etc. comprise a 'small world-system.' A thousand small world-systems comprise a middle-sized world system, and a thousand middle-sized world-systems comprise a great world-system of a billion worlds, or literally a thousand times an thousand times a thousand worlds (Skt. trisahasramahasahasralokadhatu). </em></p>
              <p><em>III. FLOWER TREASURY WORLD </em></p>
              <p><em>In the Flower Adornment Sutra the Buddha taught that the universe of world-systems is shaped like a great lotus flower and that world systems are arrayed within it in petal-like tiers. Our world -system, called the Saha World, is located on the thirteenth tier. </em></p>
              <p><em>IV. BUDDHAS IN OTHER WORLD SYSTEMS </em></p>
              <p><em>According to Buddhist teachings this planet we live on is not unique in supporting intelligent life, is not the center of the universe, and is not the only world on which Buddhism is taught and practiced. </em></p>
              <p><em>V. THE EMPTINESS OF WORLD-SYSTEMS </em></p>
              <p><em>The world-systems are spoken of by the Tathagata as no world-systems; therefore, they are called 'worldÄ systems.' (VS 80) </em></p>

              <h1><a name="cosmology"></a><em>cosmology</em></h1>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Buddha proclaimed that on the highest level of understanding the entire cosmos is pure Mind. On the ordinary level of understanding he painted a picture of a cosmos filled with countless world-systems (see entry) with countless planets filled with living beings of every sort. Our particular world-system is neither unique nor central in any way. Other world systems also have their Buddhas, who also teach the path to enlightenment.</span> </em></p>
              <p><em>The Flower Adornment Sutra describes the universe as consisting of an infinitely large lotus-flower in which our world occupies the thirteenth tier. The lotus is suspended on various oceans of primal mind-energy forces called Great Elements. </em></p>

              <p>With all due respect, but what the Arahats can see is only a fraction of what the Bodhisattvas and the Buddhas can see. Bodhisattvas cannot even see what the Buddha sees, so what more arahats?</p>
              <p>Just because the arahats do not see the Pure Land, doesn't mean that the Pure Lands do not exist.</p>
              <p>As for the Buddha coming to earth, if one is not even "awaken", even if the Buddha appears right in front of you, you won't even know it is Him, just like Upaka (i think that's the name) the ascetic, who missed out the chance to become the Buddha's first disciple.</p>

              <p>If Buddha from pureland already existed before Gautama become buddha,
              when Gautama become Buddha, he will try to meet all Buddhas in
              different pureland.In pali there is no such thing Gautama tried to meet
              all Buddhas in diffferent pureland.There is one topic in pali.One
              topic is that , One day, Gautama Budhha want to save all the
              intelligent devas,Brahma and human beings to Nibbana.Gautama searched
              who can ask very complex difficult questions of body and mind problem
              from intelligent devas,Brahma and human beings.He found nobody can ask
              very complex difficult questions of body and mind problem from
              intelligent devas,Brahma and human beings.So Gautama copy of his body to
              create another Buddha who will ask very complex difficult questions of
              body and mind problem to Gautama. All the audiance of intelligent devas ,Brahma
              and human beings listen the flow of difficult questions and answers
              between Gautama and created Buddha. In the end, they got enlighenments.</p>

              <p>There is no need for Gautama to meet Amitabha, and the story about the devas and brahmas are different since they have yet to be enlightened.</p>

              <p>I was refering to Sravaka arhats. Pratyekabuddhas and Buddhas also encompass the state of arhat but they are more advanced than sravaka arhats in various ways.</p>
