He was the first, even before Max Planck, the discoverer of the quantum, to say that quantum theory was revolutionary. His idea of light quanta was a landmark break with the classical understanding of physics. In 1909, Einstein presented his first paper to a gathering of physicists and told them that they must find some way to understand waves and particles together.</span><br><br>-----------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This remarkable book contains over 120 sayings from the founders of modern physics paired with parallel sayings from the seminal works of Buddhist, Hindu and Taoist contemplatives.  Einstein and Buddha is a fascinating collection of quotes that challenges us to think deeper about the relationship between modern physics and mystical insight. Although these two ways of understanding and investigating reality have significant differences, the parallels suggest that they share a mysterious and profound connection.</span></div>

True authenticity comes when we realized that any form of Â‘centricityÂ’ is illusionary.<br>To experience the Pure Presence of Isness,   Â“I AMnessÂ” must completely dissolve.  The Pure Presence you experienced is non-local and has no-center.  It becomes an Â‘I AMÂ’ due to linear mode of analysis.  If you have time do explore into insight meditation and the essence of Â‘EmptinessÂ’  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Regards,<br>Thusness<br></div></blockquote>Hi Thusness, long time no see!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Long Chen,<br><br>Nice to see you and Eternal Now too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  As to your question whether one's enlightenment will hinder oneself from relating in a normal society, I supposed not.  For one that has arrived at the fundamental ground, whatever role he assumes, whether as a monk, teacher, businessman or a beggar, he remains free. When it comes to practical application, he will naturally know how to harmonize and fuses completely with everything.<br><br>In Buddhism, No-Self is not a question of morality; it is a question of the true nature of the phenomenon reality.  From the marco universe to the quantum world of quarks, from time to space, from body to consciousness, all exhibit this characteristic. Emptiness prevails everywhere.  Even right now at this moment, we witness the Emptiness truth in action -- the moment ceases as it arises.  There is no changing thing (Self), only change.  Viewing things as solid entities and categorizing them as 'this' or 'that' is due to the poverty of our thinking mechanism, it is not reality.<br><br>The act of labeling will make 'things' appear solid and separated, to the extent that even when we are dealing with the very essence of ourselves -- the pure awareness, we make it an 'I AM'.   'I AMness' is perhaps the furthest the Thinking-Mind can give way and it is never meant merely as an expression for communication.  We seek, find and attempt to locate it as if it is a solid entity hiding somewhere.  As long as this wrong way of 'seeing' persists, there will be attachments and sufferings.  This is the way it is; you cannot eliminate attachment with an 'I'.  Therefore the capacity to see by awakening the emptiness wisdom is especially important in Buddhism.<br><br>Bare attention that is taught in insight meditation trains one to see without labeling, without a layer of words.  It presents us a new mode of experiencing reality as an ever changing inseparable flux.  Without this layer of thought, 'I' has no place to reside and slowly the bond of 'I' will loosen and subside.  If the karmic condition ripens, the mysterious relationship between the pure awareness and the phenomenon world will be revealed.<br><br>The experience of I AM is an intuitive experience of our naked consciousness.   It is seeing Consciousness face to face and touching Consciousness directly without in between thoughts.  But its Emptiness nature must be understood to progress further.  I got to go now....do take care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thusness<br></div>

I am most grateful.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>After reading, what you wrote... I went to meditate.<br><br>Observing the thoughts that arises, there appears to be a relationship between<br>each thoughts. Occasionally,  a desire to recall arises, a new thought will arise that does a recall. But each moment seems to be a fresh moment. .. with no second and no past.<br><br>The continuity and the recall of thoughts and memories arises one after another... but there appears to be NO ONE observing the thoughts. The observer is an impression... there is no observer.
