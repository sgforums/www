            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.humanbliss.com.sg/ques_ans.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanbliss.com.sg/ques_ans.htm</a> - First article<br><br>Q: Could Shi Fu please give us a discourse on what is Â“True SelfÂ”?<br><br>A: Â“True SelfÂ” is the opposite of Â“False SelfÂ”, if you would like to know what Â“True SelfÂ” is, you would need to know what Â“False SelfÂ” is. We often say Â“this shirt is mineÂ”, Â“this house is mineÂ”, everything are ours. After saying for half a day, we still do not know where Â“IÂ” is.<br><br>If you say that our nose is Â“IÂ”, then the eyes belong to whom? If you say the eyes are Â“IÂ”, then to whom do the ears belong? If you say the ears are Â“IÂ”, then to whom does the mouth belong? If you say the hands are Â“IÂ”, then to whom do the legs belong? Actually all these are not Self. Therefore we say: My nose, My eyes, My ears, My mouth, My hair, My hands, My legsÂ… we say everything belongs to me, but do not say that these are Me. What exactly is Â‘SelfÂ’ then? Everyone would like to find out where is the Â‘IÂ’, if Shi fu were to find the Â‘IÂ’ for you, then this Â‘IÂ’ is no longer special. Often we hear many people are intelligent, yet they canÂ’t even find the Â‘IÂ’, how can we say Â“My dadÂ”, Â“My sonÂ”, Â“My sonÂ’s wifeÂ”, Â“My valuable possessionsÂ”Â… everything is Â“MineÂ”, where exactly is Â“IÂ” then?<br><br>Here there is a layman who answered Â“IÂ” is the mind, then please, this layman find your mind and show everyone. In the past the 2nd Zen Patriarch went to find Patriarch Bodhidharma, saying Â“Venerable! My mind is in pain. Please pacify my mind.Â” Bodhidharma replied, Â“Show it to me and I will pacify it for you.Â” Shen Kuang said in amazement, Â“Cannot find the mind!Â” Actually everyone is very clever, if someone wishes to deceive us it is not easy, yet the whole life we are deceived by our Mind, yet we are not aware of it at all.<br><br>I see that to find the Â‘IÂ’ is very difficult for everyone, why not put it that way: Everyone has eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind consciousness Â– these are the Â“Six RootsÂ”. In relative to the Â“Six RootsÂ” are Sight, Sound, Odour, Taste, Touch, Â“Six DustÂ”. We say our eyes are the Â“Eye RootÂ”, seeing the colours are called Â“Six DustÂ”, the reason why know whether this is white, black, red etcÂ…. is because of Â“Eye ConsciousnessÂ”. We will be able to hear the sound of cars, the sound of speaking, the sound of the aeroplanes, the voice of singing, is because of Â“Ear-consciousnessÂ”, allowing us to differentiate, perceive so many sounds. Other than that, a single tongue, why is it able to know Sour, Sweet, Bitter, and Spicy, perceive so many tastes? It is because of Â“Tongue-consciousnessÂ”. Nose can smell so many kinds of odour, knowing perfumes are fragrant, excrement are foul-smelling; this is Â“Nose-consciousnessÂ”. Even if we close our eyes,<br>We can raise out our hands to touch, and therefore know that this is table, chair, microphone, clothes, etcÂ… this kind of using body to feel and perceive is called Â“Body-consciousnessÂ”. Also, when we close our eyes and think Â“What you say is very meaningful, what you said is right, your solution can work, and his sayings are meaninglessÂ…Â” This kind of pondering is called Â“Mind-consciousnessÂ”.<br><br>Other than the six consciousnesses said above Â– Eye-consciousness, Ear-consciousness, Nose-consciousness, Tongue-consciousness, Body-consciousness and Mind-consciousness, there is also a Seventh and Eighth consciousness. Seventh consciousness is Â“SelfÂ” Â– Â“False SelfÂ”, and is the master of this body. The eighth consciousness can be said to be our Warehouse, it can also be said to be a Videotape. For example we meet someone in America, our eyes see at once, the mind immediately forms an impression Â– I think I recognize this person! Oh! Yes yes yes! This is Mr Zhang, or Mr Wang. But, where have I met him before? This, I must think a while. When we finally remembered, this is when we take out our videotape from the Eighth consciousness and playing it.<br><br>Actually the Seventh Consciousness Â“False SelfÂ” is very strange! When our Six Roots (Six Sense Organ) are resting, it never rests; when our six roots are sleeping, it never sleeps; it wants to take out all the videotapes from the Eighth consciousness to watch. Yet this Â“False selfÂ” can function beyond our life, it can bring us to Heaven, it can also bring us to Hell. During the time of death, the Â“False SelfÂ” changes into a Transient-invisible-body (antarabhava; bardo). The Transient-invisible-body then goes into rebirth. We, the people who wishes to learn from the Buddha and cultivate, is to stop this Â“False SelfÂ”, not let it exist. Â“False SelfÂ” would ask our eyes to see bad things, it will also ask our mind to think of bad things, it would also ask our legs to do bad things, therefore Â“False SelfÂ” is not good at all to cultivation.<br><br>There are many methods of cultivation aimed at defeating Â“False SelfÂ”. The Zen sectÂ’s method is to do sitting meditation and koans, for example Â“striking seventh chÂ’anÂ”, is to keep sitting and not letting the Â“False SelfÂ” arise. This so-called Â“Strike SeventhÂ” is to strike down the Seventh Consciousness and not allowing the sentient-mind to arise. Chanting-Buddha dharma door is to chant Â“Amituofuo, AmituofuoÂ”, keep on chanting until the Seventh Consciousness ceases its function. There is a saying Â“Striking the (sentient) mind dead, the Dharmakaya (dharma body) livesÂ”, this is the meaning. If we cannot strike dead this Â“False SelfÂ”, then the Dharmakaya (dharma body) cannot live. Human Vehicle Buddhism advocates Â“Striking SeventhÂ” every moment, by ceasing the Seventh Consciousness, the Dharmakaya reveals itself; once the Dharmakaya lives, Â“True SelfÂ” will be produced. Actually Â“True SelfÂ” is only a name, if you think that Â“True SelfÂ” is really True Self, then that is wrong, it should be Â“No-Self is True SelfÂ”, that is True Self.</div>

All these sayings on no-self is only to start us on the path to practise, and helping us detaching from 'Self'.<br><br>You made a good point that thinking cannot be stopped by thinking. Once, a person was disturbed in his meditation and could not attain peace. He went to my Master and asked.... "how can I stop my thoughts"? My master replied "Don't care about it!"

So if it is uncomfortable ... moderator pls delete this post.<br><br>There is a state called in other religion 'the soul' and some newager call 'higher self'.  To me, it is the reflection of I AM... It is the potentiality of the Source/Pure awareness reflected ... that defines the purpose of its existence. It is a very high vibration state and is not easily accesssible.<br><br>This soul/higher self is the immediate originator of our thoughts. To me, it felt like the purpose of your incarnation is held there. In each incarnation, we come with a purpose... such as, to do certain things and to clear specific sets of karma... In another word, the ego (small 'I') is not the thinker of the thought. The 'ego' is one of the thoughts. The thinker/originator/designer of  our thoughts is soul.<br><br>My point is... we should not ignore or negate the needs of soul. .. that is the intention and purpose of your existence. It is possible to awake to the dharmakaya and yet do not feel the soul... This is what i have discovered.... I actually expereinced pure awareness first... before i experienced the purpose of soul/higher self... much later.<br><br>Actually the soul is a part of the dharmakaya... Dharmakaya is like full with invisible potentiality... 'rays of light '. Each ray when gets encased... start to see itself in the reflection. A face cannot see itself without a mirror. Dharmakaya get to understand itself and its ignorance through the reflected image... The face understand how it looks like/it is in the mirror.... Soul, to me, are individual reflections of specifics rays emanation of Dharamakaya. Therefore each soul is unique as each ray is different. And that's what make all of our personality... different from one another.<br><br>my 2 cents<br><br></div>

'No Attachment' is the characteristic of our nature.</span></span></span> All things - good or bad, beautiful or ugly - should be treated as void. Even in time of disputes and quarrels we should treat our intimates and our enemies alike and never think of retaliation. From thought to thought, let the past be dead. If we allow our thoughts, past, present, and future, to link up in a series, it is called confinement. If we never let our mind attach to anything from thought to thought, and there will be no confinement. This is why 'No Attachment' is taken as the fundamental principle. Good Friends, to free ourselves from all external forms is called 'No Form'. When we are in a position to do so, the nature of Dharma will be pure. This is why 'No Form' is taken as the basis.</div></blockquote>No thought, no form and no attachment is the quintessence of the Sutra. But it is not annihilation. It means to be detached from all thought, form and attachment.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Good Friends, to keep our mind free from defilement under all circumstances is called 'No Thought'. Our mind should stand aloof from circumstances, and allow no reaction to our mind from circumstances. <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But it is a great mistake to suppress our mind from all thinking; for even if we succeed in getting rid of all thoughts, and die immediately thereafter, still we shall be reincarnated elsewhere.</span></span></span> Mark this, treaders of the Path. It is bad enough for a man to commit blunders from not knowing the meaning of the Dharma, but how much worse would it be to encourage others to follow suit? Being deluded, he sees not and in addition he blasphemes the Buddhist Canon. Therefore 'No Thought' is taken as the object.<br><br>Good Friends, let me explain more fully why we take 'No Thought' as our object. It is because there is a type of man under delusion who boasts of the realization of the Self-nature; but being carried away by circumstances, ideas rise in his mind, followed by erroneous views that are the source of all sorts of false notions and defilements. In the Self-nature, there is intrinsically nothing to be attained. To say that there is attainment, and to talk thoughtlessly on merits or demerits are erroneous views and defilements. For this reason we take 'No Thought' as the object of our School.<br><br>Good Friends, what is that should be 'No'? What is that should be 'Thought'? <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">'No' means to have no dualistic and all defiling conceptions. 'Thought' means to fix our mind on the true nature of Tathata, for Tathata is the quintessence of thought, and thought is the result of the activity of Tathata.</span></span></span> It is the positive essence of Tathata - not the sense organs - which gives rise to 'thought'. Tathata bears its own attribute, and therefore it can give rise to 'thought'. Without Tathata the sense organs and the sense objects would perish immediately.<br><br>Good Friends, because it is the attribute of Tathata which gives rise to 'thought', our sense organs - in spite of their functioning in seeing, hearing, touching, knowing, etc. - need not be tainted or defiled in all circumstances, and our true nature may be 'self-manifested' all the time. Therefore the Sutra says, <span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"Even all Dharmas can be easily distinguished, the 'First Principle' is still immovable"</span></span></span></strong></blockquote>Here the patriarch taught us how to be away from our thought. This is difficult because it will take us many years to practice that. But after that, our thoughts would be vanished naturally. ThatÂ’s how Â‘No thoughtÂ’ can be accomplished. So it is not wise to suppress our mind from thinking, for whatever is suppressed will definitely strike back.<br><br>We still need to distinquish things in order to survive. The key to non-duality is to find our inner An-Hsiang first, and let An-Hsiang be the only response we have to all circumstances.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

So if it is uncomfortable ... moderator pls delete this post.<br><br>There is a state called in other religion 'the soul' and some newager call 'higher self'.  To me, it is the reflection of I AM... It is the potentiality of the Source/Pure awareness reflected ... that defines the purpose of its existence. It is a very high vibration state and is not easily accesssible.<br><br>This soul/higher self is the immediate originator of our thoughts. To me, it felt like the purpose of your incarnation is held there. In each incarnation, we come with a purpose... such as, to do certain things and to clear specific sets of karma... In another word, the ego (small 'I') is not the thinker of the thought. The 'ego' is one of the thoughts. The thinker/originator/designer of  our thoughts is soul.<br><br>My point is... we should not ignore or negate the needs of soul. .. that is the intention and purpose of your existence. It is possible to awake to the dharmakaya and yet do not feel the soul... This is what i have discovered.... I actually expereinced pure awareness first... before i experienced the purpose of soul/higher self... much later.<br><br>Actually the soul is a part of the dharmakaya... Dharmakaya is like full with invisible potentiality... 'rays of light '. Each ray when gets encased... start to see itself in the reflection. A face cannot see itself without a mirror. Dharmakaya get to understand itself and its ignorance through the reflected image... The face understand how it looks like/it is in the mirror.... Soul, to me, are individual reflections of specifics rays emanation of Dharamakaya. Therefore each soul is unique as each ray is different. And that's what make all of our personality... different from one another.<br><br>my 2 cents<br><br></div></blockquote>Hmm interesting, but I can't verify it myself. Maybe namelessness knows this better.<br><br>We are reborned with a purpose..? I think Bodhisattvas, Buddhas, certainly. Highly cultivated practitioners can choose where they want to be borned, and what they wish to do in their next life even before they are borned.<br><br>Normal beings however... once they die, their seventh consciousness transforms them to the bardo state and will have to seek rebirth according to their karma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a point which I would like to make because I think it is quite important on cultivation. I am reminded of this because I heard a passage from a dharma talk by my dharma teacher on casette about dualistic defilements yesterday.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All things - good or bad, beautiful or ugly - should be treated as void. Even in time of disputes and quarrels we should treat our intimates and our enemies alike and never think of retaliation.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Good Friends, to keep our mind free from defilement under all circumstances is called 'No Thought'.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Good Friends, what is that should be 'No'? What is that should be 'Thought'? 'No' means to have no dualistic and all defiling conceptions. 'Thought' means to fix our mind on the true nature of Tathata, for Tathata is the quintessence of thought, and thought is the result of the activity of Tathata.</span><br><br>No Defilement is very important for practise. And sometimes defilements are very subtle - you do not realise it because the things you depend on is still there. For example, you have become attached to your kind of lifestyle. Then when someone asks you to live in the jungles, you hated it. That is also defilements.<br><br>Therefore we should constantly be mindful of mind, speech, action, not slacking it in any way of giving in to sentient thoughts. And the only way is to be Aware.

IT JUST IS. and thus good, bad, moral, whatever has no meaning for it. Pure awareness is everything and therefore cannot exclude anything... it is wise, ignorance and ALL.<br><br>Just a sharing... nothing personal and i have a great respect for Namelessness.</div>
