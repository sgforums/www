              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Understanding
              the wisdom of the great Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna with the help of three
              pivotal Western thinkers</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              fundamental insight of what is known as the “linguistic turn” in
              twentieth-century Western thought is that language shapes our experience. Some
              of the most influential modern thinkers challenge our usual assumption that
              using language is merely a matter of attaching names to things that already
              exist in the world. In a very important sense, language creates the world as we
              know it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              realization challenges our everyday sense of things. We usually think of
              language (when we think of it at all) as something “transparent” or as being
              like a mirror, reflecting things as they really are. But language does not
              simply reflect the world; in fact, it largely determines what we notice and
              what we do not. In coming to a greater understanding of how language affects
              the ways we experience the world, and ourselves, Western thought is now able,
              as well, to gain a better understanding of the great Buddhist dialectician
              Nagarjuna, whose work is generally considered the most important, and the most
              difficult, in all of Buddhist philosophy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Considered
              by many to be, after the Buddha himself, the single most important figure in
              Buddhist tradition, Nagarjuna, sometimes called the Second Buddha, is said to
              have lived in India in the late second century C.E. His writings form the basis
              for the Madhyamaka, or “Middle Way,” school of thought and are hugely
              influential in the development of Mahayana Buddhism. For Nagarjuna, the world
              as we commonly experience it is a linguistic construct. He employs a method of
              rigorous analysis–using language to remove the delusions created by
              language–which reveals that the commonsense categories through which we divide
              up the world are inconsistent and self-contradictory. He does not try to
              replace one set of concepts with another, for it is precisely in the letting go
              of all views that wisdom and peace are attained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              order to make sense of the world, we divide it up in various ways. One basic
              way we do this is to make a distinction between a thing and what that thing
              does: “The man went for a walk.” Another important distinction is between a
              thing and its attributes: “The man was tall.” Nagarjuna focuses on precisely
              these distinctions, because they play an important role in causing what
              Buddhists call dukkha, or suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">One
              of the first things labelled, and the most existentially troublesome, is
              myself. When we are born, we are given a name, and as we grow up we learn to
              think of ourselves as things that “self-exist” like the other things that we
              learn how to name. In this way “I” gain a sense of permanent identity that
              persists through the various activities I do. But we also can’t help noticing
              that objects are impermanent. They originate and eventually disappear. This is
              bad news for my own identity, caught as it is in the tragic incompatibility
              between my sense of self as something unchanging and the awareness of the
              inevitable fate that awaits it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              the life story of the Buddha reveals, the Buddhist path was inspired by this
              very problem, and it offers us a way to resolve it. Language is intimately
              involved in this transformation, because it is with language that the world is
              divided up and our sense of self constructed. Nagarjuna deconstructs our
              unexamined belief in the reifications of language by revealing the
              contradictions that plague it. Awakening involves realizing that linguistic
              categories (including the “I”) do not refer to real things but are empty
              constructs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Given
              Western philosophy’s turn toward examining the role of language in shaping
              experience, can one find in it, as in Buddhism, an acknowledgment of the
              possibility of profound spiritual liberation? Well, not quite, but there are
              some intriguing similarities. Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the first Western
              thinkers to emphasize the deceptive workings of language. In Human, All Too
              Human, published in 1878, he wrote: “Through words and concepts we are
              continually misled into imagining things as being simpler than they are,
              separate from one another, indivisible, each existing in and for itself. A
              philosophical mythology lies concealed in language that breaks out again every
              moment, however careful one may be otherwise.” Like Nagarjuna, Nietzsche
              realized what this implies about the self: “The ‘subject’ is not something
              given, it is something added and invented and projected behind what there is.”
              For Nietzsche, the human being is something “unfinished,” mired in
              self-delusion, unconscious drives, and moral resentment. But one can, by rising
              above these and giving creative expression to one’s character, experience the
              freedom of theÜbermensch (“overman” or “superman”) that we can become and
              should become.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Austrian thinker Ludwig Wittgenstein, who became the most important figure in
              twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy, critiqued ways of thinking that
              try to explain the world abstractly. By letting go of “nonsensical”
              metaphysical explanations–including the metaphysics built into our ordinary use
              of language–we might, he said, come to experience the world in a more deeply
              spiritual way and with a greater appreciation of its mystery.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Wittgenstein’s
              early philosophy was very different from his later approach. In the beginning,
              his work was more technical and concerned with delimiting what can–and
              cannot–be expressed in words. Like Nagarjuna, Wittgenstein used language to
              point out the limitations of language. “My propositions,” he writes in the
              Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1921), “are clarifying in this way: he who
              understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out
              through them, on them, over them. (He must, so to speak, throw away the ladder
              after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he
              sees the world rightly.” What do we then see? The Tractatus concludes with
              reflections that are more mystical than logical. “If by eternity is understood
              not endless temporal duration but timelessness, then he lives eternally who
              lives in the present. . . . Not how the world is, is the mystical, but that it
              is. . . . The solution of the problem of life is seen in the vanishing of this
              problem.” Letting go of abstract ways of thinking, he is telling us, opens one
              up to appreciating the mystery of life in a fresh way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              his later work, Wittgenstein’s style is more dialectical. It becomes difficult
              to distinguish his own view from the views he is criticizing, and the
              conflicting voices may actually cancel each other out–a technique Nagarjuna
              typically employed in his own writings. Instead of offering us any fixed
              philosophical position, Wittgenstein analyzes some of the various
              “language-games” we play, demonstrating that language does not simply represent
              an objective world. When we think that language merely expresses facts, and
              that every meaningful expression must be referring to some thing in the world,
              we become trapped in and by the concepts we use. It is necessary, he tells us,
              to “battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Like
              Nagarjuna and Nietzsche, Wittgenstein was especially concerned to challenge the
              dualism between subject and object. All three thinkers agree that the duality
              between a self “inside” and the world “outside” is a delusion. When we observe
              carefully how words like “I” actually function, we realize that the sense of a
              separate self is, as Wittgenstein put it, only “a shadow cast by grammar.”
              Wittgenstein described his philosophical therapy as trying to “show the fly how
              to get out of the fly bottle.” But beyond this and other similarly enigmatic
              statements, Wittgenstein, who was himself a deeply religious man, was not very
              clear about what kind of liberation his approach was meant to lead to and what
              sort of life this might entail.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Today
              the thinker most often compared to Nagarjuna is the French philosopher Jacques
              Derrida, who died in 2004. Although his way of doing philosophy, known as
              deconstruction, became notorious for its difficulty, his basic approach also
              has remarkable similarities to Nagarjuna’s. Like Nagarjuna and Wittgenstein,
              Derrida is not interested in defending any philosophical position of his own
              but instead is concerned with showing the limits of language and the
              difficulties we fall into when we overstep them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Derrida’s
              work builds on structuralism, which argues that words do not have meaning in
              and of themselves. The meaning of any linguistic expression always depends upon
              some other expression, and that “other expression” is also dependent on
              something else. Meaning is therefore relative and always in flux, part of a
              chain of reference that never comes to an end. Whatever we think we understand
              right here and now always presupposes something else that is not present.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              simple example is thinking that gets caught in antithetical concepts: success
              and failure, good and evil, and so forth. We distinguish between such opposing
              terms because we want one rather than the other, yet the meaning of each
              depends on the other. If it is important for me to live a pure life (however I
              understand purity), then I will also be preoccupied with impurity–that is, with
              avoiding it. We cannot feel that we are good unless we are fighting against
              some evil–ironically, often creating more evil in the process. In his close
              reading of texts, Derrida shows how philosophical claims usually involve
              excluding some meaning that returns in such ways to unsettle the intended meaning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Derrida’s
              term to describe the relativity and “indeterminability” of meaning is
              différance, and the way différance functions in his philosophy can be compared
              to how Nagarjuna uses shunyata, or emptiness. Derrida emphasizes that
              différance does not refer to some specific thing. It is merely a conceptual
              tool useful for describing how conceptual meaning is never quite settled, but
              always “deferred.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">For
              Nagarjuna, shunyata is simply a shorthand way to express the interdependence of
              all things. Nothing has any “self-existence” or “self-presence” because
              everything–including all concepts–is dependent upon everything else. Shunyata
              is “the exhaustion of all theories and views.” Making it into a metaphysical
              theory is like grasping a snake by the wrong end–look out! Nagarjuna emphasizes
              that the meaning of shunyata itself is relative: having used it to let go of
              other concepts, we should let go of shunyata too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thanks
              to modern Western philosophers such as Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, and Derrida,
              are we in the West finally able to grasp the meaning of Nagarjuna’s philosophy?
              The question is ironic. What would it mean to “grasp” his meaning? The point of
              Nagarjuna’s approach is not to grasp something but to let go of delusive ways
              of thinking. The important question then becomes: do Nietzsche, Wittgenstein,
              and Derrida also help to liberate us from such problematic ways of thinking?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Since
              the West’s discovery of Buddhism over two centuries ago, our appreciation of
              Nagarjuna’s thought has been dependent on the development of Western philosophy
              itself, and clearly the linguistic revolution in contemporary Western thought
              enables us to appreciate better his critique of the delusions built into
              ordinary language. Yet perhaps so much talk of “the West”–implying as it does a
              sharp distinction from “the East”–is too dualistic, and also out of step with
              the realities of life on a shrinking planet in which ideas circulate wider and
              faster than ever before. Perhaps the distinction between Western and Asian
              philosophy is running its course. When it does, perhaps then we will realize
              that Nagarjuna belongs not only to Buddhist Asia; he belongs to us all.</span></p>
