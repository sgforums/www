              Good evening dudes and dudettes, I am not a buddhist, some consider me atheist, some consider me deist. Im not sure myself and i am seeking the answer.
              
              In my quest for knowledge, i have already dismissed christianity and islam as mere false religions, as conversations with their religious leaders on forums can only lead nowhere, due to them avoiding questions or answering in a roundabout and vague way.
              
              Buddhism catches my attention as it is a peaceful religion, where killing is almost impossible, or impossible to justify. Whereas in other religions, "In the name of God" blah blah, people commit atrocities.
              
              The abrahamic religions, (i've not sure abt judaism, as i have not studied it) are detrimental to our rational mind, they are anti-intellectual and force unnecessary restrictions on us, brainwash us to pester others into joining for salvation. (referring to those who don't practice religion in moderation, yet in a way, those who practice in moderation are "wrong" in the context of their religion) But i believe even in moderation, such religions provide a breeding ground for bad idealogy.
              
              I don't think there are any cases of buddhists who go crazy just like the people i mentioned above, and with regards to christianity being speculated to be the second largest religion in singapore after buddhism, im abit worried for our future.
              
              I would like to have a better understanding on the basics of buddhism, and are there any claims which contradict scientific findings.
              
              I ask for the comparison, with skepticism on both the teachings as well as the findings.
              
              btw, a quick search on google did not answer my question, so i hope some masters here have the ability to.

              <p>Welcome to the forum. First of all I don't think there are Buddhist monks or masters here, but still I think some of us might be able to answer the doubts and questions you have.</p>
              <p>You can refer to <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/basic-guide.htm</a> for a basic understanding of the teachings of Buddhism.

                                                                                              fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough

              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p>There's another quote attributed to Albert Einstein,</p>
              <p><em><br> Â“The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should
                                                                                              transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering
                                                                                              both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a

                                                                                              and spiritual, as a meaningful unity. Buddhism answers this
                                                                                              description.Â”<br><br><strong>Albert Einstein</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hence, as being said here, Buddhism differs from many other religions because of Buddha's rejection of the theory of a personal Creator. Instead he taught how everything in our experience is dependently originated, inseparable from the manifold of conditions. He taught us the deepest insights into the nature of reality that can put an end to all our sufferings and attain the highest bliss and liberation.</p>
              <p>Everything that the Buddha taught stems not from theory but from his realisation and observation -- and he taught that whatever he realised, we too, can realise for ourselves (which many did, even today) -- if he can attain enlightenment and liberation, everyone too can realise that (and there are no lack of people who achieves enlightenment and liberation, even today, even in this forum but not me). Our Buddha-nature is already complete, but temporarily obscured like clouds (representing our delusion, ignorance) obscuring the sun (the ever-present shining pure awareness which is our buddha-nature) -- even though it is already present. Buddha teaches us to awaken to that awakeness ourselves.</p>
              <p>Buddhism does not teach anything that contradicts scientific findings, on the other hand many things that were taught long ago has only been found out recently. In some ways it is a form of advanced psychology, and also transpersonal psychology. So far nobody has developed such a successful 'program' as by Buddha that allows us to achieve deep insights into the nature of ourselves and the universe (which are not separated), gain clarity and awareness, and allows us to experience the profound bliss and liberation of nirvana.</p>
              <p>There are also aspects that as Buddhist practitioners we know are true, but may not yet be recognised by the majority -- even though there are evidence supporting them.</p>
              <p>For example, 'rebirth' is one of them. We know (through experience) that consciousness, especially sensory awareness, though inter-related with the body, our mind is not 'created' or 'caused' by the material body. This also explains why there are innumerable out-of-body experiences and near-death experiences reported by subjects who 'flew' out of their body, witnessed their body from a distance, and can even describe the exact medical procedures that took place during their supposed 'unconsciousness'. Many such experiences have been described by meditators (it is a common side-effect phenomenon, even this is not a goal of our practice)</p>
              <p>In Buddhism consciousness, not caused by body, is not limited to the death of the body and that process of consciousness is re-born according to conditions again to another life. Many Buddhists, including some in this forum, have clear memories of their past lives through meditation practice.</p>
              <p>It should be noted that the Buddhist view of consciousness is not the same as some other religions such as Hinduism -- we do not view Consciousness as an atomistic 'self' or 'soul', or an entity that passes on and 'reincarnates' into another body -- nothing like that.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism, there is no 'self'. Consciousness is a process that is dependently originated -- according to conditions, it arises, and it ceases... and it arises again. Like there is no permanent, fixed, unchanging self -- but Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, arising and ceasing according to various conditions (such as karmic conditions and more)... and it ceases as it arises, momentarily. No-self and impermanence is the nature of all our experiences (made of the five sensory awareness + thoughts), which are all changing forms of consciousness.</p>
              <p>With regards to teachings on rebirth, there might be questions such as... is this scientifically acceptable? I would certainly say yes because there are much scientific research being done.</p>

                                      James' mother, Andrea Leininger, by telephone from their Louisiana
                                      home.<br> <br> Lots of kids love airplanes, but James' story is unique. He has
                                      memories of being a World War II fighter pilot from Uniontown --
                                      Lt. James McCready Huston, shot down near Iwo Jima in 1945.<br> <br> At 18 months old, his father, Bruce Leininger, took James to the
                                      Kavanaugh Flight Museum in Dallas, Texas, where the toddler
                                      remained transfixed by World War II aircraft.<br> <br> A few months later, the nightmares began.<br> <br> "They were terrible, terrible," Andrea said. "He would scream,
                                      'airplane crash, on fire, little man can't get out!' He'd be
                                      kicking, with his hands pointing up at the ceiling."<br> <br> When James was 2 1/2 years old, he and Andrea were shopping and he
                                      wanted a toy airplane. "I said to him, 'Look, it has a bomb on the
                                      bottom' and he told me, 'That's not a bomb, it's a drop tank.' I
                                      had no idea what a drop tank was."<br> <br> Neither of the Leiningers have ever served in the military, nor are
                                      they involved with aviation. Until James began showing an interest
                                      in planes, they had nothing aviation-related in their home.<br> <br> Andrea's mother sent her a book by Pennsylvania author Carol
                                      Bowman, called "Children's Past Lives." The Leiningers started
                                      using Bowman's techniques of affirming James' nightmares and
                                      assuring him that the experiences happened to a different person,
                                      not the person he was now. "It helped. The nightmares stopped
                                      almost immediately,"; Andrea said.<br> <br> However, the memories did not stop, but they do not come up all the

                                      recalled. "I asked what happened to your plane? 'Got shot,' he
                                      said. Where? 'Engine.' Where did it crash? 'Water.' When I asked
                                      him who shot the plane, he gave me a look like a teenager, rolling
                                      his eyes, 'the Japanese,' like who else could it have been?<br> <br> "What little kid knows about the Japanese," she asked. "He said he
                                      knew it was a Japanese plane because of the red sun. My husband and
                                      I were shell-shocked."<br> <br> James provided other information. He said his earlier name was
                                      James, he flew a Corsair and took off on a boat called the Natoma,
                                      and he remembered a fellow flyer named Jack Larson.<br> <br> Foods can set James' memories off, too.<br> <br> "I hadn't made meatloaf in 10 years, so James had never had it,"
                                      Andrea said. "When he sat down, he said, 'Meatloaf! I haven't had
                                      that since I was on the Natoma.' When we were getting ice cream one
                                      day, he told me that they could have ice cream every day on the
                                      Natoma."<br> <br> Bruce began researching his son's memories and discovered a small
                                      escort carrier called the Natoma Bay, which was present at the
                                      Battle of Iwo Jima. Twenty-one of its crew perished. Bruce also
                                      discovered that only one of the Natoma's crew was named James,
                                      James Huston.<br> <br> James Huston's plane was hit in the engine by Japanese fire on
                                      March 3, 1945, went down in flames and sank immediately. Flyer Jack
                                      Larson witnessed the crash.</p>
              <p>(continued from previous post)<br> <br> James Huston was born Oct. 22, 1923, in South Bend, Ind., and lived
                                      in Uniontown during the 1930s. His father was James McCready Huston
                                      Sr., of Brownsville, and Daryl Green Huston, who was born in New
                                      Geneva and grew up in Uniontown. James was the only son.<br> <br> According to Lt. Huston's cousin, Bob Huston of Flatwoods, the
                                      elder Huston started several newspapers and published 13 books. He
                                      was living in Brownsville when two Navy officers informed Huston of
                                      his son's death.<br> <br> "I didn't know James," Bob Huston said. His parents were divorced,
                                      "but I knew his father. He stayed with us in Brownsville. James was
                                      on his 50th mission and would have come home if he'd lived another
                                      five minutes."<br> <br> The Leiningers have been in touch with Bob Huston.<br> <br> "I knew what happened to James (Huston)," he said. "I was excited
                                      to hear from them (the Leiningers). The boy's mother was
                                      flabbergasted when all this happened."<br> <br> Andrea believes that her son is the reincarnation of Lt. James
                                      Huston. "There are so many little things. I believe in
                                      reincarnation now."<br> <br> Her husband, Bruce, remains skeptical. "He started researching to
                                      disprove what James was telling us, and ended up proving it all,"
                                      he said. "I think he believes that James Huston's spirit has
                                      manifested itself in our son somehow."<br> <br> The Leiningers have been in touch with Natoma Bay veterans,
                                      too.<br> <br> "We didn't tell the veterans for a long time," Andrea said, "but
                                      everyone has a story about having had a spirit visit them. James'
                                      sister, Anne Barron, was in California talking to him the day he
                                      was killed. Anne believes James' story, because he has provided so
                                      much information that only her brother could have known.<br> <br> "Families of the 21 men who were killed are talking to each other,"
                                      continued Andrea. "It's brought them together."<br> <br> The Leiningers plan to attend this year's Natoma Bay reunion and
                                      bring their son, James.<br> <br> Andrea doesn't know why this has happened.<br> <br> "If he did come back, why? Maybe it was so my husband could write
                                      the book about the Natoma Bay," she said. "It helped turn the tide
                                      of the war in the Pacific and was one of the most highly decorated
                                      carriers, but it hasn't received much recognition.";<br> <br> She said her husband has been working on a chronology of what's
                                      happened to James and is researching the book. "He has flight plans
                                      from the missions and has spent a year and a half on research. In
                                      the introduction, he's writing about how he found out about the
                                      ship."<br> <br> That discovery, through a toddler's fascination with airplanes and
                                      nightmares, has led to a segment on national television.<br> <br> ABC contacted Carol Bowman about her work on children's past lives
                                      and James Leininger's experience was the most verifiable, Andrea
                                      said. "And we agreed to share his story."<br> <br> Chris Cuomo will host the segment, which airs tonight at 10.<br> <br> Judy Kroeger can be reached at jkroeger@tribweb.com or (724)

              <blockquote>
              <p>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><br>Slightly edited from the first topic in our forum regarding Creationism: <a rel="nofollow" href="/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185">How the Brahma believed He was God?</a><br><br>In
              
              Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one popular one
              was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays.
              Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the
              All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the
              Chief of All".<br><br>In
              Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the first
              plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above where
              he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, transcending and liberation from the 8 Jhanic
              planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the devas
              below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God. Buddha
              did not subscribe to the belief of such a notion that the Universe and
              its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the
              Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer. Eventually he
              has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br><br>The Buddha was also known to have said this,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create?<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span><br><br>When
              
              the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was formed, the
              Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent brahmas/devas were
              to be reborn.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'On
              
              this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: "
              I am Brahmà, the Great Brahmà, the Supreme One, the Mighty, the
              All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the
              Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the
              Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my
              creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they
              might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1
              2:5</span><br><br>In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br><br>The
              
              Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the
              first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of
              Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that
              although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he
              cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of
              cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can
              use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a
              short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br><br>from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When
              
              he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who speaks of
              the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the human world with
              the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability
              to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be
              the creator of the human race and all things in the universe, is this a
              fact?"<br><br>The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br><br>Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br><br>The
              
              king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life and nobody
              welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha
              
              asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create
              sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he
              replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha
              asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that he created
              them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the universe and
              all things in it, and certainly not the human race. The king of heavens
              was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as
              his teacher and invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.</span></p>

              <h4>The question is whether or not the view of <em>pratityasamutpada</em> <em>(Dependent Origination)</em>,
                                the General Theory I am discussing, infers a final cause, or source,
                                either logically or temporally, or both, from which emerge all
                                phenomena. If the General Theory does infer this, then rendering the
                                General Theory with the term “dependent” would be accurate. I say this
                                because in the monotheistic traditions, as well as in the platonic
                                traditions, all things exist dependently; but what the monotheistic
                                tradition means by this is that all things exist by the grace of an
                                ultimate source, and that source is God.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>On
              the other hand, if the General Theory does not infer such a final
              source or ground, then I need to ask the location of that which brings
              forth the appearances of this world. When I contemplate the General
              Theory I do not observe any inference for a final cause or source of
              existing things, and to which existing things return. The General
              Theory simply points to other things as the source for any particular
              thing. “When this exists, that comes to be,” draws our attention to
              other existing things. Once again, I see no reason, given the General
              Theory, to infer that the Buddha meant to imply the existence of a
              final source.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>In
              addition, there exist very good historical reasons for rejecting the
              idea, in a Buddhist context, for an ultimate source interpretation of
              the General Theory. For example, Buddhism never developed a creation
              myth or story. Instead, Buddhism frequently refers to existence as
              beginningless and endless. This lack of a creation mythos, from the
              perspective of the various monotheisms, is quite distinctive. But this
              lack of a creation mythos in Buddhism is consistent with the view of
              the General Theory; I think I can infer that the lack of a creation
              mythos in Buddhism is directly derived from the central role of the
              General Theory.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <h4>The
                                lack of a creation mythos in Buddhism reflects the General Theory’s
                                focus on the appearance of things due to the existence of other things.
                                Those other things, in turn, exist due to the appearance of other
                                things, which are also existing due to other things, etc. This
                                generates an infinite regress, which is logically self-referentially
                                consistent, and has no beginning and no end. Notice also that the
                                General Theory does not require the intercession of an ouside agency in
                                order for this river of relationships to begin. Because the Buddha
                                considered the General Theory as an elucidation of the very nature of
                                things and existence as such, no special catalyst for this onward
                                flowing is necessary. The location, therefore, of the source for the
                                appearance of things is simply other things, spread out over all of
                                existence, both in time and in space. In some of the ancient Indian
                                exegeses they refer to this as “unlocated nirvana”; <em>unlocated</em> because this ultimate nature does not confine itself to any particular
              thing or corner of existence, <em>nirvana</em> because it is precisely this ultimate nature and its realization which
              brings about the peace of the cessation of all sorrow.</h4>

              <p>Therefore
                                in Buddhism, these kind of speculations about a Creator is useless.
                                Instead, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged the Buddhist
                                practitioners to find out for themselves the truths that the Buddha
                                said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get
                                enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind belief and dogmas
                                (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages analytical questioning --
                                whether this teaching actually helps us. If it does, then we should put
                                it to practice.</p>
              <p>When
                                we truly realise the truth of Dependent Origination, the question of
                                Creator/Creation will no longer arise, because we understood the
                                principle in which everything arises and pass away -- which is by
                                conditioned 'genesis'. By realising the nature of reality (empty of
                                self and phenomena, dependent arising) we will also be liberated from
                                all sufferings of samsara and the cycle of rebirth.</p>

              Hmm, thats a big chunk of information to digest.
              
              After reading about rebirth, these thoughts came to mind:
              
              1) Do humans always rebirth as humans?
              2) What about animals? Can they rebirth?

              <p>Hmm, thats a big chunk of information to digest.</p>
              <p>After reading about rebirth, these thoughts came to mind:</p>
              <p>1) Do humans always rebirth as humans?<br> 2) What about animals? Can they rebirth?<br> 3) Can one life form, after rebirth, appear as another life form?
                          (bacteria =&gt; chicken maybe)?</p>

              <p>Take your time to read them... hehe...</p>
              <p>1) No, it is possible to reborn in other realms according to conditions, specifically karmic conditions. There are 6 realms in general (which are then split up into more categories such as the 31 planes of existence) -- hell, ghost, animal (three lower realms) and human, asuras, celestial beings/heaven (three higher realms).</p>
              <p>2) Yes they are also reborn and are fully conscious beings. So we should have compassion for them and not treat as 'soulless creatures' -- actually we are all 'soulless' (no atman, atomistic self, as explained earlier) but we are 'conscious' and can feel pain, have feelings and emotions, etc.</p>
              <p>3) Bacteria and viruses are mostly unconscious beings and do not take rebirth. Being made up single or few cells, they do not have the complicated mechanism/ability to have conscious cognition and intellect, and hence it is OK to take your medicine or antibiotics. They are purely biological functionings, and are without minds.</p>
              <p>But to answer your question -- different realm beings can end up in another realm after life.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>One more thing - it should be noted that in Buddhism, we do not treat any realm as permanent/eternal. We do not believe in eternal hell or eternal paradise, even though their lifespan in these realms are very long. Eventually they will be reborn again. Hence, even heaven is not ultimate in Buddhism. We do not seek for rebirth in heaven but complete enlightenment and liberation.</p></div>
