This means that everybody is Enlightened to a more or less degree. Buddha would not have said: I am no longer the person you previously knew.<br><br>I much prefer to think that after enlightenment, one moves towards Buddhahood.<br><br>So it is a one time sudden awakening then gradual path to greater and greater evolution. It is like without becoming human and remaining an ape; it is totally impossible, no matter how much time you spend with the ape, for it to become more and more human.<br><br>The wisdom is the wisdom that enables the enlightened person to grow.<br><br>I do not know what is Dharmakaya.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>then this should be posted here:<br><br>SUDDEN OR GRADUAL ENLIGHTENMENT?<br>by Rev.Vajra Karuna<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/awakening101/sudgrad2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/awakening101/sudgrad2.html </a><br><br>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Sudden Enlightenment may come to one, but unless he or she is prepared to recognize it, and even more importantly to integrate it into his or her everyday psychological being, it will almost certainly come only to slip away.<br><br>Neither the Gradualist nor the Suddenist approach can guarantee Enlightenment, but each in their own way can give one a chance at gaining it. For the person who can commit him or herself to a fully monastic life the Gradual way may offer more hope than the Sudden way. For those who can not make such a dramatic commitment it may be the Sudden way that offers the hope. Like all religious and philosophical views various rational arguments can be made to support either a Gradualist or Suddenist approach, but the bottom line is that neither can be logically proven nor disproven. Both, in the final analysis, depend largely upon faith. Indeed, all schools of Buddhism, if not all religious traditions, require a strong faith component before any real Spiritual Awakening can occur.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Following the counsel of Devadatta, an evil friend, he arrested his father, King Bimbisara, and confined him in a cell surrounded by walls seven layers deep, forbidding any officials or ministers from going there. The queen, whose name was Vaidehi, remained loyal to the king. Purifying herself by bathing, she anointed her body with an ointment of cream and honey mixed with wheat flour, and filled her ornaments with grape juice. She then offered them to the king in secret. ---The Sutra of Visualization of the Buddha of Infinite Life as Expounded by Shakyamuni Buddha</blockquote><a href="http://www.cloudwater.org/visualization.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cloudwater.org/visualization.html</a><br><br>----<br>and in Lotus sutra:<br><br><blockquote>Later Ajatasatru, who was also at first an enemy of the Buddha, became a disciple and generously contributed to the Sangha. In the Sutras he was said to have learned the confession and attained the enduring gentleness from Manjusri. Having committed what is among the most grave of the premeditated sins, he should have fallen into the Avici (Interminable) Hell but instead he only entered the Pindala Hell (a relatively painless purgatory) from which he was quickly released, later to enter into the Buddha Realm as the Bodhisattva Steadfast and receive his prophecy of future enlightenment.</blockquote><a href="http://www.tientai.net/lit/LS/LS1/LS1audience7ajase.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tientai.net/lit/LS/LS1/LS1audience7ajase.htm</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

And as my Master said, and many other Zen masters said, we Not only need doubt, as small doubt can only produce small realisations, but GREAT DOUBT (of intense questioning) will produce Great Enlightenment. By great doubt, a person persistantly inquires on his Koan until he reaches breakthrough. 'Great Faith, Great Doubt, Great Determination' are three needs of zen practise.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www2.bc.cc.ca.us/resperic/science_and_spirituality.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www2.bc.cc.ca.us/resperic/science_and_spirituality.htm</a><br><br>Â“Great faithÂ” in Zen practice refers to a trust in the process, as demonstrated by the many who have gone on before, as well as a firm trust in oneÂ’s capabilities to see the essential nature of reality for oneself.   In scientific work, Â“great faithÂ” refers to a trust in the scientific method, successfully applied by scientists of the past, as well as an underlying belief in oneÂ’s inherent capability to understand the phenomena being studied.<br><br>Â“Great doubtÂ” in Zen refers to a willingness to profoundly question all of oneÂ’s most cherished beliefs, and ultimately to uproot them.  Beliefs are but concepts, floating on the surface.  The conceptual realm may be useful at times, but compulsive attachment to particular concepts is a hindrance to penetrating to deeper levels of realization of the fundamental nature of reality, which is beyond all concepts.  An ancient Chinese saying states that when a wise man points his finger to the moon, the fool sees only his finger.  In science, Â“great doubtÂ” is based on a realization that the model is not the reality.  Being too attached to a particular hypothesis or theory can prevent one from arriving at a better theory that reflects a deeper understanding of the phenomena of interest.<br><br>Â“Great determinationÂ” in Zen is required in order to not give in to laziness.  The process may take some time, and without determination one may never attain deep realization.  In fact, there is no deepest realization, and only by great determination will one keep going deeper.  Of course the same can be said of scientific research.</blockquote><strong>A.H.Almaas: "Well the first thing about inquiry, is to recognise that we don't know basic things about ourselves and reality. To have the humility to NOT KNOW. And also to have the courage. It's very scary to say 'I don't know who I am; what I am', or to know what is going on now. First that's the opening is the humility to acknowledge we don't know. In science they call it doubt or scepticism. But here it is not really doubt or scepticism. The doubt and scepticism turns into an emotional thing. What here is just an openness. 'I don't really know'. After that, is the love to find out. The heart-felt appreciation of 'What is the truth of us? What I am? What am I? What is humanity? What is reality? What is God?', from a loving and also curious place. So that's the general inquiry about knowing about spiritual nature. There are many things that will help us - steadfastness; courageous; an openness and curiosity that brings in questions."</strong></div>
