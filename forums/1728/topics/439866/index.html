              <p>our take according to Mahayana is that arahat(not "maha"-Arahat) indeed severed affflictions and attachment, but still have the habits of attachment/higher form of greed. <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px; ">pacceka Buddha on the other hand had no more </span>habits of attachment, but still have dualism/higher form of hatred. then bodhisttvas go on to sever dualism, but still have dualism habits.  if there's no more dualism habits, then he's a buddha, within the ten realm, not full Buddha yet, he still have wandering thoughts/higher form of folly. if no more wandering thoughts then he's a real Full Buddha.  but this also need a standard 3 great Asankhyeya kalpas. the time is also to collect merits and omniscience. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">hmm, though it's imho, but still quite insulting. drunk is not knowing what they are doing. and similarly like taking drug/intoxication is being high, also not knowing what they are doing. Buddhism have preventive precepts against drinking/intoxication.</p>

              yes they still have habitual spontaneous "reaction" of the greed that maybe due to so long period in the past become sort of uncontrollable. the mind really no greed, and they CAN end samsara of the six realm.  but the body sometimes can act out of a sudden without the intention of doing. for example i saw an monk preaching the dharma, then a mosquito flew on his face and the monk just hit it away. actually, he had not intention of hitting it away, but it just happen too fast and the hand just automatically reacted. that automatic reaction is the "habit" that had been accumulated during his previous lifes. to stopped it all of a sudden is not so possible. u need some time.

              <p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande',tahoma,verdana,arial,sans-serif; color: #333333;"> in PL school, Amitabha just achieved Buddhahood 10 great kalpa ago.
              and those achieved Buddhahood within this period in PL are
              innumberable, more than half the populations in PL, so can rough
              average 5,6,7 kalpa to achieved Buddhahood, which is inconcievable
              comparing to 3 great asankhyeya kalpas.</span></p>

              <p>i notice two of such cases, one from a popular great Mahayana master and one from a great Varjayana master. bodhisattva stage also around there. 
                      pacceka Buddha should not have such reactions. perhaps he use to met Buddha in previous life, and cannot attained enlighten then, so this life become pacceka Buddha.  such habitual reactions can be ended. it's different from walking mechanism. it's got to do with negative karma vs neutral karma. as the hitting a mosquito is a killing negative karma.</p>
              <p>Mahayana got 6 samsaric realms, and above it, got 4 noble realms.  6 samsaric realms is å†…å‡¡(inside ordinary), 4 noble realms is å¤–å‡¡(outside  ordinary). 4 noble realms also need to escape.</p>

              <p>First of all, whether or not he realized 
                                  what the Buddha realized, perhaps it is best to respect whatever he has 
                                  to offer rather than make sarcastic remarks about it - asking or 
                                  questioning his claims is ok as I do that sometimes myself, but just try
                                   to be respectful. Since his advices are coming from genuine intentions,
                                   experience and insights. If he made a mistake comparing his experience 
                                  and insight with Buddha (which is far more common than you think) - it 
                                  is because there is a lack of understanding that there are <strong>different levels of insights and enlightenment is not just a one-stage, final event sort of thing. </strong>There
                                   is a lack of understanding the difference between I AM and Non-dual 
                                  awareness, non-dual with anatta, anatta with emptiness/d.o., Advaita 
                                  Vedanta and Buddhism, etc. Few and rarely do teachers speak about the 
                                  differences.</p>
              <p>And therefore when such people attain certain insights and 
                                  experiences, they think that that is it. This is final. There is complete
                                   certainty about what he realized - and so he thinks what he realized therefore must 
                                  be what the Buddha, and the other great sages realized, too. Such 
                                  statements usually aren't made out of pride but are expressed out of the
                                   full confidence they have in seeing an aspect of reality, and partially
                                   because of their ignorance and extrapolation. While they do have some true insight and 
                                  experiences, what they have seen is not the full picture.</p>
              <p>In other words, there is a lack of pointers, maps, etc - or there 
                                  are, but they simply aren't well known or taught well enough. So of 
                                  course most people will have false ideas about what enlightenment is, 
                                  or  what exactly the Buddha realised and so on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I commented that he is at Stage 4 based on some of the comments he made.</p>
              <p>First
                                   is his insight of non-dual. This wasn't as explicitly expressed in 
                                  other videos and if not for this video, I would not have commented that 
                                  he is at Stage 4 (as many of the other expressions could have been at 
                                  stage 1~3, not that they are less important, as each 'phase' of insight 
                                  offers a valuable insight and experience). <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxbpvVZ0EzU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxbpvVZ0EzU</a> - which he describes life as "just life flowing right here right now, the birds chirping outside, the dog woofing next door. sounds of the computer fan spinning."</p>
              <p>For example, in his video 'What is Oneness' - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mGPfhRB_Y&amp;feature=channel_video_title">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43mGPfhRB_Y&amp;feature=channel_video_title</a>,
                                   he commented that reality is the space here/now, the canvas in which 
                                  everything is painted on. If we see that we are all part of one reality,
                                   then we are reifying a greater reality, a Brahman, a substratum, which 
                                  nevertheless encompasses, pervades, and manifests as all manifestations.</p>
              <p>This is what Thusness said in his 4th stage, <em>"Nevertheless it is a very important key phase where practitioner 
                                  experiences a quantum leap in perception untying the dualistic knot.  
                                  This is also the key insight leading to the realization that "All is 
                                  Mind", all is just this One Reality.<br> <br> The tendency to extrapolate an Ultimate Reality or Universal 
                                  Consciousness where we are part of this Reality remains surprisingly 
                                  strong.  Effectively the dualistic knot is gone but the bond of seeing 
                                  things inherently isn't.  'Dualistic' and 'inherent' knots that prevent 
                                  the fully experiencing of our Maha, empty and non-dual nature of 
                                  pristine awareness are two very different 'perceptual spells' that 
                                  blind."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At Stage 5, we see that in seeing there is 
                                  just the seen, no seer - in perceiving just perception, no perceiver. No
                                   awareness seeing the world - for awareness simply means the 
                                  perceiving/perception, and the flow of perceptions.</p>
              <p>Reality as 
                                  such is simply nothing substantial, there is no agent or essence the 
                                  underlies all things, we are not 'part of' some greater reality.</p>
              <p>It
                                   is like the word 'weather' - to say that 'clouds are part of weather' 
                                  may be true conventionally, but actually what is 'weather'? Is it truly 
                                  existing? Or is it simply a label collating the everchanging stream and 
                                  aggregation of weatherly phenomena like clouds forming and departing, 
                                  changing, rolling, rain, lightning, wind, all kinds of everchanging 
                                  factors and phenomena.</p>
              <p>So likewise, the word 'self', 'reality', 
                                  whatever you want to call it - is utterly empty of any substantial 
                                  reality. It is simply <strong>a mere label collating a conglomerate of everchanging phenomena </strong>and no other reality, or real canvas, can be spoken of "in which things occur".</p>
              <p>This
                                   is also the difference between Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta - in 
                                  anatta, there is no unchanging background behind phenomena at all, not 
                                  even one that is "at one with/inseperable from phenomena", we cannot 
                                  even say that "Awareness is inseperable from phenomena" just like we 
                                  cannot say "Weather is inseperable from rain" - what is weather apart 
                                  from rain? No findable essence!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That being said.</p>
              <p>After watching more of his 
                                  videos, I think his videos are not so much about an unchanging non-dual 
                                  Brahman (One Mind), but more about <strong>resting in non-conceptuality and sustaining the non-conceptual experience of impersonality/life/universe, as well as No-Mind. </strong>Means
                                   his experience is at the phase of non-dual, and it is No-Mind, but the 
                                  insight of anatta has not arisen and his practice is skewing towards 
                                  non-conceptuality stripped of the sense of personality (which leads to the experience of a universal life living and expressing this moment) and self to 
                                  experience impersonality and no-mind. No-mind is like the experience of anatta, but not as an insight into the absence of agent, and can remain as a sort of peak experience. The experience is there but not the realization that "in seeing always just the seen, no seer-seeing-seen" - and so the entire practice is skewed towards non-conceptuality to rest in no-mind. This is still around phase 4-5 but
                                   not really 5.<strong> </strong></p>
              <p>This is precisely what Thusness said here as Case 1:</p>

              <div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr">I was looking back 
                                  at some posts by Thusness and found one that really summarizes the 
                                  problems of many people (including me, once, and many others I see in 
                                  forums)...<br> <br> Thusness:<br> <br> (31 October 2010)<br> <br> Hi Geis,<br> <br> I 'fear' commenting about other's forum because AEN will create havoc in that forum after that...lol.<br> <br> Jokes aside but I think it is still too early to say that insight of  
                                  anatta has arisen.  There seem to be a mixing up and a lack of clarity  
                                  of the following experiences that resulted from contemplating on the  
                                  topic of no-self:<br> <br> 1.  Resting in non-conceptuality<br> 2.  Resting as an ultimate Subject or<br> 3. Resting as mere ‘flow of phenomenality<br> <strong><span class="bbc"><br> In case 1 practitioners see ‘The seen is neither subjective nor objective.... it just IS....’<br> In terms of experience, practitioners will feel Universe, Life.  However
                                    this is not anatta but rather the result of stripping off  
                                  (deconstructing) identity and personality.</span><br> <span class="bbc"><br> When this mode of non-conceptual perception is taken to be ultimate, the
                                    terms “What is”, “Isness”, “Thusness” are often taken to mean simply  
                                  resting in non-conceptuality and not adding to or subtracting anything  
                                  from the ‘raw manifestation’.   There is a side effect to such an  
                                  experience.   Although in non-conceptuality, non-dual is most vivid and 
                                   clear, practitioners may wrongly conclude that ‘concepts’ are the  
                                  problem because the presence of ‘concepts’ divides and prevent the  
                                  non-dual experience. This seems logical and reasonable only to a mind  
                                  that is deeply root in a subject/object dichotomy. Very quickly  
                                  ‘non-conceptuality’ becomes an object of practice. The process of  
                                  objectification is the result of the tendency in action perpetually  
                                  repeating itself taking different forms like an endless loop. This can  
                                  continue to the extent that a practitioner can even ‘fear’ to establish 
                                   concepts without knowing it.  They are immobilized by trying to prevent
                                    the formation of views and concepts.  When we see ‘suffering just IS’,
                                    we must be very careful not to fall into the ‘disease’ of  
                                  non-conceptuality.</span></strong> <strong><br> </strong> <br> In Case 2 it is usual that practitioners will continue to personify,  
                                  reify and extrapolate a metaphysical essence in a very subtle way,  
                                  almost unknowingly. This is because despite the non-dual realization,  
                                  understanding is still orientated from a view that is based on  
                                  subject-object dichotomy. As such it is hard to detect this tendency and
                                    practitioners continue their journey of building their understanding 
                                  of  ‘No-Self based on Self’.<br> <br> For Case 3 practitioners, they are in a better position to appreciate  
                                  the doctrine of anatta. When insight of Anatta arises, all experiences  
                                  become implicitly non-dual. But the insight is not simply about seeing  
                                  through separateness; it is about the thorough ending of reification so 
                                   that there is an instant recognition that the ‘agent’ is extra, in  
                                  actual experience it does not exist. It is an immediate realization that
                                    experiential reality has always been so and the existence of a center,
                                   a  base, a ground, a source has always been assumed.  This is different
                                    from 'deconstructing of identity and personality' which is related to 
                                   non-conceptuality but 'actual' seeing of the non-existence of agent in 
                                   transient phenomena.<br> <br> Here practitioners will not only feel universe as in case 1 but there is
                                    also an immediate experience of our birth right freedom because the  
                                  agent is gone.  It is important to notice that practitioners here do not
                                    mistake freedom as ‘no right or wrong and remaining in a state of  
                                  primordial purity’ ; they are not immobilized by non-conceptuality but  
                                  is able to clearly see the ‘arising and passing’ of phenomena as  
                                  liberating as there is no permanent agent there to ‘hinder’ the seeing. 
                                    That is, practitioner not only realize ‘what experience is’ but also  
                                  begin to understand the ‘nature’ of experience.<br> <br> To mature case 3 realization, even direct experience of the absence of  
                                  an agent will prove insufficient; there must also be a total new  
                                  paradigm shift in terms of view; we must free ourselves from being  
                                  bonded to the idea, the need, the urge and the tendency of analyzing,  
                                  seeing and understanding our moment to moment of experiential reality  
                                  from a source, an essence, a center, a location, an agent or a  
                                  controller and rest entirely on anatta and Dependent Origination.<br> <br> In my opinion, the blog that hosts the articles on “Who am I” and  
                                  “Quietening the Inner Chatter” provide more in depth insights on  
                                  non-duality, Anatta and Emptiness.  The author demonstrates very deep  
                                  clarity of ‘what experience is’ and the ‘nature (impermanent, empty and 
                                   dependent originates according to supporting conditions)’ of 
                                  experience.<br> <br> Just my 2 cents. :-)</div>

              <p>Here's another forum post I wrote some months back, which I think is of relevance about the different aspects of no-self, and the experience, realization and view.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> I was trained in this 3 aspects:<br> <br> 1. The experience<br> 2. The realization<br> 3. and the View<br> <br> I will start with 'experience'. There are different experiences in
                                                  relation to 'no self':<br> <br> 1. Impersonality.<br> <br> This is the case when practitioners experienced that everything is
                                                  an expression of a universal cosmic intelligence. There is
                                                  therefore no sense of a personal doer... rather, it feels like I
                                                  and everything is being lived by a higher power, being expressed by
                                                  a higher cosmic intelligence. But this is still dualistic – there
                                                  is still this sense of separation between a 'cosmic intelligence'
                                                  and the 'world of experience', so it is still dualistic.<br> <br> There is also a very important realization - the realization of
                                                  Pure Presence or Consciousness or Beingness or Existence as being
                                                  one's true identity. There is an irrefutable undeniable insight
                                                  into the luminous essence of mind. Actually self-realization is not
                                                  related to impersonality in the sense that impersonality can be
                                                  experienced with or without self-realization, however a
                                                  self-realized person would progress his experience in terms of
                                                  impersonality. Nevertheless dualistic tendencies are strong and
                                                  awareness is seen as an eternal witnessing presence, a pure
                                                  formless perceiving subject. A true experience is being distorted
                                                  by the mind's tendency at projecting duality and inherency (to
                                                  things, self, awareness, etc)<br> <br> 2. Non-dual into One Mind.<br> <br> Where subject and object division collapsed into a single seamless
                                                  experience of one Naked Awareness.<br> <br> 3. No-Mind<br> <br> Where even the naked Awareness is totally forgotten and dissolved
                                                  into simply scenery, sound, arising thoughts and passing
                                                  scent.<br> <br> 4. Sunyata<br> <br> My experience here is still at the beginning phase. It is when the
                                                  'self' is completely transcended into dependent originated
                                                  activity. The play of dharma.<br> <br> Next is the 'Realization'. Having an experience of witnessing, or a
                                                  state of pure presence, is not the same as having attained
                                                  self-realization - in that case the practitioner can be said to
                                                  have an experience, but not insight/realization. Having an
                                                  experience is not the same as having a realization... for example,
                                                  you may have a temporary experience where the sense of separation
                                                  between experiencer and experience suddenly and temporarily
                                                  dissolves or there is the sense that subject and object has
                                                  merged... temporarily. This is not yet the realization of
                                                  non-duality... the realization that separation has been false right
                                                  from the beginning... there never was separation.<br> <br> Hence having non-dual samadhis are *not* enlightenment... why? The
                                                  realization that there never was separation to begin with, hasn't
                                                  arisen. Therefore you can only have temporary glimpses and
                                                  experiences of non-dual... where the latent dualistic tendencies
                                                  continue to surface... and not have seamless, effortless
                                                  seeing.<br> <br> And even after seeing through this separation, you may have the
                                                  realization of non-dual but still fall into substantial
                                                  non-duality, or One Mind. Why? This is because though we have
                                                  overcome the bond of duality, our view of reality is still seeing
                                                  it as 'inherent'. Our view or framework has it that reality must
                                                  have an inherent essence or substance to it, something permanent,
                                                  independent, ultimate. So though everything is experienced without
                                                  separation, the mind still can't overcome the idea of a source. The
                                                  mind kept coming back to a 'source' and is unable to break-through
                                                  and find the constant need to rest in an ultimate reality in which
                                                  everything is a part of... a Mind, an Awareness, a Self.... what
                                                  this results is a subtle tendency to cling, to sink back to a
                                                  ground, a source, and so transience cannot be fully appreciated for
                                                  what it is. It is an important phase however, as for the first time
                                                  phenomena are no longer seen as 'happening IN Awareness' but
                                                  'happening AS Awareness' – Awareness is its object of perception,
                                                  Awareness is expressing itself as every moment of manifest
                                                  perception.<br> <br> However, there is still a constant referencing back to the One
                                                  Awareness. Until you see that the idea itself is merely a thought,
                                                  and everything is merely thoughts, sights, sounds, disjoint,
                                                  disperse, insubstantial. There, a change of view takes place...
                                                  experience remains non-dual but without the view of 'everything is
                                                  inside me/everything is an expression of ME' but 'there is just
                                                  thoughts, sight, sound, taste' – just manifestation. At this point
                                                  you realize no self in the sense of Anatta – just sight, sound,
                                                  thoughts, with no one behind or linking them. After anatta, you can
                                                  then proceed to experience and realize how every experience, every
                                                  manifestation is the interaction of the entire universe... the
                                                  total exertion of the universe, the totality of causes and
                                                  conditions, gives rise to this moment of manifestation.<br> <br> p.s. described more in my e-journal/e-book,
                                                  http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</p>
              <p>I forgot to 
                      mention, when you are at the peak of one mind, you will enter no mind 
                      territory where source, mind, awareness is forgotten and what's left is 
                      the world as it is. But it remains a temporary peak experience until 
                      realisation of anatta arises and results in a change of view and 
                      therefore effortless and seamless experience. What led me to the 
                      realisation of anatta is the contemplation on bahiya sutta so you might 
                      want to try that.
