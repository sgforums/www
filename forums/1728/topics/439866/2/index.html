              <p>Yes usually so. Especially after the initial excitement when having become enlightened dies down. When they first become enlightened, there may be an urge to share the joy and insight :) It also accompanies a 60-90 day period of intense bliss and tremendous clarity.</p>

              <p>Stage 1 - realized Presence, Existence, Beingness, reified as Eternal Witness/Watcher of all things, the Self. this is actually what Buddha calls 'luminosity of mind' and is merely an aspect pertaining to the mind realm in the 18 dhatus scheme, but at this phase of insight, this is not understood.</p>
              <p>to get a sense or glimpse of this, pause your thoughts. in that pause, there is undeniably a wordless, conceptualless mental presence, beingness, sense of existence, a presence-awareness that remains even after all conceptualization ceases</p>
              <p>Stage 2 - experienced impersonality (sense that everything is an expression of infinite universal life, no real personal self, but still cling to ultimate big self), maybe temporary experience of non-dual where everything is fused into self, but still fixated on Source/Self</p>
              <p>Stage 3 - entering into nothingness to dissolve self, everything experienced as self-less spontaneity</p>
              <p>Stage 4 - not merely temporary merging of subjective perceiver and perceived object - this time it is a permanent insight that subject and object were never divided, awareness and contents were never divided to begin with. no inside or outside. you no longer feel like an observer seeing the world, rather, the world is a manifestation of a single awareness at 0 distance. when you see the mountain, you are the mountain</p>
              <p>Stage 5 - in seeing just the seen, no seer. not merely the inseperability of subject and object, there is *no subject* to begin with that could be inseperable from objects, no "the one awareness" to be one or manifesting as manifestations. "awareness" is merely an empty label denoting the six modes of consciousness. it is realized that self/subject is merely an empty label, in reality just the process of disjoint manifestations/experiences without an experiencer. no subject to be in union with object. this is beginning of Buddhism enlightenment, all previous stages can be found in other religions (though also experienced by people in Buddhism)</p>
              <p>Stage 6 - not merely the emptiness of self, it is now also realized that all phenomena/objects are empty of inherent existence, being all the display of dependent origination. view of inherency dissolves, sense of locality dissolves</p>

              <p>Not asking you to "dumb down" the Dharma, but at least simplify and summarize such that people won't be put off by walls of text ... haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/bigsmile.png" alt="bigsmile.png">  Make it easier to understand!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I am ever aware that when the destination hasn't been reached, the "how-to" is probably more important than the "what".  Of course it's great to know what a wonderful place the destination is, or I wouldn't even aspire to go there.  However, I prefer to be given the tools and the instructions to get there... first. </p>
              <p>I guess that's what our meditation teachers are for, but I do sometimes wish the techniques could be discussed here a little more.  Various techniques... since everyone is different and we may need different methods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I wouldn't say the "wordy verbiage" is pointless, just intimidating to access; and I'm concerned many will just give up even before they have come to realise its value. </strong></p>

              <p>Actually in Buddhism, View is more important than techniques and path (but not to misunderstand that meditation is not important, they must be balanced), as Namdrol puts it. Because we are Buddhist practitioners and not Hindu practitioners. I can testify to this - I am not a very hardworking practitioner, but because I have right view, my progress is much faster. There are a lot of practitioners both Buddhist and non-Buddhist who are also very hardworking practitioners, but they get stuck somewhere for decades or a lifetime due to incorrect view.</p>
              <p>It's ok not to understand all the stages of the path (a lot of things you learn will also only make sense down the path), but your view must be right. You must have right view.</p>
              <p>If you have right view, you will also likewise understand Stage 5 (anatta) and Stage 6 (dependent origination/emptiness)</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-SG">It
               is important to realize what is meant by the “self” rejected by the 
              Buddha as illusory. Not only are human beings declared to lack a soul or
               self, but so is everything else: rivers, mountains, this paper, and 
              your pencil, all lack a separate self. What this means is that they 
              cannot have any existence except in terms of the interconnected net of 
              causal conditions that made their existence possible. All things 
              (including human beings) are composites, in other words, they are 
              composed of parts, and have no real existence other than as temporary 
              (impermanent) collections of parts. They are essentially patterns, 
              configurations, or Gestalten rather than objectively existing 
              separate entities. They possess no separate essence, self, or soul that 
              could exist by itself, apart from the component parts and conditions.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-SG">Consider,
               for example, an automobile. Does it have an essence or a “soul” when 
              separated from its component parts? Does it have any real existence 
              apart from its parts? One could try the following mental exercise. 
              Removing one of the tires of the car, one could ask oneself, is this the
               car? Successively taking away the windshield, a door, a piston, a bolt,
               the radiator cap, and continuing until the last piece of metal, 
              plastic, glass, or rubber has been removed, one would never find the 
              part which, if removed, transforms what remains into a non-car. Such 
              part, if found, would have represented the essence or the “soul” of the 
              car, and yet it was nowhere to be found. Now all we have is a pile of 
              parts—where is the car? At which point did the car disappear? If we 
              reflect carefully we are left with the realization that there never was a car there—all
               that was there was a conglomerate of parts temporarily connected in a 
              certain way, so as to result in a particular mode of functioning, and 
              “car” was just a convenient label to designate this working arrangement.
               The word “car” is nothing but a label for the gestalt formed by the constituent parts, and although it is true (as realized by Wertheimer and the other Gestaltists)
               that the whole is more than the sum of the parts (one cannot drive 
              sitting on any of the separate parts, or on a random heap of them, but 
              driving is possible when one puts them together in a certain way), it is
               equally true that a gestalt cannot continue to exist when separated from its parts. The gestalt, the “whole,” cannot exist by itself; it does not have a separate self or “soul.”</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-SG">But
               what about a person? According to Buddhist psychology, what we call a 
              “person” is the composite of five groups of elements or skandhas. The skandhas
               are form, feelings, perceptions, impulses, and consciousness. Just as 
              an automobile is a temporary collection of car parts, a person is a 
              temporary arrangement of these five aggregates or skandhas. There
               is no separate, independent self or soul that would be left if we 
              removed form (which includes the body), feelings, perceptions, impulses,
               and consciousness. While these aggregates are together, the functioning
               gestalt we call a person exists; if they are removed, the gestalt
               ceases to be. For this reason, the self can be said to be “empty” of 
              reality when separated from its component aggregates— a view of the self
               radically different from Western perspectives. But it is not only the 
              self that is empty, and cannot exist by itself; the skandhas themselves are also empty.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span lang="EN-SG">The five skandhas,
               like everything else, are dependently arisen, and cannot exist by 
              themselves. Take the form of one’s body, for example. What would remain 
              of it, if one removed one’s perception of it, one’s feelings about it, 
              one’s impulses to act on it or with it, and one’s conscious awareness of
               it? Form is empty of reality when separated from perceptions, feelings,
               impulses, and consciousness. And what about feelings? They also cannot 
              exist by themselves. Feelings are feelings about something, about one’s 
              body, one’s perceptions, one’s impulses, one’s state of consciousness. 
              The same is true of the remaining skandhas—each one is composed of the other four. They are in a state of interdependent co-origination, they inter-are (Hanh, 1988).</span></em></p>

              <p>He will naturally know, there is no need for authentication.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, it is good to discuss with one's teachers also, firstly why would you want to keep your experience to yourself? There is naturally a tendency to want to discuss it with others, at least those who know. Secondly, just because you are enlightened doesn't mean you have attained Buddhahood. There are different levels of practice and attainment. So the teacher still can point out certain things to you to help you on your path.</p>

              <p><br> Hey AEN, I do agree with <em>whylikethatah</em> that if people read
              and are unable to understand, it's as good as not reaching
              them.  The message is important, but the manner and method of
              delivery is equally important. </p>
              <p>Not asking you to "dumb down" the Dharma, but at least simplify
              and summarize such that people won't be put off by walls of text
              ... haha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/bigsmile.png" alt="bigsmile.png">  Make it easier to understand!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, I am ever aware that when the destination hasn't been
              reached, the "how-to" is probably more important than the
              "what".  Of course it's great to know what a wonderful place
              the destination is, or I wouldn't even aspire to go there. 
              However, I prefer to be given the tools and the instructions to get
              there... first. </p>
              <p>I guess that's what our meditation teachers are for, but I do
              sometimes wish the techniques could be discussed here a little
              more.  Various techniques... since everyone is different and
              we may need different methods.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I wouldn't say the "wordy verbiage" is pointless, just
              intimidating to access; and I'm concerned many will just give up
              even before they have come to realise its value. </strong></p>

              <p>I would say, not that elusive.  The instructions are laid out in 
              sutras.  The most commonly used "how-tos" are sutras like the

              <p>When I
               requested more discussion on the "how-tos" I wasn't seeking instruction
               right here on the forum per se.  Our meditation teachers should be the 
              ones instructing us.  However, some amount of discussion on the 
              techniques in terms of problems faced and how to solve them, which 
              techniques are better under certain conditions (e.g. people were asking 
              how to forgive and metta meditation often gets recommended), how to 
              overcome lack of motivation in practice, and even things like what to do
               if your leg is hurting while doing your sittings, etc. </p>

              Matters surrounding practice were actively discussed so that everyone

              <p>oh, you meant 'technique-based' instructions. that shouldn't be a big problem isn't it. i was thinking along the lines of coming to the 'realisation' or 'attainment' since u used the word 'destination', as in there's no 'How-to' reach that 'destination'. </p>
              <p>the ego makes a compelling case as it figures out what it needs, sets down an agenda, and progresses towards its goal. it knows where it is going, what it still lacks, and how to achieve the wanted result, all in quantifiable terms. but if the mind has never been where it is going, how could it have any possible idea how to get there, or how the journey looks like? So it becomes an obstacle if we think we know where we are going and the strategies we use to get there. </p>
              <p>the ego can interfere with the process of spiritual work, but it cannot offer much assistance. as long as the ego remains in-charge of the spiritual journey, it endlessly complicates and prolongs the process. imo, awakening or enlightenment is not something you gain, but simply <em>is </em>when the mind releases its authority. so yeah, no 'stages of enlightenment' for me thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
