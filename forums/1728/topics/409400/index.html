              <p>by Tsoknyi Rinpoche III</p>
              <p>The Vajrayana says not to reject the kleshas, the negative emotions, but to take them as the path. This can be quite challenging to most people because emotions often govern our body, speech, and mind. So in order to take emotions as the path, we need to take a step back to take a look at emotions.</p>
              <p>Where do these emotions come from? The most obvious are the karmic habitual patterns stored in our alaya. We know our own emotional inclinations, these kleshas very well, don’t we? They often seem to be running the show! But sometimes they are confusing; they seem to pop out of the alaya according to very subtle causes and conditions of which we are unaware, not from traceable situations. Other emotions, particularly pure emotions, are not necessarily created by the mind. When these emotions come, they inform the mind and create moods that color everything. Some emotions are simply patterned into the physical system. So when the physical system is triggered, those emotions come up in the mind. For example preliminary practice, ngöndro, is a time when a lot of emotions can be triggered due to the physical activity. Some people cope well with it, but some cannot take it, so preliminary practice can be a very emotionally challenging time.<img title="More..." src="http://www.pundarika.org/news/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" alt=""></p>
              <p>However, it’s not only special practice situations that produce strong emotions in the body’s chemistry. One that most people experience is fear. There are two kinds of fear. The first is a healthy fear, like when you are walking and suddenly feel yourself tripping. Fear arises instantly as a bad taste in your mouth; you can taste the chemistry of fear. Until you become a rainbow body you need that fear. That fear is part of our relative-truth wisdom. If you see a car coming straight at you, you need to do something with your intelligence and clarity. Is jumping to the side best? But which side? Is rolling out of the way better? Or is it best to stand still and wave your arms, so the car can see you and go around you? At that moment you have to choose to do something to protect your physical body. When you’re a rainbow body, then you can think, “Oh yeah, this body is transparent, it cannot be harmed, so it’s not an obstruction.” Until then, you need this fear because it will lead to life-saving action.</p>
              <p>The other fear is an unhealthy fear, a deluded fear that feels like a constant buzz in our body and mind. This is the fear you need to take care of. With such strong emotions like deluded, solidified fear I suggest you start by developing an attitude towards it that views it neither as an enemy to be abandoned, nor as something with which to identify. Once this attitude is established, bring the emotion into focus. Emotions like fear are misperceptions by the ego and result in mental grasping. Because there is grasping, a good aikido-welcome works well with it. An aikido-welcome releases mental/emotional grasping just like it does physically. You begin by saying, ”Oh hello fear, I see you’re here, but that’s okay because there’s room for you.” Then, as you relax the subtle body the fear itself relaxes a bit. At this point, like in aikido, you can move the energy of fear more easily in the same direction you are going because the ego’s fear-story is no longer in charge of the energy. By applying this method you are beginning to take emotion as the path. What is the key to doing this? It is removing the ego’s attachment to the fear story.</p>
              <p>This is how you can approach anger as well. There are two kinds of anger. One comes from believing you are right. It is a pure anger, not really sticky. With it comes a lot of clarity and, for the practitioner, the possibility of mirror-like wisdom, the dissolving of anger and ego in rigpa.</p>
              <p>But there is another kind of anger that comes when you feel you have been wrong, made mistakes or avoiding feeling of self-blame…“I’m not wrong!” This sort of anger is more difficult to deal with because it has a lot of delusion connected to it and is not so clear. It is stickier than the pure anger. This is the anger you need to take care of. It can be very powerful, heating up the physical body, tightening the subtle body, and narrowing the conceptual mind’s focus to just the object seen as threatening and the source of anger. When this anger arises, it’s ordinarily experienced as something solid and is filled with ego because within the emotions are the five poisons. Within all of the five poisons, there is one predominant element, the ego that clings to experiences and to its own survival. You have to abandon this ego, no matter what. Remove ego and the five poisons become transformed to the five wisdoms.</p>
              <p>Actually, ego is happy when you notice it and challenge it. It likes the focus; it likes the attention. It’s used to being the center of your universe and a challenge makes it feel so important, and, if it is invested in being a practitioner, so spiritual, so holy. This is why first welcoming emotion and then turning away is quite upsetting to ego. The aikido-like moves transform the energy that supports the ego’s story and centrality in your life.  When the energy is transformed, ego doesn’t know what to do. When the ego doesn’t know what to do, it freaks out and that is the time to recognize rigpa, if you can. But sometimes it’s difficult to recognizing rigpa when the kleshas are strong, so this aikido-like method works well even if you cannot rest in rigpa. In fact, when any obstacle comes, any emotion comes, the aikido method works best. But first you must welcome it. Do not confront, just welcome. But don’t hang out too long with it. If you do, you are likely to merge with the emotion and that is quite different then doing the aikido moves. Technically you may understand this, but whether you can do it or not depends on your skill in practicing this way. So practice the skill of  “mental aikido” because it is very useful.</p>
              <p>So what else can you do with self-blaming anger? It has both emotional and mental aspects that need to be dealt with, but before doing either of those, it’s best to take care of the emotion in your physical body. Generally I don’t recommend that Westerners do Tibetan Buddhist body practices. Your complex life produces subtle restlessness (lung), an emotional problem we don’t commonly see in traditional Tibet society. In Tibet they assume you don’t have a problem with restlessness and teach a lot of jumping, a lot of breathing. Sometimes it’s too much for Westerners and you might get more restlessness. Instead, I think westerners should go more in the direction of yoga, tai ji or qigong.</p>
              <p>However, there are some meditative practices in the Tibetan system that can be very helpful. In the Tibetan system we understand that there is a subtle body made of tsa, lung and tigle. The Tibetan word tsa is called nadi in Sanskrit and translates as channels in English. The Tibetan word lung is prana in Sanskrit and translates as energies or winds in English. Tigle is bindu in Sanskrit or seeds of energy in English. Within the subtle body there are different levels of subtlety. The channels are the most gross, the energies are subtler, and finally the seeds of energy are quite subtle. So meditation practices involving exercises for tsa, lung, tigle are a way of working with the subtle body and are used when taking emotions as the path. But you need to know the right way to do these exercises otherwise they will not function correctly. Because of the lung problem, you need to take your time, scan your body and loosen up the energetic knots. Over the years, knots of restlessness have developed and underneath the restlessness is ego. But ego does not like to let go, so it takes a few months, a few years perhaps, to really let go. So before you try to practice Tibetan tsa-lung exercises, I think it’s good to practice jam-lung, subtle vase breathing. Anything harsh does not work for the western body, but a very long time of gentle nurturing opens it up and the subtle body begins to rejuvenate.</p>
              <p>Once the subtle body begins to rejuvenate you can bring in mental understanding, the second aspect generally needed to work with strong emotions. A good practice for this is The Four Applications of Mindfulness. They begin to break down the ego clinging that makes self-blaming anger so powerful. Breaking down the ego clinging makes it possible to reconnect with the spark of love that lives within all of us. This spark, this basic love has surely been obscured if there is self-hatred. Basic love has been replaced by a very critical ego. Generally, you’ll find that your expectations for your life have been set so high that you are bound to be disappointed with yourself. But once you feel the spark of basic love again, really feel it, it’s possible to adjust your expectations for your life. Only then can well being infuse your heart. If you don’t do this, you’ll continue to suffer greatly from self-blaming anger. However, if you begin to receive the nurturing of basic love, your mind becomes more stable, and it’s not as hard take the medicine of rigpa.</p>
              <p>Using rigpa medicine can bring a klesha to an extreme and at its peak realize its emptiness. However, rigpa medicine also works well without letting the emotion build.  If you can, go directly to the view of rigpa, seeing the empty, spacious nature of the emotion, without rejecting, avoiding or having to transform it. Within rigpa, the anger ceases to be solid. By realizing emptiness and resting in rigpa, the already weakened ego-clinging dissolves. With no self to be hit by the emotion, there is no need to reject the anger or react to it. The counterpart of anger is mirror-like wisdom and this will come as you experience the pure energy of anger. When there is the experience of anger’s pure energy, it enhances clarity of mind. That enhancement of the clarity stays as rigpa clarity. And that is the quality of mirror-like wisdom that sees everything.</p>
              <p>But these methods are quite difficult to do because they require strong, stable rigpa and this takes some time to establish. So that is why I recommend beginning with the wisdom of the aikido-like method. However, no matter which combination of practices you use to let go of the anger story, you need to know that anger leaves some sensation in the body and you might think anger is still there. Don’t be confused by this, because actually the anger is gone. As long as the ego is not grasping, the feeling will no longer produce any karmic pattern. It’s just an uncomfortable feeling that can distract you if you don’t see it as just a little bit of physical discomfort. Don’t hook back into it. It takes some time to cool down, but the emotional part of anger is gone as soon as you let go of the ego grasping. Only the energy is left, and that is what the body is feeling.</p>
              <p>It is incomplete to look at emotions as the path for western Vajrayana practitioners without considering depression. For many, many Westerners depression is a life-long emotional struggle, with much suffering, and I think it’s connected with tigle (bindu), the seeds of energy. When I discuss depression with people, they say the experience is one of no light in their life; their thoughts and bodies feel heavy and hollow; there’s no enthusiasm, and their sexual desire has gone down (although they may not behave this way). Everything is gray or even black and they are easily scared (again, they may not behave this way). They feel flat and there’s no “juice.” Anything connected with bliss is gone.</p>
              <p>This is very close to the description of what happens in our constitution when the energies are blocked and the tigle cannot move freely throughout the body. The tigle are stuck in one place and start to diminish. When they diminish or dry up, minds start to feel a sense of depression. When not dried up and the subtle body is in balance, tigle function as the basis for love, happiness, compassion, and bodhicitta. Usually the mind rides on these energies, but when the energies become too speedy, our minds fill with worry and anxiety. Speed itself can go in a positive way or a negative way, but when it drives our minds in a negative way our whole system feels the impact. When this energy comes into the heart, people can become quite depressed and hopeless. I call this “chicken-hearted,” and it’s another form of depression. No matter what the specific formative circumstances, people with depression are easily overwhelmed by stimulation and just want to pull the covers over their head. Without the courage or guts to engage in life, they become ruled by fear and aversion and either take no risks or are covering it up with bravado.</p>
              <p>From the practice perspective, the tigle need to be revived. In the beginning, it’s difficult to address the tigle directly, so we start by working with our minds, which are usually full of thoughts of all kinds. Having a lot of thoughts also can dry up the strength of the tigle. Therefore we train our minds to calm down, relax and remain still through the practice of samadhi. If you can do this, it automatically rejuvenates the tigle, bringing back the experience of well-being. You can also apply the Four Applications of Mindfulness as we saw with anger. They too will stimulate a sense of well-being. Another important method you can apply to depression is intellectual conviction. Although you feel lousy, your conceptual belief can be quite strong. You trust the Dharma, the blessings of your teacher, and the lineage teachers. Based on this trust, you should supplicate the teachers and receive their spiritual influence. These blessings impact your subtle body and you start to experience well-being again. All of these methods can be used to jump start the tigle.</p>
              <p>Once the tigle begin to move again, your desire and enthusiasm begin to come back. Then it helps to “feed” the tigle with things that nurture well-being, like stable, emotionally healthy relationships, good food, beauty, music, and the juicy practices like devotion, which bring bliss and joy. But of course you have to take care. You have to take care of your energy. You have to use it the right way. When desire and enthusiasm come, don’t exhaust yourself expending it in the next moment. But eventually enthusiasm, bravery, openness, juiciness, compassion, love, and bliss–many things come together.</p>
              <p>From the Vajrayana point of view, emotions are fine. But if you use them wrongly, these emotions can be harmful. The key to the Vajrayana approach is remembering that your emotions are your emotions, whether you are skillfully managing them or not. They are your production. They are all empty in nature. Because of this, all emotion in Vajrayana is welcomed as method. But in Vajrayana practice, any emotional feeling can be mistakenly indulged if there is not sufficient wisdom and stable rigpa. Then it becomes just craziness or harmful behavior. This is important, so make sure your practice is a balance of wisdom and method. You need to know how to welcome emotions. It doesn’t mean you follow them all the way. Opening the door to them completely is the samsaric way of welcoming, not the Vajrayana. If you follow any emotion completely, it does not lead to freedom.</p>
              <p>However, once you have a stable rigpa practice, you can let go of all methods because recognizing the view is the best way of dealing with emotions. Just recognize rigpa, realize emptiness. That’s all. When any emotion comes, just re-recognize rigpa, realize emptiness. The emotions will naturally become purified. With stable rigpa, emotions can be purified through liberation, using self-liberation, liberation upon arising or liberation without benefit or harm. But if there’s still some lingering negative emotion, although rigpa is totally stable, it is fine to say: “Oh, hello, I am sorry, I didn’t know you were still here.” Make a “handshake” with what is hanging around, engage with it so the emotion doesn’t feel left out. You can include the emotion with an “Oh honey.” Just say “honey” like a sweet mantra. It doesn’t mean much because you are no longer trapped by the ego’s attachment to emotion, but the ego will be happy…and then you can continue to practice!</p>

              <p>The article is not so simple...</p>
              <p>Here's a more summarized version on self-liberation:</p>
              <p><br>...The particular method of Dzogchen is called the Path of 
              Self-Liberation, and to apply it nothing need be renounced, purified, or
               transformed. Whatever arises as one's karmic vision is used as the 
              path. The great master Pha Tampa Sangye [South Indian Yogin of the 11 
              century (ed.)] once said: It is not the circumstances which arise as 
              one's karmic vision that condition a person into the dualistic state; it
               is a person's own attachment that enables what arises to condition him.
               If this attachment is to be cut through in the most rapid and effective
               way, the mind's spontaneous capacity to self-liberate must be brought 
              into play. The term self-liberation should not, however, be taken as 
              implying that there is some 'self' or ego there to be liberated. It is a
               fundamental assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that all phenomena are 
              void of self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the Dzogchen sense, means 
              that whatever manifests in the field of experience of the practitioner 
              is allowed to arise just as it is, without judgement of it as good or 
              bad, beautiful or ugly. And in that same moment, if there is no 
              clinging, or attachment, without effort, or even volition, whatever it 
              is that arises, whether as a thought or as a seemingly external event, 
              automatically liberates itself, by itself, and of itself. Practicing in 
              this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision never even get
               a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.(p33)<br><br>So the
               practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without needing 
              any rules other than one's own awareness, always remaining in the 
              primordial state through integrating that state with whatever arises as 
              part of experience -- with absolutely nothing to be seen outwardly to 
              show that one is practicing. This is what is meant by self-liberation, 
              this is what is meant by the name Dzogchen - which means Great 
              Perfection - and this is what is meant by non-dual contemplation, or 
              simply contemplation....</p>
              <div class="msg-body"><br><br>~ Dzogchen teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche<br><br>-------------------<br><br>Self-liberation
               does not mean                         that a self liberates himself or 
              herself from delusorily valued                         thoughts or 
              delusory experiences; what it means is that delusorily                  
                     valued thoughts and delusory experiences liberate themselves     
                                  spontaneously (which may take place in three main 
              ways). (Source:                         <a rel="nofollow" href="http://eliascapriles.dzogchen.ru/self-liberation.pdf">http://eliascapriles.dzogchen.ru/self-liberation.pdf</a>)</div>

              <p>Perfection in the Dzogchen context has a very different meaning... it is not refering to you being perfect as a person or not.</p>
              <p>Rather, it is talking the perfection of Awareness, your Buddha-Nature itself...</p>
              <p>Right now, your Buddha-Nature is already spontaneously perfected, it is already empty, luminous (aware) and vividly manifesting in various forms and experiences.</p>
              <p>It does not become less perfect when you are ignorant, or become more perfect when you become a Buddha. Your nature is already perfect... you simply need to realize it.</p>

              <p><em>The word </em><em>Dzogchen has been translated variously as Great 
                  Perfection, Great Completeness, Total Completeness, and 
                  Supercompleteness. These terms also convey the idea that our nature as 
                  intrinsic awareness has many qualities that make it perfect. These 
                  include indestructibility, incorruptible purity, non-discriminating 
                  openness, flawless clarity, profound simplicity, all-pervading presence 
                  and equality within all beings (i.e., the quality, quantity and 
                  functionality of this awareness is exactly the same in every being in 
                  the universe). It is said that the impressive personal qualities of the 
                  fully enlightened <a title="Gautama Buddha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Buddha</a> derived from the fact that he was fully aligned with this already-existing primordial nature.

              <p>Emotions are an integral part of us, often, without mindfulness, it dictates our reaction towards outer phenomena. It is our habitual tendencies that define our emotional dispositions. Such it the result of our life of expectations, which rises from underlying/suppressed disappointment or dissatisfaction.</p>
              <p>A simple way of looking at the root cause is emotional quotient vs intelligience quotient.</p>
              <p>A perfectly rational and friendly person in normal routine, once put behind the steering wheels transforms into a snarling beast, defensive and aggressive.</p>
              <p>Or how some's personality changes when playing mahjong!</p>
              <p>Sometimes all it take is a innocuous remark to trigger irrational ranting, resulting from our underlying restlessness or dissatifaction.</p>
              <p>This underlying dissatisfaction is much part of us that we think it as normal and acceptable. It need not be so. </p>
              <p>One of the ability of practising Buddhism is the awareness of mind process, which is effective in acknowledging our dissatisfaction.</p>

              <p>Emotions are personal reaction towards internal process,eg. internalizing, often manifested as a reaction to an external phenomena.</p>
              <p>Underlying is the  attachment of values: either pleasurable or uncomfortable, good and bad of events and things. The key word is attachment and unsatisfactory state of being in attachment.</p>

              <p>That not what I said, for even within a demarcations of two groups, the two, if lumped together, is seen as one. Now there are two, because the individuals are lumped in two simply through a mere labelling of assenting and dissenting; a simple form of duality through polarity. Right and wrong, good vs evil. Root cause of a lot of suffering from this original demarcations! What you see as two groups are more are what to me is individuals labelled with a single underlying stand.</p>

              <p>We don't necessarily have to go through all states and experiences to experience liberation... However, if we have non-dual realization... we will be able to integrate our insight with emotions and experiences. Depending on the depth of insight and experience... one may be able to simply allow emotions to self-liberate as they arise so that they do not cause suffering, grasping/attachments, or leave traces. Experiences that arise become like drawing pictures on a pond - they appear vividly but are instantaneously gone without leaving a trace.</p>
              <p>At this point, whether emotions are arising or not are not so important... as whatever arises within the field of experience are neither clung to, nor rejected, but are simply experienced as the radiance of our true nature and are allowed to self-liberate spontaneously...</p>

              <p>As Thusness often mentions, there is a difference between growing wisdom and prajna wisdom... the article here is talking about prajna wisdom, the wisdom of our nature, luminosity and emptiness inseparable... the wisdom that leads to liberation. This type of wisdom does not come from learning life lessons through various circumstances but rather the experiential realisation of the ultimate nature of reality and all experiences through contemplative practices such as the ones provided in Dzogchen (but there are others).</p>
              <p>There is another type of wisdom called growing wisdom, which is the wisdom that grows with life experiences so that we know how to deal with life.</p>

              <blockquote><strong>But these methods are quite difficult to do because they require strong, stable rigpa and this takes some time to establish. </strong>So that is why I recommend beginning with the wisdom of the aikido-like method. However, no matter which combination of practices you use to let go of the anger story, you need to know that anger leaves some sensation in the body and you might think anger is still there. Don’t be confused by this, because actually the anger is gone. As long as the ego is not grasping, the feeling will no longer produce any karmic pattern. It’s just an uncomfortable feeling that can distract you if you don’t see it as just a little bit of physical discomfort. Don’t hook back into it. It takes some time to cool down, but the emotional part of anger is gone as soon as you let go of the ego grasping. Only the energy is left, and that is what the body is feeling.

                                      neither do you indulge in the story.</p>
              <p>Now... we usually have a preconception of anger, like 'anger is
                                      negative'... 'anger is dangerous'... etc. What if we strip all our
                                      pre-conceptions and labels, what if we do not even label anger as
                                      anger and simply and innocently and curiously observe what exactly
                                      is anger?</p>
              <p>Two months ago I wrote about a teacher called Sailor Bob Adamson
                                      who wrote a book called 'What's wrong with right now unless you
                                      think about it'. I wrote that I realized that we make a problem out
                                      of everything, including even our thoughts and emotions, simply by
                                      naming them... but if we stop labeling them, like 'fear'/'anger',
                                      etc, then we don't make a problem out of anything. Everything
                                      becomes a play or energy of Awareness rather than an obscuration.
                                      You simply 'enter' into a sea of wordless vibration that arises and
                                      passes in awareness but doesn't leave any traces.<br> <br> In light of this, there is nothing that needs to be done... because
                                      anything to 'do', to 'meditate', implies altering or changing this
                                      moment of experience... but this moment of experience is as it is
                                      and without making a problem out of it, is perfect/complete as it
                                      is without a need for alteration/meditation/etc.</p>
              <p>Surely, you cannot go mad by having clarity of your immediate
                                      experience! Madness is due to unclarity, due to confusion, due to
                                      being completely lost in indulging in one's stories... Awareness
                                      however steps out of the story to observe the feelings, thoughts,
                                      sensations exactly as they are. Anger and other emotions happen
                                      throughout our lives even when we are not meditating... and it is
                                      only in times of non-clarity that they go 'out of control' because
                                      we are totally lost in story, totally indulging in the
                                      'me-stories'. It is this non-clarity that causes madness.
                                      Meditative clarity simply helps clarify our experience and the
                                      nature of experience and eventually allow these emotions to
                                      self-liberate on its own accord.</p>
              <p>What exactly is anger? Other than thoughts, it is this whole
                                      energy coursing the body and the bodily sensations in the chest
                                      that you mentioned.... observe, feel it for what it is, see how
                                      they transform. This is also the 'four foundations of mindfulness'
                                      advocated by Buddha or the 'choiceless awareness' advocated by
                                      JK.</p>
              <p>If we stop labeling anger as anger.... then whatever sensations
                                      that make up anger is precisely in that moment the energy of
                                      awareness. There is no distinction/separation between awareness and
                                      anger! Anger (without the label) is simply the energy of
                                      awareness... we will have interesting insights about how anger
                                      arises according to conditionings and imprints and affects our
                                      entire being.</p>
              <p>Why worry about how to deal with anger? If you can practice
                                      choiceless awareness, that alone is enough. As JK often says: the
                                      observer is the observed... in order to 'deal' with anger, you must
                                      separate yourself from anger. But is this separation actual, i.e.,
                                      is there a somebody separate and experiencing and controlling the
                                      anger, or is the experiences you call anger simply arising on its
                                      own accord shining vividly on its own? Are you the thinker or
                                      controller or do these phenomena simply arise on its own accord due
                                      to conditioning? What if there is just this joint phenomenon
                                      without separation, these feelings, thoughts, sensations arising to
                                      no one? If they are simply seen in clarity, there is no one there
                                      to resist or attach to those experiences. There is only That -
                                      sensations, feelings, etc, with no one at the center who can escape
                                      nor accept what is appearing. What liberation that is! Just these
                                      sensations felt in full clarity, arising with no place of abidance,
                                      and then passing without leaving traces... no special effort to
                                      transform them is necessary, only the 'self-liberation through
                                      seeing with naked awareness' that Guru Padmasambhava talks about.
                                      What is present here is a wonder of shimmering awareness,
                                      everything observed and embraced as it is without a
                                      self-center.</p>
              <p>Anyway this teacher is very good, she is a qualified zen master

              <p>As JK say, it's absolutely essential to feel disturbed. Don't
                                      fear disturbance. Don't try to find security... face whatever

              <p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br> Disturbance is essential for understanding and any attempt to find
                                      security is a hindrance to understanding. When we want to get rid
                                      of something which is disturbing, it is surely a hindrance. If we
                                      can experience a feeling directly, without naming it, I think we
                                      shall find a great deal in it; then there is no longer a battle
                                      with it, because the experiencer and the thing experienced are one,
                                      and that is essential.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">So long as the experiencer
                                      verbalizes the feeling, the experience, he separates himself from
                                      it and acts upon it; such action is an artificial, illusory action.
                                      But if there is no verbalization, then the experiencer and the
                                      thing experienced are one. That integration is necessary and has to
                                      be radically faced.</span></em></p>

                                  It is loaded with memory. Face only the perception. Accept the
                                  sensation</em> <em><br> completely. When the personality who judges and controls is
                                  completely absent, when there is no longer a psychological
                                  relationship with the<br> sensation, it is really welcomed and unfolds. Only in welcoming
                                  without a welcomer can there be real transformation.<br> <br> We are in essence one with all existence; when we truly observe

              <p>The article is not so simple...</p>
              <p>Here's a more summarized version on self-liberation:</p>
              <p><br>...The particular method of Dzogchen is called the Path of Self-Liberation, and to apply it nothing need be renounced, purified, or transformed. Whatever arises as one's karmic vision is used as the path. The great master Pha Tampa Sangye [South Indian Yogin of the 11 century (ed.)] once said: It is not the circumstances which arise as one's karmic vision that condition a person into the dualistic state; it is a person's own attachment that enables what arises to condition him. If this attachment is to be cut through in the most rapid and effective way, the mind's spontaneous capacity to self-liberate must be brought into play. The term self-liberation should not, however, be taken as implying that there is some 'self' or ego there to be liberated. It is a fundamental assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that all phenomena are void of self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the Dzogchen sense, means that whatever manifests in the field of experience of the practitioner is allowed to arise just as it is, without judgement of it as good or bad, beautiful or ugly. And in that same moment, if there is no clinging, or attachment, without effort, or even volition, whatever it is that arises, whether as a thought or as a seemingly external event, automatically liberates itself, by itself, and of itself. Practicing in this way the seeds of the poison tree of dualistic vision never even get a chance to sprout, much less to take root and grow.(p33)<br><br>So the practitioner lives his or her life in an ordinary way, without needing any rules other than one's own awareness, always remaining in the primordial state through integrating that state with whatever arises as part of experience -- with absolutely nothing to be seen outwardly to show that one is practicing. This is what is meant by self-liberation, this is what is meant by the name Dzogchen - which means Great Perfection - and this is what is meant by non-dual contemplation, or simply contemplation....</p>
              <div><br><br>~ Dzogchen teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche<br><br>-------------------<br><br>Self-liberation does not mean that a self liberates himself or herself from delusorily valued thoughts or delusory experiences; what it means is that delusorily valued thoughts and delusory experiences liberate themselves spontaneously (which may take place in three main ways).

              <p>When you hear a bad news, maybe some loved one pass away, you can't take it, you completely go flat... maybe can't face life anymore... if we are not overwhelmed in this way, it'd be good right?</p>
              <p>We are completely controlled by our emotions.  Someone show us a black face and our whole day can go down the road... traffic jam, car horn at us, we get so furious...curse and swear...</p>
              <p>all these are signs of our complete lack of freedom.  So when we master emotions, then we are no longer the slave of emotions.  we can remain cheerful all the time, without bouncing up and down emotionally, it conserves alot of our energy for positive ventures.</p>

              <h2>The Raw Feeling</h2>
              <p class="intro_para">Thoughts arise spontaneously and we are not 
              the source of the thoughts. We did not generate the thoughts, check the 
              thoughts, approve of them and finally publish them. No - the thoughts 
              just come. If we try and stop a thought - it comes anyhow. The thought 
              generator in the head is very active and persistent.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">If we could control our thoughts, if we caused
               them - we could stop certain thoughts and only have happy thoughts from
               now on. But it does not work out that way. Thoughts can be suppressed, 
              but they were already thoughts before they were suppressed. And they 
              come back.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Feelings arise spontaneously and we are not 
              the source of the feelings. We do not generate the feelings, check to 
              see if they are correct or appropriate and finally release them if they 
              are OK. It does not work out like that with feelings too. Feelings arise
               - feelings that are "not good" but they do not leave straight away.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">We do not cause thoughts or feelings - for the
               simple reason is that there is not an "us" there to bring them about. 
              Our nature is universal, eternal and not personal. No-one there to 
              create thoughts and feelings.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Our true nature - Aliveness - Awareness - 
              Consciousness - is there through all thoughts and feelings. How else 
              could we be aware of thoughts or "feel the feelings". Our nature is not 
              in any was reduced by so-called "bad" thoughts or feelings. 
              Consciousness is there -  Aware of it all. Nothing is rejected.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Along comes conceptual thought to us at about 2
               or 2.5 years of age. Pretty soon there is a concept of "me" and  lots 
              of other concepts as well.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">As we grow older more and more concepts are 
              generated. It is not that concepts do not have their place - they do - 
              but in the spiritual quest that is not the case. The spiritual quest is 
              not "sorted" by the mind or concepts.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Feelings that occur are conceptualised. A 
              feeling comes up - at this stage it is the raw feeling - at this stage 
              the feeling is non conceptual. The feeling is felt but there  is 
              initially no labeling. Just the raw feeling.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Very quickly a label is applied to the 
              feeling. The words used may be "anger", "fear", "anxiety" or whatever. 
              But the actual feeling - the raw one - is not  a concept like these. The
               conceptualising seems to "cut us off" from the original actual raw 
              feeling (in reality it does not do this). As we grow older the label is 
              applied with increased speed so the amount of time experiencing the raw 
              feeling seems to be reduced and reduced.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">What is it like to experience the raw feeling?
               It is easy to do - in fact it is happening all the time - so there is 
              nothing that you need to do at all. The initial perception of a feeling 
              is always raw. Even when labels have been applied, the raw feeling is 
              still there being perceived in the immediacy of the present moment.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">You can notice the raw feeling, with no 
              thought at all. Casually looking at the raw feeling. Once again, 
              although it is expressed in these terms, nothing is  happening that is 
              different to what is always happening.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">The raw feeling can feel like a movement of 
              energy (best description) , a buffeting, a turbulance, a pressure or 
              heaviness - or many others - but even these are in the realm of concepts
               being applied to the feelings. Just look at the feeling without thought
               and without conceptualisation (which also means no thought).</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Looking at the real - the raw feeling - the 
              mind slows down or stops. But this is not "mind control". It just 
              happens. There is something very special about seeing  the Real. We do 
              not do it very often - maybe it is a shock to the system ! (joke)</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Cats do it all the time. Dogs too.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Resist the urge to label the raw feeling, 
              describe it, or explain it. If labels, judgments, descriptions or any 
              other thoughts  occur - just let them pass through. No-one there taking 
              delivery of them, as Bob Adamson says.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Once again the pure perception always occurs 
              and there is no labeling, describing or explaining. The usual deal is 
              that the mind comes in and does all that, but it is always after the 
              perception.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">The raw feelings can change and morph while 
              you are looking at them, or they can stay exactly as they are. It is 
              very interesting.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Sometime the raw feeling will disappear 
              completely (and not come back) and be replaced by a sense of joy, 
              excitement or exhilaration.  This sense of joy was in fact there all the
               time - and is your own true nature. It is always there, even if not 
              noticed. It is the smile on The Buddha's face.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Sometimes the raw feeling will change when you
               look at it and move partially away and a feeling of Aliveness and 
              excitement can be felt underneath it. This is difficult to describe - 
              and words are always dualistic.   Then the raw feeling may come back and
               at the same time the Aliveness feeling is there as well (as it always 
              is).</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Sometimes the feeling can feel like a movement
               of raw energy, but that movement changes in the way it moves, and in 
              its intensity.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">In doing this you are not being the "watcher" 
              or the "witness", which are conceptualisations after the fact. All that 
              is occurring is what always occurs, but may not have been noticed.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">This is not done as a strategy, a method of 
              getting rid of the feeling. There is no ultimate purpose for it and 
              actually  nothing is being done at all. It is not  an investigation, not
               something that will build up your knowledge. Just a looking.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">It is different every time and you cannot compare this time with the last - as this is just conceptualising it all again.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Only ever in this moment. Only a looking. It is not "you" looking - it is just looking occurring.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">The feeling moves on - meaning the raw feeling
               - in its own time. It is not "our" feeling and never was. It may 
              implode immediately or hang around for a day or so.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">You may not notice the raw feeling go and only
               realised some time later that it has gone. Sometimes the raw feeling 
              may suddenly disappear like the finale of a fireworks display.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">The raw feeling is not a problem at all. In fact it is just sensation and can be quite interesting and even sensual.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">The feeling is only a problem when it is 
              conceptualised and when a story is woven around the feeling ("me" and my
               story). But all of this is in addition to the actual. It is the added 
              conceptuality of the "me", the conceptual labels, and of course the 
              story - which is conceptual. So just stick with the real - the raw 
              feeling.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">This is not to say that the raw feeling will 
              not be painful.  Pain is actual - it is real - but the pain can be 
              conceptualised too, and story woven into it. So if the pain is there - 
              just stick with that - do not multiply the pain with layers of 
              conceptualisation on top of it.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Interestingly, the story does not run with the
               raw feeling. The story needs the conceptualisation (of the raw feeling)
               , which is the trigger into the mindstream.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">As the conceptualisation of the feeling starts
               to fall away the perception of the original raw feeling may very well 
              be enhanced. There is now no veil of conceptualisation there, which 
              appeared to have  a "deadening" effect on perception.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Sticking with the raw feeling is very 
              interesting and good fun. All that is actually there (leaving out mind 
              content, of course) is the raw feeling and Consciousness itself.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Normally both are conceptualised, but when the
               feeling is not conceptualised, the conceptualisation about our own 
              nature can fall away too.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Very often it is amazingly clear, by direct experience, that "we are not the perceived - we are that which perceives ".</p>
              <p class="intro_para">At that point the mind shuts down of itself.</p>
              <p class="intro_para">Have fun with this.</p>

              <p>This is not to say that the raw feeling will not be painful. Pain is actual - it is real - but the pain can be conceptualised too, and story woven into it. So if the pain is there - just stick with that - do not multiply the pain with layers of conceptualisation on top of it.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, the story does not run with the raw feeling. The story needs the conceptualisation (of the raw feeling) , which is the trigger into the mindstream.</p>
              <p>As the conceptualisation of the feeling starts to fall away the perception of the original raw feeling may very well be enhanced. There is now no veil of conceptualisation there, which appeared to have a "deadening" effect on perception.</p>
              <p>Sticking with the raw feeling is very interesting and good fun. All that is actually there (leaving out mind content, of course) is the raw feeling and Consciousness itself.</p>
              <p>Normally both are conceptualised, but when the feeling is not conceptualised, the conceptualisation about our own nature can fall away too.</p>
              <p>Very often it is amazingly clear, by direct experience, that "we are not the perceived - we are that which perceives ".</p>
              <p>At that point the mind shuts down of itself.</p>
              <p>Have fun with this.</p>

              <p>"....the ‘I am’ is over - you are no longer intent on verbalizing what you are. All definitions apply to your body only and to its expressions. Once this obsession with the body goes, you will revert to your natural state.</p>
              <p>We discover the natural state by being earnest, by searching, enquiring, questioning daily and hourly, by giving one’s life to this discovery"</p>

              <p>"Those who are highly evolved maintain an undiscriminating perception. Seeing everything, labeling nothing, they maintain their awareness of the Great Oneness. Thus they are supported by it. "</p>
