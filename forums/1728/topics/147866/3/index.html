            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I hope your brother is fine! I fancy that many of us do encounter people who have thoughts of attempting suicide, so I'm going to write some things here to share about how we could deal with suicide better.<br><br>MYTH #1<br>"Better don't talk about suicide"<br><br>NO! When people leave clues to tell you they wanna commit suicide, they are usually more ready to talk about it than you. It is important they get the chance to talk about it openly to someone they trust, without fear of being reprimanded or blamed. A direct way would be, to ask in a calm and concerned manner, "Have you ever thought of hurting yourself?" This would indicate to the person that you are truly concerned and you are open to talk about it.<br><br>MYTH #2<br>"People who say they want to commit suicide just want attention. They do not have the guts to really do it."<br><br>NO NO!! Many-a-times when people say they wanna commit suicide, or leave some clues for you to guess their intention to die, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>that's already a desperate plea for help!</strong> </span>Even if it were an attention-seeking attempt, there's nothing wrong and they do need help. Worse still, some people don't intend to die, but accidentally die in their 'pseudo-suicidal attempts'. So never take chances!<br><br>IMPT FACTORS TO LOOK OUT FOR:<br><strong>1. Previous suicidal attempts </strong><br>- anybody who has history of suicidal attempts are in higher risk of suicide. Important question: if you'd attempted suicide in the past, what stopped you from doing so? if you never attempted before, what stopped you?<br><br><strong>2. Concrete suicide plan</strong><br>- does he/she have a concrete plan of how to die?<br><br><strong>3. Resources &amp; Support</strong><br>- an important question is, <strong>who else knows</strong>? Who can offer some support for him/her? Is there any other person around to at least ensure he/she is safe? Is there a support system, whereby family members/friends regularly keep in contact with him/her to ensure things are fine?<br><br>These are the 3 most important factors to consider. Other factors include suicidal ideation, level of stress, availability of means to suicide, etc.<br><br>If you notice that this person is perpetually emotionally down, you should also encourage him/her to see the doctor, in case it would develop/has developed into depression, which would definitely increase suicide risk. Depression is something totally treatable and the pain &amp; agony can be reduced through early treatment.<br><br>NEVER HANDLE IT ALONE!<br>I want to emphasize that it can be very difficult and scary to deal with someone who has suicidal thoughts. One also needs to be properly trained for that. <strong>So never do it alone!</strong> The most important is to ensure a <strong>support system </strong>is being established for this person, and then immediately seek professional help.<br><br>RESOURCES TO TAP ON<br>The National Family Service Centre (FSC) Helpline is: 1800-838-0100.<br><br>Alternatively, you could go to this link:<br><br>Scroll down to the part which says "3. Advanced Search" and key in the person's postal code number - you would be able to obtain the direct address and contact number of the Family Service Centre that serves the area where your relative/friend stays.<br><br>The FSC Helpline and FSC contacts usually operate within office hours. So if one needs to speak to somebody really late at night, you could call SOS: 1800-221-4444.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Another note:<br><br>It is also important to engage in spiritual practice and dedicate to your relative/friend who is undergoing such suffering. While professional help is a must-must, we should not undermine the importance of spiritual methods.<br><br>You could practise anything, chant mantras, chant sutras, chant Buddha's name, meditate on renunciation, giving rise to Bodhicitta, practise giving, metta meditation, anything...as long as it's Dharma practice and dedicate it to your friend/relative, for the end of suffering and end to cause of suffering, for his/her enlightenment. If you know the practice of Tonglen meditation (taking and giving), it is a very useful method too, to reduce the suffering of your friend/relative.<br><br>Remember, whatever practice you engage in, always do it with a MOTIVATION of compassion/bodhicitta, and DEDICATE the merits to your friend/relative and other sentient beings. That's perhaps the best that you can give to your friend/relative.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
