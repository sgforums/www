            <div class='col-md body'>I'm glad everything turned out all right. Besides professional counseling, what you can do to help is to chant Da Bei water and spread it in and around your house especially your brotherÂ’s room.<br><br>In case you donÂ’t know how to chant it. You can download and play the sound file <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=147351" rel="nofollow"> here </a> and chant along while holding a small bottle of mineral water just in front of your chest. I think itÂ’s better to chant at least 60 times. If you donÂ’t like others to know that youÂ’re spreading the water. You can drill a tiny hole on the cap of the bottle. Then just walk around and squeeze it out.<br></div>

Yes, I think he needs some counselling. If a person has a lot of accumulated things that causes depression and cant find a way out himself, and let go, then there might be a danger in the future.<br><br>Also hopefully you can take refuge soon, and eventually also let your brother know the Dharma teachings... I believe it will help him.</div>

'Fa Yin' is just a respectful name for his speech recordings.<br><br>And I've heard about your master for long, he is very famous in Taiwan. They even own a TV channel here. I watch it sometimes too.

I think sometimes its more than that, and sometimes with bad thoughts in mind he may have to fall into lower realms.<br><br>By knowing the existence of Rebirth, one should know very well to avoid doing a silly act like committing suicide.</div>
