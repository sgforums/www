              <p><em>Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and spritual; and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.</em> -Albert Einstein<br><br><strong><em></em></strong></p>
              <p><strong><em>If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism</em>.</strong> -Albert Einstein<br><em></em></p>
              <em></em>
              <p><em>A human being is part of the whole, called by us 'Universe'; a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compasion to embrace all living creatures and the whole nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely but striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.</em><br>-Albert Einstein<br><br><br><em>The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed. -Albert Einstein </em><br><em></em></p>

              <p>Some people from the god religion told me unlike god who is a heavenly being, Buddha was only a human, so how can Buddha help us if he was only a human.</p>
              <p>My reply to them was : God has all the emotions that humans have (anger, sad, happy etc.) but Buddha does not have the emotions like humans. So, who is more human ?</p>
              <p>Buddha was a very humble man. Today, even if a Buddha is reborn in this human world, he will not claim that he is a higher being or he is a Buddha. Just like Master Yin Guangï¼ˆå�°å…‰å¤§å¸ˆ), he was Great Strength Bodhisttava (å¤§åŠ¿è‡³è�©è�¨) reincarnated but he did not claim who he was till his departure that someone who knew said that he was in fact a Bodhisttava. If this person did not come forward, no one will know that å�°å…‰å¤§å¸ˆ was a Bodhisttava. </p>

              <p>The Buddha was reborn time and time again as a sentient being, just like us all.  He understood the stresses and vexation that craving and ignorance brings.  However, he also managed to cultivate till he saw right through to Ultimate Reality.  Hence, he was able to teach others to do the same; leading many out of delusion into reality, and into freedom from rebirth.</p>

              <p>so anyway, i think can rid the name of the quoter, just read the quote itself IF it's meaningful from a "scientific" perspective can already. my initial aim is for the person who said he rather believe in science and i tot Einstein is very well known in science.</p>

              <p>Buddha of all beings is as elaborated in the Heart Sutra - the form &amp; formless are sort of cartoon-like where living beings recognize mirages while Buddha recognizes loving-kindness only. Below is a concise and terse text explained in Confucius teachings on Buddha is for reference as well.</p>
              <strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Heart Sutra</span></strong>
              <p>Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, meditating deeply on Perfection of Wisdom, saw clearly that the five aspects of human existence are empty*, and so released himself from suffering.  Answering the monk Sariputra, he said this:</p>
              <blockquote>Body is nothing more than emptiness, <br>emptiness is nothing more than body. <br>The body is exactly empty, <br>and emptiness is exactly body.
              <p>The other four aspects of human existence -- <br>feeling, thought, will, and consciousness -- <br>are likewise nothing more than emptiness, <br>and emptiness nothing more than they.</p>
              <p>All things are empty: <br>Nothing is born, nothing dies, <br>nothing is pure, nothing is stained, <br>nothing increases and nothing decreases.</p>
              <p>So, in emptiness, there is no body, <br>no feeling, no thought, <br>no will, no consciousness. <br>There are no eyes, no ears, <br>no nose, no tongue, <br>no body, no mind. <br>There is no seeing, no hearing, <br>no smelling, no tasting, <br>no touching, no imagining. <br>There is nothing seen, nor heard, <br>nor smelled, nor tasted, <br>nor touched, nor imagined.</p>
              <p>There is no ignorance, <br>and no end to ignorance. <br>There is no old age and death, <br>and no end to old age and death. <br>There is no suffering, no cause of suffering, <br>no end to suffering, no path to follow. <br>There is no attainment of wisdom, <br>and no wisdom to attain.</p>
              <p>The Bodhisattvas rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, <br>and so with no delusions, <br>they feel no fear, <br>and have Nirvana here and now.</p>
              <p>All the Buddhas, <br>past, present, and future, <br>rely on the Perfection of Wisdom, <br>and live in full enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The Perfection of Wisdom is the greatest mantra. <br>It is the clearest mantra, <br>the highest mantra, <br>the mantra that removes all suffering.</p>
              <p>This is truth that cannot be doubted. <br>Say it so:</p>
              <blockquote>Gaté, <br>gaté, <br>paragaté, <br>parasamgaté. <br>Bodhi! <br>Svaha!</blockquote></blockquote>
              <p>Which means...</p>
              <blockquote>Gone, <br>gone, <br>gone over, <br>gone fully over. <br>Awakened! <br>So be it!</blockquote>

              <p>Buddha was a very humble man. Today, even if a Buddha is reborn in this human world, he will not claim that he is a higher being or he is a Buddha.

              <p>well that was why Buddha hesitated to teach initially. the truth he realised is not easily understood and profound. coupled with delusion, ignorance and existing religions that taught about god. the concept of god is as old as mankind even surviving to this day and age.</p>

              <p>ya, i heard it before. they said it in chinese, more impactful. Buddhism is äººæœ¬(human-based), god religion is ç¥žæœ¬ (God-based). God is 'higher' than human.</p>
              <p>can say Buddhism is also ä½›æœ¬(Buddha-based). transcend both Human-based and God-based.</p>
