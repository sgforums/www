              The moment she told me that, I was really, really, surprised.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I was raised as a Muslim, and like any other Muslim kid in
              Indonesia, I had to learn how to recite the Quran. My father hired a Quran
              tutor for me and I spent a couple of hours 3 days a week with her. I did not
              only learn how to recite the Quran from her, I also learned about Islam in
              general, about what Islam (well, at least her version of Islam) teaches us.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>One of the things that I learned from her was that entering
              paradise is a Muslim privilege. No matter how many good things you have done
              before you kick the bucket, if you are not a Muslim, then bad news for you.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Even back then, I had a problem accepting that part of the
              religious teaching.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Here is the thing, I was born into the Muslim tradition because
              my father is a Muslim man. However, that was not the only tradition that I was
              born into.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>My mother is a Catholic woman, a devout one in my opinion. When
              I was very little, I spent a lot of time with my grandparents from my mother’s
              side. They had to babysit me a lot because both my parents were working back
              then.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>They had a lot of Catholic ornaments in their house – crucifixes
              on the walls, a statue of Virgin Mary, pictures of various saints, and many
              others. They would tell me stories about Jesus when they were babysitting me
              and I liked those stories.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>When I was not being babysat by them, my father usually told me
              to perform<span> </span><em>shalat</em><span> </span>prayers with him. I did not know how
              to actually perform the prayers, of course, but I would just follow the
              movements from him.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>That was my early childhood. I was always aware of the fact that
              my parents had different religious backgrounds. I did not have any problem
              accepting that fact – it all just made sense to me. I also knew that there were
              other people with other religious beliefs out there and thought that all of
              those different beliefs were as valid as mine. I had already identified as a
              Muslim at the time. If anyone asked me what my religion was, I would answer:
              Islam.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I never thought that my religion was superior to others, though.
              Until my Quran tutor taught me otherwise.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Becoming agnostic</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I guess that was the starting point of the journey that led me
              to become an agnostic-atheist.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I had a problem accepting the doctrine of the superiority of
              Islam over other religious beliefs, that only Muslims can enter paradise after
              the apocalypse. I loved my grandparents and I thought that it was not fair that
              they were going to hell just because they believed in God in a different way
              than I did. As I grew up, I started having other questions regarding other
              aspects of Islam such as the role of women in the traditional views of Islam
              and LGBT rights, but I was also afraid to question those views further because
              I did not want to go to hell for doubting my faith.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>It wasn't until my second year of university that I finally
              stopped practicing Islam. I stopped performing<span><em> </em></span><em>shalat</em>, I stopped
              going to the<span> </span><em>masjid</em><span> </span>(mosque) every Friday, and I stopped
              performing<span> </span><em>shawm</em><span> </span>(fasting) during Ramadan. I did not
              identify as a Muslim anymore. I was not an atheist yet at the time. I was kind
              of a deist, still believing in a “higher power” of some sort. But I had finally
              become a<em>murtadin</em><span> </span>(apostate).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I was not open about my epiphany to my parents. I lived in a<span><em> </em></span><em>kost</em><span> </span>(a boarding house for university
              students) in Yogyakarta when I first stopped identifying as a Muslim, while my
              parents lived in Jakarta, so that made it easier for me. But every time I went
              back to my parents’ house in Jakarta, I would pretend that I was still a
              Muslim.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I would try to get out of the house every time it was near
              prayer time, because I did not want to pray with my father. Of course I could
              not always get out of the house during prayer time, so I had to pretend to pray
              with my father during those occasions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #4c4c4c;">"The main crisis that humanity faces now is not
              religion, as many atheists would suggest. it is the oppressive power structures
              that oppress lgbt people, religious minorities (including but not limited to
              atheists), women, the working class and other oppressed groups."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Ramadan was the hardest challenge for me. I had to pretend that
              I was fasting and think of how to sneak food into my room without getting
              caught. Every time I went back to Jakarta during university break, I could not
              wait to go home to my kost in Yogyakarta.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Exploring Buddhism</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I began to have curiosity about Buddhism during my first years
              of apostasy. I read a lot about Buddhism and also went to the local Buddhist
              temple near my kost to learn more about it. I used to meditate regularly, and I
              am still trying to now.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I was really into Buddhism for a while, until I grew skeptical
              of its supernatural aspects. I still think that Buddhism is a wonderful means
              of spirituality, though. You might even call me a Buddhist-atheist or a secular
              Buddhist. I just find it hard to believe in the supernatural aspects of
              Buddhism, or in supernaturalism in general.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>What first made me became more skeptical of supernaturalism were
              the works of Richard Dawkins and other prominent figures of the New Atheist
              movement. I read<span> </span><em>The God
              Delusion</em><span> </span>and also watched
              his speech on YouTube. If you did not know, Buddhism is a non-theistic
              religion. So even before I became a full-time atheist, I already had a problem
              with the concept of an anthropomorphic god.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>One of the things that got me into Buddhism in the first place
              is that it does not have a belief in such a god. When I became interested in
              New Atheism in general, I started to be more and more skeptical about any
              supernatural claim, and, consequently, the supernatural aspects of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Before I knew it, I became an atheist.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Becoming an atheist</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Becoming an atheist was not a conscious decision for me. It was
              not like I woke up one day in the morning and said to myself, “I think I want
              to be an atheist!” There was not an exact moment when I knew I was an atheist.
              Being an atheist was more of an outcome of a long thought process in my
              experience. When I realized that I was, technically, already an atheist, I
              joined the Indonesian Atheists group on Facebook.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>When I first started identifying as an atheist, I was somewhat
              into the New Atheists movement. Yes, I was “that kind of atheist”, which I am
              now quite ashamed of. I was borderline Islamophobic, partly because as an
              apostate, I was oppressed by the Muslim hegemony in Indonesia, and also because
              I had to pretend to believe in Islam in front of my family.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>Most of the atheists I knew from the Facebook group were also
              these arrogant, militant atheists, who influenced me to turn into one.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>It was my interest in Leftist discourses, especially in anarchism,
              that made me ditch the New Atheist movement eventually. I realized that the
              prominent New Atheists like Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, and Christopher
              Hitchens are U.S. Imperialist apologists. I also learned about feminism, which
              made me come to the conclusion that Dawkins is sexist.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I am still an atheist, an agnostic-atheist to be exact. I do not
              claim that I know there is no God, I am just skeptical that such God exists.
              However, I am a different atheist from what I was before. Rather than putting my
              energy into debating religious people that they are wrong about God, I am more
              concerned about other important issues like gender, race, class, the
              environment, and human rights.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I have also stopped making hasty generalizations about religious
              people, as many atheists tend to do. I know a lot of religious people, who are
              also feminist and LGBT-allies, while, on the other hand, there are a lot of
              atheists who are sexist, racist and classist, which proves that bigotry is not
              exclusive to religious people.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>I am not denying that many religious people use religion as a
              justification to perpetuate oppression, but there are also religious people who
              use their own interpretation of religion to combat oppression. Religion is
              about interpretation after all; you can use the interpretation that supports
              the status quo, or you can use the one that challenges it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 7.5pt 0in 22.45pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4c4c4c;'>The main crisis that humanity faces now is not religion, as many
              atheists would suggest. It is the oppressive power structures that oppress LGBT
              people, religious minorities (including but not limited to atheists), women,
              the working class and other oppressed groups. All people, no matter their
              religious, racial, or national backgrounds, should work together to dismantle
              this oppressive power structure.</span></p>

              me a Magdalene, unique and determined in the hope that other atheists or all of
              humanity in general, will understand this and fight for a just world. –<span> </span><strong>Rappler.com</strong></span></p>
