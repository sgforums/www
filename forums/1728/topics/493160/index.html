              Eight-Fold Path Can Be Followed With a Six-Figure Salary</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">SETH MYDANSDEC. 20, 2016
              The New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">PATHUM THANI, Thailand — It is a temple for a changing
              Thailand: clean, unadorned, high-tech and unashamed of praying for wealth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Sit here and get rich,” read small medallions embedded in
              the floor under each white plastic chair in a vast, open-sided meditation
              center. In his sermons, the temple’s charismatic 72-year-old leader, Phra Dhammachayo,
              often exhorts his adherents, “Be rich, be rich, be rich!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With its endorsement of worldly comforts and its no-nonsense
              approach to ritual, the temple, known as Wat Dhammakaya and the largest in
              Thailand, has attracted the allegiance of growing numbers of followers in a
              movement whose popularity has unsettled the government and the Buddhist
              hierarchy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The authorities have long tried to clip its wings, and for
              the past month the police have been threatening to arrest Phra Dhammachayo
              despite a warning by the temple that it would mobilize a human shield of
              chanting monks to protect him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The charge against him is embezzlement, the latest of many
              accusations that stretch decades, while the top body of Buddhism has accused
              him of heresy. Last week, it stripped him of his title, though that does not
              seem to have threatened his status on the grounds of Wat Dhammakaya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Novice monks placed their sandals in neat rows before
              entering the temple’s meditation room. The Dhammakaya approach emphasizes
              cleanliness and order. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The temple is the spiritual embodiment of the social and
              economic dislocations that have shaken Thailand. The economic boom of the 1980s
              created a well-to-do middle class for whom moneymaking rivaled Buddhist
              tradition as a core value. They needed something that brought the two together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Cash machines are placed conveniently near a meditation hall
              with screens that declare, “Shortcut to making merit,” the important virtue of
              doing good deeds. As a merit-making bonus, credit card points earned by the
              transaction can go directly to the temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Buddha never taught us to live in hardship,” said the temple
              spokesman, Phra Pasura Dantamano. He added: “Buddha teaches moderation, but
              there are different levels of society. If I were a businessman or a farmer I
              would define moderation in a different way.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This perspective is a departure from traditional Thai
              Buddhism, in which there is less acceptance of wealth, said Suwanna
              Satha-Anand, a professor of philosophy at Chulalongkorn University.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“They crafted a possibility of a new form of Buddhism which
              is friendly to capitalism or wealth,” she said. “This is the voice of the urban
              middle or upper class who are looking for a more modern image of what a
              Buddhist can be.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Well-designed websites promise a form of meditation that is
              “simple, easy and effective.” The temple itself manifests cleanliness and
              efficiency alongside tech-savvy sophistication. Its huge boxy buildings are
              aggressively plain, finished with unpainted gray concrete. It has no spire, few
              bells and little incense.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Phra Dhammachayo, the temple’s leader, last year. For the
              past month the police have threatened to arrest him on a charge of
              embezzlement, while the top body of Buddhism has accused him of heresy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But it does not lack grandeur. Its centerpiece is a huge,
              flat dome more than 2,000 feet in diameter that even the temple concedes looks
              like a flying saucer. It radiates wealth. The dome’s surface consists of
              300,000 small Buddha statues made of silicon gold, each as tall as an open hand
              and engraved with the name of a donor — suggested donation 10,000 baht, or
              about $300.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">On special occasions, the vast plaza around the dome is the
              scene of spectacular gatherings — tens of thousands of monks in orange and
              worshipers in white — that rival an Olympics opening ceremony. The monks circle
              the dome as if the little statues had come to life, and they sit in perfect,
              ordered rows that seem to stretch to the horizon. At night, they march with
              glowing lights, and thousands of lighter-than-air lanterns float into the sky.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In keeping with the stark design of the temple, even these
              extravagant displays are marked by almost militaristic order and precision.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The same rapid rise to prosperity that inspired the
              popularity of Wat Dhammakaya also underlies the political divisions and
              outbreaks of violence that have shaken Thailand in recent years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Those divisions are being held in check by a military junta
              that seized power in 2014. “When you have hundreds of thousands of devotees,
              some people with power would be scared of that,” Phra Pasura said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He compared the Dhammakaya movement to the populist rise of
              Thaksin Shinawatra, a prime minister who was ousted in another coup, in 2006,
              and now lives in exile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> “People are afraid
              that if we get too large we could be a threat,” Phra Pasura said. He would not
              estimate the number of followers, but said they were in the hundreds of
              thousands.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the moment, the government is pursuing several cases
              against Phra Dhammachayo, the foremost of which is a charge that he embezzled
              $40 million from a credit union. He has said he was unaware of the source of
              the funds, and his followers have paid off the debt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the government is still trying to bring him to court. For
              weeks, the police have been threatening to seize him, at one point saying they
              were ready to deploy 2,000 officers to confront what was likely to be a phalanx
              of monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is a common pattern in Thailand of threat and retreat,
              whether for the surrender of “red shirt” demonstrators in 2010 or for monks at
              another temple earlier this year to give up their tame tigers at a moneymaking
              petting zoo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Phra Dhammachayo has refused to turn himself in, asserting
              that he suffers from diabetes and Turner syndrome, a chromosomal disorder. He
              has not been seen in public for six months, and there is no confirmation that
              he is still inside the temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Wherever he is, Phra Dhammachayo remains a magnetic figure
              who draws intense devotion from his followers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The temple has been controversial because of its ostentatious
              wealth, its challenge to mainstream Buddhism, and its message that it is fine
              for followers to be rich. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“I am what I am because of him,” said Watjana Suriyatham, 51,
              an assistant professor of English at Thammasat University.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mirella Kampus, 34, a Swiss member of the staff, said she had
              been at the temple for six years and had found her calling there. “If I had not
              known him, my life would be difficult,” she said. “I would not have found a
              reason for my life.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The son of an engineer, Phra Dhammachayo studied economics at
              Kasetsart University, but he had already dedicated himself to Buddhism. Soon
              after graduation, he founded the little meditation center that grew to become
              the largest temple in Thailand, with a territory that it says comprises 1,000
              acres.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">He also seems to be a man of unusual visions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 2012, in an account disseminated by the temple’s websites,
              he told his followers that Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, had been
              reincarnated and was living in a six-story heavenly palace made of silver and
              crystal glass and served by a staff of 20 not far from Apple’s Cupertino,
              Calif., headquarters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The vast temple grounds today seem hushed and still.
              Meditation halls are filled with the chanting of hundreds of monks and
              worshipers, sometimes with the aid of a karaoke-style scroll on a large screen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the temple, cleanliness and order are an important
              element of good karma. Devotees are expected not only to dress in white, but
              also to remove their sandals and place them in regimented rows when entering
              meditation rooms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Not everyone is chanting. With its vast underground parking
              garage, clean toilets, free food and sheltered plazas, the temple is a refuge
              from the noisy outside world. Families often come to meditate together, to
              picnic and even to stay the night in tents that are provided for them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ms. Kampus compared the pristine temple to Switzerland.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“My country is very clean,” she said. “When I came to
              Thailand, oh my god! But the temple is very clean.” She added, “If you keep
              orderliness outside, you are orderly inside and it is easier to meditate.”</span></p>
