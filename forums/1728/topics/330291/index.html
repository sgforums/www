              <p>Hi guys.</p>
              <p>I am a scizophrenic and trying very hard to practise on top of the sounds that are trying to disturb me when I practise.</p>
              <p>I got caught in sort of slandering the Buddha in my thoughts. These thoughts are so real that I am very afraid that I would go to hell.</p>
              <p>How do I repent? I have not done anything physically or verbally. But these sounds that are pestering me are so intellligent that they can mislead me into directing wrong thoughts to Buddhism/Buddha. A thought can be very dangerous.</p>
              <p>How I wish the sounds could go away.</p>

              <p>I remember Master Yin Shun talk about this mental hindrance before, and what he suggested was to always stay as calm as possible by chanting the name of Buddha or any Bodhisattva you like, point is <strong>must </strong>concentrate and <strong>ignore</strong> all these voices in your ears or even images manifested infront of you. Unable to control you ( due to your concentration), these hindrances will slowly retreat to the origin where they came! ( Concentration can be achiveved by listening <strong>attentively</strong> to your own voice chanting, each time u realise that u are driffting away to other thoughts or distractions, immediately pull your thoughts back to your chanting. It's like a tug of war within yourself but as long as you realise it yourself, u can come back.) </p>
              <p> It may not be easy of cos but after a few "fights" you should be able to face these voices differently, and due to your new confidence, they will subsides and totally dissappear one day. It may takes time, so don't panic and must be patient. Of cos I believe you are seeking medical advise as well, so you must trust yourself that you can do it.</p>

              <p>Oh, another D.I.Y method from me on how to ignore those voices: just imagine those voices as your mom's, wife's, or girlfriends' constant naggings. You won't be afraid and wld be on switch off mode automatically. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> ( sorrrrrry, all moms n sisters...)  </p>
              <p>Images are difficult to ignore though...just chant as loud as possible, i guess.</p>

              <p><br>ic...just treat them as one of the traffic noise or noices in the office or public places while you'r working or outdoors.</p>
              <p>But really glad to hear that you r actually coping well by the day! And I think since you r fully aware of the wrong or inappropriate thoughts and realised yourself where they came from, then you are "safe" in the sense that you will want to seek recourse to help yourself. There are ppl who don't even know they have commited wrong thoughts, speeches or actions. This is unfortunate as it means that they may continue to plant the unwholesom deeds without remorse.</p>
              <p>So don't be afraid, sincerely repent and you will be on the right path again.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Sometimes i too have such slandering thoughts. But the more you worried bout it, the more it occurs. For me i just leave them as it is. Even if evil thoughts arises just dont try to focus on it bah..just like if u have a cut on ur skin u dont have too concentrate on the pain.</p>
              <p>Perhaps this is a struggle between the human mind. There is no battle outside but rather a battle within oneself. There is a demon in our minds. Just like how Buddha resisted the temptation by Mara, so do we too struggle within. I like the way some people phrase it. In Islam, this is call a jihad. A Jihad is commonly perceived as a holy way, but it also has the defination of an inner struggle in our mind. I believe every religion is trying to tell us that we must conquer our inner demon.</p>

              <p>Slandering Buddha with bad intention is certainly bad karma. When those "crazy zen" Buddhist say that Buddha Nature is everywhere, they do not do so with bad intention.</p>
              <p>They are merely talking from their own realisation -- Buddha Nature is really all pervading. There is no bad or malicious intent here.</p>
              <p>But if you give rise to bad intention to defame the Buddha, that is certainly bad karma.</p>
