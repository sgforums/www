              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Wendy Joan Biddlecombe OCT 12, 2017 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lisa Droski, who is a member of the Grand Rapids Buddhist
              Temple, spent three weeks treating patients on St. Thomas with the Red Cross.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Disaster Relief Nurse and Buddhist Practitioner Recounts
              Serving in the U.S. Virgin Islands</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As Texas and Louisiana reeled from Hurricane Harvey, and as
              Hurricane Irma set her sights on the Caribbean, Lisa Droski packed her bags.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Droski, a Buddhist practitioner who lives in Grand Rapids,
              Michigan, is a retired registered nurse and current volunteer with the American
              Red Cross.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shortly after arriving in the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix
              by way of San Juan and Houston, Droski hopped a military transport to St.
              Thomas, where her medical expertise was desperately needed after Hurricane Irma
              made landfall in early September. She was on the island when Hurricane Maria
              came two weeks later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Two category five hurricanes hit the U.S. Virgin Islands last
              month, knocking out the power grid and leaving residents without electricity,
              water, food, and access to essentials. The chain of islands, situated about 40
              miles east of Puerto Rico, are home to about 106,000 people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Droski spoke with Tricycle shortly after returning to the
              continental U.S. about the conditions in the Virgin Islands, the work that
              still needs to be done, and how her practice helped her endure three weeks of
              service.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">How did you end up
              doing volunteer work on St. Thomas? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I’ve been a nurse with the Red Cross Disaster Health Services
              for many years. I’m on the national team, so I usually respond to large-scale
              disasters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I had been asked to go to Hurricane Harvey, but I was out of
              the country at the time. When Irma came, I was home, and my local Red Cross
              chapter called and asked if I could volunteer. I said “certainly.” They had
              first planned to send me to Florida, and then they asked me to go to St. Croix
              in the Virgin Islands. I was on St. Croix for about five minutes before they
              sent me to St. Thomas on a passenger jet chartered by the military.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When we landed, I was taken to the Red Cross headquarters in
              an office building. I was the only Disaster Health Services person across three
              islands when I got there, so they made me the head of the Disaster Health
              Services. I was my own boss.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Within 24 hours a lot of other relief workers came in. I
              worked with a very talented EMT, as well as people from disaster mental health
              services, and we started working in the largest local shelter on St. Thomas,
              which had been run by the local Red Cross and the Department of Human Services
              on St. Thomas since before Irma. There were close to 200 people in the shelter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What were the
              conditions in St. Thomas like? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There was a curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day, and
              there was no cell phone communication. I had absolutely no Internet, like most
              people. The stores that were open had really long lines. ATMs and all those
              kinds of daily things that people have gotten used to weren’t working.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When it started to seem like conditions were improving a
              little bit, Hurricane Maria came. About half of the Red Cross folks on St.
              Thomas went home, because we were told in no uncertain terms that if we stayed,
              we might not have food and water. Many people elected to go home, or left
              because their families wanted them home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">About 30 of us stayed on the island, and I was assigned to an
              evacuation shelter in a middle school. We took care of about 130 people in two
              rooms over four days. We had the support of the Puerto Rico National Guard
              members, who were there even when their own families and homes were taking a
              direct hit.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The logistics of getting aid to people is really daunting.
              Everything has to come in by barge. There were boats sunk in the harbor, and
              there were landslides. Even driving a minivan was dangerous, because there was
              still debris on some of the roads—you could go around a blind curve and find a
              broken telephone pole with miles of downed wire. We had numerous flat tires.
              You just can’t get around.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Why did you decide to
              stay for the second storm? What did you weigh in your decision?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I thought, “OK, these folks have been through a category five
              hurricane already and they survived, and the building I’m going to be in seems
              pretty sturdy. I came here to help people, and me leaving now is not helping
              anybody.” I discussed this with my husband, who was a little nervous.  I was a little nervous, too—you’d have to be
              silly not to be nervous—but I wasn’t frightened. I felt that I needed to
              fulfill the mission that I went there to do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What kind of care did
              you administer? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It was mostly mental health needs and helping people who
              needed medication that they couldn’t get otherwise.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">People had been traumatized. The staff was nervous and the
              National Guard members were worried about their families, so most of what I did
              was just listening—mental health first-aid things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After Maria, I was assigned to a shelter with about 30
              elderly and special needs clients who needed a lot of care and probably should
              have been in nursing homes. We did basic care for these folks; bathing them,
              changing diapers, bandaging wounds. That’s not usually what the Red Cross does,
              but that’s what we did.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When we hear about
              hurricanes and other natural disasters, the emphasis is on the number of lives
              lost and physical damage to property. We don’t often hear about the damage a
              storm can do in terms of mental health. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mental health is really overlooked. Staff members get burned
              out, stressed, tired; they want to go home. So we did a lot of counseling with
              the staff and shelter folks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And I learned that mental health is still a stigma on the
              islands. According to family physicians we spoke to, there is only one
              psychiatrist on St. Thomas, who is in his 80s and has pretty much retired. He
              doesn’t prescribe medication and did not practice at all when we were there.
              Most of the primary care physicians are uncomfortable prescribing psychiatric
              meds. So there are a lot of people with mental illness who are not treated, and
              everything becomes exacerbated when you add stress on top.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When did you decide it
              was time to go home?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I went home because my three weeks were up. I was ready. It
              was hot and humid and we were living in very Spartan conditions. We had a
              couple of friendly tarantulas that kept visiting us. I really wanted a bed,
              shower, and clean clothes.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Can you tell me a
              little bit about your Buddhist practice and community? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I am a sangha member of the Grand Rapids Buddhist Temple and
              have been an on-and-off solo Buddhist practitioner since the late 1970s. When I
              started practicing, I didn’t know that there was an English-speaking Buddhist
              temple in Grand Rapids. I started going to that temple a couple of years ago,
              and found it to be a very warm, welcoming teaching community where I
              immediately felt accepted. Last June I got the gifts of the precepts, and I
              really felt the support of the sangha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The new abbot of our sangha is Ai Su Kimberly Hillebrand, and
              she wrote me a metta [lovingkindness] meditation mantra to take with me. I kept
              it in a locket and recited it every morning and evening. It helped keep me
              grounded, and reminded me to use mindfulness to focus on what I was doing at
              the moment without worrying about what was going on around me, even when
              everyone was calling “Nurse, nurse, nurse.” Practicing equanimity was the
              hardest thing, because I saw a lot that I wanted to change.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Are there any lessons
              from your time in St. Thomas that you’ll carry with you from this experience? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I think we all found community. The Red Crossers who were
              there became like family, because we had a common purpose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The people of St. Thomas were very appreciative of us being
              there and let us know that in many ways. There was a Wendy’s and a Kmart on St.
              Thomas that were open, and they had a special line for first responders and
              emergency workers so we could get into the store more quickly. If we needed
              prescriptions filled, they always let us to the front of the line at the drug
              stores.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Do you think your
              Buddhist practice draws you to service?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I felt drawn to help people before, but I think my Buddhist
              practice made it easier for me to understand the interconnectedness of all
              people and things. I wasn’t able to do any formal sitting meditation when I was
              there, but every night right before lights out I would chant the White Tara
              mantra, which really helped me focus on compassion, and then I would sit or lie
              on my cot and try to meditate for a little while. I’m calmer and more in tune
              with other people than when I went to Katrina, particularly, and Sandy, and I
              have some guiding teachings to keep me focused. And I think it’s really
              important for us to know as Buddhists that there are practical ways that we can
              put our Buddhism into action.</span></p>
