              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              know, that sounds like a setup for a bad joke, but it is my reality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I’ve
              had three wives: a Jew, a Christian, and a Buddhist. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              know, that sounds like a setup for a bad joke, but it is my reality. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              grew up in an intolerant Christian fundamentalist church, which tended to see
              other religions, or other branches of Christianity, as either (1) wrong, (2)
              dead wrong, or (3) heathen. Catholics were thought to be all three, and were
              doomed to eternity in hell because they were sprinklers instead of dunkers,
              although I always kind of admired them because they sponsored lively social
              events which sometimes had beer. My church on the other hand, was strict
              Prohibitionist. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              realized the depth of their isolationist approach to life when I was still a
              child in the 1960s, being subject to slide shows and missionary talks from what
              they called “Project Italy.” Now I knew about missionaries, and heard stories
              about going to third-world countries, building homes and bringing water to poor
              African villages, and that all sounded worthwhile and noble. But this church’s
              missionary work had none of that. No, their work involved sending young people
              to Italy to convert Catholics. Even at ten years old, I could see the absurdity
              of the whole concept. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              all seemed pointless, as the prevailing theory was that all non-Christians went
              to hell, all Christians outside of that particular church were going to hell,
              and most people in the church were going to hell too. It seemed like a losing
              game from the beginning. I recall a “fire and brimstone” preacher talking about
              sin, and how he himself had to repent from his misspent youth, when he was
              known for playing fiddle in barn dances (the horror!). You could also earn a
              spot in hell for being a woman and taking authority over a man, or for being a
              man and allowing it to happen. Their attitude towards women seemed normal to me
              at the time, reinforced by the social mores of the 1960s. I grew up thinking
              that all women (with the possible exception of my grade school teachers) stayed
              at home. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              my oldest sister fell in love with and married a Catholic man, my parents
              thought the world had ended, and my dad brought out his bible and set out to
              convert him, lest his immoral ways drag my sister down to Papist hell. But my
              brother-in-law, a good man, stuck to his guns and refused to succumb to
              fundamentalist glory, and married my sister anyway. By the time it was my turn
              to get married, my parents had already been softened somewhat by the
              experience, and realized that any such attempts at conversion would be
              hopeless. I married a Jew. There was much wailing and carrying on, but no
              attempts at conversion. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              moved to San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district, where all thoughts of
              fundamentalism became my past, with my present being an occasional foray into
              the world of such horrible delights as the Unitarians, which always had great
              donuts after service; the Baha’i, whose universal philosophy, egalitarian
              attitude towards women, and Persian hospitality was refreshing; and the Hare
              Krishna, which was delightfully Bohemian and had great Indian food at their
              meetings. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              second wife – the Christian – represented what was, in retrospect, an
              unfortunate instance of backsliding into my childhood. A southern woman who
              made chicken-and-dumplings, her accent, despite the fact that I grew up hearing
              my mother’s own southern twang, sometimes confused me. She insisted on having
              what I thought she called a cannon room in our house. I wondered if perhaps it
              was a throwback to the Civil War, where we would defend our homestead with
              armaments, but in reality she was referring to a “canning room” for preserving
              fruits and vegetables. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              I came to my senses and left her, I wanted to move as far away from my hometown
              as possible. I found that Bangkok was about as far away as I could be without
              leaving the planet, so I moved there, became a Buddhist and met my third wife.
              When we moved back to the United States, we did attend church with my parents
              once. Being as my new wife was from Southeast Asia and had dark skin, the
              reception was decidedly cold, and we never returned. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              I love most about Buddhism is that it is not an exclusive religion. If for
              example, my wife walks into my parents’ old church and announces that she is a
              Buddhist, she would be immediately set upon, Bible-thumped, told that her
              relatives are burning in Hell (yes, that really happened), and told to obey her
              husband. Buddhists on the other hand, don’t evangelize. If you want to know
              about Buddhism, most Buddhists will be happy to tell you, but they’re not
              obligated by their holy books to try to convert you. It takes a lot of pressure
              off of the conversation. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              one thing the church of my childhood did teach me – although unintentionally –
              was tolerance. I saw their intolerance and restrictive attitude towards women
              drive people away, never to return. I saw the futileness of attempting to force
              one’s beliefs on other people. The first time I saw a woman acting in an
              official nature in a church was with the Unitarians, and I was completely blown
              away. I never thought such a thing was possible, and came to realize that it
              didn’t mean the end of humanity as we know it.</span></p>
