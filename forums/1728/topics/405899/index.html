              <p class="style72"><span class="style63 style42"><span class="style49">W</span></span>ithin Buddhism, there are very many important sutras. However, the most important Sutra is the <em><a href="../shurangama/shurangama_contents.asp"><span style="color: #cc6600;">Shurangama Sutra</span></a></em>. If there are places which have the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, then the Proper Dharma dwells in the world. If there is no <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, then the Dharma Ending Age appears. Therefore, we Buddhist disciples, each and every one, must bring our strength, must bring our blood, and must bring our sweat to protect the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. In the <em><a href="../shurangama/shurangama2.asp"><span style="color: #cc6600;">Sutra of the Ultimate Extinction of the Dharma</span></a></em>, it says very, very clearly that in the Dharma Ending Age, the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is the first to disappear, and the rest of the sutras disappear after it. If the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>does not disappear, then the Proper Dharma Age is present. Because of that, we Buddhist disciples must use our lives to protect the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, must use vows and resolution to protect the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, and cause the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>to be known far and wide, reaching every nook and cranny, reaching into each and every dust-mote, reaching out to the exhaustion of empty space and of the Dharma Realm. If we can do that, then there will be a time of Proper Dharma radiating great light. <br><br>Why would the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>be destroyed? It is because it is too true. The <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is the Buddha’s true body. The <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is the Buddha’s sharira. The <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is the Buddha’s true and actual stupa and shrine. Therefore, because the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is so true, all the demon kings use all kinds of methods to destroy the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. They begin by starting rumors, saying that the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is phony. Why do they say the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is phony? It is because the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>speaks too truly, especially in the sections on The Four Decisive Deeds, the Twenty-five Sages Describing Perfect Penetration, and the States of the Fifty Skandha Demons. Those of off-center persuasions and externally-oriented ways, weird demons and strange freaks, are unable to stand it. Consequently there are a good many senseless people who claim that the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is a forgery. <br><br>Now, the principles set forth in the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>are on the one hand proper, and on the other in accord with principle, and the weird demons and strange freaks, those in various cults and sects, all cannot hide away their forms. Most senseless people, in particular unwise scholars and garbage-collecting professors “Tread upon the holy writ.” With their extremely scant and partial understanding, they are confused and unclear, lacking real erudition and true and actual wisdom. That is why they falsely criticize. We who study the Buddhadharma should very deeply be aware of these circumstances. Therefore, wherever we go, we should bring up the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. Wherever we go, we should propagate the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. Wherever we go, we should introduce the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>to people. Why is that? It is because we wish to cause the Proper Dharma long to dwell in the world. <br><br>If the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is regarded as true, then there is no problem. To verify its truth, let me say that if the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>were phony, then I would willingly fall into the hells forever through all eternity - for being unable to recognize the Buddhadharma - for mistaking the false for true. If the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>is true, then life after life in every time I make the vow to propagate the Great Dharma of the Shurangama, that I shall in every time and every place propagate the true principles of the Shurangama. <br><br>Everyone should pay attention to the following point. How could the <em>Shurangama Sutra </em>not have been spoken by the Buddha? No one else could have spoken the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>. And so I hope that all those people who make senseless accusations will wake up fast and stop creating the causes for suffering in the Hell of Pulling Out Tongues. No matter who the scholar is, no matter what country students of the Buddhadharma are from, all should quickly mend their ways, admit their mistakes, and manage to change. There is no greater good than that. I can then say that all who look at the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, all who listen to the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, and all who investigate the <em>Shurangama Sutra</em>, will very quickly accomplish Buddhahood. <br><br>Composed by <br>Gold Mountain Shramana Tripitaka Master Hua</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>[January 1983]<br><br>The Shurangama Sutra is a sutra that acts like a demonspotting mirror in Buddhism. All the celestial demons, externalists, and the li, mei, and wang Liang ghosts reveal their true appearance when they see the Shurangama Sutra. They have no way to hide and no place to which they can flee. And so in the past, when Great Master Zhi Zhe heard of the existence of this sutra, he bowed in the direction of India for eighteen years. For eighteen years, he used this spirit of utmost sincerity to pray for this sutra to be brought to China.<br><br>Of all the greatly virtuous and eminent monks of the past, all the wise and lofty Sanghans, there was not a single one who did not praise the Shurangama Sutra. Therefore, as long as the Shurangama Sutra exists, the Buddhadharma exists. If the Shurangama Sutra is destroyed, then the Buddhadharma will also become extinct. How will the decline of the dharma come about? It will begin with the destruction of the Shurangama Sutra. Who will destroy it? The celestial demons and externalists will. They see the Shurangama Sutra as being like a nail in their eyes and a thorn in their flesh. They can't sit stilt and they can't stand steady; they are compelled to invent a deviant theory that says the Shurangama Sutra is false.<br><br>As Buddhist disciples, we should recognize true principle. Every word of the doctrines in the Shurangama Sutra is the absolute truth. There isn't one word that does not express the truth. So now that we are studying the fifty skandha demons, we should realize even more just how important the Shurangama Sutra is. The Shurangama Sutra is what the deviant demons, ghosts, and goblins fear most.<br><br>The Venerable Master Hsu Yun lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, and during his whole life, he didn't write a commentary for any sutra other than the Shurangama Sutra. He took special care to preserve the manuscript of his commentary on the Shurangama Sutra. He preserved it for several decades, but it was later lost during the Yunmen incident. This was the Elder Hsu's greatest regret in his life. He proposed that, as left-home people, we should study the Shurangama Sutra to the point that we can recite it by memory, from the beginning to the end, and from the end to the beginning, forwards and backwards. That was his proposal. I know that, throughout his whole life, the Elder Hsu regarded the Shurangama Sutra as being especially important.<br><br>When someone informed the Elder Hsu that there were people who said the Shurangama Sutra was false, he explained that the decline of the dharma occurs just because these people try to pass fish eyes off as pearls, confusing people so that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. They make people blind so that they can no longer recognize the Buddhadharma. They take the true as false, and the false as true. Look at these people: This one writes a book, and people all read it. That one writes a book, and they read it too. The real sutras spoken by the Buddha himself are put up on the shelf, where no one ever reads them. From this, we can see that living beings' karmic obstacles are very heavy. If they hear deviant knowledge and deviant views, they readily believe them. If you speak dharma based on proper knowledge and proper views, they won't believe it. Speak it again, and they still won't believe it.<br><br>Why? Because they don't have sufficient good roots and foundations. That's why they have doubts about the proper dharma. They are skeptical and unwilling to believe.<br></p></div>
