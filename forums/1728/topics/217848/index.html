            <div class='col-md body'>for info :<br><br><blockquote>The commentaries on the Vinaya Pitaka[49] and the Anguttara-nikaya[50] say that the eight important rules which the Buddha gave to the Bhikkhuni Sangha will make his Teachings last for five thousand years rather than five hundred. There will be one thousand years for <strong>Arahats who attain analytical insight</strong>, one thousand years for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Arahats without those attainments</span>, one thousand years for Non-returners, one thousand years for Once-returners, and one thousand years for Stream-winners. After these five thousand years of penetration of the true Doctrine (pativedha-sadhamma),[51] the accomplishment in the texts (pariyatti-dhamma) will remain. After the accomplishment in the texts disappears, the signs (linga) will continue for a long time. </blockquote><a href="http://www.ubakhin.com/uchittin/arimet/ARIMET03.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubakhin.com/uchittin/arimet/ARIMET03.html</a><br><br>so there are 2 kinds of arahats, with or w/o analytical insight. the really genuine ones are much insightful.<br><br>/\<br></div>

There are many today who continue to have a deep insight into the reality of No-Self, and with such insights he will break the 3 fetters of Sceptical Doubt, Belief in existence of a 'self', and attachment to Superstitions, Wrongly rituals and rites, etc. Then as he breaks more fetters he will advance to 2nd, 3rd, stage of Arhat and finally when all fetters are destroyed he attains 4th stage. It is very likely that one or more Non-returner (3rd stage) or higher practitioners have visited this forum.<br><br>As per Mahayana's understanding, for Bodhisattvas, many Bodhisattvas around are also enlightened and liberated, although they purposely stay in samsara to carry out his vows - saving sentient beings, perfect his paramitas, practising to attain complete and perfect Buddhahood. At which point in time is a Bodhisattva liberated from samsara may depend on one's understanding. According to Lankavatara Sutra, an Arhat reaches an equivalent of the 6th Bhumi. There are altogether 10 Bhumis before Buddhahood, and there are many bodhisattvas around who are of various bhumis.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Diamond Sutra:</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Oh Conqueror, what will happen in the future, in the days of the last five hundred, when the holy Dharma is approaching its final destruction?

The ten are greed, hatred, stupidity, arrogance, doubt, the view of (bodily) self, one-sided views, deviant views, the view of being attached to views, and the view of grasping (non-beneficial) prohibitive precepts.<br><br>"In the world of desire, all ten operate in relationship to the Truth of Suffering, while seven (all except the view of self, one-sided views, and the view of grasping prohibitive precepts) operate in relation to the Truths of Accumulating and Cessation, and eight (all except the view of self and one-sided views) operate in relation to the Truth of the Path. In the form and formless worlds the relationship of the delusions to the Truths follows the same order with the exception of hatred in relation to all four Truths, since hatred must be eliminated before one can enter . Thirty-two deluded views in the world of desire, twenty eight in the world of form, and twenty-eight in the formless world total eighty-eight. . . .<br><br>"Upon eliminating the Eighty-Eight Deluded Views, one becomes a first-stage Arhat (Skt. , Stream-winner)." (HS 123 124)<br><br>Eighty-One Cognitive Delusions<br>"There are nine degrees of cognitive delusions, which manifest themselves on nine separate grounds. The nine degrees are simply the higher superior, the higher intermediate, and the higher inferior; the middle superior, the middle intermediate, and the middle inferior; the lower superior, the lower intermediate, and the lower inferior. The Nine Grounds are the Five Destinies [=Six Paths of Rebirth minus ], which comprise the first ground, the Four Dhyanas, and the Four Formless Samadhis. . . . Upon eliminating the first six degrees of the first ground, one becomes a second stage Arhat (Skt. , Once-Returner). Upon eliminating the final three degrees of the first ground, one becomes a third stage Arhat (Skt. , Never-Returner). When all the remaining seventy-two are eliminated, one becomes a fourth stage Arhat (Skt. ). sometimes only the fourth stage is referred to as Arhatship."
