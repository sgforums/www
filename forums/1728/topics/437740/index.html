                                        FIRST URGES EVERYONE</span> to give rise to the enlightened 
                                        mind, love, and compassion, and apply ourselves to listening 
                                        to the teachings, reflecting upon their meaning, and 
                                        meditating on them. The purpose of these actions is 
                                        to achieve the enlightened state, and that is for the 
                                        purpose of benefiting all sentient beings, in numbers 
                                        as vast as the sky.</p>
              <p>In the Buddha's tradition, the concept, or the presentation, 
                                        of the two truths is very important. For that reason, 
                                        in this first weekend course Rinpoche will give the 
                                        presentation of the two truths through the various traditions 
                                        of the Dharma. The two truths are the conventional truth 
                                        and the ultimate truth. The conventional truth is the 
                                        mode in which things appear, and the ultimate truth 
                                        is the mode of being, or the way things really are.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>When we hold on to the mode of appearance of things, 
                                        the conventional truth, as having some kind of true 
                                        existence, then the various kinds of sufferings arise, 
                                        and the various disturbing emotions. So conditioned 
                                        existence or samsara arises from holding onto the way 
                                        things appear as being real, as being true, as having 
                                        some kind of innate existence. So then, realizing the 
                                        mode of the way things are, realizing the ultimate truth, 
                                        pacifies or dispels all of the various disturbing emotions; 
                                        from that one gains nirvana. Briefly, then, attaching 
                                        to the mode of appearance as having true existence--this 
                                        is the confused mind or the bewildered mind. Therefore, 
                                        it is necessary to reverse that bewildered mind and 
                                        to realize the nature of things as they are.</p>
              <p>Whatever phenomenon there is to be known, that phenomenon 
                                        can be known in terms of the conventional truth, or 
                                        it can be known in terms of the ultimate truth, but 
                                        only in terms of these two truths and not in terms of 
                                        any other truths. Because of the importance of knowing 
                                        that phenomena have their existence in terms of these 
                                        two truths, the Buddha said that all phenomena whatsoever 
                                        can be known through these two truths, ultimate and 
                                        conventional, and not in any other way.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>In order to understand these two truths, the ultimate 
                                        and the conventional, they have to be approached through 
                                        the different Buddhist traditions. It is difficult to 
                                        understand them without approaching them in that way.</p>
              <p>The traditions can be divided into the Vehicle of the 
                                        Hearers, or the Shravakayana, and the Great Vehicle, 
                                        or the Mahayana. In the Vehicle of the Hearers, there 
                                        is the division into the way of positing the two truths 
                                        in terms of the Vaibhashika school and the way of positing 
                                        the two truths in terms of the Sautrantika school. And 
                                        in the Great Vehicle, or Mahayana, there is first the 
                                        way of positing the two truths in the terms of the Cittamatra, 
                                        or Mind-Only school, and then the way of positing these 
                                        truths in the Madhyamaka tradition. In the Madhyamaka 
                                        tradition, further there is the Svatantrika approach 
                                        to positing these two truths, and the Prasangika approach 
                                        of positing them. Then there is also the empty-of-other 
                                        approach. It is better to use the Tibetan word for this, 
                                        which is zhen-tong. "Zhen" means "other," and "tong" 
                                        means "empty." Literally it means "empty of other. " 
                                        In English it is a little awkward, so we will just say 
                                        zhen-tong. And finally, besides the zhen-tong approach, 
                                        there is the mantra approach to positing the two truths.</p>

              <p>Rinpoche will begin by positing the two truths according 
                                        to the Vaibhashika school. The following quote is taken 
                                        from the text The All-Pervasiveness of All-Encompassing 
                                        Knowledge, written by the first Jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche, 
                                        Lodro Thaye. It is sometimes known as The Treasury of 
                                        Knowledge.</p>
              <p>In the tradition of the Vaibhashika, the conventional 
                                        truth is the coarse object of continuum consciousness, 
                                        which can be broken down. The partless, which cannot 
                                        be rejected, is the ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>That is the root verse.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>Conventional truth refers either to something that 
                                        can be broken down or destroyed physically (with regard 
                                        to physical objects), or (with regard to the mind) to 
                                        the continuum of consciousness that through analysis 
                                        can be broken down. From the point of view of physical 
                                        objects, the ultimate truth is the very small, partless 
                                        atoms or particles that cannot be broken down any further. 
                                        And in the terms of the mind, the smallest moment of 
                                        consciousness would be the ultimate truth. So, briefly 
                                        then the relative or conventional truth is the coarse 
                                        object or the continuum of consciousness, and the ultimate 
                                        truth is the atomic unbreakable particles and the smallest 
                                        moment of consciousness.</p>
              <p>An example of the conventional truth, according to 
                                        the Vaibhashikas, is the vase and the flowers. The reason 
                                        they are conventional is because they can both be destroyed. 
                                        The cup can be broken and the flowers can be taken apart. 
                                        Once the cup is broken or the flowers are taken apart, 
                                        then the idea, the concept of cup or the concept of 
                                        flowers, will not arise. So that is the conventional 
                                        level.</p>
              <p>Considering the same cup and flowers from the ultimate 
                                        view they have an ultimate nature because they are physically 
                                        made up, according to the Vaibhashika view, of atomic 
                                        particles that are partless, that cannot be divided 
                                        any further, and so they are beyond being able to be 
                                        destroyed.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>As regards consciousness, the consciousness, for example, 
                                        that arises from the moment we awaken until we sleep, 
                                        that continuum of consciousness is called the conventional 
                                        level. It is called the conventional level because if 
                                        it is investigated and divided up, then it cannot be 
                                        established as being existent any longer; since it has 
                                        been divided. If one investigates that continuum of 
                                        consciousness, then one sees that the past moment of 
                                        consciousness has ceased to exist, the future moment 
                                        of consciousness has not yet arisen, and the present 
                                        moment of consciousness is fleeting. If one looks at 
                                        it closer and closer at each momentary instant, the 
                                        continuum cannot be established as being ultimate; ultimately 
                                        speaking there is no continuum.</p>
              <p>To summarize again, gross objects are the conventional 
                                        level, and the continuum of consciousness is the conventional 
                                        level. The smallest indivisible particle is the ultimate 
                                        level, and the smallest instant of consciousness is 
                                        the ultimate level or ultimate truth.</p>

              <p>What is meant by indivisible, according to Vaibhashika 
                                        tradition, are the smallest, subtlest particles, which 
                                        cannot be divided into, for example, a northern part, 
                                        a southern part, a top part, or a bottom part. Since 
                                        they cannot be divided like that, they are said to be 
                                        ultimate. If they could be divided into those parts, 
                                        then they would not be the smallest parts.</p>
              <p>Since these particles are small and indivisible, they 
                                        cannot be destroyed. Since they cannot be destroyed, 
                                        since they can not be broken down any further, these 
                                        small parts are said to possess a particular energy, 
                                        or power.</p>
              <p>The aggregation of these small indivisible particles 
                                        constitutes the coarse objects. If you take the gross 
                                        object and destroy it, what is left over are the smallest 
                                        indivisible particles.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>From the point of view of consciousness, consciousness 
                                        cannot be destroyed in the same way that an object can 
                                        be destroyed. With consciousness, one analyzes it into 
                                        the consciousness that was, the consciousness that is 
                                        yet to be, and the present consciousness. And with the 
                                        present consciousness, one investigates it down to the 
                                        subtlest moment or instant, beyond which it cannot be 
                                        divided any further, and that is the ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>This smallest moment in the Buddhist tradition is said 
                                        to be the time it takes a finger to snap, divided by 
                                        64. That is what is said to be the smallest instant 
                                        in time; in the Buddhist tradition that is called the 
                                        limit of time. Through one's analysis, through one's 
                                        intelligence, one could say that the moment could be 
                                        divided into hundreds, into thousands, into millions. 
                                        Of course, that is possible. But in terms of the arising 
                                        of thoughts, the thought arises in these 64 divisions 
                                        of a finger snap.</p>
              <p>If you take an arrow or a bullet and you shoot it through 
                                        100 flower petals, it seems to go through instantaneously; 
                                        one cannot break down the movement through 100 flower 
                                        petals. But if one analyzes it, one sees that is has 
                                        to go through the first flower petal before it goes 
                                        through the second flower petal, and so forth.</p>
              <p>Rinpoche says that previously the scientific position 
                                        was that the ultimate truth was small atomic particles 
                                        that could not be divided. He says that he thinks this 
                                        is very similar, not exactly the same perhaps, but very 
                                        similar to the Vaibhashika school.</p>

              <p>What is called "Buddha," or in Tibetan "sang-gye," 
                                        is the exhaustion of all confusions and bewilderment 
                                        and the shining forth of the five wisdoms. What is called 
                                        "samsara" is confused or bewildered appearances. The 
                                        exhaustion of these confused, bewildered appearances, 
                                        along with the habitual tendencies or karmic dispositions, 
                                        is what is "Buddha."</p>
              <p>In the traditions of the Vehicle of the Hearers and 
                                        the Vehicle of the Self-Realizers, the goal is to attain 
                                        the state of an arhat, or "foe destroyer." This is enlightenment 
                                        or nirvana, but not the ultimate nirvana. It is only 
                                        the exhaustion of the grosser veils, not the complete 
                                        exhaustion or pacification of the very fine, subtle 
                                        confusions. So it is not ultimate enlightenment. Until 
                                        one achieves the ultimate state of a buddha, one has 
                                        not achieved the ultimate nirvana.</p>
              <p>When one attains the complete state of a buddha, the 
                                        complete state of enlightenment, then there is a great 
                                        benefit for other sentient beings. The reason for this 
                                        is that when one has exhausted all of one's own confusions, 
                                        one is able to really and truly work for the benefit 
                                        of other beings.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>For the benefit of all sentient beings, the Buddha 
                                        taught the inexpressible or inconceivable Dharma, the 
                                        limitless Dharma, the endless Dharma. He said that there 
                                        is the way things appear--the conventional truth--and 
                                        the mode of being of things--the ultimate truth. Other 
                                        than these ways, there is no third truth, no other way.</p>
              <p>The difference in the way of positing or expressing 
                                        these two truths is the first main division between 
                                        the Vehicle of the Hearers and the Great Vehicle, the 
                                        Mahayana. In the Vehicle of the Hearers, you have the 
                                        Vaibhashikas' way of positing the two truths, and the 
                                        way of positing the two truths in terms of the Sautrantikas; 
                                        and then, in the Great Vehicle, the way of positing 
                                        these two truths in terms of the Mind-Only approach, 
                                        and the way of positing these two truths in terms of 
                                        the Madhyamaka approach. Then there is the Mantrayana 
                                        or the Vajrayana (Diamond Vehicle) approach to positing 
                                        these two truths.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>So there are many ways of positing the two truths. 
                                        Rinpoche is basing his teachings upon the teachings 
                                        of the first Kongtrul Rinpoche, Lodro Thaye, who discussed 
                                        this matter in the book The Treasury of Knowledge. This 
                                        book is composed of the root text, which is called "The 
                                        All-Pervasive Knowledge," and the commentary, which 
                                        is called "The Ocean of Limitless Knowledge." If one 
                                        were to ask why it is called "The All-Pervasive Knowledge," 
                                        it is because it is describing or speaking about all 
                                        phenomena--that is, all phenomena of both nirvana and 
                                        conditioned existence. And it is describing or speaking 
                                        about the way in which things are, their mode of being 
                                        or the nature of all phenomena.</p>
              <p>The reason why the commentary is called "The Ocean 
                                        of Limitless Knowledge" is that the knowledge of the 
                                        Dharma that is being expressed is said to be without 
                                        limit and without end. It is said to be like an ocean 
                                        because the oceans of the world are very, very vast 
                                        and very, very deep. The reason for studying "The Ocean 
                                        of Limitless Knowledge" is that if in the path stage 
                                        on the way to Buddhahood, one does not study "The Ocean 
                                        of Limitless Knowledge," then at the fruition stage 
                                        one won't obtain a Buddha's pristine awareness of omniscience 
                                        or all-knowing.</p>
              <p>This text by Kongtrul Rinpoche, composed of the root 
                                        text, "The All-Pervasive Knowledge," and the commentary, 
                                        "The Ocean of Limitless Knowledge," is divided into 
                                        40 chapters. This presentation of the two truths is 
                                        one of those 40 chapters. This particular chapter deals 
                                        with the Buddha's three turnings of the wheel of Dharma, 
                                        and with the two truths. It also deals with the links 
                                        of interdependent origination, but in this particular 
                                        section that Rinpoche is teaching, it is only dealing 
                                        with the two truths, not the three turnings of the wheel 
                                        or interdependent origination.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>Yesterday Rinpoche briefly explained the way of positing 
                                        the two truths in the Vaibhashika tradition and in the 
                                        Sautrantika tradition. Today he will begin by briefly 
                                        explaining how the two truths are posited in the Cittamatra 
                                        or Mind-Only tradition.</p>
              <p>First there is the root text from the "All-Pervasive 
                                        Knowledge," and it goes like this: "The tradition of 
                                        the Mind Only school posits a dualistic appearance depending 
                                        on objects and object perceivers. The ultimate truth 
                                        is the nature of the consciousness of there not being 
                                        two." In the commentary to this, "The Ocean of Limitless 
                                        Knowledge," there is an explanation concerning this 
                                        root verse, and Rinpoche is going to extract the essence 
                                        of that and give a brief presentation or explanation.</p>
              <p>In this tradition, what is said to be conventional 
                                        truth is the dualistic appearance of the outer, "held" 
                                        object and the inner, "holding" entity, or the perceiving 
                                        mind. So these two, holder and held, grasper and grasped, 
                                        apprehender and apprehended, constitute the conventional 
                                        level or the conventional truth. The mind that is beyond 
                                        that, that is free from that, that sees both as being 
                                        simply mind, that is the ultimate truth or the ultimate 
                                        level.</p>
              <p>In this tradition, the dualistic appearance of holder 
                                        and held, the consciousness that makes this division 
                                        or separation, the thoughts or conceptualizations that 
                                        make this distinction, need to be exhausted. For the 
                                        purpose of exhausting this dualistic clinging, one needs 
                                        to realize that the essence or nature is empty of these 
                                        two.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>So the dualistic appearance, the seeming appearing 
                                        of grasper and grasped, has no true existence, no reality, 
                                        no truth. It is simply confusion, bewilderment, artificiality. 
                                        One needs to understand that it is all of these things, 
                                        that this seeming dualism does not exist, has no true 
                                        reality.</p>
              <p>This dualistic appearance is like a dream. For the 
                                        purpose of resolving this seeming duality, this appearing 
                                        as two (grasper and grasped), it is necessary to realize 
                                        the nature of the ultimate truth. If one does not understand 
                                        that this dualism is bewilderment and confusion, one 
                                        will not be able to realize its nature as being that 
                                        of the ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>The best example to illustrate how these two truths 
                                        function is the example of the dream. When we are dreaming, 
                                        there appears to be a duality between the appearances 
                                        in the dream and the perception of these appearances. 
                                        However, this seeming duality is only conventional, 
                                        only artificial; it has no true existence or true reality. 
                                        This appearance of two, perceiver and perceived, is 
                                        simply the bewilderment or the confusion of the mind. 
                                        Both of these, holder and held, are simply the mind 
                                        itself, simply the clear cognition of the mind itself, 
                                        the luminous knowing of the mind itself.</p>
              <p>Rinpoche says that this is the brief explanation of 
                                        this particular view, of the Cittamatra, in terms of 
                                        the two truths.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>Then, we move on to the Madhyamaka approach and the 
                                        two truths in relation to the Madhyamaka approach. First, 
                                        the Madhyamaka is divided into what is called empty-of-self 
                                        and empty-of-other. The Tibetan for "empty of self" 
                                        is "rang-tong." "Rang" means "self," and "tong" means 
                                        "empty," so literally it means "self-empty." "Zhen" 
                                        means "other," and "tong" means "empty," so the meaning 
                                        is "other-empty." The rang tong approach says that all 
                                        phenomena of conditioned existence and nirvana are empty 
                                        of having any self essence or self-nature. The zhen-tong 
                                        or empty-of-other approach says that the nature of the 
                                        mind, the Buddhanature, is endowed with spontaneous 
                                        qualities, but is empty of any adventitious, fleeting, 
                                        passing stains on that nature.</p>
              <p>In the rang tong or empty-of-self approach, you have 
                                        the two schools of the Svatantrika and Prasangika. The 
                                        Svatantrikas make assertions about the nature of reality 
                                        or the true nature; the Prasangikas do not make any 
                                        ultimate assertions themselves.</p>
              <p>The Svatantrikas refute the idea of there being existence, 
                                        true existence, and they assert non-true existence. 
                                        They refute the idea that things have their own nature, 
                                        and they assert emptiness. The Prasangikas refute the 
                                        idea that things have true existence, that things have 
                                        any nature of their own. They do not, however, assert 
                                        emptiness. They do not assert nonexistence. The do not 
                                        assert even freedom from elaboration, because in their 
                                        tradition the ultimate level is completely beyond being 
                                        something that can be asserted.</p>
              <p>The root text says that in the tradition of the Svatantrikas, 
                                        appearances exist as the conventional truth like a magical 
                                        illusion. The ultimate truth is nonexistent like the 
                                        sky. So in the Svatantrika tradition the conventional 
                                        truth is said to be the appearances that arise owing 
                                        to the coming together of causes and conditions. They 
                                        are said to exist in the same way that appearances in 
                                        a dream or appearances of a magical illusion exist. 
                                        On the ultimate level, things are said not to have any 
                                        nature of their own, to be nothing whatsoever, nothing 
                                        at all, to be empty in the same way that the sky is 
                                        empty.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>All of the sensory experiences, such as the experiences 
                                        of form, sound, smell, taste, and touch are caused by 
                                        the coming together of causes and conditions. These 
                                        conventional appearances are like the sensations or 
                                        experiences in dreams. Form, sound, smell, taste, and 
                                        touch then have no real essence of their own. They are 
                                        the results of causes and conditions, like a dream, 
                                        having no essence of their own, empty of having self-essence. 
                                        This is the ultimate truth, the unmistaken truth. This 
                                        is the reality or the real truth, that they are empty 
                                        of any self nature, of any self-mode of being.</p>
              <p>In the same way, then, all feelings of happiness and 
                                        all feelings of suffering simply exist in a conventional 
                                        way, like these same feelings of happiness and suffering 
                                        in a dream. They are existing merely conventionally. 
                                        They have no self-essence or nature of their own. They 
                                        simply come together as a result of causes and conditions.</p>
              <p>If one investigates and examines these feelings of 
                                        happiness and suffering with one's eye of wisdom, one 
                                        will come to see that ultimately they have no existence, 
                                        no nature of their own. They are completely empty, nothing 
                                        whatsoever, in the same way that the sky is completely 
                                        empty. Like the experiences of suffering and happiness 
                                        that arise in a dream, except for being simply the coming 
                                        together of causes and conditions, except for being 
                                        artificiality, except for being confusion, they themselves 
                                        have no nature, have no essence, are empty.</p>
              <p>In the tradition of the Svatantrikas, it is necessary 
                                        to understand and realize that things have no self-essence, 
                                        no nature of their own, for the purpose of exhausting 
                                        the clinging to things as being real.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>Moving on then to the explanation of the two truths 
                                        in terms of the tradition of the Prasangikas, the root 
                                        text says that the conventional truth is what is imputed 
                                        by thought, the expressions of the world. The ultimate 
                                        truth is free from elaboration, beyond thought and expression. 
                                        The commentary briefly says that basically, in this 
                                        tradition of the Prasangikas, what is conventional truth 
                                        is anything that is imputed by thought, by the mind. 
                                        What is ultimate truth, then, is that which is completely 
                                        beyond any elaborations or fabrications, any thought, 
                                        any expression.</p>
              <p>In this tradition there are basically three different 
                                        kinds of processes: the process of no analysis, the 
                                        process of a little analysis, and the process of fine 
                                        analysis. If one does not apply one's reasoning, one's 
                                        analytical wisdom, to trying to ascertain what the ultimate 
                                        truth is, then this is called the process of no analysis. 
                                        If one uses one's analytical abilities to do this, then 
                                        this is the process of a little analysis: and if one 
                                        does this in a very, very complete manner, then this 
                                        is the process of fine analysis.</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-o.gif" alt="*" width="20" height="14"><img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-p.gif" alt="" width="40" height="14"><br> <img src="http://www.kagyu.org/images/djws-q.gif" alt="" width="60" height="8"></p>
              <p>What is the process of no analysis? In it, samsara 
                                        is said to be of the nature of suffering, and karma 
                                        (cause and effect) is said to function in such a way 
                                        that when virtuous actions are committed, then virtuous 
                                        fruits are reaped, and when nonvirtuous actions are 
                                        committed, then nonvirtuous fruits are reaped.</p>
              <p>In the process of a little analysis, one is able to 
                                        say that on one hand is the conventional truth and on 
                                        the other hand is the ultimate truth. When one is able 
                                        to make this differentiation, this is the process of 
                                        a little analysis.</p>
              <p>In what is called the process of fine analysis, there 
                                        is no longer a differentiation between conventional 
                                        truth and absolute or ultimate truth. One is beyond 
                                        making this differentiation, one is completely beyond 
                                        all expressions, beyond all speech in terms of describing 
                                        this. When one is free from all fabrications or elaborations 
                                        of thought, free from all fabrications of the mind, 
                                        this is the process of fine analysis.</p>

              <p>Briefly, in the Prasangika approach, all of the fabrications 
                                        of the mind and all of the objects that result from 
                                        these fabrications of the mind are relative, the conventional 
                                        truth. For the purpose of exhausting or pacifying this 
                                        relative perception of truth, it is necessary to realize 
                                        and to understand the meaning of the state of the ultimate 
                                        truth, the state that is free from conceptualization, 
                                        fabrication, elaboration.</p>
              <p>What is this fabrication or elaboration of the mind? 
                                        It is to say, for example, that this is existence or 
                                        this is nonexistence; or to say that this is both existence 
                                        and nonexistence; or to say that this is neither existence 
                                        nor nonexistence. All of those are fabrications, elaborations. 
                                        Where one has the thought of a perceiver and of a perceived, 
                                        this is a fabrication. All of this is the conceptual 
                                        level. For the purpose of pacifying or exhausting these 
                                        elaborations, it is necessary to realize this, free 
                                        from elaborations or fabrications.</p>

              <p>One can reflect again and again and take to heart these 
                                        brief explanations of the meaning of these different 
                                        approaches to the two truths.</p>
              <p>To summarize, the tradition of the Mind-Only posits 
                                        apprehender and apprehended, dualistic appearance, object 
                                        and object perceiver. The ultimate truth is the nature 
                                        of consciousness of not being two. In the tradition 
                                        of the Svatantrikas, appearances exist as the conventional 
                                        truth, like a magic illusion. The ultimate truth is 
                                        nonexistent like the sky. In the tradition of the Prasangikas, 
                                        the conventional truth is what is imputed by thought, 
                                        the expressions of the world. The ultimate truth is 
                                        free from elaborations, beyond thought and expression.</p>

              <p>First let me explain that I am trained in this as a Gelug. Obviously <br>there is some interpretation. The lineages have some differing views <br>on Madhyamika as it is so important. Some think the views differ <br>greatly, some don't. I belong to the latter. I encourage with all my <br>heart that persons who are stimulated and feel benefited by this <br>series to study more. <br><br>Tsongkhapa felt that the cause of being bound to samsara was a <br>deeply rooted habit that grasped to the concept of inherent <br>existence. To exist inherently means to have a basis independent of <br>imputation. Tsongkhapa argued in essence, that all the tenet systems <br>below prasangika asserted such a basis either explicitly (i.e. they <br>said so and one can find it stated as such) or implicitly (it may be <br>hard to find the passage and there is a question about it but such a <br>conclusion might be drawn from other things). In the case of <br>Vaibhasika and Sautrantika it was the dharmas. In Yogacara, it was <br>paratantra and parinispanna or mind. The Madhyamikas argued that <br>there was no such basis ultimately at all. The Svatantrikas, <br>however, because they used syllogisms instead of consequences <br>implicitly asserted a type of independence on the conventional level <br>known as svalaksana or inherent characteristic. <br><br>This is extremely subtle. The argument is that if a syllogism is <br>used, there is an assumption that the two parties will see the first <br>mode the property of a subject in the same way, implying some sort <br>of independent existence. Seeing the property in the same way <br>demands recognizing that the property has at minimum some sort of <br>characteristic which is independent of the imputing mind. The use of <br>a consequence does not do this, but merely takes the assumption of <br>the opponent as a basis as opposed to making an assumption oneself. <br>Therefore the Prasangika do not have the fault of asserting iherent <br>existence/characteristic even conventionally.<br><br>Other scholars in Tibet hold that Tsongkhapa's differentiation is <br>incorrect since the Sautrantikas do not assert svalaksana ultimately <br>and only use it conventionally as a means to lead persons to the <br>truth and do not hold it as a view. They further argue that the <br>Indians did not view the Svatantrikas and Prasangikas in the way <br>Tsongkhapa did and rather seemed to agree that the difference was <br>pedagogical. They say svatantra is for converting non-buddhists, <br>prasanga for converting buddhists.<br><br>Tsongkhapa's point though, however the intent or history of the <br>issue, was that even grasping at something this subtle had to be <br>done away with. Tsongkhapa agreed with Chandra that inherent <br>existence didn't exist even conventionally. In the conventional <br>world people just use words and agree on things in an unanalytic way.<br><br>I say I am Jamyang. I don't say I am inherent Jamyang. By negating <br>inherent existence, one allows convention and there is no <br>incompatibility between samsara and nirvana, between form and <br>emptiness. Once inherent existence is negated then what is left is <br>just dependent arising. Then everything is pure. The negation of <br>inherent existence is intended as an arrow to shoot the root cause <br>of defilement. It cuts out the core of that which is grasped. things <br>appear then as mirage, a reflection, a plantain tree, a bubble etc. <br>a play of stainless mind and wind.<br><br>Sarva Mangalam<br><br>Precious Bodhicitta, where it is not arisen, may it arise.<br>Where is has arisen, may it not decline but grow ever fuller.<br>By the merit of this presentation, may all beings obtain the state of <br>Vajradhara. May the dharma take solid root in the West and may no <br>obstacles arise to its practice and flourishing.<br>###</p>
