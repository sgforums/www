                                                          believing in God and practising buddha teahing?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My answer is that you can start practicing and learning Buddhism with a belief in God, but as you start to deepen your insight and understanding of workings of the universe and life, you will start to see through the notion that there is a 'creator' or agent behind experience.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to convince you to change your beliefs now - I am just saying that this is what may automatically happen as you progress in your practice of Buddhism, if you do start practicing. As you practice and gain direct experience on the nature of reality, your view of 'God' may shift from a 'personal God' to an impersonal and transcendental 'Ground of Being', to an interdependently originated universe.</p>
              <p>You need to have the courage to suspend all beliefs and look at your direct experience what the nature of reality is... once you stop relying on concepts and beliefs and simply look, insights and realizations of the nature of reality will arise quickly and you will go beyond all doubts about what the Truth is.</p>
              <p>You will see that all experiences arise due to an intricate interdependence and there is no one who is behind a particular arising experience... neither is there a 'you' or a 'God' doing or experiencing or making things happen.</p>
              <p>Things simply happen due to the supporting conditions... they are empty.</p>
              <p>Shunyata (Emptiness) means whatever appears are empty of independent
                                       or inherent existence, be it a sound, a form, or any other phenomena. 
                                      This is because it is the 'interconnectedness' that give rise to the 
                                      sound or experience (The person, the stick, the bell, hitting, air, 
                                      ears, etc, i.e. the conditions). <br><br>Thus, whatever arises 
                                      interdependently is vividly clear and luminous, but empty of any 
                                      *independent* or *inherent* existence. The entire universe is empty.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is the doctrine of interdependent origination that removes the view of there being an agent or self or God behind experiences.</p>

              <h3>2.8 Monotheism</h3>
              <h4>This is the big one, the view that concerns most westerners. There is a
                                      long and venerable history of discussion between the monotheistic tradition
                                      and Buddhism. This dialogue between the two traditions often centers on
                                      whether or not at core these two traditions have a common understanding.
                                      The need for this dialogue appears because at a certain obvious level Buddhism
                                      simply does not have a supreme being, what the monotheistic tradition generally
                                      means by God.</h4>
              <h4>I distinguish two components of ultimacy that are unique to the monotheistic
                                      tradition. Given that the monotheistic tradition believes in the existence
                                      of only one God, the monotheistic tradition conceives of God as the ultimate;
                                      furthermore God in this tradition is the creator of all existence and also
                                      bears moral responsibility for the activities which occur in this existence.</h4>
              <h4>Both of these components are absent from the Buddhist tradition. The Buddhist
                                      tradition lacks a being who has created existence. Instead, from the perspective
                                      of Interdependent Transformation, Buddhism conceives of existence as always
                                      existing, without beginning and without end. Furthermore, from the perspective
                                      of Interdependent Transformation, there is no specific locus of creation,
                                      no specific being is responsible for bringing existence into existence.
                                      Rather, creativity is an aspect of all existing things and therefore the
                                      source of existence is the things of existence, spread out over all of
                                      existence, throughout all space, throughout all time.</h4>
              <h4>John Reynolds, among western scholars I am familiar with, has written with
                                      clarity on this issue:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>As for the existence of God, of the Creator of heaven and earth, this is
                                      the concept central to religion as we know it in the West. Was the Buddha
                                      an atheist or an agnostic in relation to the existence of a Supreme Being
                                      or God? ...</h4>
              <h4>In the Suutras there is found a Buddhist account of Genesis. [This account
                                      appears in several sources both in the Mahayana and the Theravada Canons.]
                                      In reply to questions from His disciples, the Buddha explained that the
                                      humanity found on this planet earth once inhabited another planetary system.
                                      Ages ago when the sun of that world went nova and the planet was destroyed
                                      in the ensuing solar eruptions, the bulk of its inhabitants, as the result
                                      of their arduously practicing the Dharma for ten thousand years, were reborn
                                      on one of the higher planes of the Form World or <em>Ruupedhaatu</em>, a
                                      plane of existence known as <em>Aabhaasvara</em> or “clear light.” Here they
                                      enjoyed inconceivable bliss and felicity for countless aeons. Then, when
                                      their great store of past karma came onto maturity, our own solar system
                                      and planet earth began to evolve and some among their numbers were reborn
                                      on the lower planes of the <em>Ruupadhaatu</em> in the vicinity of the nascent
                                      earth. This plane of existence where they found themselves reborn is known
                                      as <em>Brahmaaloka</em>. The first of these beings to reawaken and be reborn,
                                      upon seeing the solar system evolving below him, exclaimed in his delight,
                                      “I am the Creator!” In this way, he came to believe that he was the actual
                                      creator of the universe which he saw about him, for he did not remember
                                      from whence he came and was born without any parents. But in actuality
                                      the manifestation of this universe was due to the collective karma of all
                                      in that company and his own individual manifestation, which was a case
                                      of apparitional birth, was due to his own great stock of meritorious karma
                                      coming into maturation at that time because the requisite secondary conditions
                                      were present.</h4>

              </blockquote>
              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation,
                                      is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended
                                      to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes
                                      this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s
                                      Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly
                                      to this discussion:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>124. ... [I]f Creation were dependent upon conditions, the complete collection
                                      of those causal circumstances would be the cause, and not <em>Ishvara</em> [Note: <em>Ishvara</em> was a common name for God in ancient India, similar
                                      to <em>Yahweh</em>.] If the complete conditions were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create; and if they were absent, there would
                                      be no creation.</h4>
              <h4>The Dalai Lama’s Comment:</h4>
              <h4>If creation and destruction are dependent upon a collection of causal conditions,
                                      the totality of those conditions would be the cause, and not a God who
                                      is independent of and uninfluenced by events. If the causal conditions
                                      were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create the resultant
                                      phenomena; and if they were not assembled, those phenomena would not be
                                      produced.</h4>

              </blockquote>
              <h4>Both of the above quoted passages are rooted in the understanding of existence
                                      as a causal matrix, the view of Intedependent Transformation. It is somewhat
                                      astonishing to think of God as deluded, as Reynolds suggests. God thinks
                                      he has created this world system because, due to his karma, he was the
                                      first conscious being in this world system. Unaware of his past karma which
                                      created the conditions for his rebirth in this world system, and not observing
                                      any other conscious beings in this world system, God then concludes that
                                      he is the creator of this world system. Unaware that there are other world
                                      systems, incalculably numerous, God/Ishvara concludes that he is the creator
                                      of all of existence.</h4>
              <h4>It takes some time to take in all the implications of such a world view.
                                      It is breathtaking in scope and rich in implications. One of the implications
                                      is that being reborn as God is not, from a Buddhist perspective, a fortunate
                                      rebirth. It is not a rebirth that will lead to liberation, to <em>nirvana</em>,
                                      and the cessation of all sorrow because such a rebirth re-enforces the
                                      idea that there is something that exists independently, and it is this
                                      very idea/belief/feeling that is the source of sorrow.</h4>
              <h4>It might seem that this is the end of the story; Buddhism doesn’t believe
                                      in a creator Deity that bears moral responsibility for existence while
                                      the monotheistic tradition has this view at its core. The two traditions,
                                      therefore, diverge.</h4>
              <h4>However, God has many names and many meanings and Interdependent Transformation
                                      has many facets. Though the view of Interdependent Transformation does
                                      lead to a view of existence that in some respects differs from that of
                                      the monotheistic tradition, we should not stop at this conclusion. I have
                                      previously mentioned in the discussion on the basic implications of Intedependent
                                      Transformation that this core view of the Buddha means that all things
                                      exist dependently. Because the monotheistic tradition regards God as the
                                      creator of all existing things and of existence itself, the monotheistic
                                      tradition views all things as existing dependently, as in a totally dependent
                                      state. From this perspective, the perspective of dependence, the Buddhist
                                      and Monotheistic tradition share a common insight into the transcendent
                                      nature of all existing things.</h4>
              <h4>Or take the view that God is love. It is out of God’s love that existence
                                      emerges. Existence is an expression of the generosity and benign nature
                                      of God. In the Buddhist tradition it is the realization that all things
                                      exist interdependently that gives rise to the blossoming of the compassionate
                                      heart. Love and Compassion are always present, but they are covered over
                                      by ignorance, self-concern, and distraction. I think that these two insights
                                      are very close for they both proclaim that in some sense love and compassion
                                      are the true nature of existence, that love and compassion blossom when
                                      we comprehend the transcendental.</h4>
              <h4>What I am suggesting is that even if I put aside the idea of a Creator
                                      Being, even if I put aside the idea of a Being who bears moral responsibility
                                      for existence, there are still significant, broad areas for dialogue between
                                      the two traditions because there is more to the idea of God than the idea
                                      of a Creator. From a Buddhist perspective, the most important aspects might
                                      lie outside of the Creator view.</h4>
              <h4>How do we access this broader understanding that lies at the core of the
                                      monotheistic tradition? I would suggest using those traditions centered
                                      on positive theology. Positive theology is that theology which explores
                                      the Divine Names and Attributes of God. For example, Dionysius the Areopagite
                                      wrote a theological work called <em>The Divine Names</em>. I think it would
                                      be an excellent place to start making such a comparison. For example, Dionysius
                                      writes:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>... Since it is the underpinning of goodness, and by merely being there
                                      is the cause of everything, to praise this divinely beneficent Providence
                                      you must turn to all of creation. It is there at the center of everything
                                      and everything has it for a destiny. It is therefore ‘before all things
                                      and in it all things hold together.’ Because it is there the world has
                                      come to be and exists. All things long for it. The intelligent and rational
                                      long for it by the way of knowledge ...</h4>
              <h4>Realizing all this, the theologians praise it by every name ... they give
                                      it many names, such as “I am being,” “life,” “God,” the “truth.” These
                                      same wise writers, when praising the Cause of everything that is, use names
                                      drawn from all the things caused: good, beautiful, wise, beloved, God of
                                      gods, Lord of Lord, Holy of Holies, eternal, existent, Cause of the ages.
                                      They call him source of life, wisdom, mind, word, knower, possessor beforehand
                                      of all the treasures of knowledge, power, powerful, and king of Kings,
                                      ancient of days, the unaging and unchanging, salvation, righteousness and
                                      sanctification, redemption, greatest of all and yet the one in the still
                                      breeze. They say he is in our minds, in our soul, and in our bodies, in
                                      heaven and on earth, that while remaining ever within himself he is also
                                      in and around and above the world, that he is above heaven and above all
                                      being, that he is sun, star, and fire, water, wind, and dew, cloud, archetypal
                                      stone, and rock, that he is all, that he is no thing.</h4>
              <h4>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0809128381/dharmajssutra-20"> Pseudo-Dionysius, The Complete Works</a>, translated by Colm Luibheid, “The Divine Names”, Paulist Press, Mahway, New Jersey, 1987, pages 54-56.)</h4>
              </blockquote>
              <h4>Now, turn to the Buddhist tradition and uncover the names that the Buddha
                                      in the Discourses uses for <em>nirvana</em>. He uses such terms as the “cessation
                                      of suffering”, “the non-clinging”, “peace”, “serenity”, “the lovely”, “the
                                      unconditioned”, “love”, “the unborn”, “the deathless”, etc.. Just as the
                                      core view of the monotheistic tradition is multi-faceted, so also the ultimate
                                      goal and core notion of the Buddhist tradition has many facets and many
                                      names. Once I move away from a fixation on the idea of God as a creator
                                      of existence, I am actually able to find a lot of similarity between these
                                      core views, many overlaps. It is useful to compare these two because how
                                      they arrive at these core understandings, such as dependence, differs,
                                      but often the core understandings themselves are amazingly similar. Thus,
                                      both traditions are mutually enriched by broadening their understanding.</h4>
              <h4>This is not the place to go into a systematic treatment of these two core
                                      views. It would require a book in and of itself. I believe what would be
                                      required is to compare and contrast the facets of ultimacy that each tradition
                                      has lived with down through the centuries. In addition to comparing and
                                      contrasting, I would also suggest comprehending how each tradition arrives
                                      at this understanding.</h4>
              <h4>I believe the result of such a project would produce a mosaic of overlapping
                                      and divergent understandings. From the perspective of a particular facet
                                      X, the two traditions have a shared view. From the perspective of facet
                                      Y, the two traditions diverge. From the persective of how they arrive at
                                      the same view X, there will also appear similarities and contrasts. When
                                      engaging in this project it is also important to keep in mind that monotheism
                                      is not a uniform tradition; it is actually more accurate to say “monotheisms”,
                                      and the same applies to Buddhism. The personalism of Christianity, for
                                      example, is something not shared by Judaism or Islam. Similarly, the view
                                      of the ontological status of suffering is quite different in different
                                      Buddhist traditions. Though this complicates the task, I do not consider
                                      it an insurmountable obstacle as long as one maintains a broad focus.</h4>
              <h4>This may seem like a lot of work, but I believe the results of such a project
                                      would be an ability to speak clearly to each other, from the views that
                                      each tradition holds, and come to a genuine and deep mutual understanding
                                      and appreciation. A good way to start such a project would be to compare
                                      two specific core texts, such as <em>The Divine Names</em> with something
                                      like the <em>Udana</em> in the Buddhist tradition. This may seem to narrow
                                      the focus from the broad focus I just suggested. However, the virtue of
                                      taking two specific works and comparing them is that it grounds the investigation
                                      in a specific work and tradition so that it reduces mere speculation.</h4>
              <h4>The dialogue between monotheism and Buddhism has been going on for a long
                                      time. I believe such an exchange can prove fruitful for both traditions.
                                      I would hope that such an exchange of views could be expanded to include
                                      other traditions as well, such as the western philosophical tradition,
                                      the secular humanist tradition, and the many spiritual traditions in the
                                      world today. With a good heart, mutual respect, and the capacity to perceive
                                      all people as equal, such an endeavor will help all concerned.</h4>

              <p>There are two kinds of meditation... one is calm abiding meditation, which trains in one pointedness/concentration and developing calmness. The other is vipassana which is insight meditation which trains in awareness of the nature of reality. Both must be developed for enlightenment.</p>
              <p>As for anger and patience, calmness from shamatha/calm-abiding practice can develope through meditation and this may be useful, metta meditation/loving-kindness meditation also is of great help, but if you want to remove the three poisons of craving, anger and ignorance forever, you have to reach deep enlightenment. In other words calmness itself is not enough to remove the 3 poisons.</p>

              <p>Hi Mayleesl,</p>
              <p>I hope you can continue to believe and have faith in God and at the same time continue to practice diligently on meditation. The kind of effect it has on a meditator is unbelievable and no words can describe it. I believe meditation will make us a better, calmer, peaceful and happier person. It is important for us to radiate this positive to aura to other ppl, trying to make this world a better one =)</p>
              <p>I understand that some meditation centers do charge for a meditation session. There are generally about 2 types of meditation centers.</p>
              <p>1) The first one does not base on the teachings of Buddhism, it is more of commercialized meditation. </p>
              <p>2) The second types are those open by Buddhist or conducted in temples. These instructors/teachers/monks need money to run their daily operations and to provide more beneficial lessons. I personally know one Buddhist layperson who is doing this for a living. However, he still gives free meditation courses on request by Buddhist Societies/organization as part of sharing. </p>
              <p>They  centers are catered for people who does not believe in Buddhism or people who feel uncomfortable about stepping into a monastery. Through this centers, they are still able to learn about meditation and benefit from it. </p>
              <p>If you happen to go to these centers and if you feel that the teacher is someone worth respecting, someone who is knowledgeable and passionate about guiding people to advance in their meditation practices, do help out. The very first lesson is Buddhism is the heart of generosity. It makes one happier, less stingy and open-hearted. This is the very basis to develop kindness, wisdom and all the important foundation of meditation practices. </p>
              <p>May you be well and happy and may your practice continue to grow! Hope I did answer to your question. =)</p>

              <p>Hi Mayleesl</p>
              <p>Actually there is nothing wrong with <em>believing in God and practising buddha teaching</em>?</p>
              <p>As Buddhist teaching is about being compassionate and manifesting that quality in our daily life. Beside, in the new testament, Jesus always display this compassionate quality to the people during his earthly ministry. See Mark 8:2.</p>
              <p>In the West,  it is quite common for people to embrace both Christianity and Buddhism. Sometime they embrace the former out of upbringing and family, the latter out of personal spiritual endeavor.</p>
              <p>In fact, if you can get hold of the late Thomas Merton author's book which is available in the National Library for some reading. It will be great. As he was a Catholic priest and a zen practitioner who wrote about his meditiation experience.  </p>

              Try to keep the 10 commandments very well and practice from the heart. Look out for the 7 deadly sins in your heart and cultivate the 7 virtues from the heart. This could help improve your meditation.

              <p>(continuation)</p>
              <p>From contemplative inquiry into the nature of reality (through questions like 'Who am I?') we begin to discover that the fundamental essence of what we truly are and the entire universe is a ground of consciousness. This is a non-conceptual insight... but think about it - if there is no evidence of an object apart from consciousness, then the entire universe as we know it - mountains, rivers, you, me, etc...all arise from and within consciousness. This can all be realized from our own experience... unlike beliefs of a personal god based on some ancient texts that often contradict each other and can never be verified. They remain as some mere vague concepts and are not helpful at all...</p>
              <p>Even if we do meet up with the so called 'god', that meeting with the person called 'god' would depend and arise within our consciousness. That person you meet will also be alive by the power of Consciousness. And the meeting will be sustained by the power of consciousness. Our consciousness is thus the true source of the entire animate and inanimate world. What is the only true all-power, all-presence, all-knowing 'creating' agent of the entire universe? Consciousness. Without which, nothing can manifest at all...</p>
              <p>Consciousness is thus discovered to be the subject of the universe... for where is perceptions apart from the perceiving awareness. This is the level where I mean 'your view of God will be transformed from a personal God to an impersonal Ground of Being'.</p>
              <p>However, this is not the final realization... there is further insights into the nature of awareness and the universe that dissolves the view of 'duality' and 'inherency'.</p>
              <p>There will come a time when it is realized that the 'perceiving mind' is precisely just perceptions, sensations, sights, thoughts, etc... the insight arises that 'manifestation is the source!' because awareness precisely is the perception itself - the observer is the observed. Further investigation removes the notion of an ultimate agent behind experience... there is no perceiving agent or awareness that 'causes' perception - it is not that there is no consciousness but consciousness is simply and only the arising and subsiding sensations according to conditions. There is no hearer behind hearing, experiencer behind experiencing - there is simply this process of experiencing without an agent... the experiencing is precisely simply the flow of experience. These experiences are self-luminous and arise dependent on supporting conditions.</p>
              <p>Our views change as we progress in our contemplative practice. In the spirit of true contemplatives in all religions, don't stick to one belief but continue investigating and practicing and the truth shall be revealed.</p>
