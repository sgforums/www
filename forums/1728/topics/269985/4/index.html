            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dumbdumb!:</div><div class="quote_body">nono, i don't mean the 5C reward.<br><br>i meant heavenly reward. for standing up for their faith, for helping the needy, for not denying their Savior in the face of death. For faith. For suffering persecution.<br><br>for having more balls than almost everyone else<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br></div></blockquote>I know you mean that and sure, we might think that they are doing it for a heavenly reward... people that do it for a heavenly reward will not like you say... will not have "more balls than almost everyone else".<br><br>Why? Most people are seeking a heavenly reward and they are different, they have "more balls than almost everyone else" because their motivation is not "heavenly reward ". That is what I am trying to tell you.<br><br>It is a calling and until you have this calling, you cannot understand the motivation.<br><br>People with a calling behave in a "stupid manner" to most people but like Mother Theresa, that is because the have a different motivation from most people.<br><br>What I am trying to tell you is that their sacrifice is their reward.<br><br>You might wonder how "sacrifice' can be a reward. It is a reward because they are not like everyone else. Their happiness and the joy they have does not come from the 5Cs and does not even come from expecting a place in heaven.<br><br>They have a profound joy in themselves and part and parcel of having this joy is the motivation to serve and to sacrifice of themselves. You can also say that "the motivation to serve and to sacrifice of themselves" bring them a profound joy. They cannot have the profound joy without the motivation to serve and to sacrifice of themselves.<br><br>Don't worry, it is not something that you have to worry about because not everyone is called (but that means that not everyone has the profound joy in themselves that does not come from chasing after and having the 5Cs or expecting a place in heaven)</div>
