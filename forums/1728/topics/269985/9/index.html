The Taliban, which took the 21 Koreans hostage in Afghanistan, denied medical team's access to sick hostages for security reasons though six Kabul doctors arrived at a site where captives are held.<br><br>Prospects for a dramatic breakthrough dimmed by the fact that the United States and Afghanistan ruled out any possibility of prisoners-captives swap.<br><br>The purported Taliban spokesman Qari Yousaf Ahmadi said that the Taliban and Korean negotiators are seeking to find a suitable place for a face-to-face talks. The Associated Islamic Press (AIP) reported that the Taliban asked the UN to guarantee their safety for the talks.<br><br>``Medical assistance and treatment will be of no use if we later kill them,'' Ahmadi told The Korea Times. ``Killing even the women is not a problem with us.''</blockquote>Contrast it with the words of people bent on taking the lives of innocent people that went all the way there to provide medical aid to strangers in a strange land.<br><br>We all live and die. There is no need to make other people's lives miserable for we are all in this together (but the delusion of self in exclusion of others, is great)<br><br>Remember the hostages.</div>

To believe otherwise u are not buddhist already.<br><br>For Christians, obviously God is sovereign. When you become a Christian, it doesn't mean u don't have to suffer and be persecuted. On the contrary, many a time a Christian would have to suffer with Christ. Look at the apostles: all of them died marytr's death. Look at Christ, he went thru torture and pain to die for our sins. This shows that a Christian's walk is not an easy path.<br><br>If Moses thru God's help could save the Hebrews from the Eygptians, it shows God's sovereignty in that matter. If God wants to save the 21 korean Christians, it is also his sovereignty.<br><br>Thanks for your waking up call. But hope u understand from the Christian perspective.<br><br>Appreciate the fact that Buddhists are giving words of blessings for the korean Christians. Singapore Christians have been praying for them too. Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the most immediate thing to do now is to pray for the safe return of the south Koreans and that they are able to pull through with the sickness and agony they are having now.<br><br>I am sure all good Christians, Buddhists, Taoists, Muslims and other individuals of their faith will pray for the good ending of this event. It is irrelevant now to debate about God.<br><br>Two lives already been lost and some of the female captives are now gravely ill and are desperate to come home. We should all come together, unite and pray/hope for the best outcome.<br><br>If you are a Christian, pray to your Lord.<br>If you are a Taoist, perform your spiritual ritual.<br>If you are a Muslim,  pray to your Lord too.<br>If you are a Buddhist, chant the name of Buddhas or Bodhisattwas or Sutras.<br>If you are from other faith, just do what you can do spiritually.<br><br>I think we should, like the one over at the loyang Tao Pei Gong temple where different cultures and religions are housed under one roof, living in harmony and peace.<br><br>If, the world at large, can all live in harmony with great tolerance, respect, and understanding, I don't think this tragic event will ever occur. Maybe we can and we should, at least set some examples to mitigate world conflicts.<br></div>

To every believer I know, it is what they choose to believe. You claimed your god is sovereign and hence as such he is the supreme being whom you willingly submit to his jurisdiction and parlay your life according to his whim and fancy. Another religion will claim its god is great if not supreme.<br>I can't imagine this idea of kingdom and sovereign parallels that of humans!

            <div class='col-md body'>Afghan group without pity<br><br>The murders of two of 23 South Korean hostages show that the Taliban of Afghanistan remain outside the norms of civilised behaviour. The Afghan zealots seized the South Koreans as a bargaining tool against the Kabul government. The Taliban leaders have demanded the release of Taliban prisoners. It is notable that the Afghan government has held the Taliban war prisoners in a civilised manner, while their opponents have terrorised and brutalised the innocent and unarmed Koreans. The Taliban must be convinced to free their hostages. They also must not be rewarded in any meaningful way. It is encouraging that the Asean Regional Forum members strongly agree.<br><br>The South Koreans are helpless victims of a kidnap plot.
