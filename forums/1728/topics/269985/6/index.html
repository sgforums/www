I mean, are you sure that is a good attitude to have?<br><br>It is best not to label people... they are neither friend nor enemy nor good nor bad... (what Buddhism calls non-dualistic)<br><br>They go around killing people the authorities (those that have taken up the job and is their responsibility) will have to try to capture or kill them... but it is not useful to think of them in terms of good or bad or friend or enemy.<br><br>If your relative, not just friend, behaves like the Taliban, and it is your responsibility, you have to try to capture or kill them too (if you can't change their minds or you think it is unlikely that you can change their minds)<br><br>Actually I wanted this thread to be purely a bless the hostages thread but since you mentioned it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Remember to bless the hostages and say a kind word and have a kind thought for them...</div></blockquote>In terms of relative truths, there is right or wrong, like for example you can pray for hostage's safety, but you can't pray for kidnappers' victories. Non-duality is not like that and does not 'cancel out' relative truths.<br><br>Though we should not attach to relative truths as if they are ultimately true and existent, otherwise we attach to forms and persons, right and wrong. While working on relative truths, we should not personalize a situation and just base on pure facts.<br><br>Also, I think the more appropriate term in Buddhism is not 'bless others'... we don't 'bless others', we can only 'dedicate merits to them' and also 'the grace of triplegem will bless'.</div>
