If any more are killed, it could force aid agencies to pull out of Afghanistan -- denying millions of Afghanis the help they need after years of war.<br><br>The Taliban are guided by the Afghan Pashtunwali code, a principle that requires Â“hospitality to all, especially guests and strangersÂ” Â– and this kidnapping is a clear violation of the code, offending the weary people of Afghanistan on whom they depend. So itÂ’s time for the global community to stand with Afghanis and South Koreans, demand that the Taliban to honour their code and release the rest of the hostages. Sign the petition NOW --</div>
