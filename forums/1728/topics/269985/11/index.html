"Father, don't worry. <strong>We don't proselytize</strong>. How can I?" she assured her father, who is <strong>not a Christian</strong>. "I can't even speak the language." Above all, Seo supported his children's trip because he knew what it was like to be a child growing up in a war-ravaged country; he was born in February 1950, four months before the outbreak of the Korean War.<br><br>"Whenever I saw those poor children on television, I thought of my own childhood," Seo said. "I felt good and proud when my children left for Afghanistan."</div>

There is such a thing as conducting/doctoring experiments or even designing experiments to prove one's theory.
