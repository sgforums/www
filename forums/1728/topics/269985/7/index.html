As you can see he keeps saying gigabyte14 is having a problem.<br><br>I understand the situation's importance but it doesn't mean to make someone making a big hoo-haa out of it.<br><br>Everyday there are other sufferings going on in the world, not only these unfortunate korean christians.<br><br>Just take a look around you, I still see beggars around. There are people right in our country having some handcapped having a deprived life. If Andrew is really compassaionate, he should start walking the talk and not just talking the walk.<br><br>"Blessings" that he had so-called are effortless to begin with. Whereas Buddhism taught that beside besides having thoughts and intention, one must act upon.<br><br>I suggest to Andrew, if you are reall <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> concern, you can consider writing an appeal with petition to the Talibans. Do something rather than just yakking in here.<br><br>Period.</div>

Four other deadlines set by the militants have lapsed without incident but the Taliban on Saturday expressed impatience, saying 17 of the South Koreans captured 11 days ago were ill and talks must be "speeded up."</div>
