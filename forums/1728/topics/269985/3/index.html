            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Taliban kill SKorean hostage in Afghanistan</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</span><br>A deadline imposed on 22 surviving South Koreans kidnapped by the Taliban passed early Thursday, hours after the rebels demanded a prisoner swap after killing their first hostage.<br><br>There was no immediate news on the fate of the abductees following the 2030 GMT deadline (1.00am local time) and a leading Taliban figure called for more foreign kidnappings.<br><br>The South Korean government confirmed the death and appealed for the other hostages to be released unharmed.<br><br>"One of our citizens kidnapped in Afghanistan has been confirmed to have been killed on July 25," foreign ministry spokesman Cho Hee-yong told a press briefing on Thursday.<br><br>"The government once again urges (the kidnappers) to immediately release the hostages and we will continue to do our utmost to win their safe release," the foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the Yonhap news agency.<br><br>Police found the bullet-riddled body of the Korean, one of a group of Christian aid workers, a few hours after the Taliban said they had executed him because talks to secure the release of eight insurgent prisoners had stalled.<br><br>"We killed one of the Koreans today because the government is not being honest in talks," Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi told AFP by telephone from an unknown location on Wednesday.<br><br>The police chief of Ghazni province, where the Taliban are holding the Koreans, said the badly-wounded body was dumped in a remote area several miles from the nearest road.<br><br>"We've recovered the body. It had 10 bullet holes," police commander Alishah Ahmadzai said.<br><br>In an alarming intervention, the Islamist militia's apparent new military commander used a television interview to urge rebels to kidnap as many foreigners as possible.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Speaking to Britain's Channel 4 News from an undisclosed location along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, Mansour Dadullah, who took over from his brother Mullah Dadullah killed by coalition troops in May, also said that the Taliban planned to use children to behead hostages.<br><br>He advocated kidnapping foreigners to trade them for Taliban captives -- Dadullah himself was released from prison by Afghanistan in exchange for a kidnapped Italian journalist earlier this year.<br><br>"Of course, kidnapping is a very successful policy and I order all my mujahideen to kidnap foreigners of any nationality wherever they find them and then we should do the same kind of deal," Dadullah told the broadcaster.</span><br><br>As tensions mounted on Wednesday, the head of the government delegation negotiating the release of the Koreans, Waheedullah Mujadadi, said the Taliban had opened fire on him in a buffer zone between Taliban and government controlled areas.<br><br>"I managed to escape the attack. They were trying to kidnap me as well or kill me," he said.<br><br>The militants -- who were ousted from power in Afghanistan by US-led forces in late 2001 -- set the 2030 GMT Wednesday deadline for Afghan authorities to accede to their demands for the release of the jailed Taliban fighters.<br><br>"We call on the South Korean government, parliament and its people to pressure the Afghan government to accept our demands or we'll kill more hostages after the deadline passes," Ahmadi said.<br><br>An Afghan governor and the Taliban both denied a report by South Korea's Yonhap news agency, quoting an unidentified government official in Seoul, that eight of the Koreans were freed Wednesday.<br><br>"Talks continue but no one has been freed so far," said Ghazni governor Mirajuddin Pattan. Rebel spokesman Ahmadi said the claim was "government propaganda."<br><br>South Korean and Afghan officials earlier travelled to Ghazni to lead efforts to free the Koreans, the biggest group of foreigners to be abducted during the Taliban's nearly six-year insurgency.<br><br>Any prisoner exchange would run counter to President Hamid Karzai's pledge not to allow the practice after his government in March freed Dadullah and four other Taliban militants in exchange for the Italian reporter.<br><br>A fresh hostage crisis was defused Wednesday when Taliban rebels freed a Danish journalist and his Afghan companion several hours after abducting them overnight in eastern Kunar province bordering Pakistan.<br><br>Officials earlier said the reporter was German.<br><br>Provincial governor Shalizai Didar said the pair were abducted after they travelled to the restive Watapour district to report on a NATO-led air strike which killed several Afghan civilians some two weeks ago.<br><br>"They were freed with no conditions through the power and cooperation of peace-loving local elders," Didar said.</blockquote>How does one even talk to such barbarians?!
