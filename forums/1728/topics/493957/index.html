                  There a Criterion?</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">[1] "Is there, monks, any
                  criterion whereby a monk, apart from faith, apart from persuasion,[2] apart
                  from inclination, apart from rational speculation, apart from delight in views
                  and theories, could affirm the attainment of enlightenment:[3] 'Birth is
                  destroyed, the holy life has been accomplished, what was to be done is done,
                  there is no further living in this world'?"</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"For us, Lord, all things
                  have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, their refuge. It would be
                  well, Lord, if the meaning of these words were to be made clear by the Blessed
                  One.[4] Hearing it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it."</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"There is such a
                  criterion, monks, whereby a monk... could affirm the attainment of
                  enlightenment... What is that method?</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"In this, monks, a monk
                  seeing an object with the eye recognizes within himself the presence of lust,
                  hatred or delusion, knowing 'Lust, hatred or delusion is present in me,' or he
                  recognizes the absence of these things, knowing 'There is no lust, hatred or
                  delusion present in me.' Now, monks, as regards that recognition of the
                  presence or absence of these things within him, are these matters to be
                  perceived by faith, by persuasion, by inclination, by rational speculation, by
                  delight in views and theories?"</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"No, indeed, Lord."</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"Are not these matters to
                  be perceived by the eye of wisdom?"[5]</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"Indeed, Lord."</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">"Then, monks, this is the
                  criterion whereby a monk, apart from faith, apart from persuasion, apart from
                  inclination, apart from rational speculation, apart from delight in views and
                  theories, could affirm the attainment of enlightenment: <span style="color: red;">'Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been accomplished, what was to be

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>1.Pariyaaya: a word with
                  several meanings, lit. "going around," hence "succession,"
                  "mode," "procedure," etc. This short sutta deals with the
                  very basic question of how, objectively, one can be sure that the declared goal
                  of the Buddha's practice has been achieved: thus the rendering
                  "criterion" is appropriate. It may be compared with the
                  frequently-quoted Kaalaama Sutta (AN 3.65: translated in WH 8).</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">2.Not influenced by anybody
                  else.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">3.Añña.m vyaakareyya. Woodward's
                  rendering "could affirm insight" is inadequate, because aññaa
                  definitely means the highest insight of enlightenment. The declaration takes
                  the form shown below: "Birth is destroyed... etc."</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">4.The formula is abbreviated
                  in the text here. It is found in full elsewhere.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">5.I follow Woodward's
                  rendering for paññaaya (lit. "with wisdom"). The actual expression
                  paññaacakkhu "eye of wisdom" occurs elsewhere.</p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The above Sutta highlighted on
              what an enlightened person would experience in himself rather than what the
              term enlightenment means.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Buddhist enlightenment is a reference
              to an inner ‘awakening’ in us leading to the realisation into what the reality of
              our existence is all about. That it is impermanence, non-self,
              unsatisfactoriness or suffering. It is term the Three Marks of Existence. These
              three terms may sound simple enough to understand. But in reality, it can take one
              a whole lifetime of practice to come to the realisation of the true meaning of
              what it is all about. By practice it means here, the cultivation of good virtues,
              constant meditation and deep contemplation of the Buddha’s teachings leading to
              eventually gaining the wisdoms needed for such realisation. Such teachings as The
              Four Noble Truths, The Eightfold Noble Paths, The Dependent Co-arising Doctrine
              are worth re-reading all the time. This is so, because as one advance in our
              practice, new meanings and truths will emerge all the time adding to our depth
              of understanding of the Buddha’s teaching. This is the perspectives of the
              Theravada tradition.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">In the Mahayana tradition, the
              emphasis is more on the teaching of Non-Duality and the doctrine of Emptiness. The
              teaching is not so much concentrated on individual liberation alone, but salvation
              is extended to all that is living with and around us. The teaching of
              non-duality brings us closer to all that exist on this earth. It is a teaching
              that would make us more capable to empathize with our fellow beings, their
              needs, their suffering and understanding them better. It is a teaching of
              oneness of all that lives.  I still
              remember reading the case of a Christian living in the earlier century in Europe
              who proclaimed that he was “God’. He was either deranged or one who has
              realised non-duality. Poor guy, he lost his life then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The teaching of Emptiness
              emphasis the connectivity of all beings that exist. It gives added meaning to
              the Co-arising dependent teaching of the earlier Buddha’s teaching. At its
              ultimate level of realisation, all clinging tendency would be abandoned as
              whatever subtle remnant of the ‘Self’ who have vanished.</p>
