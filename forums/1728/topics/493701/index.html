              Theravada Women’s Issues: A Conversation on Gender Equality and Ethics with
              Ajahn Brahmali</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Raymond Lam Buddhistdoor

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">Like
              his teacher Ajahm Brahm, Norwegian-born Ajahn Brahmali is unafraid to speak his
              mind, not only with students and fellow Buddhists, but also at the broader
              level of Buddhism and morality. This honesty famously cost Ajahn Brahm his
              institutional connections in Thailand when he came out in support of bhikkhuni
              ordination in 2009. I think it is safe to say that none in Ajahn Brahm’s
              circle, including Ajahn Brahmali, have much in common with their former
              community at Wat Pah Pong anymore. Though the events are now relatively distant
              memories, the ramifications can still be felt today, not least in the
              conversations that circulate within Theravada circles about the future
              relationship between the male sangha and women.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Ajahn
              Brahmali has a fascinating take on his preceptor’s excommunication in Thailand.
              “Getting thrown out of Wat Pah Pong, of course that came as a shock. It doesn’t
              feel good when you’re thrown out of a system,” he said. He had just finished a
              Day of Kindfulness* at The University of Hong Kong in November last year, and
              his sojourn with me in a hotel lobby had turned into a long reflection about
              his moral convictions. “You lose your mates, your friends, you feel abandoned.
              But the system itself wasn’t really that appropriate! If you look at the
              monastic Vinaya, the early sangha, as the Buddha laid it down, was almost completely
              flat. There was no hierarchy at all. Even the position of abbot didn’t exist,”
              he said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“Yet
              Buddhism in Thailand is hierarchical—you have a sangharaja at the top, you have
              a council, you have someone controlling you. Hierarchies are always very corrupting,
              and power, position, and money become very important. After a while, I realized
              that there was something very positive: we were independent; we could react to
              local demands. We were no longer controlled by an umbrella organization. The
              overall outcome, to be honest with you, was probably positive. We got bhikkhuni
              ordination, and we got the bonus of institutional independence!” he said with a
              mischievous twinkle in his eye.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Born
              in 1964, Ajahn Brahmali had no Buddhist friends or contacts while growing up in
              Norway, although when he was 12 he did fantasize about living in a hut in the
              forest. His first exposure to Buddhism came during a university trip to Japan,
              where he came across Buddhist temples and statues in Kyoto and Nara. Later, a
              friend loaned him a book on the mindfulness of breathing and breath meditation,
              and he was very happy with the results of practicing the exercises
              prescribed—“Wow, this is really cool,” he recalls thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After
              completing a degree in finance, which he did not find very meaningful, he
              contacted the Buddhist Society in London and went to practice as an anagarika
              at Amaravati Monastery in Britain. Further exploration led him to Bodhinyana
              Monastery in Western Australia in 1993, and by 1996 he had ordained as a monk
              with Ajahn Brahm as his preceptor. Two years later, in 1998, the Buddhist world
              was shaken when several Sri Lankan women were ordained as Theravada bhikkhunis
              by Chinese nuns.** Ajahn Brahmali maintains that he was an early supporter of
              the movement, indeed urging Ajahn Brahm to speak out long before the latter
              took the plunge. “I said to him that we wouldn’t be on the right side of
              history if we didn’t do so,” he recounted. “He agreed.” As a Theravada monk
              living in Australian society, he felt it was particularly crucial that Ajahn
              Brahm’s community deal with matters pertinent to the progress of that society,
              despite them having ordained in Thai trappings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“True,
              we have our roots in Thailand, but once you move outside of Thailand you have
              to adapt to local circumstances and not be stuck in the past. I think this was
              how Buddhism functioned originally. Every sangha has the autonomy to look after
              its own affairs. It was never hierarchical, so each sangha could react as it
              saw fit to local affairs.” As far as he is concerned, the long-term survival of
              the sangha in Australia requires the sangha to have a sense of equality rather
              than hierarchy. The “weirdness” about Buddhism, as Ajahn Brahmali puts it, is
              that it is one of the few religions in which women (through the Buddha’s aunt
              Mahaprajapati) are present from the beginning, historically, with men. “And yet
              now we’re lagging behind! The Church of Norway, for example, has a woman as its
              head!” he observed, taking care to emphasize that this was not a token gesture
              of simply ordaining female priests or even bishops, but the church’s leader.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">I
              asked Ajahn Brahmali why resistance seemed to be growing in reactionary
              echelons to the seemingly inevitable tide of female monasticism, but he
              disagreed with this framing. “I don’t think it’s becoming stronger. As
              monasticism for women becomes a reality, the voices against it naturally start
              to become more prominent. There’s nothing to talk about when there are no
              female ordinations, but once people start saying, ‘Hey, this is really going
              on,’ then people who don’t like them start to speak out.” He thinks there is a
              groundswell of support for bhikkhuni ordination everywhere and that the average
              Thai monk is actually quite supportive. He also noted that one senior Thai monk
              had divulged that 80 per cent of male monastics in Thailand were quite happy
              about the growth of the bhikkhuni order.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“So
              you will hear these very conservative voices who might be senior or high up in
              the hierarchy. But it’s like a lid that suppresses all other opinions—take that
              lid off and you have no idea what’s going to happen,” said Ajahn Brahmali, who
              feels quite optimistic that Theravada Buddhists will keep on the right side of
              history. “I know for certain that the Ajahn Chah tradition strongly objected to
              what Ajahn Brahm did, but the vast majority of monks even within that school
              are probably supportive. But the voices you hear are at the top, and for that
              reason it seems as if there is this united front against bhikkhunis, while in
              reality the situation is completely different.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Is
              Ajahn Brahmali playing politics? Perhaps. He admits that there will always
              exist a political undertone when discussing big ideas. “But you don’t talk
              about politics as such, you talk about moral issues,” he said, emphasizing that
              if other people choose to mischaracterize his speaking out on moral issues such
              as feminism and climate change as playing politics, it is their problem.
              Remembering this distinction has, over the years, helped him to maintain a
              calm, clear, and consistent voice about the moral matters at the heart of
              Buddhism. Perhaps this is a distinction that more Buddhists should keep in mind
              as our Vehicles focus on issues of great moral urgency—not only that of female
              monasticism, but humanity’s very future on this planet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">*
              Kindfulness is a five-stage meditative technique coined by Ajahn Brahm that
              focuses on awareness of the present moment and awareness of the breath.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">**
              Four conditions need to be present for the legitimate ordination of nuns: all
              monastics within a given monastic boundary are present, none of the candidates
              may be disqualified (such as being underage, in debt, or disabled), the
              procedure needs to be chanted correctly, and there must be an adequate quorum.
              The final rule hearkens back to the Buddha’s ancient ruling that a nun must be
              ordained by a sangha of bhikkhunis and then a council of bhikkhus. Not only
              were all four rules fulfilled in 1998, but also the quorum of dual ordination
              has been repeatedly demonstrated to be valid by some of the finest minds in
              Buddhist scholarship. The Chinese bhikkhunis carrying out the ordination
              followed the Dharmaguptaka Vinaya and were therefore legitimate nuns, and there
              is no legal impediment preventing a monk or nun of a Vehicle or even school (as
              opposed to Vinaya) from performing their Vinaya’s act of governance with a monk
              of another “sect.” The Theravada and Dharmaguptaka rules were therefore upheld,
              both councils of monks and nuns oversaw the ordination as the Buddha laid out,
              and Theravada/Mahayana doctrinal distinction did not invalidate the ordination.
              See Ven. Analayo’s seminal essay, “The Revival of the Bhikkhuni Order and the
              Decline of the Sasana.”</span></p>
