              our “self ” intact, that’s the one we love best. We won’t find anybody who will
              love us as much as we do ourselves. Yet, because of our ego delusion, we
              believe that there must be somebody like that somewhere. In reality we should
              look at this search in a different way. We shouldn’t try to find somebody who
              will help us to support our self-delusion but rather someone who will help us
              to get rid of it. That can be the Buddha and his teachings, because such is the
              essence of the dhamma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Introspection shows
              us the difficulties in making the self solid and secure. In fact, this is such
              a burden that we cannot be deeply happy. We can be pleasurably excited, but
              complete happiness is not possible with a view that needs constant
              reinforcement. We are not satisfied with telling ourselves how wonderful and
              clever we are. We need another person to reinforce and support this view.</span></p>

              self-image is, the easier it gets knocked down. We often believe that it is
              sensitivity when our feelings are hurt, but it just means that we are
              self-centered and want to protect our threatened ego.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To look for total
              satisfaction in oneself is a futile endeavor. Neither satisfaction nor self
              really exist. Since everything changes from moment to moment, where can self
              and where can satisfaction be found? Yet these are two things that the whole
              world is looking for and it sounds quite reasonable, doesn’t it? But since
              these are impossible to find, everybody is unhappy. Not necessarily because of
              tragedies, poverty, sickness, or death: simply because of unfilled desire.
              Everybody is looking for something that isn’t available. It’s worse than
              looking for a needle in a haystack; at least the needle is there, even though
              it is hard to find. But satisfaction and self are both delusions, so how can they
              ever be found? Searching here and there keeps everyone busy on this little
              globe of ours. If we were to stop looking for satisfaction for the self, we
              would have an immediate lessening of dukkha (unsatisfactoriness), since dukkha
              arises only from wanting something. Also our self-concept would be minimized,
              as ego is no longer constantly in the forefront of the mind.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>To get to this
              enormous root system that entangles us, we have to use mindfulness. The reason
              we find it so difficult to be really mindful is the fact that true attention
              shows us that there is no person, only mind and body. It is like coming up
              against a wall and instead of digging through that wall, the mind veers off and
              doesn’t want to know anything further. True mindfulness has arisen when there
              is only the action but no doer. With divided mindfulness we experience both,
              the one who is mindful and the one who is being watched. If we use precision in
              our attention, we see—even if only for a moment—that no person is embedded in
              our mind/body process. We can never forget that experience.</span></p>
