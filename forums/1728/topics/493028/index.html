              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="text-align: justify;">MATSUYAMA — Local governments
              in the Shikoku region are working to have a local pilgrimage route featuring 88
              Buddhist temples designated as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The pilgrimage connects these
              sacred places throughout the region, with each temple having a number, but
              there are many unknown aspects of its origin and history.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Among the pilgrims dressed in
              white at Ishiteji temple in Matsuyama in late September was Shinsuke Tosa from
              Okayama, who was making the journey to pray for his mother, who is suffering
              from an intractable disease. The 34-year-old was visiting the No. 51 site of
              the pilgrimage on the 27th day of his trek, which he began around the second
              anniversary of his grandfather’s death two years ago.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">“</span>My
              legs ache and I feel lonely, but I’ve been encouraged by meeting other people,”
              a satisfied-looking Tosa said. “[This pilgrimage] has given me a chance to
              self-reflect.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Sadamu Okamoto of Matsuyama
              was visiting the temple with his wife and daughter as part of the family’s
              three-day drive covering 17 of the sacred sites. “We’re also enjoying trying
              local udon eateries,” the 67-year-old said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Next step is preservation</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The four prefectures of
              Shikoku and 58 municipalities with pilgrimage temples submitted a petition in
              August to the Cultural Affairs Agency to seek candidacy for World Cultural
              Heritage status. The document described the holy journey as “our nation’s typical
              form of pilgrimage.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The local governments consider
              the 88 temples and the 1,400-kilometer route connecting the sacred sites as the
              basis of the envisioned World Cultural Heritage site. The governments will face
              the issue of how to establish a scheme to preserve these temples and the route
              as cultural assets.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The pilgrimage is
              “characterized by its casual nature, and anyone can start it from anywhere and
              at any time,” said Masato Mori, an associate professor of cultural geography at
              Mie University and the author of “Shikoku Henro” (Shikoku pilgrimage),
              published by Chuokoron-Shinsha Inc.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Pilgrims in the region can
              start their journey from any of the 88 temples, in contrast to the pilgrimage
              to Ise Jingu in Mie Prefecture, in which the grand shrine is regarded as the
              absolute sacred site. Moreover, the 88 temples belong to different schools of
              Buddhism.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The casual nature of the
              Shikoku pilgrimage was also pointed out by Shuji Matsuki, secretary general at
              a citizen group in Matsuyama that aims to help the 88 sacred sites and the
              route obtain World Cultural Heritage status.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">“</span>We
              hope to promote the ritual as something that represents a culture of
              coexistence because it welcomes anyone from any religion,” said Matsuki, 67.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">However, it is unclear how the
              extensive Shikoku pilgrimage got started and developed over the course of
              centuries. The ritual is said to have been launched in 815 by priest Kukai, but
              Mori said this is “not a clear historical fact.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">According to the associate
              professor, the theory that attributed the foundation of the holy trek to the
              monk was not clearly established until a monk made reference to it in a
              document during the Meiji era (1868-1912). The monk belonged to the Shingon school,
              the teaching established by Kukai.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">“</span>Was
              it also possible for Kukai to establish these as sacred sites in Shikoku just
              before he founded Koyasan [in 816]?” Mori said. Koyasan is a mountainous sacred
              site in what is now Wakayama Prefecture and the headquarters of Shingon
              Buddhism.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The number of the temples
              deemed sacred in the pilgrimage also changed. For example, Daigoji Monjo, the
              collection of documents from the Kamakura period (1192-1333) at Daigoji temple
              in Kyoto, recorded the number of temples as 33, but a guidebook in the Edo
              period (1603-1867) said, “Eighty-eight sacred sites are visited for worship
              today.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless, there are
              apparently no documents clearly explaining how the number of temples changed.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">Changes through eras</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The Shikoku pilgrimage became
              popular among the public during the Edo period and later drew many pilgrims
              from the coastlines of the Seto Inland Sea and other parts of the nation.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">The pilgrimage acquired a more
              leisurely nature in the modern period as bus and steam vessel services were
              developed. The holy trek also came under the spotlight as a form of hiking when
              the nation leaned toward militarism during the latter half of the 1930s,
              because the government promoted the exercise as a means to help the public
              develop physical and mental health.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">In the post-World War II
              period, more and more people visited the 88 temples on bus tours or in their
              own cars. The pilgrimage became a major tourist attraction for Shikoku when the
              Seto Ohashi bridge opened in 1988. Since the latter half of the 1990s, the
              ritual has been considered a sightseeing resource essential to vitalizing local
              communities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">“</span>Since
              those days, more and more media outlets have been promoting [the Shikoku
              pilgrimage] by focusing on its ties with Kukai,” Mori said. “In addition, an
              increasing number of young people try the holy trek on foot to seek a challenge
              or embark on a journey of self-discovery.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;">There are many different
              stories surrounding the Shikoku pilgrimage, including some traditional ones. It
              is important to scrutinize the historical background to have related properties
              registered as World Cultural Heritage sites.</p>
