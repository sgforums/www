              lightly. But as a wave of piety has swept through the country in recent years,
              the Minangkabau homeland has become a hotspot for orthodoxy and intolerance.</span></p>

              sported scruffy pigtails with their smart school uniforms a decade ago now
              parade through the dusty streets in starched cotton headscarves. It is one of
              several sharia bylaws enforced since 2005 by the former mayor, Fauzi Bahar, who
              also introduced Koran reading tests in schools and banned unmarried couples
              from frolicking in public.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"></span></p>

              he explains, a smile on his face and a Rolex on his wrist. “With time those
              values were gradually eroded, then people started to leave religion, they got
              involved in free relationships and promiscuity — I’ll bring them back to the

              economic growth and political infighting</span></a>, these outward signs of
              piety are feeding concerns that Indonesia’s tolerant brand of Islam is at risk.
              The anxiety has been compounded by the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and
              the Levant, also known as Isis or Isil, which has drawn some Indonesians to its
              vision of a “caliphate”.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The worries about Indonesians waging war in
              Syria are particularly potent in this country. Returning fighters threaten to
              revive local extremist groups and undo years of counterterrorism efforts by
              Jakarta, just as veterans of the Afghan war in the 1980s formed the
              al-Qaeda-sponsored Jemaah Islamiyah network that has carried out savage
              attacks, including the bombing of a Bali nightclub in 2002.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“It appears that Isil and what’s happening in
              Syria is providing better training and a network that might bring some of those
              basically isolated and ineffectual groups together,” says Elizabeth Pisani,
              author of</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'> </span></span><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Indonesia Etc.</span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“That poses
              a much bigger threat.”</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Yet analysts say there is little to link violent
              extremism with the social and political changes sweeping through Indonesia.
              “What people need to realise is the importance of symbolism and theatre in
              Indonesian life and politics, so what we’re getting is a lot more outward
              display of piety,” Ms Pisani says. “I don’t think there’s been particular
              change in the intensity of the people’s religious devotion and belief.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Michael Buehler, a lecturer at the School of
              Oriental and African Studies in London, says the new sharia laws are often a
              tool for secular politicians seeking to win votes. Padang’s former mayor may
              talk about reviving faith but by enforcing Koran reading classes he also
              creates business for powerful Islamic teachers who influence a vast bank of voters.
              Anti-alcohol laws may drain sales from supermarket chains but they also win
              support from small traders.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><span style="display: inline-block;  "> “You just
              put a social camouflage on corruption,” Mr Buehler says, estimating that about
              440 sharia bylaws have been issued across Indonesia, most in just six
              provinces.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">When the Indonesian constitution was drafted 70
              years ago politicians edited out the seven words ordering Muslims to follow
              sharia law, so many of these new religious rules are unconstitutional. Local
              leaders get around this by burying them in so-called “anti-sin” legislation,
              which bands together everything from child pornography to cafés playing music
              late into the evening.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Even among devout communities in rural Sumatra,
              not everyone supports religiously motivated policies. Ewasoska, head of the
              directorate for law and human rights in the small town of Padang Panjang, is
              among those concerned. The local government is asking a Christian church to
              secure consent from the surrounding community before it expands — a legal
              requirement which he says applies only to the construction of a new place of
              worship. His fear is that officials will hound minority communities to prove
              their credentials as good Muslims.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“Our Islamic leaders are afraid about what
              people will say, what the world will say,” he explains. “For me Islam is a very
              perfect religion but Muslims don’t understand Islam completely.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Many Indonesians still revere the Middle East as
              the centre of the Islamic world, where the religion is practised in its purest
              form, but there are attempts to broadcast the virtues of Southeast Asia’s more
              open form of Islam. Where the US saw the region as the second front in the “war
              on terror” under the Bush administration, it is now being presented as a model
              for other Islamic societies — and a counterbalance to the Wahhabi
              fundamentalism exported from the Middle East.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“We are trying in some ways — and actually the
              US pushes us — to be more bold in our efforts in showing to the world that
              Islam has different faces,” says Ibnu Hadi, who heads the north and Central
              America unit at the foreign affairs ministry. “In the Middle East the
              connotation is always violent and it’s harsh and rigid but in Asia [we’re] more
              tolerant and we can adapt.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Among the</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'> </span></span><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Pancasila</span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">, or five
              principles, forming Indonesia’s founding philosophy is belief in one God. Some
              87 per cent of the 250m population is Muslim, almost exclusively Sunni, 10 per
              cent is Christian and 2 per cent Hindu and Buddhist. Only atheism is an alien
              concept.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Academics say the moderate nature of Indonesian
              Islam comes down to history: the religion was introduced by travelling sufis
              and merchants rather than imposed by Turkish or Arab conquerors. With the
              population dispersed across about 17,000 islands, no single Islamic identity
              has emerged. Instead, local traditions, animism and mysticism have been
              combined with faith. Azyumardi Azra, a moderate thinker, takes the example of
              the custom of visiting the tombs of loved ones or holy saints, a practice that
              is frowned on by more traditional Muslims. “Indonesian Muslims love to practise
              what I call flowery Islam, colourful Islam,” he says.</span></p>

              of Islam may not reflect a deeper piety but they are big business. A growing
              army of “hijabers” flood the shopping malls, matching carefully draped
              headscarves with the skinniest of skinny jeans and vertiginous stilettos.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Muslim consumer spending on clothing and shoes
              in Indonesia reached $18.8bn in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.
              And “hijaber communities” have developed around specific designers, organising
              events where young Muslim women receive religious teaching alongside lessons on
              the newest headscarf fashion.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Dwita Yuniata, who works at Zalora, a local
              online fashion retailer, says headscarves have become popular not thanks to any
              rise in orthodoxy but because an array of new Islamic designers have made them
              more accessible. “It’s more a fashionable thing and everybody has their own
              style,” she explains. “All these hijabers, they need to have lots of selection,
              lots of colours.”</span></p>

              halal hotel industry, where Indonesia’s Muslim travellers spent some $7.5bn on
              outbound tourism excluding the hajj pilgrimage in 2013, according to Thomson
              Reuters.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In the lobby of the Sofyan Hotel Betawi in
              central Jakarta, green tinsel decorates the reception desk and industry
              certificates line the walls, but there are no obvious clues that the
              establishment is sharia-compliant. Meeting Islamic law simply means serving
              halal food, providing prayer mats and making sure unmarried couples do not
              share a room. Non-Muslims are welcome.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Sofyan family, originally from West Sumatra,
              began working towards compliance with sharia law at the hotel because it
              offered better returns. “If we are sharia compliant we broaden our market reach
              rather than narrowing it,” says Riyanto Sofyan, its chairman.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Signs of rising piety in Indonesia may have
              little to do with religiosity but they feed concerns about extremism, which has
              a long history across the archipelago. The violent Darul Islam group has been
              trying to create an Islamic state since it first emerged in the final years of
              Indonesia’s fight for independence from the Dutch some 70 years ago. And Jemaah
              Islamiyah fighters have carried out savage attacks.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Yet, given the size of the population, the
              number of serious terrorist incidents remains small. Indonesia ranks 31st out
              of 124 countries in the Global Terrorism Index published by the Institute of
              Economics and Peace last year, just below the US.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Powerful mainstream Muslim organisations such as
              the Muhammadiyah are a stabilising force, providing education and healthcare
              while emphasising to their 30m followers that Islam does not condone violence.
              Meanwhile, civil society groups conduct anti-radicalisation workshops and the
              Detachment 88 police force gathers intelligence.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Yet in recent years a new
              threat has emerged as Isis gains traction in the Middle East and attracts
              followers from across the globe. Jakarta officially banned the militant group a
              year ago but Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy
              Analysis of Conflict, says the police have little power to control radical
              preachers.</span><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><a style="-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;" title="Indonesia on alert over lure of Isis - ft.com" href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5db8e554-2ada-11e5-8613-e7aedbb7bdb7.html#axzz3jvmi2WzQ"><span style="color: #2e6e9e;">Abu Bakar Ba’asyir</span></a>, Indonesia’s best-known
              Islamist cleric, pledged allegiance to Isis from within a maximum-security

              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">More than 300 Indonesians are now fighting with
              Isis in the Middle East, Ms Jones estimates. The figure is low compared with
              the UK, where thousands have joined the militant group, but it is high for a
              distant country with a powerful Muslim majority and no fear of marginalisation
              or Islamophobia.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.55pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">“It’s a worrying trend because we have always
              been a laid-back society, we have always been tolerant and we are proud of our
              tolerant religion,” says Yenny Wahid, an Islamic activist and daughter of the
              late president, Abdurrahman Wahid. “But it is now under attack — there are
              people out there who try to spread the gospel of intolerance.”</span></p>
