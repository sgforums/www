              <p>I advise you to read up on Zen Buddhism before you comment. Zen Buddhism do not ask anybody to do silly things like giving up eating and drinking. I wonder where you get this idea from.</p>
              <p>Please don't comment on something that you have no knowledge of. You can always ask if you do not know.  </p>

              <p>Currently, I am reciting as much as  I can and also practising compassion, but I do not know if that is enough. Apart from reciting the buddha's name, I am not sure if I need to be mindful of anything else or do I just have to concentrate on the recitation and have faith in practising pureland.</p>

              <p>Just concentrate on the recitation, have faith and make vow to go. No need to practice any other forms of mindfulness else, will just jump from one method to another.</p>
              <p>Cause give rise to effect. When you recite Amitabha Buddha's name it's cause, Amitabha Buddha come it's effect. Only follow Amitabha Buddha. There was once a man who recited when he was about to pass on, he saw Di Zang Bodhisattva come, but he didn't follow. Then later Amitabha and the Bodhisattvas came then he follow to rebirth.</p>
              <p>Just have faith and keep reciting, but not recite mindlessly (unless you have to do other thinking work)... when there's nothing to do, concentrate and hear every syllabe of the name clearly.</p>

              <p>although bad spirits can disguise as bodhisattva and or even buddhas, but they cannot disguise as One's <em>Root</em> Buddha æœ¬å°Š. what's one's <em>Root</em> Buddha? <em>Root</em> Buddha is the Buddha u <strong>Often</strong> recite. that mean the Buddha is already Part of u.</p>
              <p>for example if u recite AmitÄ�bha everytime, then come Medicine Buddha, then u know it's not the real one.</p>
              <p>Besides, if u see the three, Amitabha, Guan Yin and Da Shi Zhi together, u can go with them. sometimes, they can even bring a whole lot of other bodhisattvas along.  bad spirits very hard to disguise.  </p>
              <p>In Contemplation Sutra, those of Arahant or hinayana path who last minute believe in Pureland, and who only know of one Buddha, will simply see one Buddha coming.</p>
              <p>another tip is a real AmitÄ�bha or Guan Yin or Da Shi Zhi's light is very soothing, even if it's bright, it's not glaring like the sun. all the disguise ones are not soothing and pretty glaring.</p>

              <p><br>the Buddha appearance will look like the Buddha in your mind, it's automatic projection of the mind.</p>
              <p>it's also advicable that u fix on an Amitabha Picture. tell your mind that this is going to be the one i'll see. don't change.</p>
              <p>a few people went to a Guan Yin Mountain to hope that they can have a sight at Guan Yin Pusa. they all did, but when they came down to describe the appeance, they are all quite different. some prefer Guan Yin wearing white, some prefer golden etc...</p>

              <p><br>u will know who's who, just like in the dream, u know who's who.</p>
              <p>although bad spirits can disguise as bodhisattva and or even buddhas, but they cannot disguise as One's <em>Root</em> Buddha æœ¬å°Š. what's one's <em>Root</em> Buddha? <em>Root</em> Buddha is the Buddha u <strong>Often</strong> recite. that mean the Buddha is already Part of u.</p>
              <p>for example if u recite AmitÄ�bha everytime, then come Medicine Buddha, then u know it's not the real one.</p>
              <p>Besides, if u see the three, Amitabha, Guan Yin and Da Shi Zhi together, u can go with them. sometimes, they can even bring a whole lot of other bodhisattvas along.  bad spirits very hard to disguise.  </p>
              <p>In Contemplation Sutra, those of Arahant or hinayana path who last minute believe in Pureland, and who only know of one Buddha, will simply see one Buddha coming.</p>
              <p>another tip is a real AmitÄ�bha or Guan Yin or Da Shi Zhi's light is very soothing, even if it's bright, it's not glaring like the sun. all the disguise ones are not soothing and pretty glaring.</p>

              <p>perhaps the problem here is not about whether the mind is non-confused or not. it's regarding the deptors å†¤äº²å€ºä¸» and bad spirits . even if your mind is non-confused , deptors å†¤äº²å€ºä¸» can also disturb. then it is about your good roots, blessings, virtues, and causal connections, as mentioned in Amitabha Sutra.</p>

              <p><br>u are right that u can follow any of the three saints from Pureland. detail are in Contemplation sutra. there was also a recorded case, about a guy, recited very well, and only Guan Yin Pusa came with a purple pedestal. the guy could go with Guan Yin Pu, but he rejected as he want higher attainment. then he recited even more sincerely, this time round, Amitabha came Himself with the golden pedestal. the guy was satisfy and went with Amitabha.</p>
              <p>but for me i would have gone with Guan Yin Pusa. Good enough for me. :)</p>
              <p>regarding asking, i think u can. just that my concern is a fake one lie to u? so u need to follow your Root Buddha æœ¬å°Š. that mean if u are in to Amitabha's Pureland, then if they say they are other than the three saints from Western Pureland, then u should not go with them. simple.</p>

              <p><br>u are right that u can follow any of the three saints from Pureland. detail are in Contemplation sutra. there was also a recorded case, about a guy, recited very well, and only Guan Yin Pusa came with a purple pedestal. the guy could go with Guan Yin Pu, but he rejected as he want higher attainment. then he recited even more sincerely, this time round, Amitabha came Himself with the golden pedestal. the guy was satisfy and went with Amitabha.</p>
              <p>but for me i would have gone with Guan Yin Pusa. Good enough for me. :)</p>
              <p>regarding asking, i think u can. just that my concern is a fake one lie to u? so u need to follow your Root Buddha æœ¬å°Š. that mean if u are in to Amitabha's Pureland, then if they say they are other than the three saints from Western Pureland, then u should not go with them. simple.</p>

              <p>For example, the Zen school teaches meditation on a "<a href="http://www.ymba.org/han/hanglo.htm#hua-t%27ou">hua-t'ou</a>"
                  (wato). Hua-t'ou means "before words," before a single thought rises up
                  in one's mind.<sup><a href="http://www.ymba.org/han/hannote.htm#N_2_"> (2)</a></sup> What is there
                  before a single thought rises up? It is No Thought. No thought is one's
                  own Pure Mind, one's own Buddha Nature, one's own Original Face. Meditating
                  on a hua-t'ou does not mean repeating it, because the repetition of a hua-t'ou
                  is also a great false thought. Rather, to recognize one's own Original
                  Face is the purpose of a hua-t'ou.</p>
              <p>The Pure Land school teaches <a href="http://www.ymba.org/han/hanglo.htm#buddha">Buddha Recitation</a> -- the repetition of <a href="http://www.ymba.org/han/hanglo.htm#amitabha">Amitabha</a> Buddha's
                  name. However, it does not teach merely to recite by mouth, like a parrot
                  mindlessly squawking out words. Buddha Recitation centered on the mind
                  is real Buddha Recitation. This is because Mind is Buddha, Buddha is Mind.
                  As the sutras state: "The Mind, Buddhas and Sentient Beings are undifferentiated
                  and equal." Outside of Mind, there is no Buddha, outside of Buddha, there
                  is no Mind. Buddha is Mind, Mind is Buddha. If a practitioner recites the
                  Buddha's name in this manner, he will gradually arrive at the stage where
                  there is neither Mind as subject nor Buddha as object. And there is neither
                  a subject reciting nor an object of recitation. This is the stage before
                  the arising of a single thought. This is the hua-t'ou and this is one's
                  own Original Face. If the practitioner can really understand the Dharma
                  as transcending subject and object, what difference is there between Zen
                  and Pure Land?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi <a href="/users/191627">knightlll</a>,</p>
              <p>When living beings aware of their pure nature for Pureland tradition, they began towards the journey of attainment. Along that path of bliss, their attainment varied in degrees and according to the Flower Adornment Sutra, there are altogether 52 categories of attainment where the last state 52 is supreme nature. Therefore the different in level of attainment in pureland is owing to sentient beings "purification" of mind per se. Even in supreme nature, there is individual vow on expediency &amp; yuan to liberate sentient beings of the ten directions.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, living beings that do not know their pure nature such as old folks etc may also be having different level of attainment in pureland or supreme enlightenment depending on their level of cultivation.</p>
