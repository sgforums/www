              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Although many believe that the ego is just a
              source of trouble, Thanissaro Bhikkhu teaches that a healthy, functioning ego
              is a crucial tool on the path to Awakening.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: #888888;">By Thanissaro
              Bhikkhu</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">YEARS BACK, many Buddhist teachers in the
              West began using the term “egolessness” to explain the Buddha’s teaching on
              not-self. Since then, egolessness has come to mean many things to many people.
              Sometimes egolessness is used to mean a lack of conceit or self-importance;
              sometimes, a pure mode of acting without thought of personal reward. In its
              most extended form, though, the teaching on egolessness posits a fundamental
              error of perception: that despite our sense of a lasting, separate self, no
              such self really exists. According to this view, to provide for the happiness
              of this illusory self, we not only place our hopes on an impossible goal but
              also harm ourselves and everyone around us. If we could only see the fallacy of
              the ego and understand its harmful effects, we would let it go and find true happiness
              in the interconnectedness that is our true nature.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">At least that’s what we’re told, and often
              with a fair amount of vehemence. Buddhist writers, often so gentle and
              nonjudgmental, can quickly turn vicious when treating the ego. Some portray it
              as a tyrannical bureaucracy deserving violent overthrow; others, as a ratlike
              creature—nervous, scheming, and devious—that must be squashed. Whatever the
              portrait, the message is always that the ego is so pernicious and tenacious
              that any mental or verbal abuse directed against it is fair play in getting it
              to loosen its foul grip on the mind.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">But when people trained in classical Western
              psychotherapy read these attacks on the ego, they shake their heads in
              disbelief. For them the ego is not something evil. It’s not even a singular
              thing you can attack. It’s a cluster of activities, a set of functions in the
              mind—and necessary functions at that. Any mental act by which you mediate
              between your raw desires for immediate pleasure and your super-ego—the<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">oughts</span></em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">shoulds</span></em><span> </span>you’ve learned from family and
              society—is an ego function. Ego functions are our mental strategies for gaining
              lasting happiness in the midst of the conflicting demands whispering and
              shouting in the mind. They enable you to say No to the desire to have sex with
              your neighbor’s spouse, in the interest of a greater happiness. They also
              enable you to say No to the demands of your parents, teachers, or government
              when those demands would jeopardize your own best interest.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">But ego functions don’t just say No. They
              also have a mediator’s sense of when to say Yes. If they’re skillful, they
              negotiate among your desires and your super-ego so that you can gain the
              pleasure you want in a way that causes no harm and can actually do a great deal
              of good. If your ego functions are healthy and well-coordinated, they give you
              a consistent sense of priorities as to which forms of happiness are more
              worthwhile than others; a clear sense of where your responsibilities do and
              don’t lie; a strong sense of your ability to judge right and wrong for
              yourself; and an honest sense of how to learn from your past mistakes for the
              sake of greater happiness in the future.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">From this perspective, egolessness would be
              a disaster. A person devoid of ego functions would be self-destructive: either
              a beast with uncontrolled impulses, or a neurotic, repressed automaton with no
              mind of her own, or an infantile monster thrashing erratically between these
              two extremes. Anyone who tried to abandon ego functioning would arrest his
              psychological growth and lose all hope of becoming a mature, responsible,
              trustworthy adult. And as we know, self-destructive people don’t destroy only
              themselves. They can pull down many of the people and places around them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This is not only the view of trained Western
              psychologists. Buddhist communities in the West have also begun to recognize
              this problem and have coined the term “spiritual bypassing” to describe it: the
              way people try to avoid dealing with the problems of an unintegrated
              personality by spending all their time in meditation retreats, using the mantra
              of egolessness to short-circuit the hard work of mastering healthy ego
              functioning in the daily give and take of their lives.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Then there’s the problem of self-hatred. The
              Dalai Lama isn’t the only Asian Buddhist teacher surprised at the amount of
              self-hatred found in the West. Unfortunately, a lot of people with toxic
              super-egos have embraced the teaching on egolesness as the Buddha’s stamp of
              approval on the hatred they feel toward themselves.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">These problems have inspired many Western
              psychologists to assume a major gap in the Buddha’s teachings: that in
              promoting egolessness, the Buddha overlooked the importance of healthy ego
              functioning in finding true happiness. This assumption has led to a corollary:
              that Buddhism needs the insights of Western psychotherapy to fill the gap; that
              to be truly effective, a healthy spiritual path needs to give equal weight to
              both traditions. Otherwise you come out lopsided and warped, an idiot savant
              who can thrive in the seclusion of a three-year retreat, but can’t handle three
              hours caught in heavy traffic with three whining children.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This corollary assumes, though, that for the
              past twenty-six hundred years Buddhism hasn’t produced any healthy functioning
              individuals: that the collective consciousness of Buddhist Asian society has
              suppressed individualism, and that the handful of dysfunctional meditation
              teachers who came to the West—the ones who mastered the subtleties of formal
              meditation but tripped over the blatant pitfalls of American money and sex—are
              typical of the Buddhist tradition. But I wonder if this is so.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">My own experience in Asia
              certainly doesn’t confirm this. During my sixteen years in Thailand I met, per capita, more people with a
              genuinely individual outlook on life and far fewer neurotics than I did on
              returning to the mass-media-produced minds of America. My teacher, Ajaan Fuang,
              had the healthiest functioning ego of anyone I had ever met—and he knew nothing
              of Western psychology. This observation doesn’t apply just to the Thai
              tradition. Psychologists have studied ordinary Tibetan monks and nuns who have
              survived years of torture—the severest test of healthy ego functioning—and
              found that they bear no psychological scars.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">So there are many Asian Buddhists who
              clearly know the secret of how to develop a healthy ego. Some psychologists
              would have us believe that this was despite, rather than due to, their Buddhist
              training, but that belief could easily be based on a superficial reading of the
              Buddhist tradition. So we need to put this belief to the test.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">One way would be to read the ancient texts
              with new eyes. Instead of assuming that the not-self teaching is counseling
              egolessness, how about assuming that it’s part of a regimen for developing a
              healthy ego? This idea may seem counterintuitive, but that’s no measure of its
              usefulness. The measure lies in testing it as a hypothesis. So as a thought
              experiment, let’s look at the earliest record of the Buddha’s teachings, the
              Pali canon, from the perspective of Western psychology and pose a question: is
              there any evidence that the Buddha was advocating a healthy ego?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Actually, tips on healthy ego functioning fill the texts. To begin
              with, the Buddha defines a wise person as one who knows the difference between
              what are and what are not his personal responsibilities, one who takes on only
              his own responsibilities and not those of others. This is the first principle
              in any ego functioning. Then there’s the famous verse 290 of the<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Dhammapada:</span></em></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">If, by forsaking a limited ease,<span> </span><br> he would see an abundance of ease,<span> </span><br> the enlightened person<span> </span><br> would forsake the limited ease<span> </span><br> for the sake of the abundant.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This is practically a definition of how ego functions operate
              well.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">These insights aren’t random. They’re based on another assumption
              necessary for a healthy ego: the teaching on karma, that we’re responsible for
              our actions and that we’re going to experience their results. This assumption
              in turn is framed by the larger psychology of the Noble Eightfold Path. As any
              therapist will tell you, a healthy ego is strengthened by developing a healthy
              super-ego whose<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">shoulds</span></em><span> </span>are humane and realistic. It’s also
              strengthened by the ability to safely satisfy your raw demands for immediate
              happiness so that the ego’s long-term strategies don’t get derailed by sudden
              overwhelming desires. These two functions are filled, respectively, by the
              Eightfold Path factors of right view and right concentration.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Right view contains the Buddha’s<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">shoulds,</span></em><span><em> </em></span>which are in service to the
              desire to find true happiness. You divide your experience into four categories:
              suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. Then you
              take to heart the imperatives proper to each: comprehending suffering,
              abandoning its cause, realizing its cessation, and developing the path. That’s
              the Buddhist recipe for a healthy super-ego—a series of<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">shoulds</span></em><span> </span>that are on your side, that never ask
              you to sacrifice your own true well-being for the sake of anyone or anything
              else.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">As for right concentration, one of its crucial factors is a sense
              of bliss independent of sensual objects and drives. When you gain some skill in
              meditation and can tap into that bliss whenever you want, you can satisfy your
              desire for immediate pleasure, at the same time weakening any demand that the
              pleasure be sensual. As the Buddha once noted, people pursue sensual pleasure,
              with all of its inherent limitations, simply because they see no other
              alternative to physical and mental pain. But once you’ve mastered this more
              refined alternative, you’ve found a new way to feed the demand for pleasure
              right now, freeing the ego to function more effectively.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">You have also learned the key to the Buddha’s strategy for true
              happiness: It is possible to taste an immediate gratification that causes no harm
              to yourself or anyone else. Genuine happiness doesn’t require that you take
              anything away from anyone—which means that it in no way conflicts with the
              genuine happiness of others.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This understanding is revolutionary. For people dependent on
              sensual pleasures, happiness is a zero-sum affair. There are only so many
              things, only so many people, to go around. When you gain something, someone
              else has lost it; when they’ve gained, you’ve lost. In a zero-sum world, the
              pursuit of your own happiness constantly has to be negotiated and compromised
              with that of others. But when people access the bliss of right concentration,
              they’ve found a way to satisfy their own desire for happiness in a way that can
              actively augment the happiness of those around them. When they’re more content
              and at peace within, they radiate a healthy influence in all directions. This
              is how healthy ego functioning, from the Buddhist perspective, benefits others
              as well as yourself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The classic image illustrating this point is of two acrobats, the
              first standing on the end of a vertical bamboo pole, the second standing on the
              shoulders of the first. To perform their tricks and come down safely, each has
              to look after his or her own sense of balance. In other words, life is a
              balancing act. By maintaining your balance, you make it easier for others to
              maintain theirs. This is why, in the Buddhist equation, the wise pursuit of
              happiness is not a selfish thing. In fact, it underlies all the qualities
              traditionally associated not only with the path the Buddha taught to his
              disciples but also with the Buddha himself: wisdom, compassion, and purity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Wisdom, the Buddha says, starts with a simple question: What
              actions will lead to my long-term welfare and happiness? The wisdom here lies
              in realizing that your happiness depends on what you do, and that the pursuit
              of happiness is worthwhile only if it’s long-term. The test of how far your
              wisdom has matured lies in the strategic skill with which you can keep yourself
              from doing things that you like to do but that would cause long-term harm, and
              the skill with which you can talk yourself into doing things that you don’t
              like to do but that would lead to long-term well-being and happiness. In other
              words, mature wisdom requires a mature ego.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The ego basis for compassion is depicted in one of the most
              delightful stories in the canon. King Pasenadi, in a tender moment with his
              favorite consort, Queen Mallika, asks her, “Is there anyone you love more than
              yourself?” He’s anticipating, of course, that she’ll answer, “Yes, your
              majesty. You.” And it’s easy to see where a B-movie script would go from there.
              But this is the Pali canon, and Queen Mallika is no ordinary queen. She
              answers, “No, your majesty, there isn’t. And how about you? Is there anyone you
              love more than yourself?” The king, forced into an honest answer, has to admit,
              “No, there’s not.” Later he reports this conversation to the Buddha, who
              responds in an interesting way:</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Searching all directions<br> with one’s awareness,<br> one finds no one dearer<br> than oneself.<br> In the same way, others<br> are fiercely dear to themselves.<br> So one should not hurt others<br> if one loves oneself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">In other words, true self-love requires an appreciation that
              others feel self-love, too. This principle works in two ways: First, you recognize
              that if your happiness depends on the misery of others it won’t last, for
              they’ll do whatever they can to destroy that happiness. Your long-term
              happiness thus has to take into account the long-term happiness of others.
              Second, in a less calculating way, you recognize what we all have in common. If
              you take your own self-love seriously, you have to respect the self-love of
              others. In this way, compassion is based not on a sense of your superiority to
              those who are suffering but on a sense of mutual respect—a respect solidly
              based in your own self-interest.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Purity grows from providing your ego-based wisdom and compassion
              with a reality check. The Buddha once taught his son, Rahula, that purity is
              developed by examining your actions and their results to make sure that they
              actually cause no harm to yourself or to those around you. If you anticipate
              harm from an intended action, you don’t do it. If you see unanticipated harm
              coming from something you’ve done, you freely admit your mistake and learn how
              not to repeat it. You don’t cling childishly to the need to always be in the
              right. But if you see that you aren’t causing harm, you can take joy in the
              fact that you’re on the path to true happiness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Because the Buddha saw how these enlightened qualities of wisdom,
              compassion, and purity could be developed through the pursuit of happiness, he
              never told his followers to practice his teachings without expecting any gain
              in return. He understood that such a demand would create an unhealthy dynamic
              in the mind. In terms of Western psychology, expecting no gain in return would
              give license for the super-ego to run amok. Instead, the Buddha taught that
              even the principle of renunciation is a trade. You exchange candy for gold,
              trading lesser pleasures for greater happiness. So he encouraged people to be
              generous with their time and possessions because of the inner rewards they
              would receive in return. He taught moral virtue as a gift: when you observe the
              precepts without ifs, ands, or buts, you give unconditional safety to all other
              beings, and in return you receive a share of that safety as well.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Even when advocating that his disciples abandon their sense of
              self, the Buddha justified this teaching on the basis of the rewards it would
              bring. He once asked his monks, “If anyone were to burn the trees in this
              monastery, would you suffer with the sense that they were burning you?”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">“No,” the monks replied, “because we’re not the trees.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">“In the same way,” the Buddha continued, “let go of what’s not you
              or yours: the senses and their objects. That will be for your long-term
              well-being and happiness.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Notice that he didn’t say to abandon the sense of self as a form
              of self-sacrifice. He said to abandon it for the sake of true well-being and
              happiness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This point highlights one of the special features of the Buddha’s
              instructions for healthy ego-development. In Western psychology,
              ego-development is impossible without assuming a clear sense of self. But in
              Buddhism, with its realization that there is no clear dividing line between
              your own true happiness and that of others, the underlying assumption of
              ego-development is a clear sense of cause and effect, seeing which actions lead
              to suffering, which ones lead to short-term happiness, and which ones lead to a
              happiness that lasts.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">This is one of the reasons why the Buddha never used terms like
              “ego-development” or “a well-integrated self.” The types of functioning we
              associate with a well-developed ego he would have described as a
              well-integrated sense of cause and effect focused on insights into the results
              of your actions. Buddhist practice is aimed at refining these insights to ever
              greater levels of sensitivity and skill. In this way he was able to teach
              healthy ego functioning while avoiding the twin pitfalls of ego-obsession:
              narcissism and self-hatred.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Because of the Buddha’s basic terms of analysis were actions
              understood under the framework of cause and effect, we have to understand his
              use of “self “ and “not-self “ under that framework. For him, “self “ and
              “not-self “ aren’t metaphysical principles. They’re mental actions that can be
              mastered as skills. This is why he was able to use both concepts freely in his
              teaching. When the concept of self was conducive to skillful action, he would
              talk in terms of self—not only on the level of generosity and virtue, but also
              on the level of meditation. If you think that meditation is an exercise in
              not-self from the very beginning, read the discourses on mindfulness and you’ll
              be surprised at how often they describe the meditator’s internal dialogue in
              terms of “I,” “me,” and “mine.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">As for the concept of not-self, the Buddha would advise using it
              whenever unskillful attachment to things or patterns of behavior got in the way
              of your happiness. In effect, he would have you drop unhealthy and unskillful
              ways of self-identification in favor of ways that were more skillful and
              refined. Only on the highest levels of practice, where even the most skillful
              concepts of self get in the way of the ultimate happiness, did the Buddha
              advocate totally abandoning them. But even then he didn’t advocate abandoning
              the basic principle of ego functioning. You drop the best happiness that can
              come from a sense of self because an even greater happiness—nirvana, totally
              timeless, limitless, and unconditioned—appears when you do.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">So this is where our thought experiment has led. If you open your
              mind to the idea that the Buddha was actually advocating ego-development
              instead of egolessness, you see that there’s nothing lopsided or lacking in his
              understanding of healthy ego functioning. In fact, he mastered some ego skills
              that Western psychology has yet to explore, such as how to use right
              concentration to satisfy the desire for immediate pleasure; how to develop an
              integrated sense of causality that ultimately makes a sense of self
              superfluous; how to harness the ego’s drive for lasting happiness so that it
              leads to a happiness transcending space and time.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">These principles have taught many Asian Buddhists how to develop
              healthy egos over the centuries—so healthy that they can ultimately drop the
              need to create “self.” All that remains is for us to put these principles to
              the test, to see if they work for us as well.</span></p>
