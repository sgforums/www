Lack of organization, undecided, lack of orthodoxy.<br>Buddhism will continue to grow at a faster pace in western countries. It's the fastest growing religion in Australia, Canada, and other european countries, and growing rapidly in countries like U.S too. Dalai Lama already became the most popular religious leader in Canada, more popular than the Pope.<br><br>Philosophy alone I believe, isn't enough. They must look on the practical side of the teachings. As for Buddhism, Buddhism is a part of life, it's a way of living and we can experience Dharma every moment.<br><br>As for the.. "onslaught of monotheism", it is true, Monotheism is going to sweep across the Asian (and African) continent.<br><br>On the other hand, it is slowly losing followers in the western countries. There is a cultural, religious exchange. Buddhism is in the process of being transferred to these nations.<br><br>It is prophecised that within this century, Buddhism will die out in much of Asia. It is also prophecised however, that Buddhism is going to spread to the west.<br><br>"The prophecy further says that during the reign of the 21st. king, Aniruddha (1927-2027), Buddhism and the Kalachakra will have nearly come to an end in Tibet, Mongolia, China and much of Asia. This could certainly be said to be accurate! For example, after the Chinese invasion in Tibet in 1959 and the destruction of nearly all monasteries afterwards, the master Ven. Kirti Tsenshab Rinpoche was the only remaining Tibetan master holding a specific lineage of the Vimalaprabha (the 'Stainless Light' commentary); which is one of the only two main Kalachakra texts."<br><br>It is true that Buddhism has almost totally died out especially in China with major damage in Tibet after the communist takeover.<br><br>And here's the prophecy that Buddhism is going to the west, with Tibetans going exile.<br><br>'When the iron bird flies and horses run on wheels, the Tibetans will scatter like ants and Buddhism will return to the land of the red man.'<br><br>Very impressive the ancient sages were able to foresee such developments.</div>

In fact, majority of Chinese is practicing Taoist tradition without knowing it. In terms of teachings, the Tao Te Ching is widely translated in different language, it is second to the bible that is so widespread.<br><br>Taoist religion is formed and set in a way that follow the way of the Three Pure Ones.(San Qing) - Yuan Shi Tian Zun. Ling Bao Tian Zun and Dao De Tian Zun aka Tai Shang lao jun. Taoist seek refuge in the Three Pure Ones and uphold the Three Treasures - the Tao, the way, the master (dao ,jing, shi)<br><br>If we examine taoism, there is not much of a problem. the problem lies on the external. due to the decline of the Taoist religion in the ming-ching period, Taoism suffered alot of setback. our forefathers in Sg did not lay a good foundation and as you said, they only brought in the normal praying rites over, leaving the teachings.<br><br>But, in the recent yrs, the Taoist community is doing alot to revive the religion.<br><br>Examples are Taoist org in Hk, conducting talks frequently. China Taoist org is trying hard to preseve orthodox taoism too.<br><br>malaysia taoist org and sg taoist org are doing alot of work to educate taoist youth.<br><br>10 yrs ago, no one, in the papers, in the media will mention the word 'taoism'. at least now, there are ppl, like u and me who know the problems taoism is facing. this is a good sign. it is never too late.<br>as what the Tao te ching said, a thousand miles begin with the first step. we had taken the first, and we will reach a thousand mile ultimately.<br><br>And as what Lu Xun, the great chinese writer said, the root of the chinese are found in the Taoist religion. Taoism is deeply rooted in Chinese heritage and cannot be seperated. Taoism will make use of this advantage to the fullest to ride off superstitious and bring back the true meaning of taosim.<br><br>heavenly blessings</div>
