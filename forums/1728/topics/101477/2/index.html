            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fett:</div><div class="quote_body">how come all over the world, people talk about the Prince but no one talk about the Princess and the child they had? read an article about it some months bad. it really is unfair to her and the child siddhartha leave behind.</div></blockquote>Your statement seems all too familiar...<br><br>It was not unfair. Prince Siddhartha could have became a Universal Monarch as prophecised by some ascetics (many ascetics prophecised that he will either become a universal monarch or Buddha, with one ascetic prophecising that he WILL certainly attain buddhahood). He is the greatest hope for his father, his father intends to give him the throne and let him rule his lands. However, after seeing that things are impermanent, after seeing the 4 sights - old age, sickness, death and the holy person, he has convinced himself that he could not bring true happiness to people around the world if he could not find the truth to end birth and death. He could give gold to poor, he could sacrifice what he has for his people, but he could not liberate them from sufferings ultimately. He has thus set out his quest for the Buddhadharma so that he will be able to save sentient beings from all directions on Earth. This, is more important than being a universal monarch for him.<br><br>When Buddha left his palace, he tried to bring his son secretly without letting his wife know. However, because his son was tightly held by his wife, and it's too dangerous for him to grab the baby or else it will certainly wake his wife. So, he had no choice but to leave the palace without the baby.<br><br>Buddha said that he will only return when he had found the truth to liberation. When he became a Buddha, he sent his disciple to ask his wife to allow his son to renunce, saying that he intends to bring him to the path of Sainthood. The wife detested at first, but when Buddha appeared in front of her miraculously (Buddha seldom appear in this way but only in special instances), and explained to her about impermanence and the futility of samsaric relation and talked about their history in previous life and the pointlessness of it, that his wife has been liberated from her sorrows and to allow Rahula to be ordained.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lord Buddha received from his father a message asking him to visit his native place, so that he might see him once more before he died. Buddha accepted his invitation gladly and started for Kapilavastu. He stayed in a forest outside the city. His father and relatives came to see him, but they were not pleased with their ascetic Gautama. They left the place after a short time. They did not make any arrangement for his and his followers' daily food. After all, they were worldly people. Buddha went to the city and begged his food from door to door. This news reached the ears of his father. He tried to stop Gautama from begging. Gautama said: "O king, I am a mendicant - I am a monk. It is my duty to get alms from door to door. This is the duty of the Order. Why do you stop this ? The food that is obtained from alms is very pure". His father did not pay any attention to the words of Gautama. He snatched the bowl from his hand and took him to his palace. All came to pay Buddha their respects, but his wife Yasodhara did not come. She said, "He himself will come to me, if I am of any value in his eyes". She was a very chaste lady endowed with Viveka (discrimination), Vairagya (dispassion) and other virtuous qualities. From the day she lost her husband she gave up all her luxuries. She took very simple food once daily and slept on a mat. She led a life of severe austerities. Gautama heard all this. He was very much moved. He went at once to see her. She prostrated at his feet. She caught hold of his feet and burst into tears. Buddha established an order of female ascetics. Yasodhara became the first of the Buddhistic nuns.<br><br>Yasodhara pointed out the passing Buddha to her son through a window and said, "O Rahula! That monk is your father. Go to him and ask for your birthright. Tell him boldly, 'I am your son. Give me my heritage'". Rahula at once went up to Buddha and said, "Dear father, give me my heritage". Buddha was taking his food then. He did not give any reply. The boy repeatedly asked for his heritage. Buddha went to the forest. The boy also silently followed him to the forest. Buddha said to one of his disciples, "I give this boy the precious spiritual wealth I acquired under the sacred Bo-tree. I make him the heir to that wealth". Rahula was initiated into the order of monks. The King, discovering that now his grandson and a number of young men in the royal family had requested ordination, asked the Buddha only to ordain a minor with the consent of his parents or guardian. The Buddha assented. This rule was expanded to include the spouses of those intending to join the Order of monks and nuns. The Venerable Rahula was known for his humility and his desire for spiritual learning. He shunned any special consideration as the son of the Awakened One, and was noted for his high standard of discipline. Eventually, he realized Enlightenment. The Venerable Rahula predeceased the Buddha.</span><br><br>Rahula entered into the Sangha and became the youngest disciple. He became one of the top 10 disciples of Buddha and have attained Arhatship and Nirvana. His wife, Yasodhara, also attained Arhatship and Nirvana.<br><br>Not everyone is so fortunate to have a Father that could bring his son to Liberation from Samsara! He has liberated his wife from the samsaric cycle of their relationships and cleared her sorrows, bringing an end to all her sufferings! So yes, maybe, it's a little unfair that not everyone has an enlightened one as their relative.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Then he say Buddhism in a way do clash with Chinese culture of filial piety</blockquote>Chinese model of filial is such: Xiao4 Shun4.<br><br>Buddhism's model of filial piety is such: Only Xiao4.<br><br>We do our part as children to repay the debts of our parent's kindness, that hardly can be repayed even after 7 lives. However, it is unnecessary that we have to always listen to our parents, especially on their delusioned and samsaric thinkings. If your parents smoke, and your parents offer you a stick of cigarrettes, you cannot just "Shun4". It is their delusion, not yours, you do your duty as a child, that's it.<br><br>What's more, I've noticed some doubtful Mahayana sutras on filial piety. I would like to emphasize: Not every filial piety sutras in Mahayana are unauthentic, but certain filial piety sutras have scholars doubting. Usually, when a sutra uses very very emotional ways to get your attension, or make you feel "touched" and attached to your parents, then perhaps it may be doubtful. Buddism's filial piety is not linked to attachments nor strong emotional linkings. So, be mindful, judge for yourself what you read like the <a href="http://www.alc.enta.net/kalama.htm" rel="nofollow">Kalama Sutra</a>.</div>

Zen? haha....to 'chim' for me at that time..so never go into it.<br><br>well, taoism indeed has alot of taoist masters. although some had diff ideas and concept, but all are still within the Tao and Te. and hold Lao Tze words as guidelines.<br><br>as for superstitous, it is only in folk taoism (ming jian dao jiao) then we can find. the chinese/devotees often insert their own interpretation or local customs into the religion they believe in. like our forefathers who came to Sg, they did not bring in the teachings of taoism but only the very superficial part, simply praying and devotion to the divines. and thus, it is common to find superstitous in it.<br><br>our aim is to rectify this problem(objective of the forum too) and bring back orthodox taoism. u can call it a type of 'upgrading bah'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>it is common for non-taoist to find some taoist practice custom new and even strange. it is alright. if there is anything unsure, or in doubt, unclear, feel free to discuss. lets learn together.</div>

I don't think the Buddha will tell his disciples that when he was leaving the palace he actually wanted to bring Rahula along. What was he going to feed him? He knew that being an ascetic meant a lot of hardship, how's he going to take care of a baby?<br><br>As for the Buddha being irresponsible. Suppose a kid was told by his mum to go buy food for dinner and gave him $10. So the kid happily went on his way to the hawker centre. On the way, he saw a destitute woman with a kid starving away. So he gave them the $10 and went home. Do you think the mother will say that he is being irresponsible?<br><br>Which is the greater suffering - infinite rebirth in Samsara or doing without a husband/father for less than 10 years?<br><br>We all have various duties in this birth, some people are more family-based, they see taking care of the family as their foremost duty. However, for someone who has the ability to take care of a whole company, or even a whole nation, can we accuse him of being irresponsible because he does not have the time to take care of his family?<br><br>Furthermore, in Buddhism it is said that all sentient beings have in one birth or the other been our parents, our children, our spouse, our friends, our relatives, our teachers, our students, our enemies etc. So suppose the Buddha chose family over enlightenment, wouldnt that be irresponsible towards all sentient beings who have been his mother?<br></div>
