            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhists are taught not place emphasis on this as the aim of Buddhism is to develop wisdom and compassion and thereby attain Nirvana. Knowing how the universe began can contribute nothing to this task. <strong><span class="large">The purpose of this topic is just to share the ideas and views from Buddhism. </span></strong><br><br>All religions have myths and stories which attempt to answer this question. In ancient times, when many simply did not know, such myths were adequate, but in the 20th century, in the age of physics, astronomy and geology, such myths have been superseded by scientific fact. Science has explained the origin of the universe without recourse to the god-idea. What does the Buddha say about the origin of the universe? It is interesting that the BuddhaÂ’s explanation of the origin of the universe corresponds very closely to the scientific view. In the Aganna Sutta, the Buddha described the universe being destroyed and then re-evolving into its present form over a period of countless millions of years. The first life formed on the surface of the water and again, over countless millions of years, evolved from simple into complex organisms. <strong>All these processes are without beginning or end, and are set in motion by natural causes. </strong><br><br>Infinite Causes is so named because of the belief that there are an infinite number of causes and conditions that made the world the way it is. There <strong>is no Â‘first causeÂ’ or Â‘one causeÂ’ because all things are intertwined in an endless web of causality with no beginning and no end. </strong>Both natural and supernatural forces may be involved.<br><br><strong>There are many universes</strong>, of many possible types. We happen to be in one. There may be both natural and supernatural causes that set the physical conditions of our universe the way they are and allowed life of our type to come into being. However, there is no need to believe that this is the best possible universe<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An infinite web of causes and conditions affects the development of every instant in our lives and the world we live in. This includes our own actions. <strong>Karmic theory is based on the unseen bonds between living sentient beings, whereby every action we take has consequences. These consequences have an impact not only on all around us but also, through stress on the interconnections between us and everything else, reflect back on ourselves as well (either in this lifetime or in the future). </strong>However, this is not fate, because you can change your own karma, or by acts of compassion and mercy, alleviate the negative karma of those you help. In a Buddhist worldview, we help create our own reality. The discoveries of quantum physics do not trouble Buddhists the way they do members of Â‘divine planÂ’ based faiths, because the transitory nature of each moment was well understood by the Buddha, as was the interconnected condition of our existence.<br><br><strong>Quantum physics theory reveals a universe of constant change, where events are only probabilities until there is an interaction with an observer. This effect of an observing mind on the future of the universe is consistent with Buddhist concepts that we are all interconnected and our actions and even presence can affect everyone and everything around us.</strong><br><br>The Buddhist view of the world allows changes that occur over eons measured in millions of years or even billions of years. The Buddhist view of the world is that nothing that arises is permanent; all things are temporary and transitory. <strong>Because there is no design or plan,</strong> there is no objection to the idea that the worldÂ’s ecosystems have changed so dramatically that whole species have died out.<br><br>The evolution of life is, of course, the aspect of science that is causing the most vicious debate in theological and philosophical circles (since it deals with our direct ancestry, not obscure math like quantum theory or the theory of relativity). However, <strong>the fossil record clearly shows organisms existed that mix characteristics of fish and amphibians, amphibians and reptiles, reptiles and mammals, reptiles and birds, and so on, none of which would exist in a Creationist universe. </strong><br><br>The Buddhist view that many beings in many universes would be capable of sentient thought and potentially capable of being affected by karmic bonds means.There is no objection to common ancestry with other species on Earth and no belief that such ancestry Â‘lowersÂ’ the value of human life at all<br><br>The idea of the evolution of life has been tested with two completely independent sources of information. One is the fossil record. The other is the DNA sequence evidence that all life known on Earth has common roots. Again, there would be no similarity between molecules in a human body and an ape, let alone a mouse, if these organisms had been built uniquely for their specific niches and tasks in a divine plan. Instead, each is clearly a modification of a common set of parts, stretched by expanding gene families and altering gene regulation and development.<br></div>

Most religions will teach that the world was created by a Creator.  But why do so many people fall into such misconception?  It is because <strong>our mind  is conditioned to see things in a linear manner</strong>; that is having a starting point and an end.

TMC-1 is starless; it is cold and dark and has a temperature of only 10 degrees above absolute zero.<br><br>"The discovery of these large organic molecules in the coldest regions of the interstellar medium has certainly changed the belief that large organic molecules would only have their origins in hot molecular cores," said study team member Anthony Remijan of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). "It has forced us to rethink the paradigms of interstellar chemistry."<br><br>Just because a molecule is organic does not mean that it is made by living things. In fact, many of the newly spotted molecules are poisonous to organisms on Earth, Hollis said. But one of the molecules found in Sagittarius B2(N), called acetamide, contains a type of chemical bond important for linking together amino acids, the molecular building blocks of proteins.<br><br>Made up of 9 atoms, acetamide "is the largest molecule found in space that has that bond," Hollis told SPACE.com.<br><br><strong>Space tumbleweeds</strong><br><br>The molecules are thought to form by two main mechanisms. In the first, simple chemical reactions add an atom to a molecule that is stuck to the surface of a dust grain afloat in space. The second method involves chemical reactions between neutral molecules and highly reactive molecules called radicals.<br><br>Once formed, the molecules are shaken loose from their dust-grain homes by rapidly moving shock waves. As the freed molecules tumble end-over-end in space, they can emit or absorb radiation at precise radio frequencies unique to each type of molecule. Astronomers identify the molecules based on these radio frequencies.<br><br>Within a dust cloud, thousands of billions of molecules undergo the same types of rotation, emitting and absorbing the same radio frequencies. The end result is a signal strong enough to be detected by instruments on Earth.<br><br>The newfound molecules bring the total number of biologically-relevant molecules found in interstellar space to 141. Scientists have previously found benzene, a ring-shaped carbon molecule important for life on Earth, around stars and intact amino acids in meteorites that have crash-landed on Earth.<br><br>Even more complex molecular creations might be possible in space, experiments suggest. In one study, scientists simulated deep space conditions in the laboratory and created small structures resembling cell walls in living organisms.<br><br><strong>A case for extraterrestrial life</strong><br><br>Taken together, the findings suggest that the chemical ingredients necessary for life began taking shape long before our planet was formed.<br><br>Many scientists now accept the notion that ancient meteorites and comets helped jumpstart life on our planet by bringing a significant amount of water, organic molecules and even amino acids to early Earth.<br><br>Scientists now think those imprisoned organic molecules were likely created in the massive dust and gas clouds that eventually coalesced into planets and stars, comets and meteorites. Dust clouds are thought to form when events such as novas and supernovas caused chemical elements and molecules created during thermonuclear reactions inside stars to be ejected into space.<br><br>Hollis says his team plans to keep using the Green Bank Telescope to continue searching for other biologically-significant molecules.<br><br>"From a research and astrobiology point of view, it's been a goldmine," he said.</div>

In fact he even quite ACCURATELY told us how long the universe began, according to calculations based on the Buddha it is roughly 17 billions years ago.. In modern science, it is "between 11 to 20 billion years" and is constantly revised. Many other religions aren't even close to that.<br><br>But, before the current universe, we do not know. The Buddha says that our universe undergoes cycles of formation and then it will end and a new one will begin again, never endingly.<br><br>On the ultimate level, there is no beginning and no ending, because all are merely a constant flux. If you grasp on something as an entity, then of course you will see its beginning, and ending. On the relative level it is true. But on the ultimate level reality cannot be comprehended through concepts. There is neither beginning nor ending, only a constant flux, and flow - like waterfall, wind, etc. In short all there ever is is Change.</div></blockquote></div>
