                                          <p>you are entitled to your own belief, nobody can change anyone.
                          It is only through proper reasoning and if your case, your
                          "reasoning" comes not from a Buddhist viewpoint but from your own
                          personal view, what more can I do ? This is happening because your
                          foundation upon Buddhism is not built through basic tenets but
                          through a parallel and similarity with other religion level.<br>
                          <br>
                          First you accuse me of being intolerant and uncompassionate to
                          other religions and after that you found no evidence of me aganist
                          any other religons then now youiu start accusing me of paying lip
                          service. If the purpose of our exhcnage here is to "win over"
                          someone, then it would be completely useless, I am saying this to
                          you and myself, because the basic motivation of exchanging here is
                          for each other to reason and exlpore to truth by each of our
                          further investigations.<br>
                          <br>
                          To a Buddhist who knows God as the highest? We would still tell
                          them, a right view should be established, Buddha is not God. We
                          would not start compromising and agreeing with them that Buddha is
                          God, this is not even a skillfull mean here. And the Greatest
                          problem here now is "There is only One true God, it appears as
                          Buddha in india, kongzi in china, jesus in ....." Such beleifs are
                          not even right to start with. Do a research on å‡€ç©ºæ€ªè®º on gooogle, you
                          will be able to read many other people's comments both positive and
                          negative and its up to you to make your own decision, but let me
                          remind you, our moderator Eternalnow had said clearly that a
                          "Almighty creator God" is considered as a false view and not
                          allowed in this forums, are you trying to saying EternalNow is
                          being intolerant or embracing the basic tenets of Buddhism?<br>
                          <br>
                          Also Buddha nature and God is not parallel, the Buddha did not
                          teach this either. Infact, Buddha nature (Ven Jing Kong touched on
                          Dharma nature not Buddha nature) it again is his own assumption tha
                          "Buddha nature" is God.<br>
                          <br>
                          Further, you claim that I take being Buddhist for granted which is
                          not true because as a Buddhist, I seek refuge and rely only on the
                          Buddha and his teachings and not other teachings. On the same time
                          as a serious purelanders, i would only rely in Amituofo but not
                          Bible and Quranic teachings to gain rebirth in Pureland. Can You
                          please tell me, which Pureland Teaching or Pureland Master told us
                          that we can rely on bible and quran to gain rebirth in
                          Amituofo??<br>
                          <br>
                          Again, if you find nothing wrong with Ven Jing Kong teachngs, Can
                          you please explicty tell me what's wrong with YI Guan Tao???? There
                          teachings is almost totally same as Ven Jing Kong now.<br>
                          <br>
                          Recommending other people's scripture? This is not the problem now,
                          Buddhists are very open minded people, if their teachings are not
                          aganist morality, Buddhism have no reason to be aganist them and
                          their scriptures but this is not equalvalient to mixing them into
                          Buddhist practises, in the case of relying on bible and quran for
                          rebirth in Pureland.<br>
                          <br>
                          Again, i ask .. is there anything wrong for a Buddhist to solely
                          seek refuge and practise only the Buddha and his teachings?<br>
                          <br>
                          Lastly, you accuse me of hearsay and wanted "evidence" I gave you
                          evidence and you know find new excuse, this is perfect example of
                          peole who cannot analyse. But luckily people like "realization" can
                          speak from a neutral point of view corresonponding to Buddhist
                          teachings and also "dawnlight" who held up his/her promise to
                          "shutup" on Mck issue but he/she also went further by clarifying
                          what's wrong with Ven Jingkong after watching the video. This is
                          what I call, investigation and not blind belief.<br>
                          <br>
                          In Buddhism, investigation is always encouraged. It is easy to
                          correspond anything to your own mind but hard to reconcile with
                          Buddhism. I suggest you go back to the basic tenets of the Buddhist
                          Faith.<br>
                          <br>

                  One of first of being tolerant is means having peace of their doctrines of other  faith, and understand the universality of certain values, there will alway be some variances of expression due to culture.  You can't even accept filial piety as filialt piety in another name or espoused in another religion, acts of kindness of kindness is acts of kindness in any other name.

                  The point is your view is heretical and divisive and I do not wish to see your interpretation of "Buddhism", which exclusive and divisive to be believed as mainstream beliefs. You ego and self view is bigger than Mount Meru. Being "right" at all cost is more important slient contemplation.

                 1st distortion:-
                  Quoting myself:-
                   "To non buddhist who only know God as the Highest principle,the key word being Highest, and not God. As an expression of the ultimate one can reach, is what Jing Kung is relating, Buddha Nature. Yet you feel offended, simply because you believe there is no God. Then how would you like to relate Buddha Nature to non believers and how would you like them to respect Buddha Nature and in doing so, respect your beliefs as a Buddhist?"

                 Your twisting of my words:-
                  "To a Buddhist who knows God as the highest? We would still tell them, a right view should be established, Buddha is not God. We would not start compromising and agreeing with them that Buddha is God, this is not even a skillfull mean here. And the Greatest problem here now is "There is only One true God, it appears as Buddha in india, kongzi in china, jesus in ....." Such beleifs are not even right to start with. Do a research on å‡€ç©ºæ€ªè®º on gooogle, you will be able to read many other people's comments both positive and negative and its up to you to make your own decision, but let me remind you, our moderator Eternalnow had said clearly that a "Almighty creator God" is considered as a false view and not allowed in this forums, are you trying to saying EternalNow is being intolerant or embracing the basic tenets of Buddhism?"

However tolerance does not mean to import other religious teachings into buddhism. <br><br>Buddhism has its own set of teachings and to follow the Buddha's teachings is not an issue of bring exclusive or inclusive. But for Pureland teachings, yes we are quite exclusive that only the recital in Amituofo will gain rebirth in Pureland not by bibical or quranic truths. <br><br>The focus should be on Buddha, Buddhism and Buddhists. what's there to distort to justify my views?? kindly point out.</p></div>
