              Buddha learnt from the Indian philosophy, religion, cosmology, meditation from his contemporary culture of sub continent of India. It is with this knowledge that manage convert his disciples into Buddhism. He is also an excellent debater with a very deep grasp of his opponent philosophy. More importantly, he did not demonize his opponents or their belief.            
                  If Buddha was a prince in ancient China, he will no doubt be well versed in chinese rites customs, confucianistic and other hundred schools of thoughts . Taoist science and philosophy, cosmology before he became enlightened.

              <p>think we wrong MCK, i just found out that the idea of using Daoism book was not from MCK, it was originally from 13th Pureland Patriarch Yin Guang. during then people also don't like it.</p>
              <p>extracted:-</p>
              <p><strong>In the early part of the nineteenth century, Master Yin-Guang dedicated himself to advocating teaching on the Law of Cause and Effect. When Master Yin-Guang was at Pu-tuo Mountain, the citizens of Ding-Hai County invited him to give Dharma talks there. Due to his very heavy native accent, Master Yin-Guang sent another Dharma master in his place to give the lecture. What sutra was lectured on? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Guidance to Hidden Merits of Wen-Chang Di Jun</span>. It is surprising that the material chosen was a Taoist text rather than a Buddhist sutra. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Throughout Master Yin-Guang's life, he especially advocated Liao-Fan's Four Lessons and the Treatise on Response and Retribution</span>. Both during his lifetime and after, he was often criticized for doing so. But these were only viewpoints of ordinary people. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Every word and every passage in the Treatise on Response and Retribution and the Guidance to the Hidden Merits explains the Five Fundamental Precepts and the Ten Good Conducts. The Five Precepts and the Ten Good Conducts are the foundation in Buddhism (and in almost every religion and faith system).</strong> If we do not abide by them, then we are on a deviated path. No matter which method we practice, whether we are a novice, an Arhat or a Bodhisattva, if we do not abide by these, then we are on a deviated path. Then how can this be called Buddhism?</p>
              <p><strong>The Treatise on Response and Retribution and the Guidance to Hidden Merits are good reference materials, which provide a complete and practical explanation of the Five Precepts and the Ten Good Conducts. Master Yin-Guang understood that in our time, this world would face major chaos and disasters. There is only one way for us to avoid these disasters. It is to help every sentient being become awakened, to refrain from wrongdoing and practice good deeds. In this way, even if the disasters cannot be totally eliminated, their frequency and severity can be reduced. This can be done. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Compilation of Response and Retribution, the Complete Book of Mr. Chou and Liao-Fan's Four Lessons. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Master Yin-Guang used these three books to help us make up for our deficiencies in abiding by the precepts.</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.amtb.cn/e-bud/e-bud.htm">http://www.amtb.cn/e-bud/e-bud.htm</a></p>
              <p>so, MCK is good student from Li Bi Nan who's a good student of <strong>Master Yin-Guang.</strong> Li Bi Nan told MCK to follow Master Yin-Guang's foot step when he pass away.</p>
              <p><strong>Master Yin-Guang is </strong>å¤§å‹¢è‡³<strong>Mahasthamaprapta Bodhisattva.</strong></p>

              <p>Here we go again.</p>
              <p>Yin Guang didn't advocate Liao Fan or other non buddhist text, as prerequiste to Buddhism, did he? Thats the difference between Master Yin Guan and MJK.</p>
              <p>Like I said, if people show interest in Buddhism, why recommend them to read Di Zi Gui instead? Why not go straight to Buddhism? Thats the problem with MJK sect.</p>
              <p>Wanna have interfaith knowledge, so as to engage, debate with people from other faith, and convert them? Sure. But doesn't have to go to the extend setting Di Zi Gui and other non Buddhist book as entry and Buddhism to foundation. Di Zi Gui and Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian could be use as supplementary, interfaith reading material at the intermediate level or advance level. After one has a grasp on the foundation of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Today's Sunday Times report on "Tiger Mum". One of the mum said
                  she taught her kids Di Zi Gui. Let's put aside the debate of
                  whether is Di Zi Gui appropriate as the entry to Buddhism. I think
                  if many people can find something in common with Buddhism, isn't
                  more people will get interested in Buddhism and slowly they will
                  get to know the real essence of Buddhism. That is not bad afterall,

              <p>There might be something common between Di Zi Gui and Buddhism. But I find some Di Zi Gui value got some problem in it. For example. One of the first few lines in Di Zi Gui, had said that one should obey one's parents order. I dun think thats right advice. Parents do made mistake. And if parents made wrong decision, why follow? The safest way, to happiness in life, is to follow the ä¸‰å®�. Use Buddha teaching as guidance. Anything else is not reliable.</p>
              <p>So why recommend Di Zi Gui which its values got some problem in it??</p>

              <p>I had my conclusion for now. I dun find MJK teaching reliable after reading those criticisms on his teachings from some websites.</p>
              <p>As for study Daoism and Confucianism as entry and foundation to Buddhism, I dun think thats the right way to go. Should just study Buddhism right away. Buddhism teaches one how to be a upright person and more. No need to first go study Daoism Confucianism in order to learn how to be a good person, upright person, good human being.</p>

              <p>consider this</p>
              <p>human life is deem to be ideal for practice because the 3 poisons as well as all 6 realms can be experienced in this human form.</p>
              <p>then every individual has different conditions surrounding this life which may or may not be conducive for practice.</p>
              <p>the question then is this:</p>
              <p>are adversities more conducive for practice? or a smooth sailing life with a silver spoon? </p>
              <p>such events in life stem from karma and are needed to be present so that they can be worked with, so in a way can we also regard such conditions as necessary for our practice?</p>

              <p>true, i think it's the problem of moral degeneration and modernisation and western/æ°‘ä¸» thinking..... last time, no, as moral level very high, now yes.  parents themselves are not taught well by their parent, so are the parents' parent for sometime already.</p>
              <p>for this rule, i think now we can discern for ourselves when we are mature enough. yea, it also depend on one's maturity. for teenage and below, their power of discernment i think are also still not ready yet. like the recent gang fighting/killing case. so we have both side of the story. best is up the moral level of society altogether.</p>

                  gambling house, make sure parents gamble until damn shiok then drive parents back home?</p>
              <p>Di Zi Gui should add something like that, if parents order is not right, then one shouldn't obey it. Else, this one liner 'Parents order, must execute it asap' is problematic already.</p>

              The text are different, but the teachings are similiar, it is about basic conduct.
              It is very easy to get critical with those close to you. If it were others, you won't bother too much about them. There is right and there are wrong conduct and also way of doing things, people are the way they are because of ignorance, especially if they have an addiction.
                   That parents gave birth to us gives us ground to be grateful, that they fed and clothe you and raise up give you reason to be grateful. Despite their ignorance and their limitations, they have imparted enough that you are now you. Do not take them for granted.
                  So now that you are grown up and able to discern,  knowing that you are right and they are wrong, for they are old and you are young. They are set in old habits and hard to change, they being themselves for so long.  Have we become so straight and upright, that we've forgotten about loving kindness and compassion. Why is it said that all beings are your parents in your previous lives, that is because of the love and kindness your present parents have shown despite their ignorance.
                   Parents are testing sometimes because they are being who they are. They are an excellent means to allow us to development our loving kindness, compassion and skillful means.  Is it that we have grown too busy that we have find them a bore and liabilty, that we have better or more important things to do? 
                  So is'nt it time, we slow down ourselves and take stock of things, because if we are fortunate, we get to send off our parents peacefully. We have always know our parents but they, like all phenomena, are not permanent.

              think wiser meant on regard to filial piety is even if our parent are bad, we should still forgive.  not that they bad we can abandon them to die on their own. best to help them turn over a new leaf. actually, my divorce parent also not taught well, father also like to eat, drink play, gamble. last time a boss, later money all used up due to bad habit. now become poor at old age. we children suffer. mother last time bad temper. now better. growing up was not that smooth. it's hard to forgive for ordinary people. but when we learn buddhism, we was more able to forgive. 
              like the ancient story of a king(?) forgot his name. his parent also treated him badly, but his devoted filial piety for his parent soon spread around the country, and later was appointed king/high rank officer for his devotion of filial piety. so filial piety do have it's merit and virtue.

              <p><br>I agree with what you said to a certain extent but I always wonder if no one point out their faults, how are they going to correct and will they make things or Buddhism worse by continuing with their wrongful act ? Of course, I'm nobody to point out their faults, I mean those who are qualified, can't they point out <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">ä¼—ç”Ÿè¿‡and åƒ§è¿‡?</span></p>
