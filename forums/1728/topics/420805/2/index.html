              Hi Zenist69, 
                                  You views and accusation against a certain teacher is not a mild one. Hopefully you can see everything is relative, perhaps, if you can put down your prejudice against anybody, then perhaps you can also see wisdom arising  that person or religion.
                  Now, a good measure of a teacher is his students. Is there really any heresy, infamy or disharmony coming from the students. Or that the students have come out worst after being influenced negatively by this particular teacher. If you really think that this teacher is really heretic, then investigate the result of his heresies. This teacher has been around not just  one or two years,so, if indeed that he have lead people astray, it should'nt be hard to find. I feel you are being radicalised, thus will partly contribute to disharmony.

              <p>erm, i'm sure, he didn't insist forcefully. i know he didn't as i listen to him more than any of u-all here, i can say. he read more than i eat salt. those (older) who can wholeheartedly recite Amituofo in a quite place can also concentrate on doing so. <br>think the issue now is u insist he insist? but i see the same thing as Yin Guang telling people to go study a good book, seeing in that time the buddhist sutra are not so helpful to teach people cause and effect anymore, hence he printed Liao Fan massively. as we know buddhist sutra, who want to read at that time. not many people. but Liao Fan is different. it's more common and less dogma. this is entry to me. similarly MCK is seeing in this time of age, the morality of people is degenerating to the bottom core and also people no longer believe in cause and effect, hence he's encouraging like Yin Guang to study Standard of being a good student/child plus 190++ stories of cause and effect (without the label). even if he say it's an "entry", i can understand clearly his reason. u ask non buddhist people to read buddhist sutra, people will think, wah, buddhist sutra big shot ah, per se. he want to make buddhism less dogma, lively æ´»æ³¼ and like many ancient masters make dharma(not buddhism as a religion) more blending with daily life. it's the true essence of Dharma.</p>
              <p>however entry is entry, exit samsara is another issue altogether.</p>
              <p>i'm more happy to drop the issue.</p>

              <p>I don't know whether MJK's students, whether they go astray or not. But MJK is not right to insist people to enter Buddhism via Di Zi Gui and Tai Shang Gan Yin Pian. If MJK is outside of Buddhism, a religion which is not Buddhism, well, I wish him and his students all the best. If he and his students consider themselves Buddhist, then they should stop insisting Di Zi Gui as an entry to Buddhism. Am I being radical? No. The one radicalized is MJK and his students.</p>

              <p>erm, i'm sure, he didn't insist forcefully. i know he didn't as
                      i listen to him more than any of u-all here, i can say. he read
                      more than i eat salt. those (older) who can wholeheartedly recite
                      Amituofo in a quite place can also concentrate on doing so.<br> think the issue now is u insist he insist? but i see the same
                      thing as Yin Guang telling people to go study a good book,
                      seeing in that time the buddhist sutra are not
                      so helpful to teach people cause and effect anymore, hence he
                      printed Liao Fan massively. as we know buddhist sutra, who want to
                      read at that time. not many people. but Liao Fan is different. it's
                      more common and less dogma. this is entry to me. similarly MCK is
                      seeing in this time of age, the morality of people is degenerating
                      to the bottom core and also people no longer believe in cause
                      and effect, hence he's encouraging like Yin Guang to study Standard
                      of being a good student/child plus 190++ stories of cause and
                      effect (without the label). even if he say it's an "entry", i can
                      understand clearly his reason. u ask non buddhist people to read
                      buddhist sutra, people will think, wah, buddhist sutra big shot ah,
                      per se. he want to make buddhism less dogma, lively æ´»æ³¼ and
                      like many ancient masters make dharma(not buddhism as a
                      religion) more blending with daily life. it's the true essence
                      of Dharma.</p>
              <p>however entry is entry, exit samsara is another issue
                      altogether.</p>
              <p>i'm more happy to drop the issue.</p>

              <p>Make Buddhism less dogma and lively? Reading sutra consider big shot? How about reading confucius book, thats humble?? Those comments from u, thats uncalled for. Do u consider yourself as Buddhist or not? How can u say those hing if u consider yourself as Buddhist? Buddhism dun need to resort to Confucianism to make it lively and less dogma thank you very much. And reading sutra is not consider big shot. With MJK and his supporters as 'friends' of Buddhism, who needs enemy??</p>
              <p>Entry is entry. So there are all kind of ways to Buddhism. No need to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INSIST</strong></span></span> people to go read Di Zi Gui. MJK is wrong in that particular view and action. If he's a non Buddhist, sure, I respect all religions. But if he's a Buddhist, then please act like a Buddhist, a Dharma Master as he should be.</p>

And u guys just got taken up by all that and forgot to look carefully into what he had spoken.  And also Spore nowadays rarely have people with those calibre combine. So he stept in here, viola, lots of local supporters.</p>
              <p>To have knowledge in other religions and teachings, in order to debate and convince people from other faith, thats good idea. But not to the extend of reading other religion, other teachings as entry and foundation to Buddhism.</p>

              <p>That part of his teaching, I have no problem with that. But to place emphasis on Di Zi Gui, i think its a kind of betrayal towards Buddhism, dun you think? Its not only about being good and upright and all that. Its about principle. Yes, Di Zi Gui is a good book, å–„ä¹¦. But as a Buddha disciple ä½›å¼Ÿå­�, in principle, he shouldn't be pushing Di Zi Gui as entry and foundation to Buddhism. Its a kind of betrayal to his religion his faith, if Buddhism is indeed his faith.</p>
              <p>If MJK didn't consider himself a Buddhist, thats altogether another matter. If he's under a new age religion, I have no qualm with him pushing for Di Zi Gui as entry and foundation to his new age religion. But if he and his students keep pushing Di Zi Gui as entry and foundation to Buddhism, then thats just against principle, against Buddhism. 'cause Di Zi Gui is not Buddhism.</p>
              <p>I am not here to argue whether the studnet and MJK is upright or not. But in the matter of pushing Di Zi Gui, a non Buddhist book as entry and foundation to Buddhism, thats just wrong from Buddhism point of view.</p>

              I learnt pythagora's theorem in maths. But where does pythagora's theorem belong really?
              
              Does it belong to mathematics? But science uses it too. So does architecture. So does other subjects. Where does it belong? What is pythagora's theorem? Why is it called pythagora's theorem?
              
              Nowhere does it belong. Neither does it have a name. The name was given after pythagoras discovered it.
              
              Pythagora's theorem is just pythagora's theorem. Even if no one discovered it, it's still found in nature. It's just the way it is.
              
              Let it go and let nature be the way it is.

              <p>Sorry, off topic a bit as I could not find the post which I asked you about absolute right and wrong. Let me asked again, will the person who found his Buddha nature  differentiate right and wrong in real life but will not èµ·æ— æ˜Ž. Or the person who is enlightened will not care who is right or wrong in real life and just stay out of right and wrong even though there is right and wrong.</p>

              <p>I learnt pythagora’s theorem in maths. But where does

              <p>Does it belong to mathematics? But science uses it too. So does
                  architecture. So does other subjects. Where does it belong? What is
                  pythagora’s theorem? Why is it called pythagora’s theorem?</p>
              <p>Nowhere does it belong. Neither does it have a name. The name
                  was given after pythagoras discovered it.</p>
              <p>Pythagora’s theorem is just pythagora’s theorem. Even if no one
                  discovered it, it’s still found in nature. It’s just the way it
                  is.</p>
              <p>Let it go and let nature be the way it is.</p>

              <p>i think MCK is a good Buddhist. he's helping to promote peace in
                  the world. say if u go and promote Buddhist sutra in the school, or
                  educational system, or ask a freethinker to study, they will think
                  u are asking for convert.</p>

              <p>U are not being straight, wenyi. Those twisting and turning, finding excuses for MJK. Is that the MJK sect code of conduct? Nice demeanour but not able to talk straight?</p>
              <p>MJK could advocate to the schools, and educational system to teach Di Zi Gui. For civic moral 
                  education. Thats a wonderful idea. Its a great and good book Di Zi Gui. But he shouldn't be preaching to all people that Di Zi Gui as entry and foundation to Buddhism. Because he is a Buddhist and a Dharma Master representing Buddhism.</p>

              <p>This is actual practice. Its Mahayana Buddhism. If many people are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mislead</span> by some all charming person, shouldn't one voice out the concern, warning people about it? Its not a rumor. Di Zi Gui is not a Buddhist book.</p>

              <p>Zenist69  can you post the article that MJK said that Di zi Gui is the entry and foundation of Buddhism?  Have you mis-interpreted what he meant to convey?</p>
              <p>Secondly, what do you think then should be the entry and foundation of Buddhism?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, as a buddhist, what else do you study/chant/read beside Amituofo  ?  Don't tell me that is all you know and then you conclude that you are a Buddhist.</p>
