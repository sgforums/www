              <p>After reading the book Di Zi Gui pass to them newbie by those so call purelanders, some of them newbie might be disappointed in Buddhism and pureland sect. 'cause Di Zi Gui didn't help them at all. Talking about brushing teeth, washing hands after using toilet, paying respect to elderly, its too elementary to them, they find it a joke to them. And thus put off by the so call Buddhist, purelanders act of passing them di zi gui and thus shun away from Buddhism forever.</p>
              <p>Di Zi Gui give them newbie wrong impression on buddhism, they might find di zi gui boring and uninspiring and thus turn to other beliefs to look for meaning.</p>

              <p>What MCK was saying in the video is that çœŸç¥ž = æ³•æ€§ manifested as various leaders of religions to æ•™å¯¼äººç±» (teach mankind).  </p>
              <p>He
               mentions that all these various leaders of religions "take turns" to be
               leaders.  He used the term è½®æµ�æ€§...<span style="color: #0000ff;"> but then as we know, each religious leader has come up with a different 
              view of the 
              cosmos... if they are "colleagues", should they not be spreading the 
              same message?  So does Truth change according to time period?</span></p>
              <p>He then says:  In the past when there was poor communication 
              among communities, each religion came about as a manifestation of çœŸç¥ž, 
              but with adaptation to local culture and local needs.  <span style="color: #0000ff;">If so, then the 
              implication is that all are relative truths and even Buddhism itself 
              presents only a portion of the Truth.  </span></p>
              <p>And indeed, he does exhort us to
               study all religions now that information technology is thriving, in order to get the
               full picture about how çœŸç¥ž taught living beings on this planet.<span style="color: #0000ff;">  The <strong>serious implication</strong> in this is 
              that before globalization, we had been compromised in our 
              learning of the Truth because we didn't have the Whole Truth.  What 
              then are we to think of various Buddhist patriarchs of bygone days who 
              managed to 
              achieve Enlightenment even without being privy to the tenets of other 
              religions?  Or is he implying that there is an even higher Truth than what Shakyamuni Buddha taught? </span></p>
              <p>When asked about how to reconcile a disbelief in the supernatural with 
              the belief that there is 
              çœŸç¥ž, he replied that when one understands deeply enough, "existence" and 
              "non-existence" do not matter because opposite concepts do not exist 
              within Ultimate Truth (çœŸç�† as he says).  Yet, he claims to be "absolutely convinced"
               that in our cosmos, there is a çœŸç¥ž that may also be termed æ³•æ€§ in 
              Buddhist terms.... <span style="color: #0000ff;">so does his absolute conviction then signify a deep 
              understanding or poor understanding?</span><br> <br> Am I plain confounded by my poor roots, or is he on to an even higher truth that none of us has grasped?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: "hinayana" and mahayana. note the "...".</span></p>
              <p><br>May i know your "form" of Buddhism is based on which Buddha's teaching? Finger and Moon ? I thought he is from our Pureland lineage? Remember carefully, a <strong>Koan</strong> and a <strong>Dharma Talk</strong> is 2 different thing. Don't you know that?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">sw: don't understand. it's ur words against my words. <br><br></span><br>Its quite obvious, you are now relying in the person and not the dharma.</p>

How can you accuse me of not using Buddhist glossary ???  This is not a issue of half full or half empty, you don't even know what you are talking now.<br><br>The finger and moon analogy is a zen koan å…¬æ¡ˆ which main purpose is used to<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>å�‚</strong></span>. got it? Ven Jingkong was doing a talk not a zen koan session. got it? So yr excuse of using finger ponint moon analogy cannot work to cover up for him saying "God" is not god and but a name og God. You say God is not God, you say not God is God, Buddha is God but God is not Buddha and God and Buddha is actually inherent and empty and emtpy is actually not empty by just name as empty and there is not real name of empty, its nature and but when u say nature and its actually not nature but only a phonoenma ..and so on .... this is the kind of argument you are giving now while we are all discussining on the very basic tenets of the Buddha's teaching. <br><br>and also, you said i only got the analogy not the real meaning... may I know what is the real meaning ? How did you manage to know the real meaning? Did Ven Jingkong tell you personally his underlying meaning? or you assumed yourself and also why did the Buddha not teach this kind of "underlying" message to us?<br><br>How come a Dharma talk become a Zen Koan session?</p></div>
