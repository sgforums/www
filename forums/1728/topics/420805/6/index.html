              <p>Pushing for Di Zi Gui to people who show interest in Buddhism,
              thats not right. 'cause Di Zi Gui is not Buddhism. Shouldn't pass
              Di Zi Gui off pretending it to be Buddhism text. Its almost like
              deception. I speak out on this issue here in this forum. So why
              does that make me fixated, dun noe about moderation and middle
              path?</p>
              <p>MJK sect should heed this middle path advise. Stop pushing for
              Di Zi Gui. Maybe some people really not into Buddhism, boh bian,
              then we resort to other skillful means, such as sharing Di Zi Gui.
              But to push Di Zi Gui to all newbies, thats obsess with Di Zi Gui,
              attachment to wai dao books.</p>

              <p>Exactly. Thats how i feel about it. Unless really for some special reason, then, no choice introduce some other good book such as di zi gui or even bible. But for those already show interest in Buddhism, what did the MJK sect advocate? They go push Di Zi Gui to them. Thats why I am here voicing out my concern.</p>
              <p>84000 dharma path, so many path, and yet, MJK sect wanna push Di Zi Gui as the basic text and foundation to Buddhism? Thats ridiculous.</p>

              <p>When I first got in contact with MCK teachings, I found them a tad too pious and smacking somewhat of Chinese chauvinism. I knew I wasn't totally comfortable with such a stance, but I still did come away learning an important attitude towards spiritual cultivation; which is to be single-minded and to persevere in practice. </p>
              <p>Like what another forummer said at the beginning of one such related thread, I choose to take what's useful for me and leave what I'm not totally comfortable with.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I now realise that what I'm probably most uncomfortable with about MCK's teachings is not so much what standards he uses to judge morality, but his views on sickness and seeking medical help.  I have personally gone and read some of his talks where he mentions his views with regards to contracting diseases, and his attitude towards consulting doctors and taking medicine.  His implication that staunch Buddhists who are practising well will not get sick and if sick, can get well simply by faith, is a form magical thinking.  I found it irresponsible and reckless. </p>
              <p>Sorry.  I know adherents of MCK's teachings will be upset, but I realise I must speak up because this question mark has been on my mind. </p>
              <p>While I do wish Zenist were less militant and adamant in his arguments and will stop going on and on, I really do feel like he was also pushed into a corner right from the start.  This made him need to defend more and more. </p>

              <p>regarding the health part from MCK, he recently also think that his past view is too fixated. last time he seldom eat heaty food, like ginseng which people give, he throw/give away, and only eat vegetables/colder fruit, but after his doctor said that his body is too cold, and he's weaker and less energy, he change his own view and start eating food that are heatier, like ginseng, ginger and nuts.</p>

              <p>regarding the health part from MCK, he recently also think that
                  his past view is too fixated. last time he seldom eat heaty food,
                  like ginseng which people give, he throw/give away, and only eat
                  vegetables/colder fruit, but after his doctor said that his body is
                  too cold, and he's weaker and less energy, he change his own view
                  and start eating food that are heatier, like ginseng, ginger and
                  nuts.</p>

              <p>So is the MJK sect willing to let go of the habit of handing out di zi gui to newbie, people who show interest in Buddhism? Do they realize they are being too fixated in pushing Di Zi Gui, tai shang gan yin pian, etc to the newbies?</p>

              <p>for me personally, it's not so much the actual deed of introducing Di Zi Gui that is the issue here.</p>
              <p>it's the cognitive dissonance arising from views that is worth exploring. </p>
              <p>from this, perhaps we can look carefully on how dualistic views are binding in nature.</p>

              <p>I post the torrent link to di zi gui speech by dr chua, 'cause I am ignorant. I trusted the MJK sect. But when I go think deeper, I just find its not right to push di zi gui to newbie. And I didn't push di zi gui to newbie, as ENTRY AND FOUNDATION TO BUDDHISM. U could go dig out that thread. I never say DI ZI GUI IS ENTRY AND FOUNDATION TO BUDDHISM.</p>
              <p>So MJK doesn't push for di zi gui thoroughly?? But I know of at least two seperate occassion, MJK supporters push di zi gui to newbie. Are u saying those are unusual, just some kind of fluke, 'cause MJK supporters dun usually do that??</p>
              <p>Why u keep telling me di zi gui is a good book? I dun deny di zi gui is a good book! I had said it so many times already. But the problem is not with di zi gui, but MJK supporters pushing di zi gui to newbies!</p>
              <p>If u dun go thru it thorougly, shows u are really not into that book, so why keep on defending the MJK supporters act of pushing di zi gui to newbies? Serve wat purpose? just a blind sense of loyalty to defend MJK camp regardless?</p>

              <p>To Zenist:</p>
              <p>You know, MCK is not the only Buddhist teacher who sees non-Buddhist texts as exemplary and worthy of learning.  Master Hsing Yun to my memory ever mentioned one of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's treatises in his Dharma talks and said that adhering to this particular treatise will help bring about good governance (at political/country level). </p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure that there are Buddhist texts which also teach good governance, but Master Hsing Yun still chose to give mention to Sun Yat-sen's text. Can we then come to the conclusion that Hsing Yun is not a good teacher because of this?  I'm sure that as my learning increases (albeit at snail's pace) I will find out that there are other Dharma teachers who also use non-Buddhist examples to teach. </p>
              <p>Actually, after such a protracted discussion (started since Dec/Jan if I'm not wrong), we all already know and understand what you think.  You have been heard.  <strong>You cannot ask others to come round to your point of view, just as you won't concede with theirs.</strong>  To each his own.  What's important is that we ultimately arrive at the same destination. </p>
              <p>Even if as you so believe, that some people have to take a more ç»• ï¼ˆround-about) way to get there if they were to follow MCK's teachings, you have to let "nature" or should I say karma take its course.  You want to warn others of possible pitfalls, but each one has their own path to take.  We can understand your concerns and your è‹¦å�£å©†å¿ƒ.</p>
