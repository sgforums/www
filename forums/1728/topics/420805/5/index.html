              <p>I am not against filal piety. What I am against is putting too much weight, emphasis on it. Buddhism one word take care of filial piety liao: Compassion.</p>

              <p>Its a path to where? People might not get into Buddhism after reading Di Zi Gui. But if we go straight and introduce newbie buddhism books, at least they get a chance to decide whether thats for them or not. To pass Di Zi Gui to newbie, people who curious about buddhism, thats MISLEADING. Passing off Di Zi Gui as Buddhism text, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>thats just not right.</strong></span></p>

              <p>erm honestly i only seen a few of Master Jing Kong's teachings only, so cannot classify as supporter. </p>
              <p>i think Sinweiy has already explained my posts. </p>
              <p>The whole spectrum of Buddha's teachings cover everything that is required for us to be liberated. Yet only when the conditions are right then one will get in touch with them. </p>
              <p>for e.g. im the only person at home to study the teachings. with all the books in my cupboard, even my parents do not touch them. but if i wanna share something with them, i will use a lingo and scenario familiar to them to bring the teachings across.</p>
              <p>life's conditions will always be the door to the Dharma. i started exploring meditation on my own without a teacher for a long time, reading Tao Te Ching, and also this forum ( i read the forum anonymously for more than 1 year). most people will regard this path as taking one big circle and redundant. however, this big circle is not only not redundant, but it's necessary and essential as conditions for further practice.</p>
              <p>if someone i meet is open to it, i will introduce Buddhist books. If one is not open to it, be it Di Zi Gui or the Bible, it's fine. These will guide them in the basic teachings of life first, and slowly bring them towards the Dharma in future</p>
              <p>a friend shared with me the analogy of the wet matchstick which i have posted on my <a href="http://livingunconditionally.blogspot.com/search/label/Wet%20Matchstick">blog</a>.</p>

              <div class="MsoNormal"><em>It is said that everyone’s receptivity to the Dharma is like a wet matchstick.

              <p>erm honestly i only seen a few of Master Jing Kong's teachings
              only, so cannot classify as supporter. </p>
              <p>i think Sinweiy has already explained my posts. </p>
              <p>The whole spectrum of Buddha's teachings cover everything that
              is required for us to be liberated. Yet only when the conditions
              are right then one will get in touch with them. </p>
              <p>for e.g. im the only person at home to study the teachings. with
              all the books in my cupboard, even my parents do not touch them.
              but if i wanna share something with them, i will use a lingo and
              scenario familiar to them to bring the teachings across.</p>
              <p>life's conditions will always be the door to the Dharma. i
              started exploring meditation on my own without a teacher for a long
              time, reading Tao Te Ching, and also this forum ( i read the forum
              anonymously for more than 1 year). most people will regard this
              path as taking one big circle and redundant. however, this big
              circle is not only not redundant, but it's necessary and essential
              as conditions for further practice.</p>
              <p>if someone i meet is open to it, i will introduce Buddhist
              books. If one is not open to it, be it Di Zi Gui or the Bible, it's
              fine. These will guide them in the basic teachings of life first,
              and slowly bring them towards the Dharma in future</p>
              <p>a friend shared with me the analogy of the wet matchstick which
              i have posted on my <a rel="nofollow" href="http://livingunconditionally.blogspot.com/search/label/Wet%20Matchstick">blog</a>.</p>
              <div><em>Philip once told me this story about the wet
              matchstick, which was told to him by a Guru in the past.</em></div>
              <p> </p>
              <div><em><br></em></div>
              <div><em>It is said that everyone’s receptivity to the
              Dharma is like a wet matchstick. For some, the matchstick is very
              wet, no matter how hard we try to strike the match it will never
              catch fire. In other words, the conditions are not suitable for one
              to engage in learning and practicing the Dharma.</em></div>
              <div><em><br></em></div>
              <div><em>For some, the matchstick is half wet. Some parts
              of the head are wet, while there may be a small bit that is dry. If
              we can strike the match at that small bit, the matchstick will
              light up. So the person who encounters the right conditions will be
              sparked to learn and practice the Dharma.</em></div>
              <div><em><br></em></div>
              <div><em>And for some, the matchstick is dry. Naturally
              the matchstick can be lighted. So the person is very predisposed to
              learning and practicing the Dharma.</em></div>
              <div><em><br></em></div>
              <div><em>This analogy is very simple and
              straightforward.</em></div>

              <p>So dun keep pushing for Di Zi Gui. Once a newbie said he's interested and curious about Buddhism, just pass some basic Buddhism books to them. Simple as that.</p>

              <p>Pushing for Di Zi Gui to people who show interest in Buddhism, thats not right. 'cause Di Zi Gui is not Buddhism. Shouldn't pass Di Zi Gui off pretending it to be Buddhism text. Its almost like deception. I speak out on this issue here in this forum. So why does that make me fixated, dun noe about moderation and middle path?</p>
              <p>MJK sect should heed this middle path advise. Stop pushing for Di Zi Gui. Maybe some people really not into Buddhism, boh bian, then we resort to other skillful means, such as sharing Di Zi Gui. But to push Di Zi Gui to all newbies, thats obsess with Di Zi Gui, attachment to wai dao books.</p>

              <p>This is of course.</p>
              <p>Well, the impression i get from your posts is you will give/ recommend/ push Buddhist books no matter what conditions. </p>
              <p>the key word here is discernment. we need to discern the present conditions.</p>
              <p>like i already mentioned. if Di Zi Gui reaches out to someone more, i will use that. if the Bible reaches out to someone more, i will use that too.</p>
