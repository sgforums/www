              <p>What MCK was saying in the video is that çœŸç¥ž = æ³•æ€§ manifested as
              various leaders of religions to æ•™å¯¼äººç±» (teach
              mankind).  </p>
              <p>He mentions that all these various leaders of religions "take
              turns" to be leaders.  He used the term è½®æµ�æ€§... <span style="color: #0000ff;">but then as we know, each religious leader has
              come up with a different view of the cosmos... if they are
              "colleagues", should they not be spreading the same message? 
              So does Truth change according to time period?</span></p>
              <p>He then says:  In the past when there was poor
              communication among communities, each religion came about as a
              manifestation of çœŸç¥ž, but with adaptation to local culture and local
              needs.  <span style="color: #0000ff;">If so, then the
              implication is that all are relative truths and even Buddhism
              itself presents only a portion of the Truth.  </span></p>
              <p>And indeed, he does exhort us to study all religions now that
              information technology is thriving, in order to get the full
              picture about how çœŸç¥ž taught living beings on this
              planet.<span style="color: #0000ff;">  The <strong>serious
              implication</strong> in this is that before globalization, we had
              been compromised in our learning of the Truth because we didn't
              have the Whole Truth.  What then are we to think of various
              Buddhist patriarchs of bygone days who managed to achieve
              Enlightenment even without being privy to the tenets of other
              religions?  Or is he implying that there is an even higher
              Truth than what Shakyamuni Buddha taught? </span></p>
              <p>When asked about how to reconcile a disbelief in the
              supernatural with the belief that there is çœŸç¥ž, he replied that when
              one understands deeply enough, "existence" and "non-existence" do
              not matter because opposite concepts do not exist within Ultimate
              Truth (çœŸç�† as he says).  Yet, he claims to be "absolutely
              convinced" that in our cosmos, there is a çœŸç¥ž that may also be
              termed æ³•æ€§ in Buddhist terms.... <span style="color: #0000ff;">so
              does his absolute conviction then signify a deep understanding or
              poor understanding?</span><br>
              <br>
              Am I plain confounded by my poor roots, or is he on to an even
              higher truth that none of us has grasped?</p>

              Avalokeshvara, Hearer of the Cries of the World among other
               Mahabodhisattvas have taken great vows, where there is 
              suffering, there are Bodhisattvas to alleviate suffering.
              There is even a Mahabodhisattva in the Hells,Ksitigarbha'
              Bodhisattva are still here because of there compassion, act 
              of selflessness 
              
              
              There will be places where Dharma seed will not ripen.
              The next Buddha will be Maitreya, it is going to be a long,
               long wait. But still compassion arises, as everybody 
               has Buddha nature, that is potential to become Buddhas.
              
              Religions dictates moral conducts and goodness, it is out 
              of compassion that gives rise religion, cultivating good karma,
              by doing good. 
              Only Buddhas can fully ripened others' 
              potential, hence alot of enlightened beings in the 
              Era of Shakyamuni Buddha. 
               
              
              We are dealing predominant and deeply entrenched cultures, 
              Indian culture and belief exists before Buddhism, therefore
              the Buddha using Hindu comoslogy and logic,
              
               
              Past Buddhist masters did the same, that why the Chinese
              Mahayana is how it is, is explained in in chinese context of 
              Taoism and Confucianism, that why countries with cultures
              similiar with China, like Korea, Japan and Vietnam has more 
              similiarity    
              
              If you see Bhutan, Sikkim , Tibet, Mustang, there emergence
              of Varjayana. Owing to assimilation of cultures.
              
              Then you have the Theravadan Buddhism, where Bodhisattva 
              Path is not present, You will see elements of Theravadan, 
              Brahmanic and folk elements.
              
              Non of these form will exactly like how Buddha preached, as
              that context no longer exist. One follows the handful of leaves,
              the others with an aspiration to save all sentients beings.
              
              Both are true but yet different, we can learn from all or we can 
              learn from just one.  Simple analogy, with children, we teach
               what they can understand and no more, same with teenagers,
              and adults, they can be the same person at different age, but
               you teach them differently .
              
              If you are a local born Singaporean, I can speak Singlish, 
              it may be broken english, but we can converse and get the
              message across. If I were to be a habitual Singlish speaker, 
              then I will have learn proper English to get by. But is there a
              standard English even?

              <p>I've known about Pu Men Pin and Avalokitesvara's vows.  He will come as various emanations in order to rescue sentient beings. </p>
              <p>However, it still stands that MCK said,<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">çœŸç¥žå�ªæœ‰ä¸€å€‹ï¼Œåœ¨ä½›æ•™è®Šæˆ�ä½›é™€ï¼›åœ¨åŸºç�£æ•™è®Šæˆ�è€¶ç©Œï¼›åœ¨ä¼Šæ–¯è˜­æ•™è®ŠçœŸä¸»ï¼�</span>æˆ‘ç¡®ç¡®å®žå®žè‚¯å®šå®‡å®™ä¹‹é—´å�ªæœ‰ä¸€å€‹çœŸç¥žã€‚æ‰€æœ‰å®—æ•™çš„ç¥žåœ£éƒ½æ˜¯è¿™ä¸ªçœŸç¥žçš„åŒ–èº«ã€‚æ‰€ä»¥è€¶ç¨£æ˜¯é‡Šè¿¦ç‰Ÿå°¼çš„åŒ–èº«ï¼Œé‡Šè¿¦ç‰Ÿå°¼ä¹Ÿæ˜¯ã€Œè€¶ç¨£çš„åŒ–èº«ï¼Œä¸Šå¸�çš„ä½¿è€…ã€‚</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Translation of what MCK said:</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">There is only one True God.  In Buddhism, it manifests as Shakyamuni; in Christianity it manifests as Jesus; in Islam as Allah.</span>  I'm absolutely convinced that in our cosmos, there is a True God.  The saints/leaders of all religions are a manifestation of this True God.  Therefore, Jesus is a manifestation of Shakyamuni, and Shakyamuni is a manifestation of Jesus and also a messenger of God.</p>
              <p>Despite the Buddha refuting the notion of a Supreme God or prime mover, MCK is now saying that he is absolutely certain that a True God exists in our cosmos.  And this True God manifests as Buddha, Jesus, Allah etc. in order to teach mankind and other sentient beings.</p>
              <p>You mentioned that the historical Buddha used Hindu
                                          comoslogy and logic during his time.  However, to my knowledge the existing religion of the time did not exclude the concept of gods.  So, had the Lord Shakyamuni taught that a True/Supreme God existed, it would not have been off the mark at all.  So, why did he still reject the notion of a Supreme God?</p>
              <p><strong>To say that Buddhism, as taught by the historical Buddha, sprang forth as an adaptation to local culture/needs is also implying that Buddhism offers only a portion of the Truth with regards to the Nature of Reality.  </strong></p>
              <p>What does this then mean for us?  The Buddha is actually Jesus' and Allah's contemporary.  Despite Jesus teaching that God is an almighty creator, Buddha rejects the notion of a creator even though he is in fact the manifestation of the True God.  Yikes, something just occurred to me... Buddha is guilty of being unfilial because he doesn't even acknowledge whom/what he emanates from.  At least Jesus totally embraced his Father in Heaven.</p>
              <p><em>Please, please</em> don't read the above paragraph and think that I'm purposely being sarkie or using word play.  It's not my intention.  But in fact, it's MCK's treatise on this matter that's seriously garbling everything up. </p>
              <p>I quote excerpts from Buddhanet's "A Basic Buddhism Guide":<br><br><em>- Dharma (the teachings in Buddhism) exists regardless whether there is a Buddha. Sakyamuni Buddha (as the historical Buddha) discovered and shared the teachings/ universal truths with all sentient beings. He is neither the creator of such teachings <strong>nor the prophet of an almighty God to transmit such teachings to others</strong>.<br></em><br><em>- Buddhism has been described as a very pragmatic religion. It does not indulge in metaphysical speculation about first causes; there is no theology, no worship of a deity or deification of the Buddha. Buddhism takes a very straightforward look at our human condition; nothing is based on wishful thinking, at all. <strong>Everything that the Buddha taught was based on his own observation of the way things are.</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So, did the historical Buddha only have a partial handle on the Truth, or did he not?</span></p>

              <p><strong>Weychin said</strong> “Recommending the scriptures of others’ religions does’nt mean embracing other faiths, neither does it mean you stop reading Buddhist scriptures or abandoning your Buddhist practices. Or abandoning our refuges or or vows? Would you? I won’t.<br><br><br><strong>My reply:<br></strong>I have no problems with respecting or even giving recongition to other religious teaching. Also i state clearly, the Buddha did not forbid us to read non buddhist scriptures, infact the Buddha had allowed 3/4 of our time on the Dharma and 1/4 on non-buddhist teaching. That was the Buddha's openess to non-buddhist teachings, however this is not equalivant to importing non-buddhist beliefs and mixing up with Buddhism and in the case of Ven Jingkong, he not only imported an Almightt God into Buddhism, he imported judgement day and also reliance on Bibile and Quran to gain rebirth to Pureland. <br><br>By doing such things, we not only spoil our own Buddhist teachings but also disrespect to the religion. Look at the comments from youtube url which I gave, those comments from Christians who feel that their religion have been misrepresented by Ven JingKong's assumption that Jesus is Buddha and Buddha is Jesus so and so on. This clearly show that to respect another religion is to accept their belief as it is and not by crowning them as Buddhas and Bodhisattvas which in turn brings disrespect to both the original bibical and buddhist teachings. <br><br>Also such an action automaticallys leads one to lose the body of the threefold precepts as stated in the Uppasika Vinaya Sutra <span style="color: #000080; font-family: å®‹ä½“;">ä¼˜å©†å¡žæˆ’ç»�</span></p>

              <p><strong>Weichin said:</strong> My accusations stands, as I see through with eyes of compassion, and able to see the context of his conduct, while you see with eyes of self righteousness. The Bodhisattva Path aims to save all sentients being until samsara is empty. Jing Kung teaches his followers to show patience and compassion to non believers, to understand them by acknowledging them, not creating divisive lines through religion.<br><br>My reply: <br>I have to acknowledge that your compassion stems but compassion without wisdom of the Buddha brings no effect. Buddhism is a religion of wisdom and compassion. Even though all religion preaches a common idea of Loving Compassion, this does not equates to "There is only one God, in india become Buddha, in China become kongzi and so on" this is where everything goes wrong. <br><br>The Bodhisattva Path aims to liberate all sentient beings by the Dharma not by non-buddhist teachings. <br><br>I have no problem with Ven Jingkong teaching us to show patience, respect and compassion to non believers but one may have to understand standing for what the Buddha taught is not creating divise lines. It is just a truth the Buddha taught.  The Buddha drew the so called "divisive lines" from the Brahmins, from the six non buddhist teachers, from the 95 kinds of wrong views. But the Buddha had also extorted his followers to continue to respect them. <br><br>Can you call the Buddha intolerant? The Buddha gave recongition and respect to non buddhist teachers and beliefs without compromising what he stand for. This is when the divisive lines when drawn and yet not offensive. <br></p>

Also I would love Buddhists to contribute to world peace and harmony but not they way that Ven Jingkong is doing harm to our own buddhist and spefically pureland teachings. I have always welcomed proper buddhist discussion with proper Buddhist references instead of "personal assumption". <br><br>Through the video, he spoke for himself, I cannot distort words and if I did, please point out, I would be glad to offer my apologies. I also ask people not to only believe in what I said one-sided, they should be able to investigate, compare, reason and see if such teachings can reconcile with the Buddha's teachings. No way that I can control anyone, everyone is a free man to think, the wise ones will start doubting keeping the Kalama spirit up.</p>

              <p><br><br><strong>My reply</strong>: As a Buddhist, we shouldn't even say others are wrong or false. Our responsibility is to bring the Dharma to them telling them the goodness of the dharma. Also, by respecting and accepting what the other party believes in and not mixing up with yr so and so God is the manifestation of my Buddha, by doing so, we bring discredit both to buddhism and the other party. We respect Jesus as him being jesus not as Guan Yin. <br><br>Buddhists should also not be hypocrites but saying something good on the surface and closing doors saying others is wrong and false. We only need to share with them the Buddha's teaching not to judge them. <br><br>I have no idea if Christianity is a false religion or not but as a Buddhist, I am very sure that Buddhism is defintely the right and best choice. <br><br>Sinweiy, you should try not to be judgemental towards another religion as being false or wrong.</p>

              said:</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">There is only one True
              God.  In Buddhism, it manifests as Shakyamuni; in Christianity
              it manifests as Jesus; in Islam as Allah.</span>  I'm
              absolutely convinced that in our cosmos, there is a True God. 
              The saints/leaders of all religions are a manifestation of this
              True God.  Therefore, Jesus is a manifestation of Shakyamuni,
              and Shakyamuni is a manifestation of Jesus and also a messenger of
              God.</p>
              <p>Despite the Buddha refuting the notion of a Supreme God or prime
              mover, MCK is now saying that he is absolutely certain that a True
              God exists in our cosmos.  And this True God manifests as
              Buddha, Jesus, Allah etc. in order to teach mankind and other
              sentient beings.</p>
              <p>You mentioned that the historical Buddha used Hindu comoslogy
              and logic during his time.  However, to my knowledge the
              existing religion of the time did not exclude the concept of
              gods.  So, had the Lord Shakyamuni taught that a True/Supreme
              God existed, it would not have been off the mark at all.  So,
              why did he still reject the notion of a Supreme God?</p>
              <p><strong>To say that Buddhism, as taught by the historical
              Buddha, sprang forth as an adaptation to local culture/needs is
              also implying that Buddhism offers only a portion of the Truth with
              regards to the Nature of Reality. </strong></p>
              <p>What does this then mean for us?  The Buddha is actually
              Jesus' and Allah's contemporary.  Despite Jesus teaching that
              God is an almighty creator, Buddha rejects the notion of a creator
              even though he is in fact the manifestation of the True God. 
              Yikes, something just occurred to me... Buddha is guilty of being
              unfilial because he doesn't even acknowledge whom/what he emanates
              from.  At least Jesus totally embraced his Father in
              Heaven.</p>
              <p><em>Please, please</em> don't read the above paragraph and think
              that I'm purposely being sarkie or using word play.  It's not
              my intention.  But in fact, it's MCK's treatise on this matter
              that's seriously garbling everything up. </p>
              <p>I quote excerpts from Buddhanet's "A Basic Buddhism
              Guide":<br>
              <br>
              <em>- Dharma (the teachings in Buddhism) exists regardless whether
              there is a Buddha. Sakyamuni Buddha (as the historical Buddha)
              discovered and shared the teachings/ universal truths with all
              sentient beings. He is neither the creator of such teachings
              <strong>nor the prophet of an almighty God to transmit such
              teachings to others</strong>.<br></em><br>
              <em>- Buddhism has been described as a very pragmatic religion. It
              does not indulge in metaphysical speculation about first causes;
              there is no theology, no worship of a deity or deification of the
              Buddha. Buddhism takes a very straightforward look at our human
              condition; nothing is based on wishful thinking, at all.
              <strong>Everything that the Buddha taught was based on his own
              observation of the way things are.</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So, did the historical Buddha only
              have a partial handle on the Truth, or did he not?</span></p>
                            </div>

              What does it mean by "çœŸç¥ž" " ?  To me a Buddhist, towards non Buddhist  it means using a word with the highest of respect to convey Buddha Nature, the word used is "çœŸç¥ž" "  , not shang ti, not creator , literary translated to "true spirit"
              
              That the Buddha in his compassion, as a Bodhisattva to save sentient beings.  The Buddha is the Buddha, God is God, Allah is Allah, what is common thread is the true spirit of compassion. Without compassion,
              the Buddha would not have turned the wheel of Dharma.

              carry an agenda against Jing Kung and his movement of Peace and
              Harmony, thatâ€™s why you distort words in their original context to
              pursue you goal.<br>
              <br>
              There are already some proselytizer already doing this, they did it
              thinking it is for the greater good. They are just being
              ingnorant.<br>

              <strong>My reply:</strong> I am not interested in politics, I have
              also no agenda aganist Venerable Jing Kong, up till now I still
              respect and call him <strong>Venerable</strong> Jing Kong. Also I
              would love Buddhists to contribute to world peace and harmony but
              not they way that Ven Jingkong is doing harm to our own buddhist
              and spefically pureland teachings. I have always welcomed proper
              buddhist discussion with proper Buddhist references instead of
              "personal assumption".<br>
              <br>
              Through the video, he spoke for himself, I cannot distort words and
              if I did, please point out, I would be glad to offer my apologies.
              I also ask people not to only believe in what I said one-sided,
              they should be able to investigate, compare, reason and see if such
              teachings can reconcile with the Buddha's teachings. No way that I
              can control anyone, everyone is a free man to think, the wise ones
              will start doubting keeping the Kalama spirit up.</p>

If my agenda was to discredit venerable jing kong, I think i would not even credit him for his right and good dharma teachings. <br><br>And being a pureland Buddhist myself, I am especially concerned to Pureland Buddhist teachings being corrupted. Also if my agenda was to discredit Ven Jing Kong, I would not haven even started my first post here in distributing free buddhist sutras for worldwide, i should have printed books discrediting Ven jing Kong. Look at my first thread and ask those people whom had requested the sutra from me and have they recieved it? <br><br>As a Pureland Buddhist, I distribute free not only Pureland Sutras but all Buddhist sutras as long it is taught by the Buddha. This is my only agenda, to uphold and spread ONLY Buddha's teachings. <br><br>I have no problem bowing before all the good deeds and right teachings of Venerable Jing Kong but when he teaches unbuddhistic stuffs, it should also be up for scritinity. <br></p></div>
