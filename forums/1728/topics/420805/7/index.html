              <p>I post the torrent link to di zi gui speech by dr chua, 'cause I am ignorant. I trusted the MJK sect. But when I go think deeper, I just find its not right to push di zi gui to newbie. And I didn't push di zi gui to newbie, as ENTRY AND FOUNDATION TO BUDDHISM. U could go dig out that thread. I never say DI ZI GUI IS ENTRY AND FOUNDATION TO BUDDHISM.</p>
              <p>So MJK doesn't push for di zi gui thoroughly?? But I know of at least two seperate occassion, MJK supporters push di zi gui to newbie. Are u saying those are unusual, just some kind of fluke, 'cause MJK supporters dun usually do that??</p>
              <p>Why u keep telling me di zi gui is a good book? I dun deny di zi gui is a good book! I had said it so many times already. But the problem is not with di zi gui, but MJK supporters pushing di zi gui to newbies!</p>

              <p>okay i accepted u that it's not the problem of di zi gui. non did MJK supporters pushing di zi gui to newbies. what we push is the idea of <strong>morality</strong>, if u read back.</p>

              <p>To Zenist:</p>
              <p>You know, MCK is not the only Buddhist teacher who sees
                      non-Buddhist texts as exemplary and worthy of learning. 
                      Master Hsing Yun to my memory ever mentioned one of Dr. Sun
                      Yat-sen's treatises in his Dharma talks and said that adhering to
                      this particular treatise will help bring about good governance (at
                      political/country level). </p>
              <p>I'm pretty sure that there are Buddhist texts which also teach
                      good governance, but Master Hsing Yun still chose to give mention
                      to Sun Yat-sen's text. Can we then come to the conclusion that
                      Hsing Yun is not a good teacher because of this?  I'm sure
                      that as my learning increases (albeit at snail's pace) I will find
                      out that there are other Dharma teachers who also use non-Buddhist
                      examples to teach. </p>
              <p>Actually, after such a protracted discussion (started since
                      Dec/Jan if I'm not wrong), we all already know and understand what
                      you think.  You have been heard.  <strong>You cannot ask
                      others to come round to your point of view, just as you won't
                      concede with theirs.</strong>  To each his own.  What's
                      important is that we ultimately arrive at the same
                      destination. </p>
              <p>Even if as you so believe, that some people have to take a more
                      ç»• ï¼ˆround-about) way to get there if they were to follow MCK's
                      teachings, you have to let "nature" or should I say karma take its
                      course.  You want to warn others of possible pitfalls, but
                      each one has their own path to take.  We can understand your
                      concerns and your è‹¦å�£å©†å¿ƒ.</p>

              <p>There's a difference. I am sure Hsin Yun never ever push di zi gui to newbie. A buddhist or dharma master could say, hey, xyz daoist book, abc confucist book, xyz chinese leader book, etc, is really a good book. I have no issue with that. But the isssue i have with MJK sect, is they push di zi gui to people who first show some interest in Buddhism. Thats just plain misleading,  'cause di zi gui is not buddhist book. There's an element of deception in the act.</p>
              <p>I could accept the fact, many local Buddhists insist in handing out di zi gui to people who first show some interest in Buddhism. But the problem i have is people dun talk straight here in this forum. I bring up this issue, and all kind of excuses excuses excuses people here in this forum come spewing here. Come up with all kind of twist and turn, even lock up thread to prevent further debate on the issue. I mean, lets talk sense. Buddhist precept talk about right speech. Not deceptive speech. Thats why I keep on talking about it trying to debunk those people false speech on this issue. Thats why this issue until now still haven't settle. Just look at sinweiy reply and others. They are not backing down. Only until just now, there's a glimpse of light breaking out, sinweiy admit that MJK do make mistakes in his view. But if he/ she dun be so stubborn and play it straight from start, this issue would end within a few days after I brought it up.</p>
              <p>Hope u understand....</p>

              <p>Okay, I am sorry that I posted threads and messages from other sites criticizing mjk. The reason I did that, is to show that MJK has got some credibility issue. But since those messages are enormous, and need more time to verify, so, its pretty reckless to posted them here. I am not an academic, and I dun have time to verify and sift thru all those criticisms from other site on MJK.  For that I sincerely apologize for my reckless behavior.</p>
              <p>That said, I dun think my criticism on MJK on this di zi gui issue is wrong. And I dun think its  creating bad karma for me. In fact, i think i did right to bring out this particular issue of MJK, this di zi gui issue.</p>
              <p>My take is pretty straightforward. To newbie who show interest in Buddhism, lets just dun waste time, introduce them buddhism books right away. To introduce newbie di zi gui, thats misleading. Its telling them di zi gui is buddhism book. But it is not.</p>

              <p>There's a difference. I am sure Hsin Yun never ever push di zi gui to newbie. One could say, hey, xyz daoist book, abc confucist book, xyz chinese leader book, etc, is really a good book. I have no issue with that. But the isssue i have with MJK sect, is they push di zi gui to people who first show some interest in Buddhism. Thats just plain misleading,  'cause di zi gui is not buddhist books. There's an element of deception in the act.</p>
              <p>I could accept the fact, many local Buddhists insist in handing out di zi gui to people who first show some interest in Buddhism. But the problem i have is people dun talk straight here in this forum. I bring up this issue, and all kind of excuses excuses excuses people here in this forum come spewing here. Come up with all kind of twist and turn, even lock up thread to prevent further debate on the issue. I mean, lets talk sense. Buddhist precept talk about right speech. Not deceptive speech. Thats why I keep on talking about it trying to debunk those people false speech on this issue. Thats why this issue until now still haven't settle. Just look at sinweiy reply and others. They are not backing down. Only until just now, there's a glimpse of light breaking out, sinweiy admit that MJK do make mistakes in his view. But if he/ she dun be so stubborn and play it straight, this issue would end within a few days after I brought it up.</p>

              Di zi gui is a good classic, despite it is not a Buddhist scripture contains conduct and morality which is compatible with Buddhists learning.  Good conduct is universally good conduct. 
                  I do not believe any of the Ven. Jing Kung students are under any illusion the  Di zi gui is a Buddhist classic.  
                  To begin to be good Buddhist, one can start with being a good person, it is just one of the skilful methods, if it is not suitable for you, move on !!! 
                  You are still clinging too much! 
                  Choose a method of cultivation that suit you most, and allow others practise what suit them more !

              <p>Di zi gui is a good classic, despite it is not a Buddhist
                  scripture contains conduct and morality which is compatible with
                  Buddhists learning. Good conduct is universally good conduct. I do
                  not believe any of the Ven. Jing Kung students are under any
                  illusion the Di zi gui is a Buddhist classic. To begin to be good
                  Buddhist, one can start with being a good person, it is just one of
                  the skilful methods, if it is not suitable for you, move on !!! You
                  are still clinging too much! Choose a method of cultivation that
                  suit you most, and allow others practise what suit them more !</p>

              <p>No, u people from MJK camp should stop the nonsense of pushing di zi gui to newbies. Di Zi Gui is not buddhism book. Stop the nonsense of pushing a wai dao books to newbies. U wanna talk about skillful means? Then look at the person whether he/ she into buddhism or not. If they are interested, procceed to recommend buddhism books to them. NOT pushing for di zi gui to newbies regardless! THATS NOT SKILLFUL MEANS!</p>
