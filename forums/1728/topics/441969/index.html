              <div class="thread">nowadays the trend is to invest in a cemetary urn place in those modern urn 
              building.<br>Taiwan has people who buy and sell the urn place for a quick profit 
              and one urn's place is being "fried" until very high .  The Taiwan mafia has a 
              hand in it.  They are now going into the dead people's business that can also 
              bring them lotsa of money.<br>In Singapore, the Nirvana Memorium already have 
              some people doing this type of trade ( like stock market), they buy a row of 
              urn's place at the original price and then sell them high for a profit.  The guy 
              that was shown on TV doing that is the drum player of True Buddha School. He is 
              a malaysian and he is starting this type of "dead people" business in 
              Singapore.  Making use of the dead.  He is a malaysian so he doesn't feel guilty 
              of using the dead in Singapore to make his first pot of gold.<br> <br>This guy 
              only studied till High School in Malaysia and only working as a technician in 
              Singapore. Where did he get the sum of money to invest in a row of urns? He is 
              only 31, does he need a row of urns? He only buy for investment and i am not 
              surprised if he has a mountain behind him who gives him the money to fry the 
              value of the urns place high.  This True buddha School disciple name is Lam Yew 
              Sin, his brother Lam Yew Kin is a staff of Nirvana Memorium.  With his brother 
              working inside, Lam Yew Sin can get the best row of urns at the cheapest price, 
              then he sold them off at a very high price. We Singaporeans become 
              *****ers.<br>The Nirvana Memorium is actually owned by Taiwanese and i am not 
              surprised if the Taiwan mafia has a hand in it.<br>They are coming to Singapore 
              to spoil the market of Singaporeans " resting place for the death "and earning 
              high Singapore money, laughing all the way to the bank.<br>They know Singapore 
              is short of land and sooner or later, we all need a urn's place, so the 
              Taiwanese and the Malaysians start first in our country. Fried the urn's place 
              value high and it won't drop in the future.<br>We are being made use of by these 
              people from other countries.<br></div>

              <div class="commentText">there are many buddhist temples in Singapore providing these services at a 
              reasonable price. What Nirvana Memorium did is to fry up the price of a urn 
              place. Why do we need Foreigners come to Singapore to squeeze our hard earn 
              money from us ?  The foreigners will not want to be buried in Singapore, only 
              Singaporeans will.<br><br>So why do we need these type of " commerical and 
              profit oriented" services from foreigners ? So that these malaysians and 
              taiwanese can become rich in their country ? That Malaysian Lam Yew Sin already 
              buy a honda car with the profit he earns from selling a row of urn's place. By 
              what means? by trading dead people's urn.<br><br>You think lam yew sin will want 
              to be buried in Singapore or not ?</div>
