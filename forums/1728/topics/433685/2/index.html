Coming onto a Buddhist forum site and getting ridicule for his Christian views I believe, is not much fun that is, unless he is such a committed Christian, that to convert the unbelievers to his faith is his final and only objective. Hopefully he is just trying to seek affirmation that the Christian teaching and thoughts are true and is acceptable by other faith as well, and that there is no other motives behind his coming on this site with his views.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If you start reading Buddhist teachings in a haphazard way, it can be confusing as the Buddhist doctrinal ideas goes all the way from Realism, Idealism to Absolutism. It caters to all types of people with different disposition. If you want to understand Buddhism itself, it would be best that you start out reading the history and development of the religion and then going into the very basic of the Buddhist tenets which is the teaching of the historical Buddha of the Theravada tradition. You will then have the foundation to go on to the teaching of other Buddhist school of thoughts without confusing yourself. You can then do a comparison of the Buddhist thoughts with the Christian teachings. This should help you to make a better informed decision as to which religion suit you best - and then sticking to it. </span></p>

              <p>you need to learn to relax your mind. dont think about quotes. dont think what is right what is wrong. you cannot understand truth this way it only confuse you. dont think about anything. breathe in and out, calm down. clear your mind. enjoy life. when see bubble, just enjoy seeing bubble. dont think about it. when see flowers dropping, just enjoy seeing that.</p>
              <p>remember last time you see a tree and your sense of self dissolve. but dont think about it - just enjoy everything like you enjoyed the tree without a self. just the tree - crystal clear and alive. all troubles come when you forget to enjoy life.</p>

              <p>When karma catch up with them, they don't understand why or what they have done wrong. Instead they blame their god.  </p>
              <p>There was a lady who blamed god for the sudden death of her son, she pulled out the cross on her door and smashed it to the floor upon knowing the death of her son. Sometimes I think god is pitiful because many have mistaken him. It is never his will to let anyone die young.</p>
              <p>People need to understand karma inorder to better comprehend things that happen to them.</p>

              <p>If only you have affinity and faith with Amitabha, then singlemindedly chant and recite chants and verses associated with Amitabha!</p>
              <p>If you want to be grounded in knowledge, just focus on one religion, either Buddhist or Christian. For Christians, it is relatively easy, there is only one holy book!</p>
              <p>If you want to either a good Buddhist or Christian and knowledgeable about it, then you must wholeheartly read the Bible, whichever, version you have. As you read, question of what is good and what is bad, what is right or what is wrong. What does your core values tells you ! Read the ins and outs the Bible, would you, or should, do this, or if you are God, why must, could, should you do this.</p>
              <p>Later, when have felt you gotten the jist of your studied religion.you must realise what your core values are, and if the religion corresponds and strikes a chord with you .   </p>
