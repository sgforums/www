              time, even more than an arhat of 500 past lifes and know what
              he/she will happen in the future. like how He <em>predicted</em> <strong><em>eventually</em></strong> in the future, the Buddha name
              of the arahats in Lotus sutra. or the coming of the next Buddha or
              the ending of earth, <strong><em>generally</em></strong>. there's
              also a story that during a alm round, Buddha only ask one of his
              disciple to enter a house. as the owner only have affinity with his

              <p><span>The point I am trying to make is that river is simply the  aggregate of all the different factors happening concurrently and in series. The main component is water, w</span>ithout water there can be no rivers! Fresh water lakes drains to the sea and is therefore moving and yet we call them lakes. Most lakes are long as compared to wide seen from above! <span>We are obsessed with appearance of things, aren't we, heh!heh! What if I take that bowl of water taken from the river and call it river water,heh! heh!  Heat transfer is achieved by (forced) convection and conduction. Forced convection is the brushing of individual water molecules against our skin that we lose heat. Same appearance, different water! Am I wrong if I called the phenomena of a river a process? What is sustaining it is a cycle which also a process , but the river is still only a process.</span></p>

              <p>I must have missed that in our correspondence, I read your stance, but forgive me,I do not understand your implication., therefore have not made any  assumptions to that regard! Please elaborate. Especially your "me" part, what is "me"?</p>

              <p>Decomposition is a process, which is  only part of a cycle, conditions permitting. If I isolate it from other conditions forming a cycle, it remains just a process.</p>
              <p>The point I am trying to make is introduction of new factors into the equilibrium, constituting a breach. </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px; color: #333333;">Depends if the spanner breach the limits of equilibrum, if it does another cycle starts. Perhaps I should replace "reversible" as "reverse engineered" to be more clear....</span></p>
              <p>Reverse engineer a cycle is possible, but what about reverse engineering an organic decomposition cycle?</p>

The concept of karma in Buddhism is different from the notion of karma in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the idea of karma is much less deterministic. The Buddhist notion of karma is primarily focused on the cause and effect of moral actions in this life, while in Hinduism the concept of karma is more often connected with determining one's <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #0645ad; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" title="Destiny" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny">destiny</a> in future lives.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">In Buddhism it is taught that the idea of absolute freedom of choice (i.e. that any human being could be completely free to make any choice) is foolish, because it denies the reality of one's physical needs and circumstances. Equally incorrect is the idea that we have no choice in life or that our lives are pre-determined. To deny freedom would be to deny the efforts of Buddhists to make moral progress (through our capacity to freely choose compassionate action). <em>Pubbekatahetuvada</em>, the belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous actions, is considered a wrong view according to Buddhist doctrines. Because Buddhists also reject <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #0645ad; background-image: none; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: initial; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;" title="Agency (philosophy)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(philosophy)">agenthood</a>, the traditional compatibilist strategies are closed to them as well. Instead, the Buddhist philosophical strategy is to examine the metaphysics of causality.
