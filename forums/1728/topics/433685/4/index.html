              Shanfan I asked u if muslim ask u which gospel is true.
              
              How u tell him?
              
              A true christian must tell him their INJIL is false and our gospel is the right one.
              
              Evangelism surely is linked to attacking other faith. 
              
              I seen how evangelism works in my church.

              <p> The key would is higher consciousness and predictability of factors or given set of conditions. For instance, you could fairly accurately determine an animal's actions guided solely by instinct, as it is more obvious. A predator could sufficiently predict it's prey behavior most of the time, otherwise it would end up very hungry and dead. A prey animal, well, eaten and dead. In nature the scales are not overly tipped, otherwise the will be an imbalance, for the most part. There dynamics to consider, lots more wriggle room,living to a ripe old age, although possible, but not likely . Domestic livestock will almost always certainly end up in someone's table, but not absolute.</p>
              <p> Ever heard the childhood rhyme about for the loss of a horseshoe, a kingdom was lost? It explains to children the chain of events in a simplistic way.Or Humpty Dumpty.</p>
              <p>But to predict on it's variabilty of  it's behavior also derives studied behaviour from patterns emerging to it's primary and secondary response behavior. The prediction becomes more consistent as the evaluation more refined. The higher our consciousness are.  the better we are at predicting.</p>

              <p>It depends on whether you are "predicting" on an outcome before or after it has happened. When we hypothesized on outcomes we often blurr this line. We must ask ourselves, are we" determining" the past(which has already happened) or the yet undetermined future?</p>

              <p>When events happened they way it did(or appeared to us), we use logic to reconstruct occurrence as to how it occurred, factors coming into play. The reconstruct may or may not be faithful to the chain of events, just appeared so to us. Although things and events are interdependent., how relevant your logic is, reliability of prediction,depends on your level of awareness. </p>
              <p>Things shows(to the observer anyway) how things happened they way it did, the more things you factored the probability of predicting according what you envisaged. Timeline is linear, but factors and synergy of events are variable to the components at play.</p>
              <p>Take  a bus to school or work, or  go taking for examinations example,  I can say with more reliability on whether I'll going to school tomorrow than what my actual exam results will be. The first due to constancy of factors in play and no inclusion of other intervening factors.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hello everyone! Stumbled onto this forum a while ago, but since I had nothing of worth to contribute I was just happy to lurk and read what gems everyone had to offer.</p>
              <p>I have been getting myself accquaintant with buddhism for a while, and sometimes there are certain topics that I just miss or haven't come across a proper explanation yet, and this happens to be one of them.</p>
              <p>I understand and believe that the world doesn't work like proponents of determinism would describe, i.e. everything's already predetermined and there's nothing we can do to change them since it's all set in stone, fated if you will. But at the same time, I believe buddhism (as well as many other people actually) states that we don't actually have true free will as there's no "one" around doing the willing thanks to dependent origination and non-self.</p>
              <p>So, my question is: When I decide to do something, for example, walk to the MRT station instead of running, what's happening here? There's no one to exert the will to "want to walk", so I'm guessing conditions ripen that "the mind decides and walking happens", but I wonder if this actually means it's a predetermined event, but is it?</p>
              <p>Eagerly awaiting your replies. Please no not hesitate to correct my assumptions as well :) .</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is correct to say that Buddhism doesn't states that we have complete free will, as generally understood by most people as the ‘ability to choose freely’ without any influence.  The idea of free will is usually contrasted with determinism, hence your question.  Buddhism also does not teach that our lives or everything we do are determined but that our will is conditioned or limited to a greater or lesser extent.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Isn’t obvious that our ability to choose and act is under the influence of our desires and limited by skill, power, strength, wealth, health and many other circumstances and factors?<span>  </span>Also, our ability to choose is also conditioned by our past learning and experience.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When you chose to walk and not run to the MRT station, it is conditioned by many factors – others are walking, you are in no hurry, the station is crowded, it is silly to run, you are injured, etc.<span>  </span>However, is your choice predetermined? <span> </span>If so, either you had planned consciously to walk or any of the aforementioned 'determined' that you walk instead of run, or other factors such as carrying a child.  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span style="color: black; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: #333333; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The bottomline is: there is no complete free will and no absolute determinism.  Thus your statement "understand and believe that the world doesn't work like proponents of determinism would describe, i.e. everything's already predetermined and there's nothing we can do to change them since it's all set in stone, fated if you will. But at the same time, I believe buddhism (as well as many other people actually) states that we don't actually have true free will" is correct.</span></span></p>

              <p>Your predictions belies the need for everthing being a constant,everything contained within, but the universe as a whole is infinite, and is not contained within, except as concept taken as one whole. What you have manage to grasp and envisaged it to be and then some more,and then some more...</p>
              <p>Even as we has the ability to discover a particle smaller than the previous one, you will also correspondingly find a bigger universe when technology allows.</p>
              <p>It is possible that everything comes into a cycle in due course, but on what time scale?The Sun, seen in context with the human lifespan or even the human race's lifespan will seem infinite, but not so, it too eventuallly will go extinct. As the did the dinosaurs, extinct. And that they grew so big due to one huge land mass that they grew to massive proportions. Will they ever come back, or be they huge as they were before? Not likely. Conditions not there.</p>
              <p>When we talk of things of being the same,though they are just  similar in certain aspects in which we relate. We conveniently over looked the difference.Similiar but not identical, never will be. Even if we who have cloned ourselves, are we then. the same person, life/mind experience or situations.</p>
              <p>I am not even the same person I was. Part of me used to be the chicken I ate yesterday, part of me is going to be the shit I excrete. I just believe that I am the same person. And I am going to be old and feeble a decade later, maybe not, not if I die before that or I change a better lifestyle.  Yes. death is a certainty, but when? Also a mundane event taking place at different time or location, it is really the same thing. That I eating rice today and tomorrow, is it the same? Or similar actions?</p>
              <p>I put my hand in a moving stream,the constant sensation of coldness reaches my hand, but why is it cold? It appears to be same the river, but is it the same water (molecules) brushing pass my hands? So now, is it the same river?</p>
              <p>If I dug some soil from a mountain, is it still the same mountain? Why is my bucket of soil not mountain? Or the firewood, is'nt a tree. Forests are being cut down or burnt , new trees grow but are they same, identical as the previous forest?</p>
              <p>We believe them to be same even though they are not, but the only constant is the process, conditions in place. So our perception is actually flawed. The so called cycle is the process.</p>

              <p>i do wonder that only Buddha is all knowing. that by seeing a person He can see his/her past karma/affinities for countless life time, even more than an arhat of 500 past lifes and know what he/she will happen in the future. like how He <em>predicted</em> <strong><em>eventually</em></strong> in the future, the Buddha name of the arahats in Lotus sutra. or the coming of the next Buddha or the ending of earth, <strong><em>generally</em></strong>. there's also a story that during a alm round, Buddha only ask one of his disciple to enter a house. as the owner only have affinity with his disciple. etc.</p>
