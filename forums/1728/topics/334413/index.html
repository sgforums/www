              <p>There was a thread that Thusness asked me to post a few years ago, and the name of the thread was called <span class="forum"> </span> <span class="topic"> <a href="/forums/1728/topics/161161">How did Buddha got lost in Samsara?</a></span></p>
              <p>Thusness asked in that thread, <em>Now, can luminosity arise without conditions? Is there a time where
                                          there is a bright, true, essential, magnificent mind without
                                          conditions?</em></p>
              <p>The problem we (and even those with transcendental experience) continue to be confused over the question of "why original ignorance when buddha-nature is perfect and complete" is that we visualize that buddha-nature is something pure and original from the beginning untainted and untouched by conditions. Then we separate the luminosity with conditions, and we think that conditions are 'impure'. In actuality conditions and luminosity are inseparable.</p>
              <p>If we understand dependent origination then we understand everything, we understand that all things that arise in dependence are empty, and there is no first cause, only dependently originated phenomena. Including ignorance and suffering. When condition is, they manifest, we don't have a permanently pure original state -- because everything is equally empty, everything equally pure, but manifest according to conditions. When we become so caught up and enticed by our luminosity and don't understand its empty nature, that forms a factor/condition for further perpetuation of grasping and samsara. There is no pure vs impure states, that is only for conventional understanding, ultimately all states are empty, none purer than another. We just don't realise that and until we do we continue perpetuating samsara.</p>
              <p>I was just answering this question on E-Sangha a few days ago... my post:<em></em></p>
              <p><br>Answered by Thrangu Rinpoche: <a href="http://www.rinpoche.com/qa.ram">*
                                      If the nature of mind is this all-pervading, brilliant union of
                                      luminosity and emptiness, ungraspable, how is it that it could be
                                      obscured, even for a moment, let alone lifetime after lifetime?</a></p>
              <p>----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>My own replies:</p>
              <p><em>Actually
                                      we don't have an original nature, we have an empty nature, that has no
                                      beginning nor ending. To visualise a purest state from the start is a
                                      dualistic view. Emptiness is not a void, not absence of suffering,
                                      emptiness is the nature of suffering and all phenomena. Getting 'lost'
                                      and becoming dualistic is natural when we develop those conditions that
                                      make us 'lost', for example being attached to our luminosity is one of
                                      the factor. When condition is there, samsara (dualistic vision) simply
                                      manifests...<br><br>The assumption that there is a purest state and we
                                      will not becoming dualistic is itself a dualistic view. There is no
                                      purest state, when condition is there, delusion manifests, every states
                                      are dependently originated and are empty, and being empty all states
                                      are equally pure. Suffering too is empty and pure. Even the state of
                                      delusion is empty and pure but we just don't recognize it due to our
                                      karmic obscurations (or deep conditionings, karmic propensities of
                                      falsely projecting 'self' and 'inherency') that blinds us from seeing. <br><br>And
                                      no, realising the luminosity aspect alone can't lead to liberation. As
                                      I said... other religions talk about that aspect as well and not just
                                      Buddhism, but when its empty nature is not known, it becomes a
                                      metaphysical essence, and all phenomena becomes like dust on the
                                      mirror. And then there is a mirror reflecting external conditions. That
                                      becomes dualistic and 'inherent'. The cause of samsara is still not
                                      uprooted, and one of the fundamental causes as Thrangu Rinpoche stated
                                      is the attachment to luminosity due to not perceiving its empty nature.
                                      If you read my friend's experience you see that there must be further
                                      insights into the anatta and sunyata nature of awareness.<br><br>But
                                      emptiness is also not just empty, so you must realise the union and
                                      inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. Having conviction in our
                                      luminous nature as everpresent, never lost, is important, but having
                                      glimpses of that pure luminosity is just the beginning and we are still
                                      far from perceiving its nature.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>My comments on Thrangu Rinpoche's statement that ignorance comes from 'luminosity being too vivid':</p>
              <p><em><br>The
                                  luminosity is the 'knowingness', the vivid clarity. Our mind have that
                                  quality, all our experiences have that quality -- everything we see,
                                  hear, touch, is a luminous display... but not knowing the empty nature
                                  of that vivid luminosity, we get confused by that luminosity and start
                                  to grasp.<br><br>The 'emptiness' I am speaking about here should not be
                                  misunderstood as formlessness. It should not be misunderstood as a void
                                  background of all phenomena (which is an illusion). Rather Emptiness is
                                  talking about dependent origination, that whatever you are experience
                                  is dependently originated, and being so all consciousness is in fact
                                  empty of inherent/substantial existence. <br><br>The vision of lets
                                  say, a red flower, is a vivid luminous manifestation but quickly
                                  becomes distorted by our deeply rooted delusion into falsely perceiving
                                  a Subject perceiving an external Object. But actually there is no
                                  perceiver, and no flower truly 'out there' being perceived -- there is
                                  only the act of consciousness (e.g. vision, sound, taste, etc) due to
                                  the aggregation of the sense organs and sense objects, so what is
                                  experienced is utterly empty. Consciousness being empty is not a
                                  perceiver 'in here', and there is no red flower as an object 'out
                                  there' -- not every being can perceive redness/colours (e.g. dogs), and
                                  if you can perceive the atomic structures you'll see almost complete
                                  void. So the way we think that there are inherently existing objects
                                  out there with inherently existing characteristics is an illusion. When
                                  understood that consciousness is dependently originated, and hence
                                  empty, it can't even be seen as a mirror reflecting external conditions
                                  -- because the act of consciousness is a manifestation, there is no
                                  subject perceiving object, consciousness is not a mirror reflecting
                                  (though sometimes used as analogy) but is actually manifestation.
                                  Whatever we see/hear, thats empty, an empty-luminous manifesting vision
                                  that is dependently originated. 'Redness' and 'flowerness' is actually
                                  empty, the act of consciousness is merely an aggregation of causes and
                                  conditions, hence empty.<br><br>Awareness is inseparable from
                                  conditions, and hence is empty of anything graspable that stays even a
                                  moment. And that is the nature of pure awareness (empty), and pure
                                  awareness should not be mistaken as a metaphysical essence. It easily
                                  becomes mistaken as the Hindu Brahman.<br><br>Lots of religions have
                                  spoken about the luminous aspect of our nature... not just Buddhism but
                                  in fact all religions, hinduism, the mystical traditions of
                                  christianity, islam, judaism, taoism, etc. etc. <br><br>As my friend
                                  said many years back, "A “True experience” is better than a thousand
                                  words but it is also the very “true experience” of the Brilliance
                                  Bright that has blinded Mystics of all ages. The Brilliance Bright is
                                  more vivid then we can imagine. In All IT is seen and In All IT is
                                  experienced. Being vividly bright it also serves as the “condition”
                                  that obscures its very own Emptiness nature."<br><br>"...of late i have
                                  been seeing songs and poems relating to the luminosity aspect of Pure
                                  Awareness. Uncreated, original, mirror bright, not lost in nirvana and
                                  samsara..etc. What use is there? We have from the very beginning so and
                                  yet lost for countless aeons of lifes. Buddha did not come to tell only
                                  about the luminosity aspect of pure awareness. This has already been
                                  expressed in vedas. But it becomes Self. The ultimate controller. The
                                  deathless. The supreme..etc. This is the problem. This is not the

              <p>Answered by Thrangu Rinpoche: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.rinpoche.com/qa.ram">* If the nature of
                  mind is this all-pervading, brilliant union of luminosity and
                  emptiness, ungraspable, how is it that it could be obscured, even
                  for a moment, let alone lifetime after lifetime?</a></p>
              <p>----------------------------------------</p>
              <p><em>Actually we don't have an original nature, we have an empty
                  nature, that has no beginning nor ending. To visualise a purest
                  state from the start is a dualistic view. Emptiness is not a void,
                  not absence of suffering, emptiness is the nature of suffering and
                  all phenomena. Getting 'lost' and becoming dualistic is natural
                  when we develop those conditions that make us 'lost', for example
                  being attached to our luminosity is one of the factor. When
                  condition is there, samsara (dualistic vision) simply
                  manifests...<br> <br> The assumption that there is a purest state and we will not
                  becoming dualistic is itself a dualistic view. There is no purest
                  state, when condition is there, delusion manifests, every states
                  are dependently originated and are empty, and being empty all
                  states are equally pure. Suffering too is empty and pure. Even the
                  state of delusion is empty and pure but we just don't recognize it
                  due to our karmic obscurations (or deep conditionings, karmic
                  propensities of falsely projecting 'self' and 'inherency') that
                  blinds us from seeing.<br> <br> And no, realising the luminosity aspect alone can't lead to
                  liberation. As I said... other religions talk about that aspect as
                  well and not just Buddhism, but when its empty nature is not known,
                  it becomes a metaphysical essence, and all phenomena becomes like
                  dust on the mirror. And then there is a mirror reflecting external
                  conditions. That becomes dualistic and 'inherent'. The cause of
                  samsara is still not uprooted, and one of the fundamental causes as
                  Thrangu Rinpoche stated is the attachment to luminosity due to not
                  perceiving its empty nature. If you read my friend's experience you
                  see that there must be further insights into the anatta and sunyata
                  nature of awareness.<br> <br> But emptiness is also not just empty, so you must realise the union
                  and inseparability of luminosity and emptiness. Having conviction
                  in our luminous nature as everpresent, never lost, is important,
                  but having glimpses of that pure luminosity is just the beginning
                  and we are still far from perceiving its nature.</em></p>
              <p>----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>My comments on Thrangu Rinpoche's statement that ignorance comes
                  from 'luminosity being too vivid':</p>
              <p><em><br> The luminosity is the 'knowingness', the vivid clarity. Our mind
                  have that quality, all our experiences have that quality --
                  everything we see, hear, touch, is a luminous display... but not
                  knowing the empty nature of that vivid luminosity, we get confused
                  by that luminosity and start to grasp.<br> <br> The 'emptiness' I am speaking about here should not be
                  misunderstood as formlessness. It should not be misunderstood as a
                  void background of all phenomena (which is an illusion). Rather
                  Emptiness is talking about dependent origination, that whatever you
                  are experience is dependently originated, and being so all
                  consciousness is in fact empty of inherent/substantial
                  existence.<br> <br> The vision of lets say, a red flower, is a vivid luminous
                  manifestation but quickly becomes distorted by our deeply rooted
                  delusion into falsely perceiving a Subject perceiving an external
                  Object. But actually there is no perceiver, and no flower truly
                  'out there' being perceived -- there is only the act of
                  consciousness (e.g. vision, sound, taste, etc) due to the
                  aggregation of the sense organs and sense objects, so what is
                  experienced is utterly empty. Consciousness being empty is not a
                  perceiver 'in here', and there is no red flower as an object 'out
                  there' -- not every being can perceive redness/colours (e.g. dogs),
                  and if you can perceive the atomic structures you'll see almost
                  complete void. So the way we think that there are inherently
                  existing objects out there with inherently existing characteristics
                  is an illusion. When understood that consciousness is dependently
                  originated, and hence empty, it can't even be seen as a mirror
                  reflecting external conditions -- because the act of consciousness
                  is a manifestation, there is no subject perceiving object,
                  consciousness is not a mirror reflecting (though sometimes used as
                  analogy) but is actually manifestation. Whatever we see/hear, thats
                  empty, an empty-luminous manifesting vision that is dependently
                  originated. 'Redness' and 'flowerness' is actually empty, the act
                  of consciousness is merely an aggregation of causes and conditions,
                  hence empty.<br> <br> Awareness is inseparable from conditions, and hence is empty of
                  anything graspable that stays even a moment. And that is the nature
                  of pure awareness (empty), and pure awareness should not be
                  mistaken as a metaphysical essence. It easily becomes mistaken as
                  the Hindu Brahman.<br> <br> Lots of religions have spoken about the luminous aspect of our
                  nature... not just Buddhism but in fact all religions, hinduism,
                  the mystical traditions of christianity, islam, judaism, taoism,
                  etc. etc.<br> <br> As my friend said many years back, "A “True experience” is better
                  than a thousand words but it is also the very “true experience” of
                  the Brilliance Bright that has blinded Mystics of all ages. The
                  Brilliance Bright is more vivid then we can imagine. In All IT is
                  seen and In All IT is experienced. Being vividly bright it also
                  serves as the “condition” that obscures its very own Emptiness
                  nature."<br> <br> "...of late i have been seeing songs and poems relating to the
                  luminosity aspect of Pure Awareness. Uncreated, original, mirror
                  bright, not lost in nirvana and samsara..etc. What use is there? We
                  have from the very beginning so and yet lost for countless aeons of
                  lifes. Buddha did not come to tell only about the luminosity aspect
                  of pure awareness. This has already been expressed in vedas. But it
                  becomes Self. The ultimate controller. The deathless. The
                  supreme..etc. This is the problem. This is not the ultimate nature
                  of Pure Awareness. For full enlightenment to take place, experience
                  the clarity and emptiness. That's all."<br> <br> (you can read more on my friend's experience at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/200...experience.html</a> )</em></p>

              <p>No, the luminosity here does not refer to the visual sense of being bright. It's just an analogy. Luminosity is ever-present whether in light or darkness. The mind is 'brightly' aware, alive, it is a knowing presence... and it can never be lost, luminosity never goes out no matter what happens, even while emotions and ignorance appears to obscure it it's still there, like the sun shining through the clouds. We just focus too much on the clouds to notice that all clouds (emotions, phenomena) cannot separate itself from the light source that is animating all of them.</p>
              <p>Mind's brilliance is always here no matter what. Luminosity never 'passes out of existence', does not come and go. And all our experiences are the expressions of pure luminosity.</p>

              <p>note: All these are only describing the luminous aspect of our nature. it is called "ordinary mind", "ordinary awareness" simply because it is present at all moments (actually, at THIS moment which is all there ever IS) regardless of circumstances, it is all too familiar that we have overlooked it. It is what is not lost and not gained in samsara or nirvana. It is the single nature of mind encompassing all of samsara and nirvana. Even the attempt to achieve a state of awareness contains a false assumption that pure awareness is not already our natural state that is right here right now, that which is effortlessly perceiving and cognizing everything all-at-once and not separate from everything. Our natural state is functioning naturally whether or not we notice it. The only problem lies in misidentifications with finite temporary objects (body and mind). Drop and dissolve without a trace like the river enters the shining sea.</p>
              <p>But all these is still not describing about the empty nature of the inseparability with conditions. The pasted quotations also shows a lack of insight into its nature as Anatta (No-Self), and so is mistaken as an unchanging metaphysical essence.
