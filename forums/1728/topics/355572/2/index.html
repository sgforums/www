              <p>You are conscious, and aware, and that awareness can never be lost.</p>
              <p>There is nothing the mind needs to understand, and the mind cannot understand it. The mind only understands concept, and concept is not awareness.</p>
              <p>Awareness is what allows the mind/thoughts to be seen, the words on the screen to be seen, the sound to be heard.</p>

              <p>Words only point, you have to do the looking yourself, and nobody can do it for you. Reading does not help if one doesn't do the investigation himself.</p>

However, even though awareness is formless and space-like and unaffected by the presence and absence of phenomena, it nevertheless reflects (is aware of) the slightest details/forms/sounds/thoughts/etc vividly and effortlessly as itSelf, when they manifest.</p>

              <p><em>In the many recent months we have been discussing various ways and
              approaches to attain or come to an understanding of enlightened
              Awareness, to actually be in that Awareness as that Awareness.  But in
              all these discussions there has been some sense of there being a
              departure point and an arrival point, with the path being the bridge
              between these points.  But in real Ati Yoga of Dzogchen there is no
              notion of there being a starting point and an arrival point with some
              transitional process linking the two points.  Rather the departure
              point is the arrival point in this moment...now, just as we are.<br><br> Let's examine this a bit.  Your actual true nature and beingness is
              pure Awareness in all moments.  It does not require additional efforts
              or understandings to be what it already is.  What is this Awareness? 
              It has no physical characteristics and has no location in space or
              time.  It has no sense of self nor any sense of identity.  There is
              nothing personal about this Awareness such as my Awareness and your
              Awareness.  It is complete voidness or emptiness, yet it is fully
              cognizant.  There is no separation between it and the field of
              perception as they exist as one unity without parts.  In fact you can't
              even call it Awareness, because Awareness implies that there is a
              subject, such as Awareness, and objects such as external and internal
              forms and energies that Awareness is aware of...like a witness.  <br><br> But in fact, our true nature is not even Awareness in that regard, as there is nothing for Awareness to be aware of.  </em> <em>Awareness is the field of experience, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not an observer of it.</span> 
              You may ask what Awareness looks like... whatever you see, feel, think,
              imagine, hear, taste, smell are all the manifestations or appearances
              of Awareness and are therefore perfect just as they are.  There is no
              need to change your feelings, your thoughts, sensations, emotions or
              perceptions in any way.  What ever you are experiencing in each moment
              is Awareness appearing as that moment.  Even having the sense of being
              a limited and defined ego-self is also this Awareness appearing as that.<br><br> The most essential nature of Awareness is a totally empty Presence that
              just is.  That Presence is our own immediate awareness in the midst of
              whatever experience is arising.  That which hears a sound is this
              non-personal Presence as Awareness.  This is the same for sensory
              experiences and internal mental events as well.  So when we hear a
              sound, the awareness that is hearing the sound is inseparable from the
              sound.  Try it, close your eyes and just listen.  Notice how you cannot
              find a dividing line between the sound and your perceiving awareness. 
              Actually you will discover that there is no separation at all, just
              like waves being inseparable from the water.  This happens to be true
              for all your perceptions and thoughts, feelings and emotions as well. 
              Everything is Awareness appearing as those experiences.  To experience
              this directly is what is called the non-dual state or samadhi.  In
              Dzogchen we could call this non-dual state of Awareness and its energy
              field the experience of Ati.  But you cannot really call Ati an
              experience as there is no subject as a witness of the experience.  Here
              is where words and concepts fail to convey the reality of Ati.  Ati is
              never an experience...but is that which has experiences.<br><br> Ati is Reality as it is, however it appears in each moment.  There are
              no levels of Ati.  That is because Ati is everything just as you
              experience it.  Even the sense of being a confused being looking for
              freedom from suffering is Ati appearing as that.  However, there is
              still an Awareness of that experience of there being a confused being,
              that Awareness is like a mirror, but is itself never the forms or
              reflections that appear as a confused being.  We are never other than
              this non-personal Awareness as the unchanging mirror itself.<br><br> That means there is no need for meditation nor practice because
              whatever is your experience is already Ati.  All states of
              consciousness are Ati.  There is no one to become enlightened as all
              there is, is only the unified field of Being.  The sense of being a
              separate being is just an experience arising as Ati  There has never
              been any separation at any time nor separate selves.  Ati is just being
              as you are in this and every other moment.  When you are sad, that is
              Ati sadness.  When you are crazy, that is Ati craziness.  This is true
              for all conditions and states.<br><br> How is the Ati experience of Ati brought about?  The essence of Ati is
              your cognitive knowingness present within all moments.  There is a
              sense of being conscious within all experiences.  It is that pure
              cognitive consciousness that is the living heart of Ati.  The essence
              of Ati is not thoughts, but is the awareness of thoughts.  The essence
              of Ati is not your emotions, but is the awareness of emotions.  And so
              it is for all sensations and perceptions:  Ati is the awareness of all
              sensory and perceptual experiences yet is inseparable from them, again
              like water and waves.<br><br> Even though Ati is really not possible to practice, whatever you think,
              say, feel or do is already perfect Ati practice.  Whatever conduct you
              engage in, Ati is beyond any notion of virtue or vice.  So all conduct
              and actions are equal.  All thoughts, delusions, distractions are also
              left as they are as they too are perfect Ati practice.  Since whatever
              state of mind you are in is fully the perfection of Ati as it is, what
              other practice is needed?  Even when you feel lost and confused, that
              too is the perfect Ati state being practiced.  <br><br> The key is simply being Ati awareness, the Awareness present in each
              moment already.  It is empty, clear and undefined presence of
              Awareness.  Notice that Awareness has no characteristics other than
              being a naked knowingness as a continuum of consciousness in each
              moment of experience.  Whatever arises internally or externally, its
              just the empty naked cognitive aspect attending each moment as a
              non-personal Awareness of whatever is.  We enter Ati through the method
              of Direct Introduction.  There is no path of learning nor of practice
              in Ati.  Ati Awareness is always your default condition and it cannot
              be made more clear nor ever impaired.<br><br> For those that wish to enter the dimension of Ati... ask questions as
              needed.  But it might be easier to just simply notice that your current
              condition is Ati perfectly expressing itself exactly as you are... as
              the pure noticing within all experiences.<br><br> Jax</em></p>

              <p>Just thought I share my personal experience on effort vs. relaxing into awareness in the act of so-called meditation. </p>
              <p>When
              i started learning meditation (basic shamata) few years back, there is
              indeed effort required to get into the state of meditative
              one-pointedness and not letting my mind "run away".  As a beginner who
              has been in the coma of samsara for the longest time, thoughts and
              concepts are the ONLY thing i know of, so therefore real effort is
              definitely needed to condition and lead the mind to get used to and
              recognize the fact that hey.. there is another way that the mind can
              abide in.  And slowly through persistent practice with effort (lots of
              it) the mind has learnt that thoughts and concepts are not everything
              there is.  There can be another way the mind can be in - a calmer, less
              wild, more sparkling yet more relaxing way of existence - without
              having to indulge in thoughts and activities full-time to validate its
              own existence. No thoughts, no concepts but yet the mind is still there
              and doesn't just "dies off" like what it previously thought.  There is
              still "something there" - continuous "awareness" (or whatever names
              people label it with) that's not thinking anything in particular and
              actually kinda boring from a relative sense (of not doing anything). 
              Probably this is what commonly known as the moments between two
              thoughts. </p>
              <p>If someone tells me about this "awareness" before i
              learnt meditation, i would never be able to "understand" it because the
              mind knows nothing but thoughts and concepts and this awareness is
              exactly the opposite of that constant thinking.  But with consistent
              practice, it becomes easier to "enter" into this awareness with less
              and less effort required.  And at some point I've learnt that the
              awareness is actually "clearer" when I relax and just let go of the
              grasping of "trying to do this thing called meditation".  Subsequently,
              during normal hours when i can be doing mundane things, this
              "awareness" will at certain times become more apparent within my
              experiential field though there may be still thought process going on
              or my body going about its normal tasks. </p>
              <p>What I find
              interesting though is that although this "awareness" is more accessible
              now with less effort, it doesn't mean there is any profound realization
              or anything spectacular.  Even abiding in calm "awareness" the mind
              still cannot stop thinking about "what is this awareness?", "does it
              mean something?", "this is so boring".. etc.  But the difference now is
              there is awareness of these thoughts rather than indulging or being
              "absorbed" into them like in the past.</p>
              <p>My karmic habits and
              propensities are still as strong as ever - I still can't resist going
              for that mouth-watering dessert after my dinner.  I guess the little
              difference it makes now is i'm more aware and have learnt alot about
              how or what i am as a "person living this life".  It is a true gem to
              finally catch some glimpse into this "me, myself and I" story and see
              through some of the lies that its been spinning around itself.</p>
              <p>Forgive my raving.</p>

              <p>Would like to add -- the apparent 'awareness becoming brighter' and 'awareness becoming dull' at different moments of our lives are simply appearances and not reality.</p>
              <p>Awareness is always shining brightly, at all moments! The only difference is that sometimes we are too focused on the content of awareness, so that fundamental ground of awareness stays in the background which we didn't notice while the content of our focus (those thoughts, feelings, etc) is in the foreground. We become absorbed in and identified with the mental stories and positions.</p>
              <p>But when we just turn around and look, what is it that is aware of whatever we are experiencing, including apparently unclear thoughts and feelings, then we notice that Ah, Awareness is still fully present and never lost at all. Then the background of awareness becomes fully present in the foreground.</p>
              <p>Whenever we feel our awareness is dull, just look into what is it that is aware of that dullness or confusion? THAT is what never increases, decreases, arises, nor ceases. It has never been obscured at any moments at all.</p>
              <p>Thoughts processes, bodily actions, all happen by themselves
                      spontaneously and pass away by themselves -- you are not the controller or doer of them! They are
                      all arising in this bright open field of awareness. They cannot happen
                      without awareness. The only difference then is are you identified with the notion of being the separate self, doer, controller, experiencer, or are you resting as the wide open field of awareness in which everything simply manifests on its own accord. You'll see that you are not a person living this life, that life simply unfolds effortlessly by itself.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><br> Now, when you are introduced (to your own intrinsic awareness), the method for entering into it involves three considerations:<br> Thoughts in the past are clear and empty and leave no traces behind.<br> Thoughts in the future are fresh and unconditioned by anything.<br> And in the present moment, when (your mind) remains in its own condition without constructing anything,<br> awareness, at that moment, in itself is quite ordinary.<br> And when you look into yourself in this way nakedly (without any discursive thoughts),<br> Since there is only this pure observing, there will be found a lucid clarity without anyone being there who is the observer;<br> only a naked manifest awareness is present.<br> (This awareness) is empty and immaculately pure, not being created by anything whatsoever.<br> It is authentic and unadulterated, without any duality of clarity and emptiness.<br> It is not permanent and yet it is not created by anything.<br> However, it is not a mere nothingness or something annihilated because it is lucid and present.<br> It does not exist as a single entity because it is present and clear in terms of being many.<br> (On the other hand) it is not created as a multiplicity of things because it is inseparable and of a single flavor.<br> This inherent self-awareness does not derive from anything outside itself.<br> This is the real introduction to the actual condition of things.</p>

                                is the English translation of the Pali word <em>Sati</em>. <em>Sati</em> is an activity. What exactly is that? There can be no precise 
                                answer, at least not in words. Words are devised by the symbolic 
                                levels of the mind and they describe those realities with which 
                                symbolic thinking deals. Mindfulness is pre-symbolic. It is 
                                not shackled to logic. Nevertheless, Mindfulness can be experienced 
                                -- rather easily -- and it can be described, as long as you 
                                keep in mind that the words are only fingers pointing at the 
                                moon. They are not the thing itself. The actual experience lies 
                                beyond the words and above the symbols. Mindfulness could be 
                                describes in completely different terms than will be used here 
                                and each description could still be correct. </span></p>

                                is a subtle process that you are using at this very moment. 
                                The fact that this process lies above and beyond words does 
                                not make it unreal--quite the reverse. Mindfulness is the reality 
                                which gives rise to words--the words that follow are simply 
                                pale shadows of reality. So, it is important to understand that 
                                everything that follows here is analogy. It is not going to 
                                make perfect sense. It will always remain beyond verbal logic. 
                                But you can experience it. The meditation technique called Vipassana 
                                (insight) that was introduced by the Buddha about twenty-five 
                                centuries ago is a set of mental activities specifically aimed 
                                at experiencing a state of uninterrupted Mindfulness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                you first become aware of something, there is a fleeting instant 
                                of pure awareness just before you conceptualize the thing, before 
                                you identify it. That is a stage of Mindfulness. Ordinarily, 
                                this stage is very short. It is that flashing split second just 
                                as you focus your eyes on the thing, just as you focus your 
                                mind on the thing, just before you objectify it, clamp down 
                                on it mentally and segregate it from the rest of existence. 
                                It takes place just before you start thinking about it--before 
                                your mind says, "Oh, it's a dog." That flowing, soft-focused 
                                moment of pure awareness is Mindfulness. In that brief flashing 
                                mind-moment you experience a thing as an un-thing. You experience 
                                a softly flowing moment of pure experience that is interlocked 
                                with the rest of reality, not separate from it. Mindfulness 
                                is very much like what you see with your peripheral vision as 
                                opposed to the hard focus of normal or central vision. Yet this 
                                moment of soft, unfocused, awareness contains a very deep sort 
                                of knowing that is lost as soon as you focus your mind and objectify 
                                the object into a thing. In the process of ordinary perception, 
                                the Mindfulness step is so fleeting as to be unobservable. We 
                                have developed the habit of squandering our attention on all 
                                the remaining steps, focusing on the perception, recognizing 
                                the perception, labeling it, and most of all, getting involved 
                                in a long string of symbolic thought about it. That original 
                                moment of Mindfulness is rapidly passed over. It is the purpose 
                                of the above mentioned Vipassana (or insight) meditation to 
                                train us to prolong that moment of awareness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                this Mindfulness is prolonged by using proper techniques, you 
                                find that this experience is profound and it changes your entire 
                                view of the universe. This state of perception has to be learned, 
                                however, and it takes regular practice. Once you learn the technique, 
                                you will find that Mindfulness has many interesting aspects. </span></p>

                                Characteristics of Mindfulness</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is mirror-thought. It reflects only what is presently happening 
                                and in exactly the way it is happening. There are no biases. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is non-judgmental observation. It is that ability of the mind 
                                to observe without criticism. With this ability, one sees things 
                                without condemnation or judgment. One is surprised by nothing. 
                                One simply takes a balanced interest in things exactly as they 
                                are in their natural states. One does not decide and does not 
                                judge. One just observes. Please note that when we say "One 
                                does not decide and does not judge," what we mean is that 
                                the meditator observes experiences very much like a scientist 
                                observing an object under the microscope without any preconceived 
                                notions, only to see the object exactly as it is. In the same 
                                way the meditator notices impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and 
                                selflessness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">It 
                                is psychologically impossible for us to objectively observe 
                                what is going on within us if we do not at the same time accept 
                                the occurrence of our various states of mind. This is especially 
                                true with unpleasant states of mind. In order to observe our 
                                own fear, we must accept the fact that we are afraid. We can't 
                                examine our own depression without accepting it fully. The same 
                                is true for irritation and agitation, frustration and all those 
                                other uncomfortable emotional states. You can't examine something 
                                fully if you are busy reflecting its existence. Whatever experience 
                                we may be having, Mindfulness just accepts it. It is simply 
                                another of life's occurrences, just another thing to be aware 
                                of. No pride, no shame, nothing personal at stake--what is there, 
                                is there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is an impartial watchfulness. It does not take sides. It does 
                                not get hung up in what is perceived. It just perceives. Mindfulness 
                                does not get infatuated with the good mental states. It does 
                                not try to sidestep the bad mental states. There is no clinging 
                                to the pleasant, no fleeing from the unpleasant. Mindfulness 
                                sees all experiences as equal, all thoughts as equal, all feelings 
                                as equal. Nothing is suppressed. Nothing is repressed. Mindfulness 
                                does not play favorites. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is nonconceptual awareness. Another English term for <em>Sati</em> is 'bare attention'. It is not thinking. It does not get involved 
                                with thought or concepts. It does not get hung up on ideas or 
                                opinions or memories. It just looks. Mindfulness registers experiences, 
                                but it does not compare them. It does not label them or categorize 
                                them. It just observes everything as if it was occurring for 
                                the first time. It is not analysis which is based on reflection 
                                and memory. It is, rather, the direct and immediate experiencing 
                                of whatever is happening, without the medium of thought. It 
                                comes before thought in the perceptual process. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is present time awareness. It takes place in the here and now. 
                                It is the observance of what is happening right now, in the 
                                present moment. It stays forever in the present, surging perpetually 
                                on the crest of the ongoing wave of passing time. If you are 
                                remembering your second-grade teacher, that is memory. When 
                                you then become aware that you are remembering your second-grade 
                                teacher, that is mindfulness. If you then conceptualize the 
                                process and say to yourself, "Oh, I am remembering", 
                                that is thinking. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is non-egoistic alertness. It takes place without reference 
                                to self. With Mindfulness one sees all phenomena without references 
                                to concepts like 'me', 'my' or 'mine'. For example, suppose 
                                there is pain in your left leg. Ordinary consciousness would 
                                say, "I have a pain." Using Mindfulness, one would 
                                simply note the sensation as a sensation. One would not tack 
                                on that extra concept 'I'. Mindfulness stops one from adding 
                                anything to perception, or subtracting anything from it. One 
                                does not enhance anything. One does not emphasize anything. 
                                One just observes exactly what is there--without distortion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is goal-less awareness. In Mindfulness, one does not strain 
                                for results. One does not try to accomplish anything. When one 
                                is mindful, one experiences reality in the present moment in 
                                whatever form it takes. There is nothing to be achieved. There 
                                is only observation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is awareness of change. It is observing the passing flow of 
                                experience. It is watching things as they are changing. it is 
                                seeing the birth, growth, and maturity of all phenomena. It 
                                is watching phenomena decay and die. Mindfulness is watching 
                                things moment by moment, continuously. It is observing all phenomena--physical, 
                                mental or emotional--whatever is presently taking place in the 
                                mind. One just sits back and watches the show. Mindfulness is 
                                the observance of the basic nature of each passing phenomenon. 
                                It is watching the thing arising and passing away. It is seeing 
                                how that thing makes us feel and how we react to it. It is observing 
                                how it affects others. In Mindfulness, one is an unbiased observer 
                                whose sole job is to keep track of the constantly passing show 
                                of the universe within. <em>Please note that last point.</em> In Mindfulness, one watches the universe within. The meditator 
                                who is developing Mindfulness is not concerned with the external 
                                universe. It is there, but in meditation, one's field of study 
                                is one's own experience, one's thoughts, one's feelings, and 
                                one's perceptions. In meditation, one is one's own laboratory. 
                                The universe within has an enormous fund of information containing 
                                the reflection of the external world and much more. An examination 
                                of this material leads to total freedom. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is participatory observation. The meditator is both participant 
                                and observer at one and the same time. If one watches one's 
                                emotions or physical sensations, one is feeling them at that 
                                very same moment. Mindfulness is not an intellectual awareness. 
                                It is just awareness. The mirror-thought metaphor breaks down 
                                here. Mindfulness is objective, but it is not cold or unfeeling. 
                                It is the wakeful experience of life, an alert participation 
                                in the ongoing process of living. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is an extremely difficult concept to define in words -- not 
                                because it is complex, but because it is too simple and open. 
                                The same problem crops up in every area of human experience. 
                                The most basic concept is always the most difficult to pin down. 
                                Look at a dictionary and you will see a clear example. Long 
                                words generally have concise definitions, but for short basic 
                                words like 'the' and 'is', definitions can be a page long. And 
                                in physics, the most difficult functions to describe are the 
                                most basic--those that deal with the most fundamental realities 
                                of quantum mechanics. Mindfulness is a pre-symbolic function. 
                                You can play with word symbols all day long and you will never 
                                pin it down completely. We can never fully express what it is. 
                                However, we can say what it does. </span></p>

                                Mindfulness reminds us of what we are supposed to be doing; 
                                (b) it sees things as they really are; and (c) it sees the deep 
                                nature of all phenomena. Let's examine these definitions in 
                                greater detail. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><em>(a) 
                                Mindfulness reminds you of what you are supposed to be doing</em> . In meditation, you put your attention on one item. When your 
                                mind wanders from this focus, it is Mindfulness that reminds 
                                you that your mind is wandering and what you are supposed to 
                                be doing. It is Mindfulness that brings your mind back to the 
                                object of meditation. All of this occurs instantaneously and 
                                without internal dialogue. Mindfulness is not thinking. Repeated 
                                practice in meditation establishes this function as a mental 
                                habit which then carries over into the rest of your life. A 
                                serious meditator pays bare attention to occurrences all the 
                                time, day in, day out, whether formally sitting in meditation 
                                or not. This is a very lofty ideal towards which those who meditate 
                                may be working for a period of years or even decades. Our habit 
                                of getting stuck in thought is years old, and that habit will 
                                hang on in the most tenacious manner. The only way out is to 
                                be equally persistent in the cultivation of constant Mindfulness. 
                                When Mindfulness is present, you will notice when you become 
                                stuck in your thought patterns. It is that very noticing which 
                                allows you to back out of the thought process and free yourself 
                                from it. Mindfulness then returns your attention to its proper 
                                focus. If you are meditating at that moment, then your focus 
                                will be the formal object of meditation. If your are not in 
                                formal meditation, it will be just a pure application of bare 
                                attention itself, just a pure noticing of whatever comes up 
                                without getting involved--"Ah, this comes up...and now 
                                this, and now this... and now this". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is at one and the same time both bare attention itself and the 
                                function of reminding us to pay bare attention if we have ceased 
                                to do so. Bare attention is noticing. It re- establishes itself 
                                simply by noticing that it has not been present. As soon as 
                                you are noticing that you have not been noticing, then by definition 
                                you are noticing and then you are back again to paying bare 
                                attention. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                creates its own distinct feeling in consciousness. It has a 
                                flavor--a light, clear, energetic flavor. Conscious thought 
                                is heavy by comparison, ponderous and picky. But here again, 
                                these are just words. Your own practice will show you the difference. 
                                Then you will probably come up with your own words and the words 
                                used here will become superfluous. Remember, practice is the 
                                thing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><em>(b) 
                                Mindfulness sees things as they really are</em>. Mindfulness 
                                adds nothing to perception and it subtracts nothing. It distorts 
                                nothing. It is bare attention and just looks at whatever comes 
                                up. Conscious thought pastes things over our experience, loads 
                                us down with concepts and ideas, immerses us in a churning vortex 
                                of plans and worries, fears and fantasies. When mindful, you 
                                don't play that game. You just notice exactly what arises in 
                                the mind, then you notice the next thing. "Ah, this...and 
                                this...and now this." It is really very simple. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"><em>(c) 
                                Mindfulness sees the true nature of all phenomena</em>. Mindfulness 
                                and only Mindfulness can perceive the three prime characteristics 
                                that Buddhism teaches are the deepest truths of existence. In 
                                Pali these three are called <em>Anicca</em> (impermanence), <em>Dukkha</em> (unsatisfactoriness), and <em>Anatta</em> (selflessness--the absence 
                                of a permanent, unchanging, entity that we call Soul or Self). 
                                These truths are not present in Buddhist teaching as dogmas 
                                demanding blind faith. The Buddhists feel that these truths 
                                are universal and self-evident to anyone who cares to investigate 
                                in a proper way. Mindfulness is the method of investigation. 
                                Mindfulness alone has the power to reveal the deepest level 
                                of reality available to human observation. At this level of 
                                inspection, one sees the following: (a) all conditioned things 
                                are inherently transitory; (b) every worldly thing is, in the 
                                end, unsatisfying; and (c) there are really no entities that 
                                are unchanging or permanent, only processes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                works like and electron microscope. That is, it operates on 
                                so fine a level that one can actually see directly those realities 
                                which are at best theoretical constructs to the conscious thought 
                                process. Mindfulness actually sees the impermanent character 
                                of every perception. It sees the transitory and passing nature 
                                of everything that is perceived. It also sees the inherently 
                                unsatisfactory nature of all conditioned things. It sees that 
                                there is no sense grabbing onto any of these passing shows. 
                                Peace and happiness cannot be found that way. And finally, Mindfulness 
                                sees the inherent selflessness of all phenomena. It sees the 
                                way that we have arbitrarily selected a certain bundle of perceptions, 
                                chopped them off from the rest of the surging flow of experience 
                                and then conceptualized them as separate, enduring, entities. 
                                Mindfulness actually sees these things. It does not think about 
                                them, it sees them directly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                it is fully developed, Mindfulness sees these three attributes 
                                of existence directly, instantaneously, and without the intervening 
                                medium of conscious thought. In fact, even the attributes which 
                                we just covered are inherently unified. They don't really exist 
                                as separate items. They are purely the result of our struggle 
                                to take this fundamentally simple process called Mindfulness 
                                and express it in the cumbersome and inadequate thought symbols 
                                of the conscious level. Mindfulness is a process, but it does 
                                not take place in steps. It is a holistic process that occurs 
                                as a unit: you notice your own lack of Mindfulness; and that 
                                noticing itself is a result of Mindfulness; and Mindfulness 
                                is bare attention; and bare attention is noticing things exactly 
                                as they are without distortion; and the way they are is impermanent 
                                <em>(Anicca)</em> , unsatisfactory <em>(Dukkha)</em>, and selfless 
                                <em>(Anatta)</em>. It all takes place in the space of a few mind-moments. 
                                This does not mean, however, that you will instantly attain 
                                liberation (freedom from all human weaknesses) as a result of 
                                your first moment of Mindfulness. Learning to integrate this 
                                material into your conscious life is another whole process. 
                                And learning to prolong this state of Mindfulness is still another. 
                                They are joyous processes, however, and they are well worth 
                                the effort. </span></p>

                                (Sati) and Insight (Vipassana) Meditation</strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                is the center of Vipassana Meditation and the key to the whole 
                                process. It is both the goal of this meditation and the means 
                                to that end. You reach Mindfulness by being ever more mindful. 
                                One other Pali word that is translated into English as Mindfulness 
                                is <em>Appamada</em> , which means non-negligence or an absence 
                                of madness. One who attends constantly to what is really going 
                                on in one's mind achieves the state of ultimate sanity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">The 
                                Pali term <em>Sati</em> also bears the connotation of remembering. 
                                It is not memory in the sense of ideas and pictures from the 
                                past, but rather clear, direct, wordless knowing of what is 
                                and what is not, of what is correct and what is incorrect, of 
                                what we are doing and how we should go about it. Mindfulness 
                                reminds the meditator to apply his attention to the proper object 
                                at the proper time and to exert precisely the amount of energy 
                                needed to do the job. When this energy is properly applied, 
                                the meditator stays constantly in a state of calm and alertness. 
                                As long as this condition is maintained, those mind-states call 
                                "hindrances" or "psychic irritants" cannot 
                                arise--there is no greed, no hatred, no lust or laziness. But 
                                we all are human and we do err. Most of us err repeatedly. Despite 
                                honest effort, the meditator lets his Mindfulness slip now and 
                                then and he finds himself stuck in some regrettable, but normal, 
                                human failure. It is Mindfulness that notices that change. And 
                                it is Mindfulness that reminds him to apply the energy required 
                                to pull himself out. These slips happen over and over, but their 
                                frequency decreases with practice. Once Mindfulness has pushed 
                                these mental defilements aside, more wholesome states of mind 
                                can take their place. Hatred makes way for loving kindness, 
                                lust is replaced by detachment. It is Mindfulness which notices 
                                this change, too, and which reminds the Vipassana meditator 
                                to maintain that extra little mental sharpness needed to keep 
                                these more desirable states of mind. Mindfulness makes possible 
                                the growth of wisdom and compassion. Without Mindfulness they 
                                cannot develop to full maturity. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Deeply 
                                buried in the mind, there lies a mental mechanism which accepts 
                                what the mind perceives as beautiful and pleasant experiences 
                                and rejects those experiences which are perceived as ugly and 
                                painful. This mechanism gives rise to those states of mind which 
                                we are training ourselves to avoid--things like greed, lust, 
                                hatred, aversion, and jealousy. We choose to avoid these hindrances, 
                                not because they are evil in the normal sense of the word, but 
                                because they are compulsive; because they take the mind over 
                                and capture the attention completely; because they keep going 
                                round and round in tight little circles of thought; and because 
                                they seal us off from living reality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">These 
                                hindrances cannot arise when Mindfulness is present. Mindfulness 
                                is attention to present time reality, and therefore, directly 
                                antithetical to the dazed state of mind which characterizes 
                                impediments. As meditators, it is only when we let our Mindfulness 
                                slip that the deep mechanisms of our mind take over -- grasping, 
                                clinging and rejecting. Then resistance emerges and obscures 
                                our awareness. We do not notice that the change is taking place 
                                -- we are too busy with a thought of revenge, or greed, whatever 
                                it may be. While an untrained person will continue in this state 
                                indefinitely, a trained meditator will soon realize what is 
                                happening. It is Mindfulness that notices the change. It is 
                                Mindfulness that remembers the training received and that focuses 
                                our attention so that the confusion fades away. And it is Mindfulness 
                                that then attempts to maintain itself indefinitely so that the 
                                resistance cannot arise again. Thus, Mindfulness is the specific 
                                antidote for hindrances. It is both the cure and the preventive 
                                measure. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Fully 
                                developed Mindfulness is a state of total non-attachment and 
                                utter absence of clinging to anything in the world. If we can 
                                maintain this state, no other means or device is needed to keep 
                                ourselves free of obstructions, to achieve liberation from our 
                                human weaknesses. Mindfulness is non-superficial awareness. 
                                It sees things deeply, down below the level of concepts and 
                                opinions. This sort of deep observation leads to total certainty, 
                                and complete absence of confusion. It manifests itself primarily 
                                as a constant and unwavering attention which never flags and 
                                never turns away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">This 
                                pure and unstained investigative awareness not only holds mental 
                                hindrances at bay, it lays bare their very mechanism and destroys 
                                them. Mindfulness neutralizes defilements in the mind. The result 
                                is a mind which remains unstained and invulnerable, completely 
                                unaffected by the ups and downs of life.</span></p>

              <p>Just some thoughts...</p>
              <p>Awareness is actually the unchanging nature of mind, it is actually what we truly are.</p>
              <p>But the belief in the notion of a separate self can be deep and subtle and blinds us from seeing.</p>
              <p>It makes us think that 'awareness' is something that 'I' sometimes experience, yet also something that 'I' sometimes stop experiencing. We think that we are a separate self experiencing awareness. We think that we as a separate self can sometimes experience awareness and sometimes not experience awareness. This is all an unfounded notion. And no matter how clear awareness appears in our lives at times, if the basic ignorance of being a separate self apart from awareness is not seen through thoroughly, there will be something clouding the waters -- there will always be a sense of lack and the seeking to 'experience awareness' will go on.</p>
              <p>In actuality, we do not experience awareness, We ARE awareness. It is what we truly are, our true nature, that which is timelessly ever-present. It is actually that unchanging, unmoving basis and ground of all experiencing, and no separate self can be found in actuality apart from thoughts and feelings arising and passing within awareness, including thoughts of 'gaining' or 'losing' awareness. There is no separate self/experiencer to experience awareness, awareness is not something which 'I' experience (among other things 'I' can experience) but something which I Am. And all experiences are just manifestations of that awareness and is none other than That. The notion of a separate self or experiencer is seen to be non-existent just like the horns of a rabbit.</p>
              <p>So, what matters isn't so much about whether we can experience awareness, rather what's important is the clarity about what you truly are and seeing through that mis-identification with a separate self. It doesn't mean that 'nothing needs to be done' -- in my understanding the investigation needs to go on until every trace of doubts and false concepts and notions of separation is removed in utter conviction.</p>
              <p>Awareness can never be grasped by the mind. 'Gaining' or 'losing' awareness are just unfounded notions based on the notion of a separate self, and all these thoughts are cognised by awareness.</p>
              <p>In fact our nature is so direct and simple, anything that we say about awareness, is not it -- it is merely superimposing our ideas and notion over that basic, direct, reality, too direct for words and concepts. Our true nature is truly attributeless, without any characteristics whatsoever. Even though words and descriptions have been given to it, but if we are to truly see this we should let go of all notions and preconceptions. Whatever image we have of it, that's not it, since it is basically prior to all concepts, thoughts, images. Just stay with the wordless clarity and let go of everything else.</p>
              <p>I welcome any comments, thoughts, corrections, etc...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>It seems like at the relative level, the egoistic "I" who's learning the Dharma is choosing its one-way suicidal trip to oblivion.  Realization along the path will burn away every last traces of the egoistic I and all its notions about the world until at the end, neither realization nor the egoistic I remains.  What's left is just the original reality as it is, but in the end, there isn't even any object of "original reality" that can be pinned down.  Just a magical display of whatever there is, as it is.</p></div>
