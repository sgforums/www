              <p>I posted the following article in another forum yesterday (my forum name there is 'BeAwake'), initially didn't want to post here since these stuff have been posted here one form or another and hence it will only be 'repeat material'. But anyway just for sharing.</p>
              <p>http://www.sgclub.com/singapore/realise_inherent_self_150666.html</p>
              <div id="post_message_2228335">Your Buddha-Nature, or Inherent
              Wakefulness, is already complete, right now at this moment. Development
              doesn't lead to Awakeness; Awakeness is always already here. The fact
              that we insist upon not noticing it is another matter. <br> <br> Awareness cannot be reached through development. It cannot be
              cultivated. It cannot be attained. It is your natural state, and cannot
              be fabricated through contrived practices. Primordial Awareness cannot
              be an event in time since it is Prior to time. It is only about your
              already ever present fact of your being. It is present before you were
              born (i.e. in zen koan, "the original face before your parents were
              born"), present 1 year ago, 1 minute ago, present now. Unmoved.<br> <br> It is unconditioned, does not increase upon enlightenment nor decrease
              while ignorant, nor disappear at any time, regardless of whatever
              conditions there is. Thoughts of "losing it" and "getting it" are just
              hypnotic thoughts that bind us like a spell into our imaginary
              make-belief dream and miss the self-evident actuality, and yet all
              thoughts are just surfacing in this already awake nature of our being.
              Without awareness, no thoughts or experience can even be. Yet, we have
              to overcome the bondage of conceptuality and thoughts to see this
              utterly simple, direct, and intimate Truth -- too direct for words and
              concepts.<br> <br> Your Buddha-Nature, ever-present presence-awareness, is present and
              available at all moments regardless what you are experiencing,
              including your own present state of awareness right now. It is not an
              altered or fabricated state but our ordinary awareness at every moment.
              Hence, Ken Wilber says, "I'm going to talk you into this state, or try
              to, using what are known in Buddhism as "pointing out instructions." I
              am not going to try to get you into a different state of consciousness,
              or an altered state of consciousness, or a non-ordinary state. I am
              going to simply point out something that is already occurring in your
              own present, ordinary, natural state."<br> <br> I hope the following pointers by Ken Wilber are helpful in noticing
              your already awake nature, and to fully abide in it at all times. The
              pointers pointing to the moon (i.e. your true nature) should not be
              mistaken with the moon itself, but hopefully will point us in the right
              direction -- to cease chasing and grasping thoughts and outer forms, to
              go against the worldly stream of thoughts and forms, to turn the light
              of awareness within and upon itself, to allow awareness to be aware of
              itself and be awakened to itself. As what Chinese call it: å��é—»é—»è‡ªæ€§<br>

              <tr>
              <td class="alt2" style="border: 1px inset;">There are many things that I can doubt, but I cannot doubt my own
              consciousness in this moment. My consciousness IS, and even if I tried
              to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doubting. I can imagine that
              my senses are being presented with a fake reality – say, a completely
              virtual reality or digital reality, which looks real but is merely a
              series of extremely realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the
              consciousness that is doing the watching…<br> <br> The very undeniability of my present awareness, the undeniability of my
              consciousness, immediately delivers to me a certainty of existence in
              this moment, a certainty of Being in the now-ness of this moment. I
              cannot doubt consciousness and Being in this moment, for it is the
              ground of all knowing, all seeing, all existing…<br> <br> Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?<br> <br> If you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is
              actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can
              doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt
              the doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display.
              Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows
              God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of
              now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty
              lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not
              in the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God,
              because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that
              can be seen…<br> <br> This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but impossible to escape,
              because it is ever present and can never really be doubted. You can
              never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner. To put it very
              bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but impossible to avoid: it is that
              which is looking at this page right now. Can’t you feel That One? Why
              on earth do you keep looking for God when God is actually the Looker?<br> <br> Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br> <br> I am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am
              aware of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float
              by in the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the
              body – and I am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br> <br> Moreover, I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings
              exist, I can doubt that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt
              that the Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still
              be there to witness the doubt.<br> <br> I am not objects in nature, not feelings in the body, not thoughts in
              the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am that Witness – a vast,
              spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent Openness that impartially
              notices all that arises, as a mirror spontaneously reflects all its
              objects…<br> <br> You can already feel some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest
              in the ease of witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are
              free from the suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings,
              mere thoughts – they all come and go, but you are that vast, free,
              empty, open Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and
              tortures.<br> <br> This is actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the
              formless Witness, causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the
              entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are
              not the body, not the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that
              – you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br> <br> With this discovery… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from
              any and all finite objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are
              free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted,
              drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to
              time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and
              suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss,
              the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, and all that was, and all that
              ever shall be.<br> <br> But why is that only halfway home? Because as you rest in the infinite
              ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware of all that is arising,
              there will soon enough come the great catastrophe of Freedom and
              Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear entirely, and instead of
              witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead of touching the earth, you
              are the earth; instead of hearing the thunder, you are the thunder. You
              and the entire Kosmos because One Taste – you can drink the Pacific
              Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the palm of your hand;
              supernovas swirl in your heart and the solar system replaces your head…<br> <br> You are One Taste, the empty mirror that is one with any and all
              objects that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent
              expanse: infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…<br> <br> So the primary Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between…
              in here and out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all
              things witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste.
              Once you actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then –
              can it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes
              fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br> <br> And so how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the
              Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian
              dualism, then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face
              looking at the world out there. There is only the world, and you are
              all of that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that is
              arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face
              looking out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with
              a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a
              five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling
              hard to miss.<br> <br> At that point, which is actually your ever-present condition, there is
              no exclusive identity with this particular organism, no constriction of
              consciousness to the head, a constriction that makes it seem that “you”
              are in the head looking at the rest of the world out there; there is no
              binding of attention to the personal bodymind: instead, consciousness
              is one with all that is arising – a vast, open, transparent, radiant,
              infinitely Free and infinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire
              Kosmos, so that every single subject and every single object are
              erotically united in the Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from
              merely being behind your eyes, and you become the All, you directly and
              actually feel that your basic identity is everything that is arising
              moment to moment (just as previously you felt that your identity was
              with this finite, partial, separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a
              body). Inside and outside have become One Taste. I tell you, it can
              happen just like that!<br> <br> (Source: Boomeritis, Sidebar E: “The Genius Descartes Gets a Postmodern

              <p>No, there is no need to change your lifestyle and behaviors to practice. And every activity, eating, walking, singing, is just the activity of your Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p><em><br>...The particular method of Dzogchen is called the Path of
                      Self-Liberation, and to apply it nothing need be renounced, purified,
                      or transformed. Whatever arises as one's karmic vision is used as the
                      path. The great master Pha Tampa Sangye [South Indian Yogin of the 11
                      century (ed.)] once said: It is not the circumstances which arise as
                      one's karmic vision that condition a person into the dualistic state;
                      it is a person's own attachment that enables what arises to condition
                      him. If this attachment is to be cut through in the most rapid and
                      effective way, the mind's spontaneous capacity to self-liberate must be
                      brought into play. The term self-liberation should not, however, be
                      taken as implying that there is some 'self' or ego there to be
                      liberated. It is a fundamental assumption...at the Dzogchen level, that
                      all phenomena are void of self-nature. 'Self -Liberation', in the
                      Dzogchen sense, means that whatever manifests in the field of
                      experience of the practitioner is allowed to arise just as it is,
                      without judgement of it as good or bad, beautiful or ugly. And in that
                      same moment, if there is no clinging, or attachment, without effort, or
                      even volition, whatever it is that arises, whether as a thought or as a
                      seemingly external event, automatically liberates itself, by itself,
                      and of itself. Practicing in this way the seeds of the poison tree of
                      dualistic vision never even get a chance to sprout, much less to take
                      root and grow.(p33)<br><strong><br>So the practitioner lives his or her life in
                      an ordinary way, without needing any rules other than one's own
                      awareness, always remaining in the primordial state through integrating
                      that state with whatever arises as part of experience -- with
                      absolutely nothing to be seen outwardly to show that one is practicing.</strong> This is what is meant by self-liberation, this is what is meant by the
                      name Dzogchen - which means Great Perfection - and this is what is
                      meant by non-dual contemplation, or simply contemplation....</em></p>

              <div><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Very good advise by Loppon Namdrol from E-Sangha:</span></div>

              <div>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You need to just sit and relax.  <br> <br>Take a proper 
              posture. Expell the stale air.  <br> <br>Do Guru yoga. <br> <br>Then relax. As 
              one's mind slowly subsides, a vivid, clear and energetic radiance will emerge. 
              This is not rigpa itself, but is instead the radiance aspect of awareness. 
              Relaxing in this is the essence of tregchod.  <br> <br>If it does not arise-- it 
              doesn't matter-- it is there anyway. If it arises, it doesn't matter, since 
              there is nothing one can do to cause it to arise, nor will it ever subside. But 
              it is revealed when one is sufficiently relaxed.  <br> <br>If thoughts occur, it 
              doesn't matter, since thoughts do not exist outside of this state. If there are 
              no thoughts, it doesn't matter, since this radiance is not product of stillness, 
              no more than the lustre of clear water is a product of the settling out of 
              detritus.  <br> <br>When one can "see" the radiance of awareness even in the 
              midst of the chaos of concepts, then one's tregchod is moving ahead.  
              <br> <br>Otherwise, just relax and integrate into your primordial state.

              <p>It's some sort of side effects resulting from strong concentration. Don't need to be too concerned about it. When we meditate all sorts of strange sensations can occur. There is no need for alarm, but don't indulge them either.</p>
              <p>What's important is we don't lose our mindfulness and awareness, remain undistracted. Our awareness is not a contrived experience, it is not an altered state, it is not something that can be 'induced', it is not a trasient experience. It is our natural state. It is what is always already present. It is a field, an open field of awareness that gives rise to and allows all experiences to come and go without any obstructions. Relax into that open field of awareness which is unaffected by any experiences.</p>
              <p> p.s. in the practice I described, there is no need to practise any sort of contrived concentration. Any sort of focusing is artificial and contrived. There's nothing you need to do to 'be' what you already are. All you have to do is let go and RELAX. But not losing clarity or awareness or falling into trance... in fact the more you relax your clinging/fixation, the clearer awareness will be. It's natural, uncontrived.</p>
              <p>Whatever arises is allowed to pass away by itself (self-liberates) in the field of awareness, there is no attempt to cling, focus on, or solidify what is evanescent, the mirror of awareness simply 'reflects' <em>what is </em>without distortion or grasping. And hence, no special type of focusing or concentration needed, and the only concentration needed is as Adam West said: <em>'being brightly aware
                                                          of what is. Concentration in this sense simply means being
                                                          naturally aware and not being distracted by having our attention
                                                          divided by activities of mind.'</em></p>

              <p>Haha, my wisdom is nothing compared to a lot of great practitioners here.</p>
              <p>What you said is right.</p>
              <p>No matter how many transient states and experiences we had, no matter how spectacular it is, will bring us no closer to awakening. Because our true nature is not an experience, it is the unmoving awareness that is present and accessible regardless of what we are experiencing. It is THAT to which everything is happening. Whatever you are experiencing, to whom is that experiencing occuring to/in/as? Awareness. No matter where you are, what you are doing, Awareness is fully present and 'accessible'... and is the basis of all experiences -- all experience implies there is an awareness OF experience, and that awareness is our unchanging nature of mind. We just miss it when we get lost in the transient contents (experience) arising in awareness. Therefore chasing after experiences are precisely besides the point and goes the opposite direction of awakening, i.e. realising what is ever-present regardless of content.</p>
              <p>Anyway while reading something just now, I found a quote by Leo Hartong which I think is quite relevant here:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; color: #660033; font-size: normal;">First slowly, like the lifting of a mist, it dawned on me, then suddenly 
                                      it was clear: IT is not about experiences, but about THAT which is aware <strong><em> of</em></strong> the experiences: the space in which it all occurs. Whether 
                                      it is a peak experience, washing your hands, or stubbing your toe - 
                                      it makes no difference to THAT in which it all appears. IT is the seeing 
                                      rather than that what is seen. That is the shift.</span></p>

              <p>This can also relate back to your false assumption that awakening will somehow stop us from experiencing all the mundane activities in life -- which is obviously not the case, as Awareness is the basis of all activities, and is completely accessible whatever we are doing.</p>
              <p>Awareness is not a transcendental state or experience which 'cancels out' all mundane experiences and activities. Awareness is the ground of being, the ground of all experiencing, and whether what we are experiencing is so called 'mundane' (getting your work done, watching movies, washing dishes) or 'special' (entering deep samadhi, absorption, etc) makes not a difference to the nature of our mind (which is ever brightly luminous (aware), and empty). It is the basis of all mundane or non-mundane activities.</p>
              <p>You will 'see' that the awareness now, the awareness when experiencing calmness, the awareness when experiencing strange sensations, the awareness when experiencing thoughts, is exactly the same. Awareness is timeless. Awareness has no coming or going, totally unmoving.</p>

              <p>Pause all your concepts for a moment. In that gap between two thoughts, isn't there a vivid, clear, presence/beingness? You cannot doubt that even without using thoughts, it is vividly clear.</p>

              <p>We must never, never study spirituality as if it is a 'chim' subject like a difficult subject we are learning in school.</p>
              <p>Because if we are just trying to figure it out using the mind or intellect, then we are going the wrong directions. Words can only help as pointers for us to have an 'intuitive feel' of what it is talking about. Then the rest is practising, abiding in the recognition in our daily lives.</p>
              <p>Intellect is the wrong tool for this endeavor. It can never grasp spirituality. Intellect is devoid of the dynamic presence and livingness that only intuitive awareness can touch. Truth (what is always present) is obvious by itself, requiring no other tool to figure it out. As the 3rd Zen Patriarch said, don't seek truth, just cease to cherish opinions. Capturing spiritual understanding through concepts and ideas into dead images is of no use here. But when we take the focus off of the mind, then perhaps the all-pervading field of awareness might just reveal itself on its own accord.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng:</p>
              <p>"What I can tell you is not secret. If you <em>turn</em> your <em>awareness</em> inwardly and you will find what is secret within you."</p>
              <p>Leo Hartong:</p>
              <p><em>"In relation to Pure Awareness, the best the intellect can do is to recognize its own modus operandi. In other words, to get it, we must get why we cannot get it. If, at this point, the intellectual mind does not see its natural limitations, it may jump to a wrong conclusion like, ‘Oh if I can’t get it, it must be complicated.’ No doubt about it, trying to capture the non-dual in the dualistic medium of language can get very complicated; but in essence, it is not complicated at all, just as pointing out the color blue to a child is simple, but explaining it to a professor who was born blind is next to impossible.</em></p>
              <p><em>While the heart – or right hemisphere of the brain – has a feel for this type of reasoning, the dividing and classifying left-brained aspect doesn’t. It is simply not the correct tool for dealing with the undivided whole to which this text is pointing. The intellect is the wrong tool for relating to non-dualistic reality, in the same way that a bucket is the wrong tool for scooping up the summer wind, or that bars are unfit to confine the rain, or that a sealed coffin can’t hold sunlight.</em></p>
              <p><em><br>The mind not only appears in Awareness, it tends to confuse its own intellectual activity with Awareness. In fact, Awareness is not a product of the mind, but the mind is a product of Awareness – the silent and permanent background common to everything, including the mind and its activity. Like the screen on which we watch a movie, this background is generally ignored in favor of the impermanent activity that appears on or against it. Zoom out, and Awareness and its content unify in a Self-luminous singularity about which nothing can be said or known for the simple reason that anything said or known is part-and parcel of this singularity."<br></em></p>

              <p class="subhead"><strong>View and Meditation of the Great Perfection<br> by the first Jamgon Kontrul Rinpoche</strong></p>
              <p>Homage to the Guru, the teacher.</p>
              <p>The
              View and Meditation of Dzogchen can be explained in many, many ways,
              but simply sustaining the essence of present awareness includes them
              all. <br> Your mind won't be found elsewhere. <br> It is the very nature of this moment-to-moment thinking. <br> Regard nakedly the essence of this thinking and you find present awareness, right where you are.</p>
              <p>Why chase after thoughts, which are superficial ripples of present awareness? <br> Rather look directly into the naked, empty nature of thoughts; then
              there is no duality, no observer, and nothing observed. <br> Simply rest in this transparent, nondual present awareness. <br> Make yourself at home in the natural state of pure presence, just being, not doing anything in particular.</p>
              <p>Present awareness is empty, open, and luminous; not a concrete substance, yet not nothing. <br> Empty, yet it is perfectly cognizant, lucid, aware. <br> As if magically, not by causing it to be aware, but innately aware, awareness continuously functions. <br> These two sides of present awareness or Rigpa-its emptiness and its cognizance (lucidity)-are inseparable. <br> Emptiness and luminosity (knowing) are inseparable. <br> They are formless, as if nothing whatsoever, ungraspable, unborn, undying; yet spacious, vivid, buoyant. <br> Nothing whatsoever, yet Emaho!, everything is magically experienced. <br> Simply recognize this. <br> Look into the magical mirror of mind and appreciate this infinite magical display.</p>
              <p>With constant, vigilant mindfulness, sustain this recognition of empty, open, brilliant awareness. <br> Cultivate nothing else. <br> There is nothing else to do, or to undo. <br> Let it remain naturally. <br> Don't spoil it by manipulating, by controlling, by tampering with it,
              and worrying about whether you are right or wrong, or having a good
              meditation or a bad meditation. <br> Leave it as it is, and rest your weary heart and mind.</p>
              <p>The
              ultimate luminosity of Dharmakaya, absolute truth, is nothing other
              than the very nature of this uncontrived, ordinary mind. <br> Don't look elsewhere for the Buddha. <br> It is nothing other than the nature of this present awareness. <br> This is the Buddha within.</p>
              <p>There are innumerable Dharma teachings. <br> There are many antidotes to many different kinds of spiritual diseases. <br> There are many words in the Mahamudra and Dzogchen nondual teachings. <br> But the root, the heart of all practices is included here, in simply
              sustaining the luminous nature of this present awareness. <br> If you search elsewhere for something better, a Buddha superior to this
              present awareness, you are deluding yourself. <br> You are chained, entangled in the barbed wire of hope and fear. <br> So give it up! Simply sustain present wakefulness, moment after moment. <br> Devotion, compassion, and perfecting virtue and wisdom are the most
              important supportive methods for completely fulfilling this naked,
              nondual teaching about present awareness, the innate Dharmakaya. <br> So always devote yourself to spiritual practice for the benefit of
              others and apply yourself in body, speech, and mind to what is
              wholesome and virtuous.</p>
              <p>Sarva mangalam.</p>
              <p>May all beings be happy!</p>

              </div>
              <p>Would
              like to add on or clarify my previous reply: since pure awareness
              'feels' exactly the same whether in calm state, a state with thoughts,
              a pleasant state or experience or an unpleasant one, awareness is the
              fundamental 'seeing' that allows all experience to arise -- whether a
              calm state or a state of thought. Because to have an experience, there
              must be an awareness of that experience, and that seeing/awareness of
              that experience is precisely our true nature. That means in calm state,
              our true nature is that awareness that knows the calm state. In
              thinking state, our true nature is the awareness that knows the
              thoughts. <br> <br> So the question is, when the pleasant, peaceful (or non peaceful)
              feeling arise, are we abiding AS the awareness of the feelings or are
              we lost in the feelings? It is that simple.<br> <br> Similarly thoughts arising is perfectly fine -- but are we lost in the
              thoughts, or are we abiding as the awareness of thoughts? In each
              moment, we are either abiding as awareness, or lost in the
              hypnotic/trance-like state of thinking. Without mindful abidance in
              awareness the thinking will lead you away into a dreamland, one thought
              chaining up with another endlessly, and that is the samsaric dream of
              suffering. OR, we can abide as the awareness that knows when thoughts
              arise, and continues to KNOW when no thoughts arise. Most people are
              living their lives in a trance-like, hypnotic state of being completely
              identified and attached to their thinking. There is no freedom for
              them. But as practitioners we can learn to be liberated from all
              thoughts (note: this is not the same as having no thoughts, liberation
              can occur whether or not there is thoughts but the key is in being
              awake). Awareness is always present, unmoved, and never lost. But when
              we fixate on and chase our thoughts, feelings and emotions, and become
              'hypnotised' by them into a trance state, we lose sight of awareness.
              This is the meaning when Buddha said "ä¸€åˆ‡ä¼—ç”Ÿçš†æœ‰å¦‚æ�¥æ™ºæ…§å¾·ç›¸ã€‚å�ªå› å¦„æƒ³æ‰§ç�€ä¸�èƒ½è¯�å¾—ã€‚" So we
              need to bring ourselves back. In fact we cannot abide in awareness all
              the time especially for beginners: just do short periods of it whenever
              possible. We cannot do it for long at first because our habitual
              tendencies to get 'lost' in appearances and thoughts is very strong. It
              takes practise but we can certainly build the momentum. But whenever we
              abide in awareness, in that instant there is totally no identification
              and grasping on the thoughts AT ALL.<br> <br> They are just like clouds passing by in the vast, empty sunlit sky
              without being obstructed by the sky, nor is the sky being obstructed by
              the clouds. The clouds (i.e. thoughts and experiences) do not affect
              that presence of awareness, our presence of awareness shines ever
              brightly whether or not appearances show up. Also, our presence of
              awareness does not have a preference for a state without thoughts or
              appearances, nor does it reject thoughts or appearances when they
              arise. Our awareness simply 'knows'. But is utterly unattached. And as
              a result of this non-identification and non-attachment, discursive
              thoughts lessen -- thoughts arise naturally for practical matters, but
              when its purpose is met they just disappear on its own accord without a
              trace. All appearances and thoughts just come up spontaneously by
              themselves, and then go by themselves, and you are not identified with
              them. They do not affect you as presence-awareness. But this is not the
              same as having no thoughts (as due to practical reasons we do require
              thoughts to function in our daily living). All appearances,
              experiences, and thoughts, are appearances of awareness and cannot be
              separated from awareness. They all occur in your awareness and not
              outside of it, doesn't it? As the ancient Tibetan scriptures say,
              Everything -- the whole universe -- is encompassed in this single
              nature of mind! Awareness is all-encompassing and all-pervading.
              Awareness is all there is.<br> <br> While abiding in awareness there is no identification with the
              thoughts: you see that you are not the thoughts nor the thinker of the
              thoughts, nor the controller of feelings and bodily actions --
              thoughts, feelings etc show up spontaneously by themselves and pass
              away by themselves in the space of awareness. There is no thinker or
              doer involved. Everything is just a spontaneous appearance in vast
              space-like awareness. They are all the magical display of awareness.
              But there is no identifying of certain objects with a personal self, as
              'me' or 'mine'. Because there is no more investing of
              self-identification in the appearances, there is no grasping on
              whatever happens, yet there is an ever-present vivid clarity which
              knows.<br> <br> Also one note... when doubts arise 'Am I practising correctly?' or 'Is
              this awareness?' or 'Am I experiencing awareness?' or whatever the
              thought might be -- just bring your attention to WHOM does the thought
              occur? To have that thought, you must be aware of it. That SEEING or
              AWARENESS of that thought is IT. It is undeniable, undoubtable -- and
              thus have absolute confidence in it. Don't look for something special.
              It is very simple, very ordinary, we just overlook it. 'Ordinary Mind
              is Tao' as the saying goes.</p>

              <p>Lastly
              regarding the practise of chanting, if you understand what I wrote
              above and recognised this fundamental awareness in direct experience,
              then you will see that there is no contradictions at all. You can
              practise this at any moment, not just in sitting meditation, but also
              in chanting, doing your work, doing your chores, walking, talking with
              others, even thinking, basically: anything. (Awareness is ALWAYS
              accessible wherever you are. All activities are just the manifestation
              of Buddha-Nature, so there is no need to retreat into a mountain to
              practise. Awareness does not cancel out our mundane daily activities,
              but is the basis for these activities to occur -- without awareness how
              can we act?) There is also Zen Masters who advise the practise of 'Who
              is chanting the Buddha name?' I also know of people who awoke to their
              pristine awareness while doing chanting. (though awakening does not
              need to occur in any particular settings: some are awaken after hearing
              a sound, or seeing something, it can be anywhere, any occasion)
              Awakening to our true nature as awareness can occur at any time -- when
              chanting, we can be be awake to and abide in the awareness of that
              chanting. As said earlier: we can practise being awareness at all time
              and we should. But chanting helps to calm the mind so that we have
              loosened our identification with our thoughts enough to notice and
              abide firmly in our true nature as awareness, rather than being lost in
              following those discursive thoughts. This is important. Personally I
              prefer to do sitting meditation, but sometimes I do chant as well.</p>

              <p>The mind itself has no color, shape, or form, but it has energy. It
              is our duty to let go of and abandon the conditioned, proliferating
              mind. But the mind of present knowing, that which concentrates on
              Buddha, listens to Dhamma and reflects on its meaning, having been
              clearly observed, that true mind should be developed. In this case to
              "develop" means to give care and attention to establishing it in peace.
              Peace comes by countering the out-going stream of mentality and

              <p>The normal unrestrained mind is absorbed by the
              thought-consciousness seeking distraction. Go against the stream by
              looking at the source of mental activity. It originates from this
              knowing. The source of the mind lies within us. However this knowing is
              nothing substantial. It has no color, form or shape in the way that
              material objects do. It is a formless element. To speak in terms of the
              five aggregates there is:</p>
              <div class="gloss">
              <ul>
              <li><em>rupa</em> — these bodies of ours;</li>
              <li><em>vedana</em> — the experience of objects as pleasant or unpleasant, comfortable or uncomfortable;</li>
              <li><em>sañña</em> — discrimination based on memory — e.g., that this is a human being and this is an animal; this is red, this is black;</li>
              <li><em>sankhara</em> — conditioning mental activity;</li>
              <li><em>viññana</em> — cognition conditioned by mental activity.</li>
              </ul>
              </div>
              <p>The four formless aggregates of <em>vedana,</em> <em>sañña,</em> <em>sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana</em> arise within the knowing. The Buddha taught that during sitting and
              walking meditation we should make the knowing converge on itself, not
              allowing it to go outwards. Thoughts of good and bad are all exterior
              matters and are endless. In thinking and cognizing we must know the
              thinker, know the knower. All movement proceeds from this present
              knowing. That being the case, don't be deceived by these expressions of
              mind. They are merely shadows, flitting off into the past and future,
              thinking about and elaborating on the things that we like and the
              things that we don't. This proliferation is what conditions the mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is it that knows the true mind and what is it that knows the
              conditioned mind? It is just this one single knowing, the same thing
              that hears the sound of the discourse and meditates on "Buddho." As
              there is just this single knowing, muster your energies and vow to
              yourself "I will not indulge the thinking mind. I will gather the mind
              into itself." Not allowing the mind to wander means that it stays with
              Buddho. All you have to do then is to maintain Buddho.</p>

Don’t let yourselves run outside. Come<br> back. Look within and find yourself. “Return the hearing and<br> listen to the self nature / Till the nature reaches the supreme<br> way. Your nature can accomplish the unsurpassed path. That is<br> what perfect penetration really means.” Why does he select the<br> organ of the ear? It is the easiest to cultivate successfully. I believe<br> that some of you already know how to develop this skill, while<br> others do not. What does it mean to return the hearing to hear the<br> self-nature? It is the skill used in investigating Ch’an. When you<br> investigate Ch’an, you don’t want to expend all your energy on<br> seeking outside. You want to turn the light around and shine it<br> within. Then you ask yourself, “Who is mindful of the Buddha?”<br> “Who?” You want to put the “Who?” in your heart and then listen<br> with your ears. Pursue “Who?” Do this nonstop. Don’t let your skill<br> become dispersed. You investigate this topic in everything you do.<br> <br> Walking, standing, sitting, reclining,<br> don’t be apart from this.<br> If you depart from this,<br> you’ve made a mistake.<br> <br> What is “this?” It is the question, “Who is mindful of the Buddha?”<br> You don’t have to ask out loud; ask in your heart and listen with<br> your ears. Listen within, not outside. After you have listened<br> within, your heart and your hearing-nature will eventually merge<br> into one. And then in some unexpected way, at some unexpected<br> moment, you will suddenly open enlightenment. But you definitely<br> must bring your mind and nature together. Don’t let them scatter in<br> all directions. Don’t let them get dissipated outside. Collect them<br> within. Return the hearing and listen to your own nature.<br> Eventually and naturally your skill will develop. Investigating a<br> Ch’an topic and returning the hearing to listen to the self-nature are<br> the same. And now everyone knows that using the organ of the ear<br> in cultivation is the easiest method. So put your energy there and<br> cultivate this Dharma-door.<br> <br> ................</p>

              <p>Ven Shen Kai:</p>
              <p><br> Guan Shi Yin Bodhisattva practises "Ear Faculty Complete/Rounded
                                                  Penetration" dharma door, this is because he practises till
                                                  "turning perceiving inwards to perceive self-nature". What is
                                                  "turning perceiving inwards to perceive self-nature"? That is not
                                                  like ordinary people who listens to sounds outside, then follow the
                                                  sound away. In contrast, his hearing faculty listens to
                                                  self-nature, therefore he could succeed when practising this dharma
                                                  door, irregardless of where sentient beings reside in the universe,
                                                  suffering from whatsoever disasters, only if you chant his name, he
                                                  will hear it. Actually, the dharma door he practises is very
                                                  simple, everyone can practise it, let us all now discuss how to
                                                  practise dharma, let everyone learn Guan Yin Bodhisattva, I will
                                                  state an example.<br> <br> Once, there is a small child who is eating rice, suddenly he puts
                                                  down his chopsticks and said "Shi Fu! Shi Fu! I heard it!" I asked,
                                                  "What did you hear?" He said "I heard the sound of no sound." May I
                                                  ask, have all of you heard of the sound of no sound? Shen Kai is
                                                  talking here, you all can hear, hear what? Heard Shen Kai talking.
                                                  Now Shen Kai stops talking, does everyone hear it? Three minutes
                                                  later everyone answer this question. Ok! Three minutes passed, does
                                                  everyone hear it? If you hear, raise your hands. Good! Please say,
                                                  (one of the audience said: at this place other than Fa Shi's voice,
                                                  there are no other voices.) Wrong! Wrong! When Fa Shi is talking,
                                                  you hear the voice of Fa Shi speaking the dharma. When Fa Shi is
                                                  not speaking, you hear the sound of "no speaking dharma". This is
                                                  called awareness-nature, awareness-nature does not change, when
                                                  talking about 'ear faculty complete/rounded penetration' dharma
                                                  door, that is called 'perceiving nature not changing', other than
                                                  perceiving external sounds, you perceive your self-nature, that is
                                                  the sound of no sound. You only need to go back, everyday with your
                                                  ear faculty attend to self-nature and not move, 'turning inwards
                                                  and perceive self-nature', if you practise this way, one day you
                                                  will succeed. If everyone practises 'ear faculty complete/rounded
                                                  penetration', everyone will be able to be Guan Yin
                                                  Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>................<br> <br> Ven Hsu Yun ( <a href="http://hsuyun.budismo.net/en/dharma/chan_sessions2.html">http://hsuyun.budismo.net/en/dharma/chan_sessions2.html</a> ):<br> <br> <br> TAKING CARE OF A HUA T'0U AND TURNING INWARD THE HEARING TO HEAR THE SELF-NATURE<br> <br> Someone may ask: 'How can Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva's "method of
                              turning inward the hearing to hear the self-nature" be regarded as
                              Ch'an training?' I have just talked about looking into the hua t'ou; it
                              means that you should unremittingly and one-pointedly turn the light
                              inwards on 'that which is not born and does not die' which is the hua
                              t'ou. To turn inwards one's hearing to hear the self-nature means also
                              that you should unremittingly and one-pointedly turn inwards your
                              (faculty of) hearing to hear the self-nature. 'To turn inwards' is 'to
                              turn back'. 'That which is not born and does not die' is nothing but
                              the self-nature. When hearing and looking follow sound and form in the
                              worldly stream, hearing does not go beyond sound and looking does not
                              go beyond form (appearance), with the obvious differentiation. However,
                              when going against the mundane stream, the meditation is turned inwards
                              to contemplate the self-nature. When 'hearing' and 'looking' are no
                              longer in pursuit of sound and appearance, they become fundamentally
                              pure and enlightening and do not differ from each other. We should know
                              that what we call 'looking into the hua t'ou' and 'turning inwards the
                              hearing to hear the self-nature' cannot be effected by means of the eye
                              to look or the ear to hear. If eye and ear are so used, there will be
                              pursuit after sound and form with the result that one will be turned by
                              things (i.e. externals); this is called 'surrender to the (mundane)
                              stream'.[26] If there is singleness of thought abiding in that 'which
                              is not born and does not die', without pursuing sound and form, this is
                              'going against the stream'; this is called 'looking into the hua t'ou'
                              or 'turning inwards the hearing to hear the self-nature'.</p>

              <p>We must never, never study spirituality as if it is a 'chim'
                                                  subject like a difficult subject we are learning in school.</p>
              <p>Because if we are just trying to figure it out using the mind or
                                                  intellect, then we are going the wrong directions. Words can only
                                                  help as pointers for us to have an 'intuitive feel' of what it is
                                                  talking about. Then the rest is practising, abiding in the
                                                  recognition in our daily lives.</p>
              <p>Intellect is the wrong tool for this endeavor. It can never
                                                  grasp spirituality. Intellect is devoid of the dynamic presence and
                                                  livingness that only intuitive awareness can touch. Truth (what is
                                                  always present) is obvious by itself, requiring no other tool to
                                                  figure it out. As the 3rd Zen Patriarch said, don't seek truth,
                                                  just cease to cherish opinions. Capturing spiritual understanding
                                                  through concepts and ideas into dead images is of no use here. But
                                                  when we take the focus off of the mind, then perhaps the
                                                  all-pervading field of awareness might just reveal itself on its
                                                  own accord.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> 6th Zen Patriarch Hui Neng:</p>
              <p>"What I can tell you is not secret. If you <em>turn</em> your
                                                  <em>awareness</em> inwardly and you will find what is secret within
                                                  you."</p>
              <p>Leo Hartong:</p>
              <p><em>"In relation to Pure Awareness, the best the intellect can
                                                  do is to recognize its own modus operandi. In other words, to get
                                                  it, we must get why we cannot get it. If, at this point, the
                                                  intellectual mind does not see its natural limitations, it may jump
                                                  to a wrong conclusion like, ‘Oh if I can’t get it, it must be
                                                  complicated.’ No doubt about it, trying to capture the non-dual in
                                                  the dualistic medium of language can get very complicated; but in
                                                  essence, it is not complicated at all, just as pointing out the
                                                  color blue to a child is simple, but explaining it to a professor

              <p><em><br> The mind not only appears in Awareness, it tends to confuse its own
                                                  intellectual activity with Awareness. In fact, Awareness is not a
                                                  product of the mind, but the mind is a product of Awareness – the

                                                  mind and its activity. Like the screen on which we watch a movie,
                                                  this background is generally ignored in favor of the impermanent
                                                  activity that appears on or against it. Zoom out, and Awareness and

              <p>In short: only awareness can know itself (that is why it is called "self-knowing awareness"), transient and changing thoughts disguising as "understanding" merely pops in and out of awareness, but awareness is completely unaffected by the comings and goings of ideas, concepts and thoughts. It is an unmoving presence-awareness.</p>
              <p>Thought can never understand something greater than itself, something that is intimate, evident, obvious, and self-authenticating. 1000 descriptions of the moon is still not the same as the direct seeing of the moon. This is not a perfect analogy because awareness is not a "thing" to be seen yet it can be recognised in direct experience. The eye cannot see itself, the knife cannot cut itself. Yet it sees, it knows.</p>

              <p>Advise from Dakpo Tashi Namgyal, 14th century Mahamudra master:</p>
              <p>"The meaning in a nutshell is this: allow your mind to be as it naturally is, and let thoughts dissolve in themselves. This is your innate mind, which is an unidentifiable, self-knowing, natural awareness. Remain one-pointedly in its continuity and do not get distracted.</p>
              <p>During the daily activities between breaks as well, try to keep this kind of mindfulness undistractedly as much as you can."</p>
