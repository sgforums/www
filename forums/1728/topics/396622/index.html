              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>The object of Ch'an training is to realize 
                            the mind for the perception of  self- nature, that is to wipe out 
                      the 
                            impurities which soil the mind so that the fundamental face of 
                      self-nature 
                            can really be perceived. Impurities are our false thinking and 
                      clinging 
                            (to things as real). Self-nature is the meritorious characteristic
                       of the 
                            Tathagata wisdom which is the same in both Buddhas and living 
                      beings. If 
                            one's false thinking and grasping are cast aside, one will bear 
                      witness to 
                            the meritorious characteristic of one's Tathagata wisdom and will 
                      become a 
                            Buddha, otherwise one will remain a living being. For since 
                      countless 
                            eons, our own delusion has immersed us in the (sea of) birth and 
                      death. 
                            Since our defilement has (already) lasted so long, we are unable 
                      instantly 
                            to free ourselves from false thinking in order to perceive our 
                            self-nature. This is why we must undergo Ch'an training. The 
                      prerequisite 
                            of this training is the eradication of false thinking. As to how 
                      to wipe 
                            it out, we have already many sayings of Shakyamuni Buddha and 
                      nothing is 
                            simpler than the word 'Halt' in His saying: 'If it halts, it is 
                            Enlightenment (Bodhi).
                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#1"> [1]</a> </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">    <strong>The Ch'an sect from its introduction 
                      by Bodhidharma 
                            after his arrival in the East until after the passing of the Sixth
                       
                            Patriarch, spread widely all over the country and enjoyed great 
                            prosperity, unknown before and after that period. However, the 
                      most 
                            important thing taught by Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch was 
                      only 
                            this: 'Expel all concurrent causes; do not give<sub> </sub>rise to
                       a 
                            single thought.' To expel all concurrent causes is to lay them 
                      down.
                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#2"> [2]</a>  Therefore, these two sentences: 'Expel all concurrent 
                            causes. Do not give rise to a single thought', are the 
                      prerequisites of 
                            Ch'an training. If these two sentences are not put into actual 
                      practice, 
                            not only will the training be ineffective, but also it will be 
                      impossible 
                            to start it, for in the midst of causes which rise and fall, 
                      thought after 
                            thought, how can you talk about Ch'an training? </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>    Now we know that (the sentences): 
                      'Expel all 
                            concurrent causes. Do not give rise to a single thought' are the 
                            prerequisites of Ch'an training; how can we fulfill these 
                      prerequisites? 
                            Those of high spirituality are able to halt for ever the arising 
                      of a 
                            single thought until they reach (the state of) birthlessness and 
                      will 
                            thereby instantaneously realize enlightenment (Bodhi) without any 
                      more 
                            ado. Those of lower spirituality will deduce the underlying 
                      principle
                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#3"> [3]</a> from facts

                            fundamentally pure and clean and that distress (klesha)
                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#5"> [5]</a>  and enlightenment as well as birth, death and Nirvana 
                            are all empty names having no connection whatever with 
                      self-nature; that 
                            phenomena are like a dream, an illusion, a bubble and a shadow; 
                      and that 
                            the four basic elements constituting the physical body, as well as
                       
                            mountains, rivers and the great earth which are within 
                      self-nature, are 
                            just like bubbles in the sea. These phenomena rise and fall 
                      following one 
                            another in succession without interfering with the essence (of 
                            self-nature). Therefore, one should not follow illusion in its 
                      creation, 
                            stay, change and annihilation and give rise to feelings of joy, 
                      sadness, 
                            attachment and rejection. One should lay down everything with 
                      which one's 
                            body is burdened, thus becoming exactly like a dead man. The 
                      outcome will 
                            be that sense-organs, sense-data and consciousness will vanish and
                       that 
                            concupiscence, anger, stupidity and love will be eliminated. When 
                      all our 
                            feelings of joy and sadness, of the cold of hunger and the warmth 
                      of one's 
                            fill, of honor and dishonor, of birth and death, of happiness and 
                      misery, 
                            of blessing and calamity, of praise and censure, of gain and loss,
                       of 
                            safety and danger, and of handicap and help, are all cast aside, 
                      this is 
                            the true laying down (of everything). To lay down a thing is to 
                      lay down 
                            everything for ever, and this is called the laying down of all 
                      concurrent 
                            causes. When all concurrent causes have been laid down, false 
                      thinking 
                            will vanish with the non-arising of differentiation and the 
                      elimination of 
                            all attachments. When one reaches this state of the non-arising of
                       a 
                            single thought, the brightness of self-nature will appear in full.<a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#6">[6]</a> Then only can the prerequisites of Ch'an training be entirely 
                            fulfilled. Further efforts in the true training and real 
                      introspection 
                            will be required if one wishes to be qualified for realizing the 
                      mind for 
                            the perception of self-nature. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>    Recently, Ch'an Buddhists often came 
                      to inquire 
                            (about all this). As to the Dharma, fundamentally there is no such
                       thing, 
                            because as soon as it is expressed in words, the meaning will not 
                      be true. 
                            Just see clearly that mind is Buddha and there will be no more 
                      ado. This 
                            is self-evident and all talks of practice and realization are the 
                      demon's 
                            words. Bodhidharma, who came to the East to "directly point at 
                      man's mind 
                            for the perception of self-nature leading to the attainment of 
                            Buddhahood", clearly indicated that all living beings on earth 
                      were 
                            Buddhas. The outright cognizance of this pure and clean 
                      self-nature 
                            together with complete harmony with it, without contamination from
                       
                            attachment (to anything)
                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#7"> [7]</a> and without the least mental differentiation, while 
                      walking, 
                            standing, sitting and lying by day or night
                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#8"> [8]</a> is nothing but the self-evident Buddha nature. It does not
                       
                            require any application of mind or use of effort. Moreover, there 
                      is no 
                            place for either action or deed, and no use for words, speech and 
                      thought. 
                            For this reason, it is said that the attainment of Buddhahood is 
                      the most 
                            free and easy thing which relies only on oneself and does not 
                      depend on 
                            others. If all living beings on this earth are not willing to pass
                       long 
                            eons through the successive four kinds of birth

                            and if they wish to attain Buddhahood with the accompanying 
                      enjoyment of 
                            true eternity, true bliss, true personality and true purity

                      Buddha 
                            and Patriarchs, and lay down all (attachments) without thinking of
                       either 
                            good or evil; all of them will certainly be able to become Buddhas
                       on the 
                            spot. All Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Patriarchs of past generations
                       did not 
                            take the vow of liberating all living beings without warrant for 
                      so doing; 
                            they did not take vain vows and did not tell a deliberate lie. </strong> </span></p>

                      not 
                            contain an atom of falsehood and deception. However, all living 
                      beings on 
                            this earth have been, for countless eons, deluded and sunk in the 
                      bitter 
                            ocean of birth and death, rising and falling in their endless 
                            transmigrations. Being deluded, confused and upset, they turn 
                      their back 
                            on enlightenment and unite with impurities. They are just like 
                      real gold 
                            thrown into a manure pit where it not only falls into disuse but 
                      is also 
                            deplorably soiled. Because of His great mercy, the Buddha was 
                      compelled to 
                            set up 84,000

                            of different natural capacities could use them to cure the 84,000 
                      ailments 
                            caused by their habitual concupiscence, anger, stupidity and love.
                       In the 
                            same way you are taught to use a shovel, brush, water and cloth to
                       wash, 
                            brush, polish and scrub the dirty piece of gold. Therefore, the 
                      Dharma 
                            doors expounded by the Buddha are all excellent Dharmas which 
                      enable one 
                            to see through birth and death and to attain Buddhahood, the only 
                      question 
                            being the adaptability or otherwise of individual potentialities. 
                      These 
                            Dharma doors should not be divided arbitrarily into superior or 
                      inferior 
                            ones. Those introduced into China are: the Ch'an Sect (Tsung), the
                       
                            Discipline School (Lu Tsung), the Teaching School (Chiao Tsung), 
                      the Pure 
                            Land School (Chin Tsung), and the Yoga School (Mi Tsung). Of these
                       five 
                            Dharma doors, it is up to each man to choose the one which is 
                      suitable to 
                            his natural character and inclination, and he will surely reach 
                      his goal 
                            if he only sticks to it long enough without change of mind and 
                      deeply 
                            penetrates it. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>    Our sect advocates the Ch'an 
                      training. This training 
                            centers on 'realization of mind (and) perception of self-nature', 
                      that is 
                            an exhaustive investigation into one's fundamental face. The 
                      Dharma door 
                            which consists in the 'clear awakening to the self-mind and 
                      through 
                            perception of the fundamental nature' has been handed down ever 
                      since the 
                            Buddha held up a flower until after Bodhidharma's coming to the 
                      East, with 
                            frequent changes in the method of practice. Up to the T'ang (935) 
                      and Sung 
                            (1278) dynasties, most adherents of the Ch'an sect became 
                      enlightened 
                            after hearing a word or sentence. The transmission from master to 
                      disciple 
                            did not exceed the sealing of mind by mind, and there was no fixed
                       Dharma 
                            (taught). In their questions and answers (the role played by a 
                      master) was 
                            only to untie the bonds (fettering his disciple)

                      giving of 
                            an appropriate medicine for each particular ailment. In and after 
                      the Sung 
                            dynasty, human potentialities became duller, and the instructions 
                      given by 
                            the masters were not carried out by their disciples. For instance,
                       when 
                            they were taught to 'lay down everything' and 'not to think of 
                      either good 
                            or evil', practitioners could not lay down anything and could not 
                      stop 
                            thinking of either good or evil. Under these circumstances, the 
                      ancestors 
                            and masters were compelled to devise a 'poison-against-poison' 
                      method by 
                            teaching their followers to inquire into a kung an

                            <a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/xuyun/xuyun1.html#16"> [16]</a> Their disciples were even taught to hold a meaningless 
                      hua 
                            t'ou as firmly as possible (in their minds), without loosening 
                      their grip 
                            even for the shortest possible moment, in the same way as a rat 
                      will 
                            (stubbornly) bite the board of a coffin at a fixed spot until it 
                      has made 
                            a hole. The aim of this method was to use a single thought to 
                      oppose and 
                            arrest myriad thoughts because the masters had no alternative. It 
                      was like 
                            an operation which became imperative when poison had been 
                      introduced into 
                            the body. There were many koans (devised by the ancients but) 
                      later only 
                            hua t'ous were taught such as: 'Who is dragging this corpse here?

                            In the present day, the masters use the hua t'ou: 'Who is the 
                      repeater of 
                            Buddha's name?' </strong> </span></p>

                      meaning which is 
                            very ordinary and has nothing peculiar about it if you look into 
                      him 'Who 
                            is reciting a sutra?', 'Who is holding a mantra?', 'Who is 
                      worshipping 
                            Buddha?', 'Who is taking a meal?', 'Who is wearing a robe?', 'Who 
                      is 
                            walking on the road?', or 'Who is sleeping?', the reply to 'Who?' 
                      will 
                            invariably be the same: 'It is Mind.' Word arises from Mind and 
                      Mind is 
                            head of (i.e. ante-)Word. Thought arises from Mind and Mind is 
                      head of 
                            Thought. Myriad things come from Mind and Mind is head of myriad 
                      things. 
                            In reality, a hua t'ou is the head of a thought (i.e. 
                      ante-thought). The 
                            head of thought is nothing but Mind. To make it plain, before a 
                      thought 
                            arises, it is a hua t'ou. From the above, we know that to look 
                      into a hua 
                            t'ou is to look into the Mind. The fundamental face before one's 
                      birth is 
                            Mind. To look into one's fundamental face before one's birth is to
                       look 
                            into one's mind. Self-nature is Mind (and) to 'turn inwards the 
                      hearing to 
                            hear the self-nature' is to 'turn inward one's contemplation to 
                            contemplate the self-mind'. </span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">    The sentence: 'The perfect shining on
                       the pure 
                            Awareness' means this: 'the pure awareness' is mind and 'to shine 
                      on' is 
                            to look into. Mind is Buddha and to repeat the Buddha's (name) is 
                      to 
                            contemplate the Buddha. To contemplate Buddha is to contemplate 
                      mind. 
                            Therefore, to 'look into a hua t'ou' or 'to look into him who 
                      repeats the

                            the average. What a pity if they labor to no purpose! (For this 
                      reason) an 
                            ancient master said: 'It is better to remain unenlightened for a

                       truth is easy 
                            and is (also) difficult. For example, when we turn on the electric
                       light, 
                            if we know how, in a finger-snap there will be light and the

                      not know 
                            how to turn on the light, the electric wires will be interfered 
                      with and 
                            the lamp will be damaged, resulting in an increase of passions and
                       
                            ignorance. There are also some people who, while undergoing Ch'an 
                      training 
                            and looking into the hua t'ou, get entangled with demons and

                            both difficult and easy to beginners as well as to old hands. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">    Where does its difficulty lie for a

                            Although his body and mind are mature for it, he is still confused
                       about 
                            the method of undergoing it, and since his practice is

                            will either become impatient or spend his time in dozing with this
                       result: 
                            'A beginner's training in the first year, an old hand's training

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>    Where does its easiness lie for a 
                      beginner? It only 
                            requires a believing, a long enduring and a mindless mind. A 
                      believing 
                            mind is, firstly, belief that this mind of ours is fundamentally 
                      Buddha, 
                            not differing from all Buddhas and all living beings of the three 
                      times in 
                            the ten directions of space, and secondly, belief that all Dharmas
                       
                            expounded by Shakyamuni Buddha can enable us to put an end to 
                      birth and 
                            death and to attain Buddhahood. A long enduring mind consists in 
                      the 
                            choice of a method to be put into continuous practice in the 
                      present 
                            lifetime, in the next life, and in the life after next. The Ch'an 
                      training 
                            should be continued in this manner; the repetition of the Buddha's
                       name 
                            should be continued in this manner; the holding of a mantra 
                      (mystic 
                            incantation) should be continued in this manner and the study of 
                      sutras, 
                            which consists in putting into practice the teaching heard (i.e. 
                      learned 
                            from the Scriptures), should be continued in this manner. The 
                      practice of 
                            any Dharma door (to enlightenment) must be based on Sila

                            is no reason why it will not be successful. The old master Kuei

                       in 
                            three successive lives can surely expect to attain the 
                      Buddha-stage.' The

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">    After a beginner has acquired these

                            mind, if he under-goes the Ch'an training and looks into, for 
                      instance, 
                            the hua t'ou: 'Who is the repeater of Buddha's name?' he should 
                      silently 
                            repeat a few times: 'Amitabha Buddha' and then look into him who 
                      thinks of 
                            the Buddha and where this thought arises. He should know that this
                       thought 
                            does not arise either from his mouth or body. If it arises from 
                      either his 
                            mouth or body, why when he dies, cannot his body and mouth, which 
                      still 
                            exist, give rise to this thought? Therefore, he knows that this 
                      thought 
                            arises from his mind. Now he should watch (and locate) where his 
                      mind 
                            gives rise to this thought and keep on looking into it, like a cat
                       ready 
                            to pounce on a mouse, with his exclusive attention concentrated 
                      upon it, 
                            free from a second thought. However, its sharpness and dullness 
                      should be 
                            in equal proportions. It should never be too sharp for that 
                      sharpness may 
                            cause illness. if the training is undergone in this manner, in 
                      every 
                            state, while walking, standing, sitting and lying, it will be 
                      effective as 
                            time goes on, and when cause comes to fruition, like a ripe melon

                      moment when 
                            the practitioner will be like one who drinks water and who alone

                            himself and experiences a great happiness similar to that when

                       lie for an old 
                            hand? By old hand is meant one who has called on learned masters 
                      for 
                            instruction and has undergone the training for many years during 
                      which his 
                            body and mind were mature for it and he was clear about the method
                       which 
                            he could practice comfortably without experiencing any handicap. 
                      The 
                            difficulty met by a monk<sup> </sup>who is an old hand lies in 
                      this 
                            feeling of comfort and clearness in which he stops and stays. 
                      Thus, 
                            because of his stay in this illusion-city, he does not reach the 
                      place of 
                            precious things (i.e. the perfect Nirvana). He is fit only for 
                      stillness 
                            but is unfit for disturbance and his training is, therefore, not 
                            completely effective for really full use. In the worst case, the 
                            practitioner will, when coming into contact with his surroundings,
                       give 
                            rise to feelings of like and dislike and of acceptance and 
                      rejection with 
                            the result that his false thinking, both coarse and fine, will 
                      remain as 
                            firm as before. His training will be likened to the soaking of a 
                      stone in 
                            water and will become ineffective. As time goes on, weariness and 
                      laziness 
                            will slip into his training which will become fruitless in the 
                      end. When 
                            such a monk is aware of this, he should immediately give rise to 
                      the hua 
                            t'ou again and rouse his spirits to take a step forward from the

                            hundred-foot pole (he has reached)

                            will walk freely everywhere, meeting face to face (lit. substance

                            false thinking and do not make any effort to control it. You have 
                      only to 
                            be aware of it but should not cling to it, follow it or push it 
                      away. It 
                            will suffice to discontinue your thinking and it will leave you 
                      alone. 
                            Hence, the saying: 'The rise of falsehood should be immediately 
                      cognized, 
                            and once cognized, it will quit.' </strong> </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">    However, in his training, if the 
                      practitioner can 
                            turn this false thinking to his own advantage, he will look into 
                      where it 
                            arises and will notice that it has no independent nature of its 
                      own. At 
                            once, he will realize the non-existence of this very thinking and 
                      will 
                            recover his fundamental mindless nature, followed immediately by 
                      the 
                            manifestation of his pure self-natured Dharmakaya Buddha which 
                      will appear 
                            on the spot. </span> </strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>    In reality, the real and the false 
                      are the same (in 
                            nature); the living and the Buddhas are not a dualism; and 
                      birth-death and 
                            Nirvana as well as enlightenment (Bodhi) and distress (klesa) all 
                      belong

                       should 
                            not be either liked or disliked and should not be either grasped 
                      or 
                            rejected. This mind is pure and clean and fundamentally is Buddha.
                       Not a 
                            single Dharma is required (in the quest of enlightenment). Why so

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[2] In Ch'an terminology, "to lay down 
                      causes or thoughts" is to lay 
                            down the heavy load of   causes or thoughts to free the mind

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[6] This is the state described in Han 
                      Shan's "Song of the 
                            Board-bearer". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[7] Even attachment to the self-nature is 
                      also an impurity which should 
                            be cast aside. </span></p>

                      one 
                            remains under delusion, it will be immaterial to add 10, 100, or

                            zeros at the end of the number. However, when one attains

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[15] Kung an, or koan in Japanese = A

                            public laws, regulations; case-law. Problems set by Ch'an masters 
                      upon 
                            which thought is concentrated as a means to attain inner unity and
                       
                            illumination. The meaning of a kung an is irrevocable and kung an 
                      is as 
                            valid as the Law. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[16] Hua t'ou = ante-word, or ante-thought, 
                      i.e. the mind before it is 
                            stirred by a thought. It is the mind in its undisturbed condition.
                       The 
                            holding of a hua t'ou in the mind is the looking into the 
                      self-mind until 
                            its realization. It is also the turning inward of the faculty of 
                      hearing 
                            to hear the self-nature, for the disentanglement of mind (subject)
                       from 
                            external objects. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[17] i.e. who is dragging here this physical
                       body of yours? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[18] The essence of the mind is still and 
                      its function is shining. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[19] The 5 skandhas: form, feeling,

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[20] Kao Feng was the teacher of Chung Feng 
                      whose 'Sayings of Chung 
                            Feng' (Chung Feng Kuang Lu) were read by Han Shan before the 
                      latter began 
                            his Ch'an training. (See Han Shan's Autobiography.) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[21] Chang: a measure of ten Chinese feet. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[22] when the sentence 'who repeats the 
                      Buddha's name?' is merely 
                            repeated by a practitioner who only grasps its meaning, he thinks 
                      of the 
                            'tail' of the hua t'ou, instead of its head or ante-word, that is 
                      the 
                            mind. Thus he wrongly applies his mind to 'tall' instead of 
                      'head'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[23] The master means that these people fail
                       because they set their 
                            discriminating minds on grasping the meaning of these sentences, 
                      whereas 
                            in the training, their minds should first be disentangled from all
                       
                            discriminations. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[24] If an evil thought is allowed to slip 
                      into the concentration of 
                            mind while holding a hua t'ou, this thought will replace the hua 
                      t'ou and 
                            may grow out of proportion and become difficult to subdue. If it 
                      be a 
                            strong desire which cannot be satisfied, the resultant frustration
                       may 
                            cause insanity. One's breath should never be interfered with, and 
                            concentration of mind should never be on the chest as it may 
                      affect the 
                            lungs and cause the vomiting of blood. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[25] View of dualism which should be wiped 
                      out. </span></p>

                      discipline, rule, morality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[27] Master Kuei Shan (Wei Shan) and his 
                      disciple Yang Shan were 
                            founders of the Kuei Yang (Wei Yang) Sect (Ikyo in Japanese), one 
                      of the 
                            five Ch'an Sects in China. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[28] i.e. free from all attachments, which 
                      are likened to a burden 
                            which one should lay down. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[29] This state of stillness is fully 
                      described in Han Shan's 'Song of 
                            the Board-bearer' (see Han Shan's Autobiography) and in 
                      Avalokiteshvara 
                            Bodhisattva's 'Complete Enlightenment' when he said: 'Both the 
                      hearing and 
                            its object came to an end but I did not stay where they ended.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[30] Mind-nature: immutable mind-body, the 
                      existing fundamental pure

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[31] Mean: between the two extremes. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">[32] Ts'an (Can): to inquire, investigate, 
                      look into. Usually at the 
                            end of a meeting, a master mutters this word to urge his disciples
                       to 
                            inquire into or ponder over the real meaning. </span></p>
