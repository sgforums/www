This information is not to cultivate<br>&gt; fear, but to help us<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to prepare.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rinpoche said last night that we need to let as<br>&gt; many people as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible know about the practices they can do to<br>&gt; help reduce the<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; effects of the earthquake, even if they aren't<br>&gt; Buddhist, because<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; everyone does not want to suffer.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Rinpoche also said that its better to do<br>&gt; everything as soon as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; possible and to cultivate as many people as<br>&gt; possible to participate<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; because the earthquake could be earlier and would<br>&gt; be very<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; unfortunate if we didn't do these things in time.<br>&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Consequently, we have organised a full day of<br>&gt; practice at Land of<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; Medicine Buddha on Sunday, January 16. This day<br>&gt; will include<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; practices to help minimise the effect of the<br>&gt; earthquake, as well as<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; prayers for World Peace and for the victims of<br>&gt; Tsunami. Please try<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; to bring as many friends along as possible to<br>&gt; participate. You are<br>&gt; &gt;&gt; welcome to participate in all, or part of the<br>&gt; day.
