              than a year since Saddhaloka Bhikkhupassed away. He is still greatly missed by
              all his students, past and present, and by all his friends. His loss is felt
              particularly keenly by Hong Kong’s Vietnamese community, whom he dedicated many
              years of his life to serving. On 23 November 2014, the Vietnamese Buddhist
              community held a memorial ceremony for him at the eponymous Saddhaloka Temple
              on Hong Kong’s Tsing Yi Island. They have also compiled a bilingual (Vietnamese
              and English) book in memory of him, full of photographs and moving
              recollections.</span></p>

              often known simply as “Venerable,” lived in Hong Kong for decades, and even
              many who knew little or nothing about him will remember the striking sight of a
              tall foreigner in saffron robes striding purposefully through the streets of
              Sheung Wan, Central, or Yuen Long. He was born in Munich in 1938 and christened
              HeinrichKnote. When he was two years old his mother died, and he lived with his
              father and paternal grandmother. At the age of 18 he resolved to devote his
              life to the Buddha-Dharma, despite the strong disapproval of his Christian
              family.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              was ordained Samanera SaddhalokabyVenerable Saddhatissa at the Sri Lankan
              vihara in London. The newly ordained Samanera stayed on in the UK for several
              years<strong>,</strong> continuing his studies of the Buddha-Dharma and studying Chinese,
              first with Archie Barnes (a lecturer in Chinese at Durham University) and then
              on his own.He also spent some time in a small Buddhist community at Johnstone
              House in Dumfries, Scotland, later to become the Kagyu monastery of Samye Ling,
              established by Chögyam Trungpa and Akong Rinpoches. He then went to Thailand,
              where he studied Pali, Sanskrit, and meditation, and in 1967 received full
              bhikkhu ordination, with Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, the influential Thai Buddhist
              reformer and founder of Suan Mokkh, as his preceptor. He also spent time in
              Chinese monasteries in Malaysia, studying Buddhist texts and Chinese medicine.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              came to Hong Kong in 1969, hoping to travel on to monasteries in China to
              continue his studies. However, as at that time the Cultural Revolution was
              raging throughout Mainland China, he was unable to obtain a visa and stayed on
              in Hong Kong. He lived for a time in monasteries on Lantau Island and
              elsewhere, studying with Chinese masters, and then moved to the city, where he
              taught the Buddha-Dharma and treated people with Chinese medicine. </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'> </span></p>

              when large numbers of traditional Chinese books were entering Hong Kong from
              across the border as people tried to save them from the destruction of the
              Cultural Revolution, he built up an extensive library of Buddhist texts,
              Chinese classics, and books on traditional Chinese medicine. Out of these, he
              selected certain texts that were very hard to obtain and either arranged for
              old editions to be reprinted or prepared new editions. The late English bhikkhu
              Venerable Abhinyana who, in his memoirs (<em>Not This, Not That</em>), recalls
              meeting Venerable Saddhaloka in 1983, describes him as “operating a small
              Buddhist printing press, above which he slept in a windowless attic.” Venerable
              also translated texts from Chinese into English himself, including <em>The
              Discourse on the Ten Wholesome Ways of Action </em>(</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Microsoft JhengHei","sans-serif";    color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;' lang="ZH-CN">å��å–„æ¥­é�“ç¶“</span><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>), <em>The Discourse on the Questions of the

              Saddhaloka began visiting the Vietnamese “boat people” in the Hong Kong
              government refugee camps. At that time Christian groups were active in the
              camps, but no members of the Buddhist sangha were visiting them, despite the
              fact that many of the Vietnamese were Buddhists. Venerable Saddhaloka spared no
              effort to help the refugees, getting up at 3 a.m. to make the long journey to
              the camps, bringing, food, drink, medicine, books, and other things. Inmates of
              the camps from that time recall how “Thay Tay Duc” (“The Master from West
              Germany”), as they affectionately called him, came daily to the camps for 16
              years, on rainy days, on cold winter days, and on hot, humid days, his brown
              robe damp with sweat. In those dark days, he not only ministered to their
              material needs but inspired in them hope, and, for many, a renewed faith in the
              Buddha-Dharma. However, unlike some of the other religious groups, he insisted
              that gifts should be shared and everyone helped, irrespective of religious
              affiliation. He also never engaged in proselytizing activities.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>During this period,
              Venerable Saddhaloka often worked closely with the late Pam Baker and the many
              others who assisted her over the years in providing the refugees with legal
              advice. These included Peter Barnes, who recalls how “Dear Monk,” as they knew
              him, would frequently visit their tiny office in Mongkok ferrying letters from
              the Vietnamese, asking for assistance. His impression of Saddhaloka Bhikkhu was
              that of a “true gentleman, with the emphasis on gentle, despite his stern
              exterior.” </span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'>In 1998, when the last
              of the refugee camps finally emptied, Venerable Saddhaloka continued to serve
              the Vietnamese community in Hong Kong. He rented a small temple in Yuen Long
              where the Vietnamese could meet, and he continued his work of teaching the
              Buddha-Dharma, treating people with Chinese medicine, and helping people whenever
              he could. He lived extremely simply and gave away most of what he received.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'> </span></p>

              also taught and led meditation sessions for Westerners and other
              English-speaking residents of Hong Kong. He often said that he followed “the
              teaching of the Buddha,” not Buddh-“ism,” and he recognized no distinctions
              among “yanas.” His ways of teaching were sometimes described as
              “old-fashioned”—a description that in fact seemed to rather please him. He
              expected his students to read sutras and traditional commentaries preferably in
              Chinese or another of the traditional languages of the Dharma, or at least in
              English translations that followed the original texts as closely as possible.
              Sometimes he would himself translate extempore passages of Chinese or Pali. He
              also insisted that students should know a text thoroughly before engaging in
              debate about its content. However, even those of his students who may have gone
              on to align with more “modern” or “secular” forms of Buddhism feel extremely
              grateful for the thorough grounding in the tradition his teaching provided.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 18pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 12.5pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'> </span></p>

              up to his death, Venerable became progressively thinner and weaker. It was
              obvious that he was often in a great deal of pain. However, he bore it with
              great patience and endurance,never complained, and never took painkillers. He
              died in Hong Kong on 9 December 2013. The ceremonies for his funeral on 4 and 5
              January 2014 were attended by hundreds of people.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>

              Saddhaloka Bhikkhu had a broad and deep knowledge of the Buddhist canon, as
              well as of the Chinese classics and Chinese medical texts. However, as his life
              story shows, his engagement with the Buddha-Dharma was far from being mere book
              learning. His life was an example of compassion in action.</span><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #4b4b4b; letter-spacing: .65pt;'></span></p>
