              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Q: If Shakyamuni Buddha’s teachings will only be available for 5000 eons, after that 5000 eons will we be able to meet Tsongkhapa’s teachings maybe in another pure land?</em></p>
              <p><em>Yes, that’s possible. There are other universes, so there are pure lands where there is opportunity. As long as there is the tantric path that Buddha himself actualized, that Lama Tsongkhapa actualized, if it is the correct one, it’s the same. It doesn’t mean you don’t pray to be born in a pure land; you can pray to be born in a pure land. </em></p>
              <p><em>There are some pure lands where you can become enlightened. There are pure lands like Amitabha pure land, where once you are there you are never reborn in a lower realm. But with some other pure lands, it is possible to be born again in a lower realm, when you have finished your karma there; there are different types of pure land. Usually, when I make prayers, even for other sentient beings to be born in pure lands, I pray to be born in a pure land where sentient beings can become enlightened. The words, “where sentient beings can become enlightened” make a difference.</em></p>
              <p><em>Q: Normally those other pure lands are not commonly mentioned – Amitabha pure land is very commonly mentioned.</em></p>
              <p><em>Yes, because Vajrayogini and Heruka are highest tantric deities, so they are only mentioned where people do these deity practices, in Nepal, Tibet, or India. Nowadays, Tibetan monks who have escaped from Tibet and are living in Tibetan monasteries are practicing, and many Tibetan people are living in India, but amongst Indians themselves Buddhism has almost completely degenerated. There are some Theravadin temples. Where highest tantra practice has spread, then the pure lands of Vajrayogini and Heruka are known. But the general ones are Amitabha pure land and Chenrezig pure land. </em></p>
              <p><em>In Lama Tsongkhapa’s collection of teachings there is a prayer to be born in Amitabha pure land; it seems Lama Tsongkhapa emphasized it and it is quite important. One reason why Amitabha pure land is good is because, for example, to be born in Tushita pure land you need to have very pure morality, otherwise it is difficult to be born there, whereas it is very easy for ordinary beings to be born in Amitabha pure land; that is its great advantage. </em></p>
              <p><em>Making prayers to meet Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings, to be born as a human being again, to take a perfect human rebirth, and to meet a perfect guru, who is giving Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings—one can pray that whenever death happens those things happen next, in order to have realizations of the path to enlightenment. That is important whether we are reborn in a pure land or not.</em></p>
              <p><em>The best thing is to meditate on the path, the lam-rim, and to actualize it. The best thing in this life is to have realizations, some development, and as much as possible to have lam-rim realizations, of guru devotion, the three principle paths, then the tantric path and the highest tantric path; while you have the opportunity, do it in this life. That’s the most important thing. Then, if you don’t become enlightened in this life, pray to have a perfect human rebirth in the next life, the opportunity to practice where tantric teachings exist, to have a perfect environment, with all the conditions to practice tantra, and a perfectly qualified guru teaching Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings. Whatever path you haven’t developed in this life then in the next life you develop that. That is important. The purpose of pure lands is, if you are not able to actualize the tantric path in this life, then you are reborn in a pure land and become enlightened there, where there are tantric teachings. You become enlightened there for sentient beings’ sake. </em></p>
              <p><em>Q: Is it more difficult to meet Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings than to reach Amitabha’s pure land?</em></p>
              <p><em>Yes, is more difficult to meet Lama Tsongkhapa’s teachings than to go to Amitabha pure land. When you are born in Amitabha pure land, you become a bodhisattva there and possibly also achieve the Mahayana higher paths, then you come down into the world to benefit many sentient beings as a bodhisattva. </em></p>
              <p><em>It is not that being born in Amitabha pure land is like being in a god realm. It is totally different, everything is pure, there are not even words like suffering rebirth, old age, sickness, and death, and no anger or desire, those gross delusions, arise. There is no such thing. You definitely receive teachings and then develop the Mahayana path. Then, as a bodhisattva you come to a world, such as a human world, to benefit many sentient beings. </em></p>
              <p><em>Q: So, it is best is to pray to be reborn in Amitabha’s pure land because then you cannot be reborn in the lower realms.</em></p>
              <p><em>That is for sure. Pray to be born there. </em></p>
              <p><em>If a bodhisattva comes into the world that means it is only to benefit others. In the pure land you also accumulate merit, then you come down to the human realm to benefit others. Also, if there are some tantric teachings existing, then you practice tantric teachings and become enlightened. You can do that.</em></p>
