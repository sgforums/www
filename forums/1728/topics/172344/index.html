            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, there is no ONE answer. Different people have different solutions.<br><br>It probably a good idea to guide her along to do some activities (example volunteer works or to do some physical workout exercise). It is at this time, she needs strong support and encouragement from family and friends.<br><br>It is also common for her to dwell into the unfortunate event of losing her baby and it is very painful. It is not easy, but possible. Tactfulness needed here. And if she can overcome the pain, she usually will grow stronger and becoming more mature.<br><br>For some, volunteering is a great way to overcome the pain. Because the act of volunteering makes one realises that there are many others who are worst off. Instead of dwelling on the lost, it is better off to replace it by giving. The mind can only think about one thing at a time.<br><br>Just an opinion. I am not someone who is good at giving advice.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>From what I heard, if there is no yin yuan with the child, the baby may get miscarried somehow. That happened to my dharma teacher before and she briefly told us her reason. She went to pray from spirit-deities for a baby because for a very long time she did not get pregnant. After praying she became pregnant within a very very short period of time but later... got miscarried. When my Master came to Singapore and my dharma teacher first met him, my Master's comment was only 'Lai2 Zhe3 Bu4 Shan4' (not virtuous). The lower realm being did not have the karma to be borned in her family.<br><br>Anyway everything must have its yin yuan met otherwise it will fall apart. Maybe the baby did not have the karmic affinity (no 'yuan') to be borned in her family. Its not her fault that the baby had to go like that. All are conditioned arisings, when there is arising there will be ending.<br><br>I also agree with Sinweiy on the non-self part. Even family members are very unpredictable. Next life even if I meet again I may not even recognise them. So its not really 'mine' after all. That is really just an illusion.<br><br><img src="http://www.bewithbuddha.org/img/sk_letgo.gif"><br><br>Secondly, since she is in a Buddhist class, perhaps she can ask her teacher for advice too?</div>
