              <p>Because they have eradicated the illusion of self (identification to body and mind as 'self' or identification with a separate experiencer), no, they do not feel fear. As my friend Thusness said, the three important factors of self liberation is "non attachment, fearlessness, and non-duality (no-self)"</p>
              <p>They can still think and analyse like anybody else. It is still a necessary function for daily living and to communicate the dharma to others.</p>
              <p>They still have the same physical appearance and needs (sleep, toilet, sick, old age, death, etc) like any other humans. You will not be able to tell by the looks. There are examples in the scriptures where a person cannot recognise Shakyamuni was the Buddha, or that certain people are Arhants, such as the example given in the next post.</p>

              <p>In the Dhammapada there is an example of a Lay Arhant who overcame fear:</p>
              <p><br>The Dhammapada Verse 397<br><br>XXVI (14) The Story of Uggasena, the son of a Rich Man.<br><br>While
              residing at the Jetavana Monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (397) of
              the Dhammapada, with reference to Uggasena, the son of a Rich Man.<br><br>After
              marrying a dancer from a theatrical troupe, Uggasena was trained by his
              father-in-law who was an acrobat, and became very skillful in
              accrobatics. One day while he was demonstrating his skill, the Buddha
              came on the scene. After hearing the Buddha's teaching Uggasena
              attained Arahatship while he was still performing his feats on top of a
              long bamboo pole. After that, he climbed down from the pole and pleaded
              with the Buddha to accept him as a bhikkhu and was accordingly admitted
              into the order.<br><br>One day, when other Bhikkhus asked him whether
              he did not have any feeling of fear while climbing down from such a
              great height (i.e. about 90 feet), he answered in the negative. The
              Bhikkhus took that to mean that Uggasena was claiming to have attained
              Arahatship even then. So, they went to the Buddha and said, "Vernerable
              Sir ! Uggasena claims himself to be an Arahat; he must be telling
              lies." To them the Buddha replied. " Bhikkhus, one who has cut off all
              fetters like my son Uggasena, has no fear."<br><br>Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows;<br><br>Verse
              397 : Him I call a Brahmana, who has cut off all fetters and is
              fearless, who is beyond attainment and is free from moral defilement.</p>

              <p>The way an Arhat thinks cannot be conceived by any of us, simply because all of us have never experienced such states in our past lives. They are still humans alright, with the exception that there won't be anymore rebirth after the end of that life. They are fearless, as fear is founded in the root of Delusion, for an Arhat has destroyed all roots of evil and defilements.</p>

              <p>I remembered when the Buddha attained enlightenment, he was approached by a man who was impressed by the Buddha's serene and compassionate appearance, so he approached the Buddha and asked him. Are you a deva, the Buddha replied, no. Then the man asked you are you a human, the Buddha replied no. Then the man asked, what are you then? The Buddha replied, I am a Buddha, enlightened Tathagata, teacher of gods and men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think arhats are no longer humans once they attained enlightenment. Heard from K Sri Dhammananda in his audio tapes that, human is a sanskrit word meaning emotions, to be able to feel. Arhats are passionless, rid of the fetters of ignorance and craving. so based on the term, arhats are not humans.</p>

              <p>He meant that he is no longer an ordinary human still trapped in the cycles of samsara and suffering, and he has transcended the cycle of rebirth in the six realms.</p>
              <p>He has transcended birth and death and sufferings which is the human condition and the condition of all unenlightened sentient beings.</p>
              <p>However an enlightened being still has the same physical body, behaviors, personality, etc after enlightenment (though he is no longer identified with them): only no more defilements and attachments.</p>
