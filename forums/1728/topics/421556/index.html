              <p>The Lunar New Year heralds the start of one of our major events for the 
              year. This period also marks the Day of Miracles of Buddha Shakyamuni. 
              On this day and during this fifteen day period, merit accumulated is 
              multiplied 1,000,000 times. During this period, we provide fifteen days 
              of light offerings and other prayers for good conditions for academic 
              excellence and wisdom, compassion and wealth of dharma and material.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>When Shakyamuni Buddha was 40 years old, 6 great Hindu teachers , who
               represented the 6 schools of Hinduism that existed at the time, 
              challenged the Buddha to a competition. It was a common practice at that
               time that the great kings and noble families sponsored the teachers who
               could perform feats. Buddha accepted the challenge knowing that many 
              would be benefited and achieve the state of arhatship (liberation) and 
              people of the future would be inspired to practice as a result of his 
              demonstration.</p>
              <p>First Day - Buddha held a toothpick, put it on the ground and it 
              turned into a wish fulfilling tree. It was decorated with jewels</p>
              <p>Second Day - Buddha manifested two wish fulfilling jewels.</p>
              <p>Third Day - The king offered to wash the Buddha's feet. The water 
              from this became a pool with the eight special qualities of water. 
              Whoever drank or touched it was healed of diseases and mental ailments.</p>
              <p>Fourth Day - Buddha caused a rain which completely filled up the eight great canals.</p>
              <p>Fifth Day - Buddha emitted golden light from His mouth and people could see the beings of the six realms being liberated.</p>
              <p>Sixth day - Buddha transformed the energy of the audience and everyone became clairvoyant and knew each others' minds.</p>
              <p>Seventh day - Buddha manifested as the greatly virtuous Wheel Turning
               King and many people were converted to Buddhism. Up to that time the 
              Hindu teachers had not shown any feats of any capability</p>
              <p>Eighth day - Gods from Indra's palace served the Buddha and made 
              offerings to Him. His opponents fled in fear as tornados appeared as did
               wrathful deities. For the next seven days Buddha showed miracles 
              without competition.</p>
              <p>Ninth day - Buddha grew His body until the Brahma Realm came under His chin.</p>
              <p>Tenth day - Buddha's body grew to the top of Akanishta.</p>
              <p>Eleventh day - Buddha was not visible but the sound of His voice was heard everywhere.</p>
              <p>Twelfth day- Rays of light from the Buddha's body emanated to and 
              pervaded all of samsara and inspired the generation of loving kindness 
              in all beings' heart.</p>
              <p>Thirteenth day - Buddha manifested light from the spot between His 
              eyebrows which filled the entire space with millions of Buddhas, all of 
              whom taught the Dharma simultaneously to all beings in the six realms.</p>
              <p>Fourteenth day - Flowers that were offered to the Buddha by the gods 
              filled all of space and on each flower was a Buddha manifesting the 
              activity of teaching and explaining Dharma.</p>
              <p>Fifteenth day - Buddha gave the energy so that all beings could see 
              all the six realms. Many people converted to Buddhism after seeing the 
              lower realms with their own eyes.</p>
