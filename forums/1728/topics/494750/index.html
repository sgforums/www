              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Meher McArthur Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-10-02 | </span><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The city of Kamakura in Japan’s Kanazawa Prefecture is home
              to one of the most poetic and paradoxical works of Buddhist sculpture. The
              statue is the Great Buddha, or Daibutsu, a giant bronze figure of Amida Buddha
              measuring 11.3 meters in height at Kotoku-in, a temple of the Jodo-shu branch
              of Pure Land Buddhism. The elegant Buddha is seated in the lotus position with
              his hands in the gesture of meditation, his eyes cast downward in peaceful
              contemplation. What is peculiar about this magnificent Buddha is that he sits
              in the open air, exposed to the elements, as he has done since 1498, after
              typhoons, tidal waves, and earthquakes devastated the temple building that once
              housed him. Since then, no new temple has been built around the image. Instead,
              the Daibutsu sits calmly on a stone platform emanating total balance and
              serenity—a monument, simultaneously and paradoxically, to physical permanence
              and the Buddhist concept of impermanence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The beloved statue of Amida (Skt: Amitabha, Amitayus) was
              built in the mid-13th century, several decades after the nation’s political
              capital was moved from Kyoto to Kamakura by the new military regime, the
              Kamakura shogunate. The military rulers of Japan embraced Buddhism and established
              many temples around their new capital to provide spiritual sustenance for the
              elite and the samurai warriors who served them. One of the traditions they
              embraced was Pure Land Buddhism, a sect devoted to the worship of Amida Buddha.
              Amida is believed to have vowed to liberate all beings from samsara,
              irrespective of sex, age, social standing, and even behavior and deeds. Simply
              by following Amida, devotees are guaranteed rebirth in his glorious Western
              Pure Land, where the Buddha will then assist their souls on their search for
              enlightenment, or nirvana. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pure Land Buddhism was transmitted to Japan from China during
              the Heian period (794–1185), when it was practiced mainly by members of the
              imperial court, but under the new military regime the sect gain a broader
              following among the general populace. Pure Land temples were established
              throughout the country and images of Amida, his celestial entourage of deities,
              and his glorious Western Paradise were commissioned for display in the temples
              and for followers to worship in their homes. In Pure Land Buddhist practice,
              mindfulness of Amida is supremely important. Devotees repeatedly chant Amida’s
              name, a practice known in Japanese as nembutsu, and perform meditative
              contemplation and visualization of Amida, creating a bond with the deity to
              ensure their soul’s passage to his Pure Land. Many images depict Amida
              descending with his celestial attendants to collect the soul and transport it
              to paradise, and, from the early days of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan, devotees
              on their deathbed held the end of a string attached to such images, known as
              Amida’s Welcoming Approach (Japanese: Amida Raigo), to ensure that Amida
              carried their soul to paradise. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">According to chronicles of the Kamakura shogunate, work on
              building the Great Buddha at Kotokuin began in 1252, and priests from the
              temple gathered donations from the local population to help pay for
              construction. The bronze Buddha was originally covered in gold and housed in
              the Great Buddha Hall, or Daibutsuden, but the structure was damaged by
              typhoons in 1334 and 1369, and subsequently in a severe earthquake in 1498.
              Over the years, the statue itself has been damaged by the elements and repaired
              on several occasions but has remained uncovered for more than half a century,
              during which time not only Buddhists but also travelers from around the country
              have paid their respects to the Great Buddha. In the mid-19th century, artist
              Ando Hiroshige (1797–1858), who produced some of Japan’s most famous woodblock
              printed landscapes, paid homage to the image with a print, naming it after one
              of the later temple halls of the Kotoku-in, the Shojosen-ji. Later in the
              century, British writer Rudyard Kipling visited Japan and was so awed by the
              sculpture that he penned a poem to the Buddha at Kamakura. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Today, Buddhists of all traditions and travelers from all
              over the world come to visit the Great Buddha of Kotoku-in. The figure has
              become so well known that it now ranks alongside Katsushika Hokusai’s woodblock
              print The Great Wave off Kanazawa as one of Japan’s most iconic artistic
              creations. Just as Hokusai’s Great Wave, which depicts small fishing boats
              being tossed around by a massive tidal wave, reminds us of the truly awesome
              power of nature, this Great Buddha, sitting in the open air without the
              protection of a temple building, is also a reminder of the destruction that can
              be inflicted upon human structures by the forces of nature. However, at a time
              when so many regions in the world are suffering from the devastation of earthquakes,
              hurricanes, tsunamis, fires, and other natural disasters, this powerful Buddha
              image, which has survived wars, fires, earthquakes, and typhoons for 750 years,
              is also a reminder of the strength of the human spirit and in the belief in
              something greater than ourselves.</span></p>
