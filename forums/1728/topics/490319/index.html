              month, the Dalai Lama suggested that, if his successor were to be a woman, she
              would have to be attractive, otherwise "not much use." With the
              breathy, halting chuckle of a man whose joke did not land, he doubled down on
              his assertion. "It's true!" he stammered, as the interviewer tried to
              change the subject.</span></p>

How could he say something so inflammatory
              and backwards about women? Has he always been like this, and we just never
              noticed?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">While social media affords us an intimate—if often
              one-sided—relationship with celebrities, figures like the Dalai Lama still
              prove impregnable despite their attempts at candor. It's one thing to watch
              someone live-stream their colonic on Periscope; it's another to simply spend
              the day with them. Forty years ago, my mom did just that. She went on a date
              with the Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">At the timeI my mom was studying at the Architectural
              Association in London; the Dalai Lama was visiting Cambridge to meet with Sir
              Karl Popper, David Bohm, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker of their
              astrophysics department in an effort to find</span><a href="http://www.dalailama.com/messages/buddhism/science-at-the-crossroads"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>common ground</span></strong></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">between science and Buddhism.</span></p>

              age two, taken to Lhasa to be educated by monks in a 1,000-room palace, and
              instated as the political leader of Tibet at age 15.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">When he and my mom met, he had been in exile for 14
              years, living in India.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">My mom was 22. She was living on Regents Park Road with
              two other women in what was essentially a one-bedroom apartment with a large
              closet that could hold a twin bed. She and her friend Daisy—who was in London
              to study opera—slept in the bedroom together. They had many short-term
              sub-tenants. But that fall, they hosted an art history grad student named
              Carolyn. And Carolyn set up the date with the Dalai Lama. "He wanted to
              meet some American women," my mom recalled.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In a 1993<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/28/magazine/the-dalai-lama.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>interview</span></strong></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">with the<span> </span><em>New
              York Times</em>, the Dalai Lama said, "Even in the 1960s and 1970s, I
              didn't have much knowledge of [women's issues]." This is putting it
              mildly, according to my mom. "He seemed very naive...maybe a little shy
              around girls," she said.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In some ways, the date was fairly ordinary: Carolyn,
              Daisy, and my mom took the train to Cambridge to go on a walking tour of the
              campus with their gentleman caller. In other ways, it was less so—he introduced
              himself to them as the Dalai Lama, sticking to formalities. "I didn't know
              how to address him, so I just waved when I wanted his attention," my mom
              said.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In addition to the walking tour, my mom and her friends
              were treated to a tour of his room, where he had set up a shrine with
              "ancient artifacts," which he told them were "from B.C."
              Then he and my mom went out on the Charles River. "He did not do any of
              the work," she recalled. "I had to do all the punting." My mom
              punted the small boat along the river while the Dalai Lama sat cradled on the
              cushioned bench, remarking on the Cambridge scenery.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">"He was a little weird and hard to talk to,"
              my mom said, so his recent comments didn't surprise her. And widespread shock
              seems a little late in the game, at this point. The<span> </span>truth is that the Dalai Lama has made
              this "joke" about a female Dalai Lama many times:<span> </span>with<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.ora.tv/larrykingnow/2015/7/13/dalai-lama"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>Larry King</span></strong></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">,
              with German Buddhist writer<span> </span></span><a href="http://info-buddhism.com/Interview_Dalai_Lama_about_the_Full_Ordination_of_Women.html"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>Michaela Doepke</span></strong></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">,
              with t</span><a href="http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/world_news/Asia/article1557049.ece"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>he Sunday Times</span></strong></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">—to
              name a few. In his BBC interview, he makes this joke in reference to some
              half-forgotten interview he did in Paris with a French women's magazine 20 or
              30 years ago.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">It's also perhaps misleading to label this viewpoint a
              joke, since he makes the same argument earnestly in his autobiography,<span> </span><em>My Spiritual Journey</em>.
              "Beauty is one of the eight qualities of a precious human body on the
              physical level," he wrote. "It is obvious that if a female Dalai Lama
              is ugly to look at, she will attract fewer people. The aim of a female
              reincarnation is to transmit the Buddhist teachings to the public in a
              convincing way."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>For
              all his demi-divinity, the Dalai Lama is certainly not above a dick joke.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And the Dalai Lama makes no secret of the way that
              attractive human bodies affect him. In a New York Times interview, when asked
              about his weaknesses, he replied, "Of course, sometimes beautiful
              women...But then, many monks have the same experience. Some of it is curiosity:
              If you use this, what is the feeling? [Points to his groin.]" For all his
              demi-divinity, the Dalai Lama is certainly not above a dick joke.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The Dalai Lama is the successor in a line of

              male.

              patriarchal."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This strain of Buddhism was established in the 14th
              century. The title Dalai Lama arose in 1587, and by 1641, the Dalai Lama—this
              one was the fifth—had complete political and religious authority over Tibet. He
              was considered to be Tibet's greatest leader, until Tenzin Gyatso.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In the past, Dalai Lamas indicated where they will be
              reincarnated by writing a letter to be read after their death, or a prominent
              lama will have dreams of the child's house, or heavenly signs will surface. In
              the case of the current Dalai Lama, an omen predicted his identity. Eighteen
              months after the death of the 13th Dalai Lama, Tibet was in political turmoil.
              The monks consulted with the Dalai Lama's embalmed body, which was set up in
              the lotus posture gazing southward for meditation. When a few observant monks
              noticed that the figure's head tilted eastward, even a day after their
              correction, they were convinced that his successor would be found in the east.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In many ways, the reincarnated form the Dalai Lama takes
              is a reflection of the needs of Tibet and Tibetan Buddhism at the time. The
              Dalai Lama before Tenzin Gyatso left Tibet in turmoil, and a successor—the
              right kind of successor—had to be found immediately. As Gross puts it,
              "All religions reflect their social settings." And Tibet has a
              tradition of thinking of women as inferior. The word for "woman" in
              the Tibetan language literally translates to "born low."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This hierarchical attitude is at odds with what Gross
              calls "the true Buddhist teachings." "Buddhists can't come up
              with the same excuses for male dominance." Yet reincarnated leaders almost
              always take male form. The institution of reincarnation essentially upholds the
              status quo. However, Gross goes on to say, "There has been some shift
              among some of the more prominent leaders of the Buddhist world."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>In
              his biography, the Dalai Lama said that the next Dalai Lama could be a woman or
              a man.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The current Dalai Lama has made conflicting comments
              regarding his successor. In his biography, he asserts, "I have told the
              Tibetan people that it is up to them to decide whether they want another
              reincarnation...Reincarnation is about continuing your work from the previous

              Dalai Lama could be a woman or a man, that "the institution of the Dalai
              Lama must change according to the times."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">"That's come a long way for popular Tibetan

              Compassion has a female aspect called Tara. Often called the Mother of all
              Buddhas, some stories trace her back to an original princess who attained a
              high level of enlightenment. A group of monks suggested that she should pray to
              be reborn as a man, so that she could progress further. Tara refused, saying
              that those who see gender as a barrier to attaining enlightenment are
              "weak-minded worldlings." She resolved to always be reborn as a
              woman.

              as an example of "a true feminist movement in Buddhism."</span></p>

              from receiving the highest ordinations. At the same time, there are lineages in
              the Tibetan tradition of female high reincarnations. In short: female
              practitioners are kept from power; female figures enjoy reverence. Gross notes
              that Tara is the most popular deity in Tibet—male or female. Again, there's a
              difference between the letter of Buddhist teachings, and how they're carried out.
              Women can be symbols for worship, but they cannot be leaders with legitimate
              political and religious power.</span></p>

              feminist. "Isn't that what you call someone who fights for women's
              rights?" he asked during a<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/the-dalai-lama-proclaims_b_297285.html"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #2cc1d9;'>2009 speech</span></strong></a><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">at the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, TN.</span></p>

              sincere. The real question is whether the Tibetan people would accept."</span></p>

              friends returned to their tiny apartment. "We didn't make fun of him.
              Probably we giggled about him afterward," she said. And then the calls
              started. He called them more than three times, asking to "get together
              again."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">"It was kind of like having someone's little
              brother call you for a date," my mom said.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">When I asked her why she didn't take him up on his
              offer, my mom replied, "It didn't seem appropriate. Because of who he is
              and was. And because he did seem so boyish. It was peculiar." For someone
              with inherited centuries of wisdom and decades of Buddhist study, the Dalai
              Lama lacked one thing: He couldn't speak to women. Couldn't make conversation
              with them, couldn't relate to them, and certainly couldn't hit on them. As my
              mom said, "He was just a pest." Forty years later, not much has
              changed.</span></p>
