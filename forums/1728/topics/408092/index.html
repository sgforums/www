              <p>(This passage is taken from the book "The Ten Dharma Realms are not beyond a single thought")</p>
              <p class="style16"><span class="style17"><span style="font-size: xx-large;">T</span></span>he Dharma Realm of Asuras</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p class="style15"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="style18"><span style="font-size: large;">A</span></span>suras have a violent nature,<br>Laden with blessings, lacking power. <br>Absolutely determined to fight,<br>They bob along in karma's tow. </span></p>
              <span style="font-style: italic;">Asura</span> is a Sanskrit word that means "ugly." Male asuras are extremely ugly; the females are beautiful. It is the nature of the male asura to initiate fights. The female asura is also naturally fond of fighting, but wages covert wars, unlike the overt physical battles of the males, using weapons of the mind such as jealousy, obstructiveness, ignorance, and affliction.</blockquote>
              <p class="style15">Sometimes this realm is included in the Three Good Realms— gods, humans, and asuras. At other times they are classified as one of the Four Evil Realms—hell-beings, hungry ghosts, animals, and asuras.</p>
              <p class="style15">There are asuras in the animal realm, in the human realm, in the heavens, and among the hungry ghosts. Although the asuras are an individual Dharma Realm by themselves, they appear in the otherrealms as well. In general, regardless of what realm they are in, they like to pick fights, and they have bad tempers. They enjoy bossing others around and like to be supervisors, but they can't stand supervision. They won't be controlled by others. These are the characteristics of asuras.</p>
              <p class="style15">If you haven't noticed the asuras, I can tell you more about them. Among people, asuras can be good or bad. The good asuras include military officials and troops, and bad asuras are bandits, thieves, robbers, thugs, murderers, and the like. We can see these asuras in the world of men.</p>
              <p class="style15">There are also asuras in the heavens. Heavenly asuras wage battles against the heavenly troops of Shakra. From morning to night, they attempt to overthrow Shakra so that they can seize his jeweled throne and become the heavenly king. But no matter what strategy they use, they are always defeated, because they are "laden with blessings, lacking power." They have accumulated the blessings that earn them rebirth in the heavens, but they have no authority there. For that reason, they are invariably defeated in their battles with the heavenly troops.</p>
              <p class="style15">Are there asuras in the animal realm? Yes. Tigers, for instance, are asuras among the animals. Lions and wolves are also asuras among the animals. These asuras bully the other animals. Wolves, tigers, and lions kill other animals for food. They prey on other animals because they have the nature of asuras. Snakes and eagles are also asuras.</p>
              <p class="style15">In general, asuras are utterly unreasonable and have huge tempers. They are constantly blowing their tops. Too much temper!</p>
              <p class="style15">There are also asuras in the hungry ghost realm, and they go around bullying other ghosts. The realm of hungry ghosts has kind ghosts and evil ghosts. Evil ghosts are utterly unreasonable. Ghosts are not reasonable to begin with, but these asura ghosts are even more unreasonable. And so the verse says: Asuras have a violent nature. They have explosive tempers.</p>
              <p class="style15"><span style="font-style: italic;">Laden with blessings, lacking power.</span> They have heavenly blessings, but lack heavenly authority. They fight for power and advantages, but fail to obtain them. <span style="font-style: italic;">Absolutely determined to fight</span>: they love to fight and wage war. The modern world is a world of asuras—everyone is fighting and struggling, trying to knock each other down.</p>
              <p class="style15">Asuras are so belligerent that they can keep fighting for one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, five hundred, or even a thousand years. They could fight for a thousand years without getting tired of it!</p>
              <p class="style15">This is the Age Strong in Fighting and also the Dharma-Ending Age. Nevertheless, we don't want it to be the Dharma-Ending Age; we want the Proper Dharma to prevail. We should vow that wherever we go, the Proper Dharma will prevail. If we do that, every place we go will become a place of genuine Dharma. If everyone fulfilled this vow, the Dharma-Ending Age would become the Proper Dharma Age. We can turn the situation around.</p>
              <p class="style15"><span style="font-style: italic;">They bob along in karma's tow</span>. Asuras may be born in the heavens, in the human realm, or in the realms of animals and hungry ghosts. Dragged by the force of their karma, they become deluded, create more karma, and undergo the retribution. The force of their karma pulls them to undergo retribution in various realms. Cultivators should take care not to be belligerent and hot-tempered. Then they won't get dragged into the asura realm.</p>
              <p class="style15">Five of the nine Dharma Realms have asuras. In the animal realm, there are asuras among creatures that fly in the air, those on the land, and those in the water. Crocodiles are an instance of asuras in the water. Wild stallions are asuras among horses. They bring trouble and disturbance to the herd. Most bulls are asuras, too. They butt their two horns against things to show their tough asura disposition. Bulls are asuras by nature. Dogs have even more of an asura nature, so people who own dogs are in close association with asuras. If you hang around asuras, you become closer to them. And getting close to them is dangerous; you might just fall into the realm of asuras. Everyone should pay attention to this and not run into the realm of asuras!</p>
              <p class="style15">(The passage below is from the Shurangama Sutra)<br>H7 Destiny of asuras.<br>I1 A general introduction to their name and number.<br><br>Sutra:<br>“Furthermore, Ananda, there are four categories of asuras in the Triple Realm.<br><br>Commentary:<br>“Furthermore, Ananda, there are four categories of asuras.” “Asura” is also a Sanskrit word. Sometimes it’s translated as “non-gods.” That’s because some asuras have the blessings of the heavens but not the virtue of the gods. Another translation is “not upright in appearance”; however, only the male asuras are that way. The asura women are extremely beautiful. Asuras are found among beings of the four kinds of birth: womb-born, egg-born, moisture-born, and born by transformation. Each of these will now be discussed.<br><br>I2 A specific explanation of those included in this destiny.<br>J1 Egg-born ghosts.<br><br>Sutra:<br>“Those in the path of ghosts who use their strength to protect the Dharma and who can ride their spiritual Destiny of Asuras  penetrations to enter into emptiness are asuras born from eggs; they belong to the destiny of ghosts.<br><br>Commentary:<br>“Those in the path of ghosts who use their strength to protect the Dharma and who can ride their spiritual penetrations to enter into emptiness are asuras born from eggs.” Some ghosts are good and act as Dharma protectors. Kuan Ti Kung is an example. He is a great and powerful ghost. These kinds of ghosts protect and support the Triple Jewel. They can use their spiritual powers to go into emptiness. These asuras “they belong to the destiny of ghosts.”<br><br>J2 Womb-born people.<br><br>Sutra:<br>“Those who have fallen in virtue and have been dismissed from the heavens dwell in places near the sun and moon. They are asuras born from wombs and belong to the destiny of humans.<br><br>Commentary:<br>“Those who have fallen in virtue and have been dismissed from the heavens dwell in places near the sun and moon.” They started out in the heavens, but they didn’t have the virtue to remain there. They fell and were thrown out into empty space. They take<br>up residence in places close to the sun and moon. “They are asuras born from wombs and belong to the destiny of humans.”<br><br>J3 Transformation-born gods.<br><br>Sutra:<br>“There are asura kings who uphold the world with a penetrating power and fearlessness. They fight for position with the Brahma Lord, the God Shakra, and the Four Heavenly Kings. These asuras come into being by transformation and belong to the destiny of gods.<br><br>Commentary:<br>There is another category of “asura kings who uphold the world with a penetrating power and fearlessness. Their strength is enormous. They can shake the entire world system. If they grasp the peak of Mt. Sumeru with their hand and push, they can topple the mountain right down. That’s the kind of strength they have. With such great spiritual powers, they think they’d like to be the Great Brahma King or the Lord Shakra. So they fight for power and authority. “They fight for position with the Brahma Lord, the God Shakra, and the Four Heavenly Kings. These asuras come into being by transformation and belong to the destiny of gods.” They use their spiritual powers to undergo this transformation. The Lord of the asuras had a beautiful daughter who became the reason why he went to war with the God Shakra. She was an exquisite young goddess, and when Shakra laid eyes on her he went to the Lord of the asuras to ask for her hand. The asura father consented. It turned out, however, that the asura woman was extremely jealous and selfish. The Lord Shakra liked to listen to the Buddhadharma and would go regularly to hear the Dharma Masters lecture on the sutras. The asura woman noticed his absence and became jealous. She thought, “Now that he’s married me, he doesn’t love me anymore. I bet he’s going out and having an affair.” Possessed by such jealous thoughts as this, she secretly followed the Lord God one day to find out where he went. When the Lord entered the Dharma assembly and took his place, his wife observed that there were a lot of women in the gathering. This fired her jealousy even more, and with that she became visible. When Shakra saw her he asked, “What are you doing here?” “You come here to get friendly with women and don’t invite me along:” she replied in a jealous fit. Shakra slapped her face, and she began to cry and ran home to the asura King to tell her tale. “The God Shakra is breaking the rules and always going out to find women,” she reported. “When I followed him, he hit me.” Of course, when the asura King heard that, he was outraged. “We’re going to war: We’ll overthrow him and usurp the throne:” He sent out the entire company of asura soldiers and generals to join battle against Shakra. Well, guess what; the combined military might of Shakra, Brahma, and the Four Heavenly Kings could not overcome the asura troops. It was a stalemate. Finally Shakra had to go to the Buddha to ask for help. “What’s to be done?” he said. “I can’t beat these asuras.” Shakyamuni Buddha replied, “Go back and tell all your officers and enlisted men to recite the phrase ‘Mahaprajnaparamita,’ and I guarantee that everything will turn out all right.” Shakra did as he was told, and the asuras gave up without further fight. That’s how Shakra finally won. But these kinds of asuras are always fighting for position and authority.<br><br>J4 Moisture-born animals.<br><br>Sutra:<br>“Ananda, there is another, baser category of asuras. They have thoughts of the great seas and live submerged in underwater caves. During the day they roam in emptiness; at night they return to their watery realm. These asuras come into being because of moisture and belong to the destiny of animals.<br><br>Commentary:<br>“Ananda, there is another, baser category of asuras. They have thoughts of the great seas and live submerged in underwater caves.” These asuras belong to the animal realm. Dragons and the like are examples. Since they think so much about the sea, they end up living in it. “During the day they roam in emptiness; at night they return to their watery realm.” They go back to their underwater caves in the evening. “These asuras come into being because of moisture and belong to the destiny of animals.”</p>

              <p>thus i learn, Asura are included in all the realm except the Hell realm. Deva realm also have asura. our world also have human asura and animal asura. Asura are not in hell. not to be confused with hell creature, raksasa, yaksha.</p>
              <p>as for the7th month, hell beings travel to earth are not true in Buddhism, it's folk believe. ya, hell beings have to exhaust their karma before they are out. but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GHosts</span></strong> (not hell being) are always here, no need to wait for 7th month. maybe u can say they are more active. as the saying goes, äººå�Œæ­¤å¿ƒ,å¿ƒå�Œæ­¤ç�†. we human active, they also active. sort of they are attached to the old habits they had when they are human.</p>
