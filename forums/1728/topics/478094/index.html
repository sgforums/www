              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 26px; line-height: normal;">"Modern Age Siddharta Gautama - Giving Up Billions and Lead a Life of Monkhood</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.6875px;">Ajahn Siripanno is a humble Theravada Buddhist monk from Thailand. He was educated in the UK and can speak 8 different languages. He is the one and only son of the second richest man in Malaysia, T. Ananda Krishnan, a low profile successful businessman that has business interest in media, oil and gas, telecommunications, gaming, entertainment and property. Ananda Krishnan is estimated to have a net worth of US$9.6 billions according to Forbes's 2012 world wealthiest people. He ranks the second richest man in Malaysia while at the number of 89 in the world.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.6875px;">Ajahn Siripanno's mother is a Thai and he has two other sisters. It was during a retreat in Thailand where he wanted to pay homage to his mother's family and took up temporary ordination as a Thai forest monk. He was eighteen then (1989) and growing up in UK has made him quite open to different culture and to him the temporary ordination could be something 'fun'. That was the first time he encountered Buddhism, something that was very new to him.</p>
              <div id="mod_20433028" class="module moduleText color0" style="margin-bottom: 1.4em; clear: left; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.6875px;">
              <div id="txtd_20433028" class="txtd" style="word-wrap: break-word;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">His aim during that time was simple and according to a talk that he gave at Maha Vihara, a Theravada Buddhist Temple in Malaysia, some years ago, his initial plan was to stay in the forest for just two weeks. He had never thought of becoming a forest monk would be his life career. What had really moved his heart was none other than visiting and learning how Ajahn Chah had done to the Sangha community during that time.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;"><a style="color: #551a8b; outline: 0px;" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajahn_Chah">Ajahn Chah</a> was a well-known Theravada monk and he had many followers/disciples from the West. Some of his most famous diciples include Ajahn Sumedho, Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn Khemadhammo, Ajahn Brahm and Jack Kornfield (a notable author and meditation instructor).</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">However, his hope of learning directly from Ajahn Chah shattered because this great master was already very ill. He could hardly talk and needed aids moving around on his wheelchair. Ajahn Siripanno only had the chance to meet him once but the impact that had on him was huge. It was a life changing moment!</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">What he experienced during the stay at the forest temple had totally changed his perception towards Buddhism and monkhood. The initial two weeks plan had now become a permanent one. He had never look back and after more than two decades, he is now an abbot of Dhao Dham Monastery, located in National Forest Reserve near Thai-Myanmar border.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">Ajahn Siripanno is still in contact with his father and, which his father will visit him from time to time. It is the top priority for all Buddhist followers to practice filial piety and monks are not exceptional too. There was a time when Ajahn Siripanno travelled in his father's private jet to Italy as he was requested by his father to spend some time with him for his 70th anniversary. This humble monk with only a robe and a small tote bag drew quite a lot of attention during the stay in one of the finest hotel in Italy. The story that you might have read over the net about a monk that travelled in a private jet was none other than Ajahn Siripanno.</p>

              <div id="mod_20433033" class="module moduleText color0" style="margin-bottom: 1.4em; clear: left; color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20.6875px;">
              <h2 class="subtitle" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.6em; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: 1.2em;">Nothing VS Everything</h2>
              <div id="txtd_20433033" class="txtd" style="word-wrap: break-word;">
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">Can you imagine how a young man could give up everything (billions) and lead a simple life as a forest monk? Note that a Theravada tradition monk only eats once a day and after 12 noon, they are prohibited to consume any solid food.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">It is quite normal for a young man from rich family to enjoy his luxurious life; driving a sports car, wearing fancy clothing and of course with a hot lady sitting at the side. However, an exceptional one will truly choose an extraordinary path of life and Ajahn Siripanno is one of the least examples of the <strong>Modern Age <a style="color: #551a8b; outline: 0px;" href="http://kenwu.hubpages.com/hub/famous-buddha-quotes">Siddharta Gautama</a></strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">Below is the talk that given by Ajahn Siripanno at Maha Vihara, Brickfields, Malaysia, 2010. There he shared about the teachings of Ajahn Chah and what he encountered during his first visit at the forest Shangha community. The title of the talk is <em>'Timeless Teachings of Ajahn Chah'</em>."</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75em;">"<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt; line-height: 20.6875px;">In 2008, as my friend and I sat down in the restaurant to eat our dinner, we saw a man in the hotel lobby. Immediately, we assumed that he was alone so decided to invite him for dinner.</span></p>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">“I don’t eat dinner,” the elderly man declined the offer, “I am on my way to the gym.”</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">The next morning, I met him in the hotel lobby and noticed that he was wearing the same clothes.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">“Yesterday was my father’s 70th birthday and he wanted me to spend it with him in a special place,” the monk informed me. The monk could have been in his early thirties.  He had short hair and was wearing saffron robes and had a pair of slippers on. “What a beautiful country you have? They had flown into Paro in their own jet.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>

              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Krishnan is the second richest man in Malaysia . According to Forbes he is worth 7.6 Billion dollars. The Tamil Malaysian of Sri Lankan Tamil origin is a self made man and is a notable philanthropist but leads a low profile life. He and his son are both Buddhists.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>

He started to look for him and his search stopped in a Buddhist monastery in north Thailand .  Shocked to see his son in saffron robes, short hair with a begging bowl in his hand the father invites his son for a meal.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">“I am sorry; I cannot accept your invitation.”  Like all my fellow monks, I have to beg for my food.” Krishnan reply made headlines, “With all my wealth I cannot even afford to feed my own son.”</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">The son still lives in the monastery in the forest of Thailand and like all the monks in the monastery depends on other people’s generosity for his sustenance.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 12pt;">Hearing stories like these one wonders if we are giving up everything that we already possess to acquire things that we really don’t need.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: verdana, arial, Sans-erif; font-size: 12px; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"><br style="clear: both;"></div>

Krishnan’s son clearly shows that detachment could be a greater wealth and devotion a bigger asset in our lives."</span></div>

              Ya lo Ya lo, normally rich people won't cultivate one because there is no hardship to propel them to do so.
              
              And true filial is to attain Buddhahood as soon as possible so we can save them from the cycle of re-birth instead of giving them monies and satisfy their corporeal aspects of life.
