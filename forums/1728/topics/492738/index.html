              TIBET—In the contest for Tibetan hearts and minds, a 26-year-old Buddhist monk
              is emerging into the spotlight. He is the Chinese-appointed Panchen Lama, and
              he is being groomed by the Communist Party to fill an important political and
              religious role in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Obedient
              to the party and loyal to the Chinese state, the “Chinese Panchen” is being
              pushed forward as an alternative to the Dalai Lama, a man widely loved by
              Tibetans as their supreme religious leader, but reviled by the Chinese
              Communist Party as a “wolf in monk’s clothing” trying to split Tibet from the
              motherland.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Experts
              are skeptical about whether ordinary Tibetans will accept this young man’s
              credentials: his status as the true reincarnation of the Panchen Lama—Tibetan
              Buddhism’s second most important living religious figure—itself the subject of
              bitter controversy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Yet
              there is no doubt that, with the Dalai Lama, now 81, the contest for Tibet is
              entering a new phase, and decades of Communist Party preparation for the older
              monk’s eventual demise are gathering pace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>In
              July, the young, bespectacled Gyaltsen Norbu, dressed in Tibetan religious
              finery, presided over an important and rare ritual inside Tibet to a large
              audience of laypeople, monks and nuns. Since then, he has been busy visiting
              monasteries, temples, schools and hospitals across the high plateau.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>“An
              increasingly active Panchen Lama is expected to mitigate the Dalai’s
              influence,” announced the nationalist Global Times tabloid last month, citing
              speculation that this process was being encouraged to “prepare for a post-Dalai
              Lama era.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Chinese
              state media said 100,000 people had attended each day of the four-day
              gathering, called a Kalachakra ceremony, braving rain and cold weather, and
              quoted monks praising this young man’s “attainments.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>But on
              a recent visit to Tibet, it was hard to find much enthusiasm for the Chinese
              Panchen Lama, as many people know him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Indeed,
              mention the Panchen Lama to many Tibetans and they start talking about a
              6-year-old boy, recognized by the Dalai Lama as the true reincarnation of the
              Panchen Lama in 1995, who immediately disappeared into Chinese custody and was
              referred to as the world’s youngest political prisoner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>His
              name is Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, and he has not been seen since, but a Tibetan
              official claimed last year he was living a normal life and did not want to be
              disturbed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>In
              Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, a shop selling photographs of leading Tibetan
              religious figures contained none of the Chinese Panchen, but several of a
              predecessor, the 10th Panchen Lama, who was vilified and imprisoned during
              China’s Cultural Revolution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>There
              were also many images of the Karmapa Lama, another important reincarnated lama,
              who was recognized by China before fleeing to join the Dalai Lama in exile in
              India in 2000 at age 14—a decision that embarrassed Beijing but won him
              credibility among many Tibetans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>One
              shop worker said there simply wasn’t any demand for images of the Chinese
              Panchen, while another man dismissed him as a “Chinese Buddhism official.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Similarly,
              images of the ninth and 10th Panchen Lamas were easy to find at the Jokhang
              Temple in Lhasa, Tibetan Buddhism’s holiest site, but images of the Chinese
              Panchen Lama—the 11th—were not on obvious display.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>The
              Tibetan government-in-exile, representing refugees and based in the Indian hill
              town of Dharmsala, said Tibetans had been forced to attend the Panchen Lama’s
              Kalachakra, with “severe penalties” for failing to do so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Sonam
              Dagpo, the exile administration’s international relations secretary, called the
              Kalachakra a “political sham” and said it was ironic that it had been organized
              by a “self-declared atheist government” during some of the worst repression of
              religious freedom in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>But
              whatever Tibetans think of the Chinese Panchen, he will be thrust into the
              limelight after the Dalai Lama dies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>The
              ninth Panchen Lama, for example, was instrumental in the search for the boy who
              came to be recognized as the 14th and current incarnation of the Dalai Lama in
              the 1930s. The Dalai Lama in turn played a key role in identifying the 10th
              Panchen Lama in the 1950s.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>The
              Dalai Lama said he might decide not to reincarnate at all, but if he does it
              would be in a baby born outside China. Beijing almost certainly has other
              plans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>“Ultimately,
              China has made the necessary plans to find and choose a Dalai Lama of its own
              once the present Dalai Lama passes away,” said Elliot Sperling, a professor at
              Indiana University and an expert on Tibet. “And certainly the Chinese Panchen
              Lama will play a big role in that process.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>China’s
              enthronement of both the Karmapa Lama and the Panchen Lama can be seen as dress
              rehearsals for the eventual nomination of a new Dalai Lama, experts said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>“In the
              case of the Chinese Panchen Lama, the authorities have found that they can
              indeed install a lama who is rejected by large segments of the Tibetan
              population, and maintain him in his position by simple coercion and state
              power,” Sperling said. “This is significant because they will certainly find
              little support for a Dalai Lama chosen by the Chinese state.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Gyaltsen
              Norbu was born in Tibet in 1970 to parents who were Communist Party members,
              and has lived in Beijing, reportedly under “protective” guard, since being
              enthroned as Panchen Lama.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>He has
              always stressed his loyalty to the Chinese state, declaring last year that “the
              lives of the masses are moving towards wealth and civilization,” and that “the
              Tibetan future is bright like the endless light of the golden sun.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>He has
              praised the party for liberating Tibet from feudal serfdom when its troops moved
              into Lhasa in 1951, but did cause a stir when he expressed some concerns in a
              2015 speech—complaining that official “quotas” for the number of monks allowed
              in the Tibetan Autonomous Region were too low, and there was “a danger of
              Buddhism existing in name only.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>The
              International Campaign for Tibet, a Washington-based advocacy group for Tibetan
              democracy and human rights, said those comments may have reflected concerns
              relayed to him by senior lamas during his visits to monasteries in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="  text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background: #FAFAFA;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #404040;'>Tsering
              Shakya, a Tibetan historian and scholar at the University of British Columbia,
              said the fact that the Panchen Lama does not live in his traditional seat in
              Tibet’s Tashi Lhunpo Monastery showed that monks there still did not accept
              him.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Seemed not easy to bring stability and confidence among Tibet and China. One one hand, many chinese political officials are sceptical of their groomed potential, and the Tibetan monks are not quite comfortable with this potential, one the other hand, the Dalia Lama claimed personally he does not want to reincarnate in China, and the Tibetan in general, have been facing clouded minds that lack of confidence in peace and harmony. Besides, influence from various groups outside Tibet and China are setting in to generate dichotomous views instead of going into Tibet to offer on site assistance. </p></div>
