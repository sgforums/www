              <p>When will Maitreya Buddha be born into this human world?</p>
              <p>'Maitreya Buddha' 
                      is the Bodhisattva whom the people of today address as the 'To-be-born 
                      Honoured Maitreya Buddha'. This Buddha is presently still in the heavens 
                      above us. He resides in Tusita Heaven (å…œ çŽ‡ å¤© ), the fourth level of 
                      the six World of Desire heavens, within the Maitreya Inner Court of the 
                      palace of Tusita. He is the Dharma Master of Tusita Heaven. It is known 
                      to all on heaven and earth that he has not yet attained Buddhahood, but 
                      he is a Bodhisattva who has cultivated to an extremely high level, one 
                      which is almost the same level as that of Buddha. He is a great Bodhisattva 
                      who has attained the 51st stage in the enlightenment of a Bodhisattva. 
                      This level precedes the attainment of Buddhahood. He is currently in Tusita 
                      Heaven waiting to be born into our human world to be the next Buddha, 
                      thereby succeeding the present teacher of Buddhism, Sakyamuni Buddha. </p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the Kalpa of Virtue, 
                      there are 1,000 Buddhas born. The first Buddha was Krakucchanda Buddha, 
                      the second, Kanakamuni Buddha, and the third, Kasyapa Buddha. The fourth 
                      Buddha is our present Sakyamuni Buddha. The fifth Buddha will be Maitreya 
                      Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">During the time when 
                      Sakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honoured One, attained Buddhahood, Maitreya 
                      was his disciple. Of the many disciples of the World-Honoured One, Maitreya 
                      was a most remarkable and prominent Great Bodhisattva, and was widely 
                      known as 'Maitreya Bodhisattva'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Images of reverence 
                      for Maitreya Bodhisattva can be found at every corner of the world in 
                      most Buddhist temples and monasteries, and in the worshipping halls of 
                      Buddhist private homes. Maitreya Bodhisattva, with his ever-laughing expression 
                      and all-accommodating round belly, is a delightful sight to all. He embodies 
                      the virtues of magnanimity and tolerance, and serves as guidance and inspiration 
                      to all of us in the way we deal with people and the way we conduct our 
                      daily affairs. This is one Bodhisattva whom we cannot do without.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">'Maitreya' is his 
                      family name, which translates into 'loving-kindness' in Chinese. Thus, 
                      there are people who know him as the 'Bodhisattva of Loving-Kindness'. 
                      His given name is 'Ajita', which means 'second to none'. And so, there 
                      are also people who call him 'Ajita Bodhisattva' or 'The Unsurpassed Bodhisattva'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">After Sakyamuni Buddha 
                      was born, this Bodhisattva was born to a Brahmin family in a village called 
                      Kapil located at Varanasin in the southern part of Olden India. Foreigners 
                      to his country take 'Ajita' to be his family name and Maitreya to be his 
                      given name, as is the way in the West, where it is customary to have the 
                      given name before the family name. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Maitreya Bodhisattva 
                      has been cultivating through aeons of kalpas. Distant kalpas ago, his 
                      name had been the 'Immortal of All Wisdom' (the Immortal Sarvajna). During 
                      the time of the 'Ancient Maitreya Buddha', he had been so deeply moved 
                      when he heard the discourse delivered by the Ancient Maitreya Buddha on 
                      the sutra of 'Compassionate Mind Samadhi', that he immediately vowed to 
                      learn to be like Maitreya, to become Maitreya, to emulate the predecessor 
                      Buddha, to practise the Bodhisattva Way, to enlighten all sentient beings, 
                      and even to become a Buddha in the future. For this reason, he has retained 
                      the name 'Maitreya' through all these aeons of kalpas past.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Just before Sakyamuni 
                      Buddha entered into Nirvana, Maitreya Bodhisattva returned to his own 
                      hometown, sat cross-legged at his birthplace and passed away. At that 
                      moment, his body radiated a splendidly brilliant purple golden aura rarely 
                      ever seen in this world. He was then reborn into Tusita Heaven. 'Tusita' 
                      means 'contented'. Where the five desires of pleasure are concerned, celestial 
                      beings born in this heaven are contented and satisfied. However, Maitreya 
                      Bodhisattva is not there to indulge himself in pleasure; rather, he is 
                      the Dharma Master in the celestial palace, and he guides and enlightens 
                      all the celestial beings living there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Tusita Heaven is of 
                      a different temporal dimension from that of our world. One day and night 
                      in this heaven is 400 years in our human world on Earth, and one year 
                      in Tusita Heaven is 140,000 Earth years. The celestial life span of Maitreya 
                      Bodhisattva is 4,000 years, which is equivalent to 5.67 billion years 
                      on Earth at that time. This length of time is going to pass before Maitreya 
                      Bodhisattva returns to this world to attain Buddhahood. This is the reason 
                      why all Buddhists now address Maitreya Bodhisattva as the 'To-be-born 
                      Honoured Maitreya Buddha'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">'To-be' infers 'future'. 
                      It also implies that it will definitely be Maitreya who comes, and no 
                      other Buddha! It refers to a future event. But when exactly in the future 
                      and in which country will this great Maitreya Bodhisattva be born into 
                      this world to attain Buddhahood? Our Earth goes through four main stages 
                      of Formation, Existence, Destruction and Void. These four stages comprise 
                      80 small kalpas which make one great kalpa. Each stage will take the period 
                      of one medium kalpa, which is equivalent to 20 small kalpas. Starting 
                      from an average human life span of 84,000 years, the life expectancy is 
                      reduced at a rate of one year per hundred years until the average human 
                      life span is ten years. The process then reverses: the average human life 
                      span is increased at a rate of one year per hundred years until the average 
                      human life span returns to 84,000 years. This cycle of a decreasing and 
                      then increasing human life span constitutes one small kalpa.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">On our Earth, during 
                      the 20 small kalpas of the Formation Stage, there were no Buddhas born. 
                      The arrival of Buddhas only started during the eighth small kalpa of the 
                      Existence Stage. Sakyamuni Buddha came to this world during the ninth 
                      small kalpa, and Maitreya will only arrive in the tenth small kalpa when 
                      the human life span commences its descent from 84,000 years. When that 
                      happens, he will be honoured 'Maitreya' and will be the successor to Sakyamuni 
                      Buddha. At that time, the world will be a prosperous, peaceful and happy 
                      place. This is the reason people will address him as the 'Prosperous Buddha' 
                      or 'Happy Buddha'.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Maitreya is a blessed 
                      Buddha. At the time when he arrives to be born, the earth will have gone 
                      through many changes. Mountains, rivers, cliffs and gorges will have disappeared, 
                      and most parts of the Earth will have become flat plains. The seas will 
                      be calm and the soil fertile, so there will be many natural recreational 
                      parks. Favourable weather conditions will prevail throughout the four 
                      seasons. Beautiful flowers will blossom everywhere and everything will 
                      be pleasant. Crops and harvests will be plentiful. Fruits will be beautiful 
                      and sweet. Grains will grow naturally and without husk. They will be extremely 
                      fragrant and tasty. When matured, the grains will be readily edible without 
                      the need for cooking. Feeding on them, people will enjoy longevity and 
                      will be free from sickness. There will be no natural disasters. Everyone 
                      will be kind, good-natured, and free of evil thoughts and behaviour. Greed, 
                      anger, ignorance, arrogance, suspicionï¿½. killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, 
                      false speech, intoxication ï¿½.etc, unwholesome thoughts and bad conduct 
                      all will not exist. Everyone will realise the wonderful practice of cultivating 
                      the three pure karmas of body, speech and mind. They will exhibit equality 
                      in thinking and will not discriminate. They will distance from disputes 
                      and will be amicable and joyous with each another. They will utter good 
                      words of encouragement, perform numerous virtuous deeds and refrain from 
                      all evil deeds. There will be no need to worry about food and drink. As 
                      for clothing, weaving will not be needed, since soft delicate garments 
                      of different styles will grow from celestial garment trees on earth. People 
                      can help themselves to these for clothing. Palaces and houses will miraculously 
                      appear, and the ground filth-free. As for latrines, whenever people need 
                      to relieve themselves, the ground will automatically open up to receive 
                      their waste and then close up afterward. The ground will produce different 
                      kinds of precious gems that can casually be handpicked by anyone. Admiring 
                      and playing with these gems, people will say, "I've heard that in past 
                      kalpas (possibly referring to our present kalpa) people hurt one another 
                      over such gems and precious stones. They were imprisoned and suffered 
                      all sorts of distress. Now these gems and precious stones are like tiles 
                      and stones which no one needs to guard over. This really is a pure and 
                      peaceful world."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At that time, even 
                      though the world will consist of many small countries, only one big country 
                      will be the common ruler. On the Earth will be a vast plain, covering 
                      four million Li (é‡Œ ), with four great oceans located in each direction. 
                      There will exist a big city named Ketumati City (é¸¡ å¤´ åŸŽ ), spanning 
                      500 Li from east to west, and 280 Li from north to south. The land is 
                      flat and expansive and well populated with people. The streets are neat 
                      and orderly. In the sky above, there will be a dragon king named 'Water 
                      Radiance', drizzling fragrant water at night and maintaining breezy sunny 
                      weather during the day. In the city, a Yaksa (ç½— æ�€ ä»Ž , Demon) by the 
                      name of 'Leaf-Flower', will appear in the middle of the night to serve 
                      the people; removing the filth from the city, sweeping and cleaning, and 
                      sprinkling the ground with perfumes so that the city will be very clean 
                      and fragrant. Dragons, deities and ghosts will work for the benefit of 
                      human beings. They neither need offerings to be made to them nor do they 
                      need to be worshipped, as such superstitious practices will no longer 
                      exist. The climate and environment will be favourable; the citizens gentle 
                      and amiable; and ghosts and deities will provide their support and protection. 
                      These conditions effect the birth of a 'Turning-Wheel Saint King' (è½¬ 
                      è½®åœ£ çŽ‹ ) named Rang-qu. Ketumati is his capital city. The King will apply 
                      Buddha-dharma to govern and guide his subjects. He has the Golden Wheel 
                      Treasure, Elephant Treasure, Horse Treasure, Pearl Treasure, the Lady 
                      of Virtue and Beauty Treasure, the Minister of Soldiers Treasure, and 
                      the Minister of Treasure. He will secure the city with these treasures, 
                      rather than with conventional swords and batons. The place will be carefree 
                      and joyous, and freedom, peace and equality will prevail.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">During this time, 
                      the treasures of the world are gathered and stored in four small countries 
                      controlled by Saint King Rang-qu: the first location is the Yi-luo-bo 
                      (ä¼Š</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">ç½—é’µ</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">) 
                      great treasury of Qian-tuo-yue Country (ä¹¾é™€ è¶Š å›½ ), the second is the 
                      Ban-chou (èˆ¬ ç»¸ </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">) 
                      great treasury of Mi-ti-luo Country (å¼¥ æ�� ç½— å›½), the third is the great 
                      treasury of Xiang-lai-chi-da Country (é¡¹ èµ– å�± è¾¾ å›½ ), and the fourth 
                      is the Rang-qu great treasury of Bo-luo-na Country (æ³¢ ç½— æ�º å›½ ). The 
                      quantities of precious gems and exquisite items stored in these four treasuries 
                      are too numerous to be counted. All items stored in the Rang-qu Treasury 
                      at Bo-luo-na Country are treasures of tribute that King Rang-qu receives 
                      from all over the world. Hence, the treasury is named after the Saint 
                      King in commemoration. Nonetheless, everything in the four treasuries 
                      still belongs to the humanity of the world. The King does not consider 
                      them his personal possessions. The personnel managing the treasures are 
                      entrusted with the responsibility of helping and aiding others. Whenever 
                      they learn of poor people in the world, they report to the Saint King 
                      and then the treasure is generously used for aid. Any such act of generosity 
                      toward the people brings great joy to the Saint King's heart. At this 
                      time, people in the world have no worry regarding food, clothing, housing, 
                      transport, recreation, bearing and raising children and education. Those 
                      considered 'poor' are only but those living in the outskirts who do not 
                      have precious ornaments to adorn themselves with. ('poor' only to this 
                      extent) Whenever the Saint King sees men and women, young and old, regardless 
                      of racial skin colour, with dignified, healthy bodies, upright, bright 
                      and pleasant countenances, he will be very satisfied.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">This brilliant and 
                      virtuous Saint King has the best Prime Minister by the name of 'Subrahmana' 
                      (ä¿® æ¢µ æ‘© ), a good friend of the Saint King in his youth. He is very 
                      learned and outstanding in his talents, and more knowledgeable than anyone 
                      else. He has a transcending perspective and remarkable wisdom. And he 
                      is compassionate in helping others. Both the Saint King and Subrahmana 
                      possess upright countenance and healthy good-looking physiques. They are 
                      both young and capable. Among the world's women of virtue and beauty, 
                      Subrahmana's wife, Brahmavati (æ¢µ æ‘© è¶Š ), is the most intelligent, wise, 
                      virtuous, moral, knowledgeable and capable. She is deeply compassionate, 
                      dignified, and exquisite, unparalleled anywhere on Earth, just like the 
                      Deva Sakka's (å¤© ä¸Š å¸� é‡Š ) wife in Heaven. Her breath is fragrant as 
                      the 'You-po-luo Flower' (ä¼˜ é’µç½— å�Ž ), and her body exudes the natural 
                      scent of sandalwood. She has not any of the 84 types of pretentiousness 
                      of common womenfolk. In her entire life, she is never sick nor does she 
                      suffer any pain or tragedy. She is always free from any distracting and 
                      wild thoughts, distress and bitter melancholy. All of this is the consequence 
                      of her previous lives' cultivation of pure karma of body, speech and mind. 
                      In their previous lifetimes throughout aeons of past kalpas, everything 
                      of Subrahmana's and Brahmavati's thoughts, deeds and speech, comprise 
                      moral work, cultivating, practising giving and performing charity for 
                      the masses. This has resulted in their now being the prime ministerial 
                      family. Not only are they well honoured and respected by all the people, 
                      but even those living in heaven praise them highly and consider them quite 
                      rare and extraordinary.</span></p>

                            is due, in the same manner as Sakyamuni Buddha's birth, Maitreya 
                            emerges from the right side of his mother's upper body. The entire

                      up, he profoundly senses that all worldly knowledge is really only mundane 
                      and he would be better off renouncing the world to cultivate as a monk. 
                      And so, at the outskirts of Ketumati City, in the exceptionally resplendent 
                      scenery of Hua-lin Garden (å�Ž æž— å›­ ), he renounces his worldly life. 
                      In the garden is a big Dragon-Flower Tree, named for its dragon-like branches 
                      and dragonhead-like flowers. During the midnight of the first day of his 
                      renunciation, Maitreya Bodhisattva enters into deep meditation under the 
                      Dragon-Flower Tree and instantly attains supreme enlightenment. Maitreya's 
                      attainment of Buddhahood quakes the Three Thousand Great Chiliocosm. The 
                      earth deities take off in their separate ways, spreading the news. Everyone 
                      in the Heaven of Four Heavenly Kings, Thirty Three Heavens (Tavatimsa), 
                      Heaven of Devas Yama, Tusita Heaven, Nirmanarati Heaven, Paranirmitavasavartin

                      become aware that Maitreya has attained Buddhahood. He will be the teacher 
                      of celestial and human beings! The Deva King of Paranirmitavasavartin 
                      Heaven residing on the sixth level of the World of Desire brings all his 
                      celestial followers down from heaven to pay reverence to the Buddha. From 
                      that time onwards, Maitreya Tathagata commences spreading the Dharma to 
                      all the human and celestial beings, resulting in many human and celestial

                            people eventually renounce the world and attain 'Arahathood ' (fourth

                      comes to Maitreya Buddha, requesting to be taught the Dharma. Soon after, 
                      the Saint King passes his reign over to his crown prince, and renounces 
                      to follow the Buddha. He becomes a member of the Sangha community and 
                      attains Arahathood.</span></p>

                      Buddha reaches Maitreya's father, Subrahmana Elder, he too leads a group 
                      of 84,000 cultivating Brahmins to renounce the world, become members of 
                      Sangha and attain Arahathood. Maitreya Buddha's mother, Lady Brahmavati 
                      also leads 84,000 court ladies to renounce the world with the Buddha, 
                      become Bhiksuni (Buddhist nuns), and attain Arahathood. The Buddha's mother's 
                      renunciation has such a great influence on the women that tens of thousands 
                      of other womenfolk come to Maitreya Buddha, requesting to renounce and 
                      practise the Dharma. Most of those who are deeply rooted in virtue gradually 
                      attain enlightenment. And as for the many who are yet to attain enlightenment, 
                      Maitreya Buddha gives them the Teachings of the Three-Vehicles: the Great 
                      Vehicle, Middle Vehicle and Small Vehicle.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Throughout Maitreya 
                      Buddha's entire life of delivering discourses on the Dharma, he guides 
                      and enlightens infinite numbers of sentient beings. Among the various 
                      Dharma discourses, there are 3 great assemblies: The first assembly teaches 
                      and guides 9.6 billion people, the second assembly, 9.4 billion people, 
                      and the third assembly, 9.2 billion people. These assemblies are the highly 
                      renowned 'Dragon-Flower Triple Assemblies' of the future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Thus during this period, 
                      the Saha world is transformed into the pure land of Maitreya Buddha. All 
                      who have been guided and enlightened attain Arahathood. The numbers of 
                      those who receive guidance and deliverance in assemblies in the heavens, 
                      human realm and elsewhere are infinitely many. It is not by chance that 
                      those who have been guided and delivered by the Buddha attain enlightenment 
                      instantly. Rather it is truly the result of their own cultivation of blessings, 
                      morality and wisdom through aeons of kalpas. During the Period of Pure 
                      Dharma, the Semblance Period, and the End of Dharma Period of the era 
                      of Sakyamuni Buddha, most of them had planted their virtuous roots, established 
                      extensive links with the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, learned and practised 
                      Buddhism, performed good deeds for many others, observed the precepts 
                      and recited the Buddha's name, and spread the Dharma and benefited sentient 
                      beings.</span></p>

                      has lived a full life of 84,000 years, he enters Nirvana. And the legacy

                      in our human world and attains Buddhahood. Sakyamuni Buddha narrated this 
                      at Anathapindika Park in Jetavana Grove of Sravasti, to an assembly of 
                      1,500 disciples. Ananda, with a bare right shoulder, knelt upon his right

                      You are well aware of the names and honourable titles of all the past 
                      Buddhas, and the numbers of followers, disciples and Bodhisattvas. Whether 
                      it be one kalpa, or a hundred, or innumerable kalpas, your observation 
                      is complete. Further, you know the kings, ministers and citizens, telling 
                      them apart by their individual names. As for today's world, you have full 
                      knowledge of the present numbers of territories and the extent of national 
                      boundaries. Disciples following you eagerly wish to hear about the distant 
                      future to come, about Maitreya's appearance and attainment of Buddhahood, 
                      all the changes that will occur, how bountiful and joyous the state of 
                      the Buddha world will be, and how much more time is to pass before then."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Time and again, Ananda 
                      humbly requested. And in response to this plea that Ananda made on behalf 
                      of all those present at the assembly, the compassionate Buddha spoke this 
                      prophetic sutra. The 'Sutra of the Coming of Maitreya' has been well documented 
                      and referenced in many other sutras.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Taking the Buddhism 
                      Tripitaka and Twelve Sections of the Buddhist Scriptures as our guiding 
                      compass, let us all cultivate our minds and actions, and diligently progress 
                      on the right path. We should extensively establish virtuous links with 
                      the Buddha, distance ourselves from evils, and perform virtuous deeds. 
                      Let us all come together to implement Humanity Vehicle Buddhism, build 
                      a pure land in this world, dignify the minds and bodies of all people, 
                      maintain the conditions for rebirth in the human realm, and ready ourselves 
                      for the period in the next 5.67 billion years, when we will all come together 
                      to welcome the arrival of Maitreya Bodhisattva in our human world, and 
                      celebrate his attainment of Buddhahood.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>
