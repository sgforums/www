Why is there a relationship between what I do now and my next rebirth?</blockquote>rebirth is caused by the continuation of the mental processes of the dead person in a new body. The new person however is not identical to the one that left the previous body (a lot of causes and conditions come into play to shape this new being), nor a completely different person (because of causality relation).<br><br>"According to Buddhism, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all component or conditioned things are impermanent and in a constant state of flux.</span> Therefore in opposition,the existence of an unchanging and independent self, in this world,is denied since it goes against the Buddhist principle of selflessness (anatta). Thus Buddhists teach that a reborn being is <strong>neither entirely different nor exactly the same </strong><br><br><strong>example</strong><br><br>Light a candle with a match, or visualise doing it. Hold the wick directly above the lighted match, but not actually touching the flame. Watch carefully. The wick will begin to smoke, and will then burst into flame. <span style="color: blue;">Does the flame jump from the match to the candle? Is the candle flame the same as the flame on the match, or is it a different one? If</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">we describe the process scientifically we will say that the heat from the flame on the match vaporised some paraffin wax from the candle, and the paraffin vapour ignited, producing a new flame. The two flames are separate and burn from different fuels, but are causally related.</span><br><br><blockquote>Secondly, since there is no shared identity, why is there no confusion and mix up?<br><br>If there is no shared identity, can it really be said that 'I' get reborn? Because in my next life it's not me already, it's a totally new and different entity, with no memory of past, it's a different entity. Like ice becomes water. So is there really a rebirth?   </blockquote>Neither the same nor another<br><br><strong>illustration</strong><br><br>In the case of a pot of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">milk that turns first to curds, then to butter, then to ghee</span>; it would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not be right to say that the ghee, butter and curds were the same as the milk,</span> but <span style="color: blue;">they have come from that so neither would it be right to say that they are something else</span><br><br>Just as an electric light is the outward visible manifestations of invisible electric energy, even so we are the outward manifestations of invisible Kammic energy. The bulb may break, and the light may be extinguished, but the current remains and the light may be reproduced in another bulb. In the same way, the Kammic force remains undisturbed by the disintegration of the physical body, and the passing away of the present consciousness leads to the arising of a fresh one in another birth. But nothing unchangeable or permanent "passes" from the present to the future.<br><br><strong>illustration.</strong><br><br>A: Â“It is like a fire that a man might kindle and, having warmed himself, he might leave it burning and go away. Then if that fire were to set light to another manÂ’s field and the owner were to seize him and accuse him before the king, and he were to say, <span style="color: blue;">Â‘Your majesty, I did not set this manÂ’s field on fire. The fire that I left burning was different to that which burnt his field. I am not guilty.Â’ </span><span style="font-style: italic;">Would he deserve punishment?Â”</span><br><br>B: <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Indeed, yes, because whatever he might say the latter fire resulted from the former one.Â”</span><br><br><strong>By this mind and matter deeds are done and because of those deeds another mind and matter is reborn; but that mind and matter is not thereby released from the results of its previous deeds.Â”</strong><br><br><strong>Also, how is it determined that the relationship is linear or whatever it is. Why is it not random? For instance, why can't I do something good in this lifetime but be reborn as an idiot in next lifetime? Why cant a criminal kill many people but be reborn as a scholar? How is it determined that good will yield good, evil will yield evil?</strong><br><br><strong>Karma</strong>.There is no good or evil rather <strong>unskillful or unwholesome action </strong><br><br><strong>example</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you fall down from a tree and break your leg, it is not a matter of justice or punishment, but simply the operation of the law of gravity, a natural law which we all are subject to</span>. Likewise, if <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you eat good food and remain healthy, your health is only natural, not a reward given to you by some supreme being. </span>Whether a supreme being exists or not, you will remain healthy and strong if you treat yourself properly in accordance with the law of nature. Of course, we may refer to the broken leg as a punishment and good health as a reward, but that is just a way of talking. <strong>The law of kamma operates in much the same manner, the difference being that it functions within the framework of morality, based on the principle of cause and effect. </strong><br><br></div>

Some karma are so strong that it will take it's toll on numerous rebirth.  Example, your relationship with your family.  They could have already created this affinity with you in numerous lifetimes.  So likewise, what you do now, will be affecting your future rebirth, maybe not once, but countless.<br><br>Rebirth and Karma is closely interlinked, and it's not as easy as the idea of reap and sow.  There is a possibility of you doing something good, and reborned as a mentally handicapped person the next life.  This effect may not be caused by the things you've done in the immediate past life, could be due to something that was done numerous lives ago, where the cause has finally ripen.  But maybe due to the good you have done in this life, you will encounter good life, though with the handicaped body.<br><br>There are many tests done by Scientists on the idea of rebirth, and if you are into Tibetan Buddhism, many gurus have encountered numerous times of rebirth, and they have very clear memories of their past lives.<br><br>I think the fundamental is to understand Karma, and really put Buddhism into practise, so that we could be free from the rebirth cycle in the 6 realm.<br><br></div>
