              <p>I dunno whats the fuss, but there are some in the sangha community in thailand that forbid or does not recognise the bhikuni ordination in perth. Ajahn Brahm presided over the ordination and he certainly didnt do anything wrong or against the vinaya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Didnt Buddha allow and ordain female followers as bhikuni? are there female bhikunis in thailand? whats the reason for some to forbid the ordination?</p>

              <p>The Vinaya says that in order for ordination of Bhikunis, it requires a presence of 2 Bhikkus and 2 Bhikunis.</p>
              <p>Since the Theravada Lineage for the Bhikunis are long gone after the decline of Buddhism in India, it was generally considered to be lost from the world, in Theravada POV. The Theravada Nuns never set their foot to Thailand or Burma in the past due to the limitation of female nuns to travel far, but they did set their foot to Sri Lanka (which was eventually lost too).</p>
              <p>Therefore, some of the senior Theravada monks, are very reluctant to revive the lineage for the very fact that they are NOT the Buddha who was the first person to ordain a Bhikkunis.</p>
              <p>So the contention here is : There isn't any more Theravada Nuns in the world today, and ordination of Nuns requires 2 senior Monks and 2 senior Nuns.</p>

              <h1>Full Ordination for Nuns Restored in Sri Lanka</h1>
              <h3>By Ven. Ani Jutima</h3>
              <p>After a hiatus of one thousand years, Theravadin women once more have
               the opportunity 
                to ordain as bhikkhunis and thus become full members of the Sangha. 
              Traditionally 
                the Sangha is composed of fully ordained nuns (bhikkhuna), fully 
              ordained monks 
                (bhikkhu), novice nuns (samanera), and novice monks (samanera).</p>
              <p>From the 3rd century BCE when King Ashoka’s son, Mahinda, and 
              daughter. 
                Sanghamitta, brought the ordination lineages of both monks and nuns 
              from India 
                to Sri Lanka, there was a long, proud history of male and female 
              monasticism 
                on this island.</p>
              <p>In the 11th century, as a result of war, drought and famine, both the
               monks’ 
                and nuns’ orders died out in Sri Lanka. The bhikkhu order was revived 
                within one generation by inviting a group of bhikkhus from Siam 
              [Thailand] who 
                fulfilled the requirements for giving bhikkhu ordination. However, as 
              the bhikkhuni 
                order did not exist in any other Theravada country, the requirement 
              that a bhikkhuni 
                receive her ordination from a group of ten bhikkhunis of ten years 
              standing 
                followed by a further ceremony presided over by monks could not be 
              met. Thus 
                the bhikkhuni lineage lapsed.</p>
              <p>Hence, since the beginning of the 11th century, women wishing to 
              commit themselves 
                to the renunciate life have had only one option: ten lay precepts. 
              Even the 
                ten precepts of a samaneri have been denied them, since in the 
              Theravada tradition 
                these can be given only by a bhikkhuni. The status of these ten 
              precept nuns, 
                known a Dasa Sil Matas (literally Ten Precept Mothers), is ambiguous; 
              they are 
                considered neither proper monastics nor lay women either.(1)</p>
              <p>The situation in the other Theravada countries is even more 
              difficult. It seems 
                that in Thailand and Cambodia there never were bhikkhunis, and 
              although they 
                were possibly present in Burma at one time, there too the lineage did 
              not survive. 
                In modern times, Burma has nuns with the ten lay precepts who, like 
              the Dasa 
                Sil Matas in Sri Lanka, are not thought to be true nuns. In Thailand 
              and Cambodia, 
                even the ten lay precepts are denied women, and the nuns there are 
              restricted 
                to eight precepts with a corresponding diminishment of status.(2)</p>
              <p>Thus the four-fold community of fully ordained nuns, fully ordained 
              monks, 
                lay women and lay men, which the Buddha clearly declared was integral 
              to the 
                success of the Buddhadhamma, has been absent from all Theravada 
              countries for 
                one thousand years.</p>
              <p>Recently, however, after extensive research by a group of women from 
              Sri Lanka 
                and Europe, it was confirmed that the bhikkhuni lineage extant in 
              Taiwan and 
                Korea is actually of Sri Lankan origin and therefore could 
              legitimately be used 
                to ordain Theravada nuns and restore the bhikkhuni order.</p>
              <p>Although I received novice ordination in the Tibetan tradition in 
              1993, being 
                in my heart a Theravadin and having a long association with the Thai 
              forest 
                tradition, I decided recently to go to Sri Lanka to receive the 
              samaneri vows 
                of the Theravada vinaya school.(3) It was a very happy experience for 
              me, and 
                I came away deeply impressed with the situation that is developing 
              there—impressed 
                with the bhikkhunis and samaneris I met, and inspired by the impact 
              the female 
                sangha is having on their society.</p>
              <p>Since the first ordination of Sri Lankan bhikkhunis in 1996, which 
              was conducted 
                in Sarnath, India by Korean monks and nuns, there have been further 
              ordination 
                ceremonies in Bodh Gaya and in Sri Lanka. There are now over 200 fully
               ordained 
                nuns as well as many novice nuns who are planning to receive the 
              higher ordination, 
                which they are eligible to do after having kept their samaneri vows 
              for two 
                years.</p>
              <p>Behind this amazing resurgence is an organization called Sakyadhita, 
              Daughters 
                of the Buddha, which was established at a conference of Buddhist women
               held 
                in Bodh Gaya in 1987. Since then there have been six Sakyadhita 
              conferences, 
                including one held in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 1993. At the time of that 
              conference 
                there was strong opposition from the religious authorities of Sri 
              Lanka even 
                to placing the topic of bhikkhuni ordination on the agenda. However as
               an outgrowth 
                of that conference, and from the exposure the Dasa Sil Matas have had 
              to fully 
                ordained nuns from other traditions, the aspiration to revive the 
              Theravada 
                bhikkhuni lineage was born. With careful negotiation over several 
              years and 
                the eventual support of prominent members of the (male) monastic 
              community, 
                the situation changed completely.</p>
              <p>It has been said before that there is nothing more powerful than an 
              idea whose 
                time has come.</p>
              <p>Much of the vision and energy for the project has come from Mrs. 
              Ranjani de 
                Silva, who attended the first Sakyadhita conference in Bodh Gaya, has 
              been its 
                President since 1995, and who conceived and organized the 3rd 
              conference in 
                Colombo.</p>
              <p>During my visit to Sri Lanka I stayed at the Sakyadhita Training 
              Centre established 
                at Panadura, south of Colombo. At the Centre regular programmes are 
              organized 
                for the nuns on such topics as community health care, counseling 
              skills and 
                social development. Nuns come from small nunneries all over the island
               to attend 
                these training sessions; they seem to be motivated by a strong desire 
              to be 
                of practical benefit in their communities. There are also young nuns 
              attending 
                university where they are studying Pali language, Buddhist philosophy,
               Buddhist 
                history and other related topics.</p>
              <p>In addition to providing the facilities for these training 
              programmes, the 
                Centre is ‘home’ to seven nuns, and I felt privileged to have the 
                opportunity to spend time with them. Some of them are doing university
               studies, 
                and the older, educated nuns teach. Neighbourhood children come for 
              Dhamma classes; 
                local people, often women, come to talk, to receive advice, or to 
              participate 
                in the evening puja.</p>
              <p>On three occasions during my brief stay we were invited out to family
               homes 
                for the daily meal. Two of these were anniversaries of family deaths, 
              and the 
                senior nuns conducted all the necessary ceremonies with confidence and
               dignity. 
                In the past it would have been monks fulfilling these functions, so it
               is significant 
                that some families are now choosing to invite nuns to officiate 
              instead.</p>
              <p>For me, however, it is the third invitation that is the most 
              memorable. It 
                came from a rather poor family living just down the lane near the 
              Sakyadhita 
                Centre. When the Centre was first built and the nuns began living 
              there, the 
                husband, known in the neighbourhood as an abusive drunkard who 
              terrorised his 
                family, was deeply hostile to the presence of the nuns. I was told 
              that if he 
                discovered his wife or three young daughters had visited the nuns, 
              they were 
                beaten. And there we were, two years later, being offered a meal by 
              the whole 
                family, sober husband included, in their living room. The reverence, 
              the delight 
                and the quiet pride were palpable.</p>
              <hr>
              <p>Ranjani de Silva has extended an invitation to Theravada women 
              everywhere who 
                want to ordain to contact her, and she will do whatever she can to 
              help. She

              <p>If i do remember correctly, the first nuns who gave the bhikkhuni ordination in China were nuns who came from Sri Lanka. In fact, a lot of the new Sri Lankan bhikkunis took their ordination at Taiwanese nunneries.</p>

              <p>1. He definetly would know, do look up at the Buddhist Channel about this, especially since he was accorded a rank akin to "Bishop" by the King of Thailand a few years back.</p>
              <p>2. None actually. Basically a lot of it was like not following "Thai Law" and "Thai culture" which he was "supposed" to follow, especially after being accorded a high rank.  Another thing is also because the ordination was supposedly done in 'secret', ie, not informing the elders at the temple in Thailand before going ahead with the ordination. Of course, if he did let them know, the ordination might not have gone ahead because the Thai side would definetly have disallowed it.</p>

Two weeks later, I decided to shave my head and become a nun. At the time, I was a student at the law school of National Taiwan University, and wanted to be a lawyer or even a politician. I had felt, since I was a child, great sympathy toward the suppressed classes in society and was attracted to fairness and justice.

Three decades ago, most of Fo Guang Shan’s members were women and most of them were young, in their twenties and thirties, and with a college education. The whole community was very dynamic and energetic, full of hope and life. The founder of the order, Venerable Master Hsing Yun, called for young and educated people to join the Sangha. During those two weeks, I myself had a personal transformation, and changed my path as a lawyer into that of a monastic. </span><span style="line-height: 150%;  "></span></span></p>

One day, we students were invited by a devotee to stay in a hotel, where the bed in the room was high-up and large. One of the ten precepts is to restrain oneself from sleeping on such a bed. I asked the Venerable Master what I should do. “You need be able to sleep on either the small one or the big one,” he said. “Both are fine.” That was a wonderful lesson, because the reason I came to Buddhism was to look for liberation and not bondage, for the ultimate truth, and not just rules—and some rules in the Vinaya seemed to be unfair, especially the many ones for women. </span></span></p>

With his support and Fo Guang Shan’s sponsorship, I finished a Master’s degree in philosophy from Hawaii University and the Ph.D. in Religion from Yale within eight years. For my dissertation, I decided to study the Vinaya and the monastic codes of India and China. When I finished my dissertation, I cried out, “Gotama! This old man was so wise and kind.” I felt this to be so, because the Buddha left so much flexibility with the rules, so there were exceptions to particular rules whenever they created inconvenience in the Sangha. </span></span></p>
