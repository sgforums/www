              to Buddhist Patriarchy </span></a></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In order to become a force for social change, Buddhism
              needs to rid itself of enduring ills—the barring of female ordination first
              among them. Ajahn Brahm </span><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #444444;'>January 30, 2015 </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, an
              African-American woman refused to obey a bus driver’s order to give up her seat
              to a white passenger. This simple act of defiance became one of the most
              important symbols of the modern Civil Rights Movement in the United States.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Before she passed away in 2005, Rosa Parks became a
              Buddhist—at age 92. One can speculate that this female icon—and fierce opponent
              of discrimination—chose Buddhism because it lends itself to the advancement of
              social justice causes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">She was right.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Buddhism should advance the particular social justice
              issues described in United Nations Millenium Development Goal Number Three (MDG
              3): Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. For Buddhism to grow in our
              modern world, we need to do more than teach meditation, preach inspiring
              sermons, and make the sutras available online. We are good at studying,
              publishing, and spreading the word of Buddhism. Where we have not been very
              successful is showcasing the compassion and selflessness of the dharma by our
              actions. We have written many more words in our books than what few kind words
              we have spoken to the poor, lonely, and desperate. We have built so many more
              temples than orphanages.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Theravada Buddhism’s current male leadership, in
              particular, needs to clearly demonstrate its commitment to MDG 3 through the
              acceptance of bhikkhuni [nun] ordination. Only then can the Theravada sangha
              use its considerable influence to make a fairer world—one where people are
              judged by their character, not by their gender.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Theravada Buddhist monks, generally speaking, are very
              conservative. Claiming to be the guardians of “original Buddhism,” they
              consider one of their most important duties the preservation of these precious
              early teachings. However, monks of all traditions in all countries—and Buddhist
              lay scholars as well—accept that there were fully ordained women, called
              bhikkhuni, in the lifetime of the Buddha. Moreover, in these early teachings,
              the Buddha clearly states that he seeks to give full ordination to women:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Ananda, once I was staying at Uruvela on the bank of
              the river Neranjara [present day Bodh Gaya] under the Goatherd’s Banyan tree,
              when I had just attained supreme enlightenment. And Mara the Evil One came to
              me, stood to one side, and said, ‘May the Blessed One now attain final Nibbana;
              may the Sugata [Buddha] now attain final Nibbana. Now is the time for the
              Blessed Lord’s final Nibbana.’ </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">At this, I said to Mara: ‘Evil One, I will not take
              final Nibbana until I have bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay men, and lay women
              followers who are accomplished, trained, skilled, learned, knowers of the
              dhamma, trained in conformity with the dhamma, correctly trained and walking in
              the path of the dhamma, who will pass on what they have gained from their
              teacher, teach it, declare it, establish it, expound it, analyse it, make it
              clear, until they shall be able, by means of the dhamma, to refute false
              teachings that have arisen and teach the dhamma of wondrous effect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Theravada Buddhists should have an advantage over
              other major world religions because their tradition explicitly gives equity to
              women. Christianity has no tradition of gender equality in its priesthood—nor
              does Islam, Judaism, or the various schools of Hinduism. Buddhism stood ahead
              of its time in granting such status to women from “when [the Buddha] had just
              attained supreme enlightenment<em>” </em>at Bodh Gaya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Nevertheless, there remain two significant obstacles
              to the acceptance of bhikkhuni ordination in Theravada Buddhism: (1) Ignorance
              about who makes the decisions that govern the sangha, and (2) Ignorance of the
              Vinaya, the rules established by the Buddha that restrict what decisions may be
              made. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As to that first point, for instance, many monks in
              Thailand argue that a 1928 ruling from the Sangharaja [head Buddhist monk] of
              Thailand, Phra Bancha Somdet Phra Sangharacha Jiao Gromluang Jinawarn Siriwad,
              banned the ordination of female monks: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">It is unallowable for any bhikkhu to give the
              going-forth [ordination] to women. Any woman who wishes to ordain as a <em>samaneri</em> [novice nun] in accordance with the Buddha’s allowances, has to be ordained by
              a fully ordained bhikkhuni. The Buddha laid down the rule that only a bhikkhuni
              over 12 <em>vassas</em> [an annual three-month retreat] is eligible to be a <em>preceptor</em> [ceremonial guide who delivers vows]. Since there are no more fully fledged
              bhikkhunis to pass on the lineage, there are thus no samaneris who have
              obtained a proper ordination from a fully fledged bhikkhuni.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Besides the antiquity of the ruling, one could also
              point out that the Sangharaja of Thailand, together with the Thai Council of
              Elders [senior monks], is only permitted to rule on matters directly concerning
              the monks and novices of the two main Thai Buddhist sects, <em>Mahanikaya</em> and <em>Dhammayuttanikaya</em>. They are not legally empowered to rule over the
              affairs of other monastic groups, such as Mahayana monks or nuns. The wait will
              never end for those well-meaning monks holding out hope that the Thai Council
              of Elders will sanction the legitimacy of Theravada bhikkhunis. The Thai
              Council of Elders, after all, is not legally entitled to rule on matters beyond
              its remit.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">As for the Vinaya, the second obstacle that I listed,
              each monastic community is bound to act within its rules.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Renowned Theravada scholar monk Bhikkhu Analayo argues
              that the Thai Sangharaja’s 1928 ruling—and thus, the Vinaya in its current
              form—has no bearing because it directly contradicts the Buddha’s original
              teachings. In a recent publication, “<a href="https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-365456258/the-revival-of-the-bhikkhuni-order-and-the-decline"><span style="color: windowtext;">The Revival of the Bhikkuni
              Order and the Decline of the Sasana</span></a>,” Analayo argues persuasively
              that the Buddha gave authority for bhikkhunis to receive ordination in a dual
              ceremony—both in a sangha of bhikkhunis and then in a sangha of bhikkhus.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">By restoring equity to women in the Theravada sangha
              through reinstating bhikkhuni ordination, we will address the inferior status
              of women in many Theravada countries, promote gender equity in education, and
              thereby make a strong statement in support of the third UN Millennium
              Development Goal: gender equality and the empowerment of women.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">In a <a href="http://sakyadhita.org/docs/resources/newsletters/21-1-2012.pdf"><span style="color: windowtext;">recent paper</span></a>,
              scholars Emma Tomalin and Caroline Starkey explore the role that Buddhism in
              Thailand and Cambodia plays in maintaining gender disparity in education.
              Ultimately they ask, “What is the relationship between the reassertion of
              women’s traditional ordination rights and female empowerment through
              education?” Since, as they note, “several scholars, both Thai and Western, have
              implicated Buddhism as one explanatory factor for the historical inequality
              between genders, particularly in the poorest areas,” many advocates of
              bhikkhuni ordination see “a direct relationship between the low status of women
              in many Buddhist traditions and the inferior status of women within Buddhist
              societies.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">By fixing our own house first, we have the
              considerable opportunity and moral authority—through our books and sermons—to
              inspire our Buddhist followers to work toward gender equality in spheres other
              than religion. Such action would lead to a world with less violence, better
              health, and more prosperity.</span></p>
