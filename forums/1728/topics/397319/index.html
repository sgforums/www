Fear not the forms of the peaceful and wrathful who are one's own thought forms.<br><br>O now when the bardo of rebirth is dawning in one's mind With one single wish, join with the results of meritious acts May the door of the womb be closed and the revulsion recollected The time has come when energy and pure love are needed May one cast off jealousy and meditate upon the father-mother<br><br>O procrastinating one, who thinks not of the coming of death Devoting oneself to the useless doings of this life, Improvident one is in dissipating ones opportunity Mistaken indeed would ones purpose be now if one returns empty handed Since Dharma is one's need, would one not devote oneself to the Dharma even now?<br><br>Thus say the Great Adepts in devotion If the chosen teaching of the guru not be borne in mind Would one not be acting as a traitor to oneself? It is of great importance that these root words be heard.<br><br>Here begins "The Path of Good Wishes Which Protects from Fear in the Bardo":<br><br>When the cast of chance of one's life is exhausted The relatives of the world avail one not When wandering alone by oneself in the bardo O you conquerors, peaceful and wrathful, exercising the power of your compassion Let it come that the gloom of ignorance is dispelled<br><br>When wandering alone, parted from loving friends When the shapes of one's empty thought-forms dawn upon one here May the Buddhas, exercising the power of their divine compassion That there be neither awe nor terror in the bardo<br><br>When the bright radiances of the five wisdoms shines upon one now May one, neither awed or terrified recognize them to be of oneself When the apparitions of the Peaceful and the Wrathful forms are dawning upon ones mind Let it be that with the assurance of fearlessness that one recognizes the bardo<br><br>When experiencing miseries because of the results of one's actions Let it be that the conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful dispel the miseries When the self-originating sound of reality reverberates like a thousand thunders Let it be that they are transmuted into the sounds of the Mahayana.<br><br>When one is unprotected and habitual influences have been followed here Beseech the conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful for their protection When suffering miseries because of habitual propensities Let it be the blissful Samadhi of clear light dawning upon ones mind<br><br>When assuming supernormal rebirth in the Sidpa Bardo Let it be that the perverting revelations of Mara do not occur within When ones mind arrives wheresoever one wishes Let it be that one not experience the illusory fright and awe from karma.<br><br>When the roarings of savage beasts are uttered Let it be that they are transformed into the Six Syllables (the mantra of the jewel in the lotus) When pursued by snow, rain, wind and darkness Let it be that one sees with the celestial eyes of bright wisdom<br><br>Let it be that all sentient beings of the same harmonious order in the bardo Without jealousy obtain re-birth in the Buddhalands When suffering from intense miseries of hunger and thirst Let it be that one not experience the pangs of hunger and thirst, heat and cold.<br><br>When beholding one's parents in union Let it be that one see them as the divine pair, The conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful, Father and Mother. With the ability of being born anywhere for the benefit of others May one be endowed with signs and graces<br><br>Obtaining for oneself a body, Let it be one that liberates all Without allowing karma to follow Let it be the merits which follow and be multiplied<br><br>Wherever one is born, there and then Let it be that one meets the conquerors, the Peaceful and the Wrathful. With the ability to walk and talk at birth, May it come that one accomplishes the non-forgetting intellect And remember all ones past lives.<br><br>In all the various lores, great, small and intermediate Let it be that one masters hearing, reflecting and seeing In whatever place one is born let it be auspicious And may all sentient beings be endowed with happiness<br><br>O you conquerors, Peaceful and Wrathful, in likeness to your bodies, The number of your followers, duration of your life period, limits of your realms. And in the likeness of ones divine nature Let it be that all others equal you in every way<br><br>By the gift-waves if the innumerable Peaceful and Wrathful deities And by the gift-waves of the wholly pure reality And by the gift-waves of the one- pointed devotion of the mystics Let it be that whatever is wished for be fulfilled here and now.<br><br>The Colophon:<br><br>Through perfectly pure intention In the making of this, through the roots of the merits thereof May the protectorless sentient beings, Mothers, Be placed in the state of the Buddha Let the radiant glory illuminate Jambudvipa (this world) Let this treatise be auspicious And let goodness and virtue be perfected in every way.<br><br>credited to the precious guru, PadmaSambhava<br><br>The Path of Liberation Through Hearing, Reflecting, and Seeing in the Bardo<br><br>Throughout the six realms of samsaric existence this teaching is known as "Liberation Through Hearing and Reflecting". It is not necessary to understand what this teaching means, but rather in simply listening to the words and letting one's own interpretations do the rest. The title means just what it says, particularly the use of the word "through". These teachings are the "Root Verses of the Bardo Thodol", the transition, state of change, life flux, basis of duality, between birth and death; a description of conditioned arising. The deities mentioned are representative of the different aspects of consciousness in one's own mind, and do not represent some external divine being. They form a mandala, a recognizable pattern of archetypal conscious thought forms. Psychologically, they are known to the individual minds of samsaric beings as expressions of egocentricism, namely: (1)ignorance,(2)jealousy, (3)desire, (4)pride, and (5)hatred, as well as the corresponding collective alternatives as (1)bodhisattvic mind,(2)impartiality (justice), (3)altruistic affection, (4)compassion, and (5)all-embracing love. The attributes 2 through 4 constitute the first(1). This teaching is important because of the changes in consciousness, and is not meant to be understood as an intellectual truth or conclusion. It is applicable to uprooting the habitual tendencies of conditioning in one's own mind, but it has no utility otherwise. This teaching is tantric in nature, utilizing duality as a vehicle of skillful means for expounding this dharma and penetrates to the deepest layers of collective unconsciousness. I post it not as an effort of self-aggrandizement, but only to offer it to you without any expectations of reward or condemnation, that all sentient beings realize enlightenment. <br><br>Liberation Through Hearing 1<br>http://reluctant-messenger.com/Tibetan-Book-Dead_Houston1.htm<br><br>Liberation Through Hearing 2<br>http://reluctant-messenger.com/Tibetan-Book-Dead_Houston2.htm<br><br>Death and the Bardo<br>http://reluctant-messenger.com/Tibetan-Book-Dead_Evans-Wentz.htm<br><br>Bardo Thodol Prayer by Thrangu Rinpoche<br>http://www.dharma-media.org/media/mfs.php?mediaID=163</p></div>
