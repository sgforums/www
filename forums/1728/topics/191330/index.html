It is a state of mind. And this state of mind is achieved without a perfect place and time, for a perfect place and time is possible only in the perfected mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>19th May '06<br><br><strong><span class="large">Experimentation</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: olive;">I do some experiments sometimes, mindful ones, just to see what happen. The things done in the experiments aren't always exactly "wise" but sometimes they "have" to be done in order to learn a important lesson the hard way. For example, I might crave for chocolates so much that I let myself buy a whole bunch of them and start eating away. My rational mind tells me that it isn't good for health to eat so much heaty and fattening stuff in one go, while my emotional mind just wants it all. However, at the same time, my rational mind might tell me "Go ahead-follow this blind emotion-but just this once for this silly chocolate craving and see what happens. You already know something bad will happen but you don't believe it enough! Let reality prove itself!"<br><br>And so, as "expected," I might end up with a sore throat or even fever... This might sound crazy, but I do feel that such "relatively harmless" experiments are necessary once in a while. I'll rather get it over with bravely, with a hard lesson learnt once and for all, than let the craving linger on and on, disturbing the mind. The key factor that must be present is mindfulness and bearing all responsibility of whatever results. Never go overboard. Don't even think of trying dangerous and addictive things like drugs!<br><br>Come to think of it, the Buddha could in a sense be said to have been a most courageous experimenter extraordinaire. He wholeheartedly tried practising asceticism to its extreme. In fact, He almost "went overboard," but He listened to His innate Wisdom and gave it up in time. It was His experimentation with asceticism that led to His discovery of the Middle Way. </span><br><br><img src="http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/2003fa/photo/92a.jpg"></div>

However, it is important because habits are what make us. Every sentient being's illusory self is just a bunch of tendencies to do this or that due to habitual forces. In fact, I think kicking off a habit is part and parcel of the process of breaking the illusion of a self that seems so fixed (and condemned by the negativity of the habit). For example, for habits like smoking, how is the best way to quit it naturally? We have first be deeply convinced of the destructiveness of the bad habit, physically and spiritually, deep down in our hearts. The next step is to replace that bad habit with a good one, or at least a neutral one. This is to fill in the sudden feeling of emptiness and urge. Maybe have a bunch of baby carrots around to chew? That's healthy! Vitamins instead of over 400 poisons (in a cigarette)! But as the path to total liberation warrants it that we have to transcend all habitual forces that create attachment, even the carrots have to be "given up" someday! One day, you will feel at total ease. Ah! The state of desirelessness- what bliss!</span> </span><br><br><img src="http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/2001wi/picture/91b.jpg"></div>

One can be so proud that he refuses to admit it. The very moment one refuses to admit that one is proud, one is almost definitely proud. Pride is this strong sense of self that feels justified in every way despite reality being otherwise. In fact, pride distorts reality (this could be why it is hard to detect). We all have pride-to have no pride is to be egoless. For that to happen, one has to be enlightened! Are you an enlightened? Now watch it-you might "proudly" proclaim that you are proud. Be repentant! It is not a glamourous thing! It is different from basic human dignity. It takes a person to be mindful enough to realise that one is indeed proud to some extent. Only then can one seriously work at subduing pride. Are you proud? Answer this mindfully with conviction, with the least pride possible.</span><br><br><img src="http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/2002fa/photo/92c.jpg"></div>

Nowadays, I just look in the direction of the sound and see what it is with an ordinary everyday mind, or even walk straight to it to probe more. No fear, no fuss, but also no guts involved. Just curiosity with a simple mystery to solve. I'm not ruling out the possibilities of the supernatural, but the real monster is usually our unguarded mind gone wild.

            <div class='col-md body'>28th May '06<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Venerable</strong></span><br><br>It is strange to me how some personalities gain more respect and/or attention just by their form or appearance. We seem to create in our minds a certain image of the people we encounter, and our subsequent interaction with them is based on that image created within our psyche. Thus, I sometimes find that people pay greater attention to monks and nuns, simply because they are members of the Sangha. Advice given by a lay person sometimes (if not most of the time) does not carry as much weight, even if the advice is the same as one given by a monk or nun.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Well ... it is a fine quality to love and respect the ones who have forsaken "worldly attachments," but people forget that they are as much human as the rest of us. Also, aren't the rest of us, the lay followers, potential venerables afterall (one never knows...)? So, please continue to venerate the Venerable, the one in everyone.</span><br><br><img src="http://taipei.tzuchi.org.tw/tzquart/2002wi/photo/89bp.jpg"></div>

"It," however, as in my finger, not the moon. He sees not that beyond my finger. I move my finger and he jumps around with it. He only needs to see where my finger leads to to see the moon. But he misses it. So close yet so far away! This is the good old Zen analogy-The finger is the Sutras and teachings that point to the Truth (the moon). The finger is just a guide to the moon. The finger is not the moon. The teachings are not the Truth-they are about the Truth. I think there is a dog in each of us dancing around the finger of Truth. Being "played" by the finger by our own ignorance and attachment to words-missing the real thing all this while. The Truth is between the lines, beyond the lines, beyond form. <span class="large">Be freed by the holy scriptures, not trapped by them!</span> </span><br><br><img src="http://mud.mm-a2.yimg.com/image/469543247"></div>
