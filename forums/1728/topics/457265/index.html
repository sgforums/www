              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I need some help with the paying attention to sensations practice.</p>
              <p>I try to do it but it seems I am doing it wrong and I get confused.</p>
              <p>I have been a member of liberation unleashed</p>
              <p>and have passed through the so called gateless gate</p>
              <p>so, I know what you are talking about when you say no self and impermanence.</p>
              <p>But, the truth is that I am still not sure if passing through the gate was just an intellectual thing for me or If I have really seen it.</p>
              <p>I have read your blog AEN and have read about the seven stages of enlightenment,</p>
              <p>read daniel ingrams core teachings of buddha</p>
              <p>and am trying to start with the attention to sensations.</p>
              <p>So, I would love some help with this.</p>
              <p>I found this forum through reading the moderator's (awakening to reality) posts in the liberation unleashed forum in facebook and really liked what he has to say and would love it if he could help me out.</p>

              <p>Hi, welcome!</p>
              <p>What you must familiarize with yourself is the pure sense of existence, presence, knowingness. This luminosity has never been lost - it is called primordial awareness, yet it is apparently obscured due to our constant distractions and discursive thinking. When cluttered with thoughts, we will not be direct, we do not touch something directly without intermediary. It is touching the luminous essence, the presence, in its entirety, in a non-conceptual and direct manner.</p>
              <p><strong>When you directly realize your luminous essence, there is no more doubt at all, only utter certainty.</strong></p>
              <p>Through Self-Inquiry, we can realize this, but only in the thought realm. That pure sense of Existence, Presence, is only experienced in the subtlest mind realm as a pure thoughtless beingness (which then later becomes reified as a background Witness). But if you are practicing Vipassana, you are simply experiencing and opening up to the clarity of all senses (instead of skewing to a 'pure realm' - in fact we will come to realize later that everything is equal purity in suchness). For there to be effortless non-dual presence/sensation there needs to arise non-dual insight in complements to your practice. But in either self-inquiry or vipassana, still, this "immediate, pure, bare, direct" mode of perceiving the pure clarity or luminosity of "existence" - be it as the I AM (the pure sense of thoughtless beingness/existence) or as a pure sensation or a pure sight or a pure sound.</p>
              <p>When what I call insight into non-dual and later anatta arises, every sensation has this same taste and intensity.</p>
              <p>In terms of practical advise on Vipassana (if that is what you are practicing), do refer to <a href="/forums/1728/topics/419870?page=1">http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/419870?page=1</a></p>

              <p>You must come to realize this through direct experience:</p>
              <p><em>There is knowingness, a luminous clarity, bright and radiance.  This vividness presence and clarity is more real then the real but was obscure by the veil of thought.  This is the ISness Presence that appears mystical and mysterious, ungraspable and hidden.  This is the luminosity aspect of our Buddha's nature.  However the ungraspableness nature of our own essence is not an attribute peculiar only to pure awareness; there is no monopoly at all. In light of prajna wisdom, all phenomenon existence exhibits this ungraspable nature --emptiness nature of reality. </em></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
              <p>The thing I understood is that most important is anatta or lumious clarity or mindfulness</p>
              <p>although I dont know the exact meaning of the terms anatta or luminous clarity, I think I have understood what you mean by them.</p>
              <p>So, if I am not wrong, then what is most important is to just see the sensations, thoughts</p>
              <p>as just arising and disappearing on their own.</p>
              <p>So,
                   when there's a worrying thought, I notice where it's coming from and I 
                  find that it's just arising on it's own. there is no 'me' who is 
                  thinking it. this thought just came and vanished out of nothingness.</p>
              <p>so,
                   at the moment, the practice that I am doing is to remind myself or to 
                  notice where the present thought or sensation is coming from, where 
                  there is really a me who is thinking or doing things. and I keep finding
                   that the thought or sensation or feeling just came by itself.</p>
              <p>there was no doer.</p>
              <p>so, throughout the day I will keep noticing where thoughts or feeling are coming from.</p>
              <p>or in short, throughout the day I will keep looking whether there is any doer of the deeds I am doing or the thoughts I am thinking. will this be the correct way to practice?</p>
              <p>is this the correct way to practice or am I missing something?</p>

              <p>Hi awakenedmind, your focus is so far on impersonality and non-doership. The aspect of non-dual and anatta has not dawned. This is why it is good to focus on experiencing the non-dual luminosity. WIth the pointer of Bahiya Sutta, it can lead to anatta insight. So the purpose of practicing mindfulness is to have direct experience of this non-dual luminosity (vivid cognizance and presence), this aliveness like what asunthatneversets wrote: <em>Also one of the nyams of their practice or realization is that  
              everything around them comes alive... Chairs, rocks, the ground, the sky
                etc.. Everything feels like ones own body feels right now.. Which is  
              naturally because everything is a manifestation of ones own nature and  
              that is a direct experiencing of that. But not everyone has that nyam.</em></p>

                                      emphasized. When we stripped-off the symbolic representation of
                                      Â‘birdÂ’, Â‘chirpingÂ’, Â‘outsideÂ’, Â‘eyes-organÂ’, Â‘ears-organsÂ’,

              <p>Hi <em>awakenedmind</em>, maybe the above thread will be useful to you.  The chatlog is still somewhat long but it's closer to a set of "how to" instructions, which is probably what you are wanting right now.  </p>

              <p>OK, I reckon the following may help clarify a bit more about "how to" practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>P2 says:</strong><br>oh, i mean his [Thusness] vipassana method<br>he's asking us to just 'be'?<br>to be there and fully aware<br>for me at present, i am only able to focus on one sense faculty at a time<br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>AEN says:</strong><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>ur only 'job' is to sense whatever arises as clearly as possible</strong></span><br>whether u are able to maintain focus is another matter...<br>but having a focus on one object is also ok<br>like in <em>anapanasati</em></p>
              <p><strong>P2 says:</strong><br>whatever arises<br>so ok, lemme use an example<br>say i am sitting there and suddenly the tractor downstairs starts to roar<br>that's like the salient sensation... the noise<br>so i shift my focus to hearing it<br>then later, when a cool draft comes<br>that seems more salient... i turn to sensing that?<br>can it be done like that?</p>
              <p><strong>AEN says:</strong><br>yes that's fine<br><strong>u dont need to control ur attention</strong>... unless u are doing formal meditation<br>like anapanasati<br>then some amount of effort to sustain concentration on a single object is necessary</p>
              <p><strong>P2 says:</strong><br>so but i can also sit in meditation with Thusness' sensing method, right?</p>
              <p><strong>AEN says:</strong><br>yes</p>
              <p><strong><br>P2 says:</strong><br>and how does one incorporate 'right view' into this?<br>how will i begin to see the 3 characteristics?</p>
              <p><strong>AEN says:</strong><br>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/realization-and-experience-and-non-dual.html<br>" Lastly, I am not suggesting that there is a definite order of precedence for realizing the profound meaning of the dharma seals; it all depends on the conditions and capacity of each practitioner. But given the choice, start from penetrating the true meaning of anatta first, we will have very different understanding of impermanence, suffering and nirvana once we mature our insight of anatta. "<br>u can remind urself of anatta, like in ven buddhaghosa verse, or thusness two stanzas of anatta, or bahiya sutta 'in the seeing just the seen'<br>so as u practice 'thusness vipassana' u are deconstructing self and perception into its constituent perceptions<br>without seer-seen</p>
              <p><br><strong>P2 says:</strong><br>i see
                      <br>(12:03 AM):<br>i did think also... is it possible to contemplate anatta (using the suttas u mentioned) and also do Thusness Vipassana?
                      ...so yes, now u r saying it's fine to do both</p>
              <p><strong>AEN says:</strong><br>yes<br>in fact its important</p>

              <p>No it is not incorrect. Just that you are currently focusing on the non-doership aspect. I am pointing out other aspects as well, that is to directly experience non-dual luminosity and realize its non-dual nature, and the insight into no-agency.</p>
              <p>When you look at Thusness Stage 5, he mentioned this: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a></p>
              <p>"Phase 5 is quite thorough in being no one and I would call this anatta 
                          in all 3 aspects -- no subject/object division, no doer-ship and absence
                           of agent."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Non-doership is already glimpsed from the experience of impersonality, no subject/object division starts from Stage 4, and there is deeper insight into absence of agent in Stage 5 (anatta).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for practice, you should direct to experiencing pure vivid clarity in all sensations, stripped of any conceptual constructs (only the direct, immediate awareness/vivid perception). And in terms of investigation, this advise might be relevant in my e-book:</p>
              <p><em>You are a sincere and humble practitioner and I truthfully hope that you will achieve swift spiritual break-through. As I am too in a learning process, I will try to share with you what I have learnt.<br><br>First you should break-through the division between subject and object. It is OK to experience substantial non-duality first, but it is good to bear in mind that there are further phases.<br><br>When we challenge the boundaries and division between subject and object, we are able to collapse our experience into oneness. This is the phase of substantial non-dual. By challenging the boundary where awareness ends and manifestation begin, or the border between awareness and content, everything reveals itself to be an expression of a single field of undivided awareness. Such that things no longer occur 'In' awareness, but 'As' awareness. Everything is equally an expression of the infinite field of awareness... and there is no separation whatsoever between awareness and content, perceiver and perceived, subject and object.<br><br>That is the substantial non-dual phase. After which you can try to contemplate, 'in seeing just the seen', 'in hearing just the heard' like in Bahiya Sutta. This is not just a matter of substantial non-dualism. It is not 'everything is Awareness' but that 'there is no Awareness apart from the sights, sounds, etc'. So effectively, the term 'Awareness' is just a label, like the word 'weather', for the myriad of self-luminous experiences... it has no independent, permanent existence of its own. In seeing, ONLY just the seen. Apart from that there is no seeing or awareness. Just the seen, heard, cognized, thought, etc... just manifestation. So we no longer see a metaphysical essence. We no longer see anything inherent. Not even an 'Awareness'. Instead, we see a dynamic stream of luminous activities, without an agent, without a perceiver, a doer, controller, etc. This is not the inseparability of subject and object, but seeing how there is no subject to begin with – only self-luminous processes, activities, dharmas.<br><br>When a person undergo awareness practice until a certain phase – non-dual, it is very very important to keep instilling the right view and keep breaking the 'essence'. At this point you will need to have clarity on anatta and dependent origination in order to refine the experience of anatta. Even if one had glimpses and experiences of no-mind, one will still be unable to realize anatta, until practitioners realize that it is not necessary to have an 'essence' at all – it is simply a distorted view. So, to penetrate into Anatta, there must be the willingness to let go of the wrong 'view' entirely – the entire idea of an 'essence' must be gone. So with the adoption of view, we perfect the experience until all doubts are gone, and the center is completely gone – just flat, disjoint, unsupported, dimensionless and pure experience, manifested as whatever arises.<br><br>First investigate and clear the bond of duality, then investigate and clear the bond of inherency.</em></p>

              <p>You have to really enjoy and tune into the senses, the texture and details of the moment, and relax non-dually into the moment, the experience, zoom into the clarity. Clarity is the most important issue, but it is in inverse relationship with the construct/projection of self/Self - as Thusness said in 2007:</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>There must be joy, there must be enough relaxation (into the moment of whatever arises), and there must be clarity - that is you must zoom into the texture of the moment and savor it like you are born in a paradise for the first time (and you are - every moment is a first time in paradise!), there must be a deep sense of wonder. Take strolls in nature more if possible and fuse into nature. It is helpful.</p>
              <p>For example, I had an intense PCE* when I was dancing and really tuning into the music and movement completely until the sense of self/Self completely dissolves into sounds, sights and action in its deep intense clarity, after which my entire practice shifted, though I'm not suggesting that as some kind of practice (not so healthy too - those places I used to frequent in the past, especially binge drinking and stuff) - anything will do as long as you can really tune into the moment and experience the clarity at its uber intensity. People usually can get into the 'moment' or 'in the zone' when doing dangerous stunts, mountain climbing, falling off a plane on parachute, speeding, etc etc - it pauses stop/conceptualization and there is only the 'moment' (any distraction and they're dead! so there is only this moment of action, next moment of action, one by one... no room for second thought or a self/Self!) with utter alertness and heightened senses - or even taking drugs like LSD with a particular aim or pointer in mind. But I do not recommend any of these as these are mere experiences and some people then depend on these stuff to 'get back into the mood'. Then it becomes a sort of dependency and addiction. It also comes with its risks and dangers. And without insight - whatever peak experiences one has becomes very pointless</p>
              <p>I personally did not undertake any of these dangerous endevors so they are certainly not necessary. What is more important is sincere, true practice and insight. Know the proper way of practice - mindfulness taught by Buddha already covers it all, it is an ingenious way to development of insight and tranquility, it is a direct way to enlightenment as the Buddha himself said. With insight, PCE becomes effortless - but it is difficult to have insight without certain experience also.</p>
              <p>The purpose is not to cultivate the PCE 24/7 (without insight it will always be contrived) - it is only to let you have a clear glimpse of non-dual luminosity, then with further insight that PCE is made natural and implicit. Even this is only the beginning and far from total liberating experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. in teachings like Dzogchen, they teach movement meditation like Vajra dance, singing song of vajra, etc etc - all of these are about integrating Presence into the foreground. For me, it was through dancing at a nightclub and at that time I didn't know there were practices like that.</p>
              <p>Actually every moment of life can be integration. Not only pleasant experiences, every unpleasant experiences too and thats the point! It is not just sitting meditation (although also important).</p>
              <p>Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche tells us to maintain the Presence we experience when we are alert and driving the car. You don't need to be speeding, mountain climbing etc - the non-dual Presence is more important and can be experienced in any moment. So my telling you all those 'dangerous stunts' is not for you to try them out, but to 're-enact that presence and clarity in every moment as far as possible'. Even if you try to experience non-dual clarity and there is a deep sense of Presence, it doesn't mean one experiences non-dual - it is not so easy and takes some time. The sense of self must completely dissolve into non-dual clarity/experience. But with right view and practice eventually it will be experienced, and then realized. Fake it till you make it.</p>
              <p>Also keep in mind the stanzas of Bahiya Sutta - it will be very helpful.</p>

              your whereabouts in time and space. It doesn’t need to be 100% accurate, all
              we’re doing is fabricating a rough mental image which makes it easier to be <span class="commentbody">f</span>ully present mentally, right here and now.<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[1]</span></span></div>

              the
              visual field simply because seeing is occurring. Apply this same

              experience them all at once with the same openness and clarity. </span></div>

              is. All the senses are aligned with the present moment, each doing what it does
              without effort. It becomes evident that there is a complete lack
              of stress or anxiety here, at least until some thought or other
              sensation ‘pulls’ us away from what’s already occurring. By simply recognizing
              that you’ve been ‘pulled’ away from this immediate sensate experience,
              you’ll be back in the moment again because you’ve noticed that thought is no

              from “you” as an independently existing identity, there is the
              opportunity to ‘let go’ of those mental fabrications and allow
              things to happen as they will. Through this effortless
              recognition, we can remain attentive to experience as it is and always be right

              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Attentiveness is a commonly used word and is something
              that forms the bare bones of our practice, regardless of which model we use. I
              intend to break the word down and provide a practical description of what
              attentiveness “is”, and how to improve practice through really understanding
              what it means to be attentive. This is just my take on it based on what works,
              and is working, for me; this may change as new information becomes available.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Word</span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Attentiveness describes the act of paying attention to an
              object; to be “attentive” is to be engaged in the act of paying attention; “attention”
              is defined as “the act or faculty of attending” <span style="font-size: xx-small;">[1]</span><span style="font-style: italic;">,</span> faculty being “an
              ability, natural or acquired, for a particular kind of action” <span style="font-size: xx-small;">[2]</span><em>.</em> Since we all have this ability naturally rather than having to acquire it, as
              is apparent simply by noticing that you’re sitting reading this post right now,
              it’s just a case of recognizing this “particular kind of action” occurring in
              real-time and learning how to utilize it effectively. </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Some common synonyms for the word “attentive” include:
              heedful, aware, alert, and, perhaps most interestingly given the context of
              this piece, mindful <span style="font-size: xx-small;">[3]</span><span style="font-style: italic;">.</span> In short, to be attentive is to be
              heedful, aware or mindful of whatever is occurring at any given moment. For the
              sake of clarity, I’d like to briefly analyze the word “mindfulness” since,
              given what we know already about attentiveness and based on my own practice, I
              posit that it is identical in operation and produces the same phenomenological
              results; there will likely be some who immediately disagree based on comments
              made by the founder of the AFT, or consider these correlations to be the
              product of “my” efforts to force-fit the language of one model with another. I
              am trying to present this in as clear terms as possible so as to avoid any
              ambiguity or bias towards any one model, and am also providing these breakdowns
              of the words to clarify the way in which I use and understand them.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The word “mindful” is an adjective meaning “attentive,
              aware, or careful (usually followed by <em>of</em>)” <span style="font-size: xx-small;">[4]</span><em> </em>or “<span style="background-color: white; color: #333333;">conscious or aware of something</span> “<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[5][6]</span><em>. </em>We’ve already looked
              at “attentive” and found that it’s synonymous with words like “mindful”,
              “heedful”, “aware” and “alert”, all of which represent the same process: To be
              attentive of something; to be paying attention; to be aware.  It does not require any further analysis to
              demonstrate that mindfulness and attentiveness are simply labels for the same,
              naturally occurring ability to pay attention.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">What is this “naturally occurring ability to pay
              attention” and how does it happen?</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Process</span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Attentiveness is occurring right now as I sit here
              writing this; as my eyes scan the screen I’m able to simultaneously notice the
              sound of my fingers on the keyboard, the television in the background, and the
              sound of traffic outside. I’m also aware of what’s going on ‘internally’ and
              can notice thoughts arising by themselves, the way I mentally verbalize these
              words as I edit this paragraph and consider whether it’s an accurate
              description or not; a reflection based on the way that I understand the words
              I’m using and whether or not others will understand them in the same way. All
              of this can be observed occurring without effort, but the simplicity of
              attentiveness is what makes it difficult for some to perceive.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Attentiveness is just a matter of noticing what’s
              happening right now, you’re not looking <strong>for</strong> anything or trying to <strong>do</strong> anything,
              you’re just noticing what’s already happening at this moment. It’s an active
              engagement in your immediate experience, an alertness, a preparedness to openly
              accept whatever arises without judgement. This attentiveness includes what’s
              going on” internally” - by which I mean: the general feelings observed,
              emotional states, thoughts that present themselves, particular narratives the
              mind reels off; mental phenomena in general - as well as what’s going on “externally”
              - by which I mean: physical sensations via the five sense doors: touch, sight,
              sound, taste, and smell. Attentiveness only ever happens <em>right now</em>, not in the future and not in the past, now. Not then.
              Only now. To be attentive or mindful is to be actively present; to be cognizant
              of what is happening at this moment in time.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">So, why is it that the vast majority of people aren’t
              actively engaged in simply being aware, particularly when there are so many
              benefits to be found in doing so?</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Problem</span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The way our minds usually function involves a continual
              push-pull between past, present and future, only spending fleeting moments
              actually being here. When we’re not occupied with thoughts like “what am I
              going to do when I finish what I’m doing right now?”, we’re occupied with
              thoughts like “why isn’t what I’m doing right now as good as that thing I was
              doing before?”. We’re rarely here now, which may sound clichéd but is easy
              enough to verify as accurate in our own experience; we’re either fretting over
              what might happen in some not-occurring-right-now future, or worrying about what’s
              already happened in, or may occur due to, some not-occurring-right-now event in
              the past.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">To complicate matters further, we then identify with
              those thoughts and narratives, consider them to be “my” thoughts, “my” stories
              about what’s going to happen to “me”; we have feelings <em>about </em>those mental phenomena which give rise to this sense of “me”
              in the first place and around we go again ad infinitum. All of these,
              relatively<span style="font-size: xx-small;">[7]</span> subtle, automatic processes, that we’re not usually aware of, are part of what
              leads to a lack of attentiveness. The noticing of them is the first step to
              seeing them clearly, and once they’re seen clearly they can be let go of via
              further attentiveness and investigation. What’s happening <strong>now</strong> is what counts, what might happen or what’s already happened
              are never occurring right now so thoughts of them can be acknowledged and let
              go of. This is not to say that reflection on what’s gone before or planning for
              what may come are not necessary; regardless of whether you’re “awakened” or
              “not” you still need to be able to function skilfully in the real-world. </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Aside from the natural inclination of our minds towards
              this dynamic and dualistic process of identification, there’s also the issue of
              effort, of having to do something to be attentive in the first place. If we can
              see how being attentive, present and aware allows life to be far more pleasant
              and clearly, fully experienced then we can find ways to incorporate it in fun,
              interesting and engaging ways; when we can have fun while learning, we can
              optimize our ability to take on board information. While attentiveness can
              become automatic with enough effort and practice, it requires a kickstart for
              the mind to be able to recognize it; it seems paradoxical that something
              effortless should require effort to become what it already is, yet it’s one of
              those things that really need to be experienced to be understood fully.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: right;"><strong style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br></span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong>The Basics</strong></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">There are lots of ways you can kickstart attentiveness,
              whether it’s asking yourself “How Am I Experiencing This Moment of Being Alive”
              (also known as <a href="http://actualfreedom.com.au/">HAIETMOBA</a>) or just noticing that you’re annoyed by something on
              the television; it comes down to being aware of what you’re experiencing, both
              “internally” and “externally” at any given moment. As far as what we’re
              supposed to be aware <em>of</em>, the list
              could go on for pages, but we can describe a (very) basic framework to start
              from and you’re then free to explore, add, amend or discard whatever helps your
              own practice. Essentially we’re looking at the six points of sense contact,
              a.k.a. “sense doors” a.k.a. the senses and what sort of information they can
              ‘take in’:</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Eyes = Sight (Visual)</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Ears = Hearing (Auditory)</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nose = Smell (Olfactory)</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Tongue = Taste (Gustatory)</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Skin/Muscle = Touch/Movement (Tactile/Kinesthetic)</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘Mind’ = Thought/A
              label for mental faculties in general.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These are our six points of sense contact, in which I’m
              also including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submodalities">submodalities</a> of each e.g. with regards to sight, we can
              talk about light, colour and form; distinctions discernible within the
              experience of “seeing”. How each of the senses can be further investigated will
              be of more interest to us later in the discussion, but for the moment we’ll go
              back to basics and strip the practice to it’s bare bones.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The Details</span></strong></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As we’ve already seen, to be attentive is to be aware...<em>but aware of what</em>? Your experience at
              this moment as it happens! <em>And how do you
              do that</em>? By noticing what’s happening! <em>Is
              it really that simple</em>? Yes! Simply notice that you’re already aware of at
              least one aspect of your current experience, whether it’s the sensation of a
              warm breeze against your cheek or the memory of dinner with a friend, whatever
              is happening in your body and/or mind is what to be aware of. Something quite
              cool about attentiveness is that it’s got a built-in feedback mechanism; once
              you learn how to recognize it, you can quickly see when you’re no longer being
              attentive which immediately brings you back to where you want to be: Present,
              mindful, aware and cognizant of how you feel inside and out; from your
              emotional state to the itch on your foot, it’s all made of the same stuff and
              is worthy of being investigated. With practice, you can begin to dismantle and
              investigate these feelings and sensations but, for the moment, I’m going to
              stick to the practice of attentiveness itself rather than insight.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Once you can be aware of one sensation, you can begin to
              expand that ‘field’ of attention to include other sensations like sounds,
              touch, sights, and so on; notice how each of these “sense consciousness”
              happens of its own accord, they occur when an object makes contact with them
              and don’t require any effort on your part. It’s a fascinating thing to do, just
              noticing how your experience of the world is being constructed in real-time and
              how incredible the human brain and nervous system are; the ever-changing,
              chaotic blast of information that makes up “reality” is received, decoded, and
              interpreted by this organism to create this experience of the world...and “I”
              am not involved in any way, shape or form. Literally.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You can also look further into the various submodalities
              which make up the overall “object” being perceived by this implied “subject”.
              For example, in the instant of touch there are myriad sensations which make up
              that particular conceptual label, “touch”; we can (ap)perceive temperature,
              pressure, texture/pattern, etc. each of which can then be broken down ad
              absurdum if you’re so inclined. There is a kaleidoscopic range of sensory
              delight available right now, ever changing and never static, simply by paying
              more attention to your experience; notice more, look closer and see just how
              multi-faceted a jewel (ap)perception is.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">In terms of what we’ll call “internal” sensations, by
              which I mean mental movements, thoughts, conceptualizing, and anything of a
              not-solely-physical-sense-based variety, the selection of what can be attended
              to is pretty much endless. What’s useful is not to get involved in the content,
              simply notice them and see how they appear, fade and vanish by themselves to be
              replaced by something else. With further practice, you can also dismantle and
              investigate these states in the same way as you would with any other sensation.
              It’s all fair game, the point is (if such a thing can even be said!) that
              you’re attentive to what’s happening in your immediate experience right now.
              Once you can be attentive effortlessly, practice being <strong>more</strong> attentive to even <strong>more</strong> of your experience; there is no end to how attentive you can be but it can only
              happen right now.</span></div>

              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I’ve already mentioned the Actualism technique of asking
              yourself “HAIETMOBA?” and recognizing emotional states, but it’s possible to
              use a variety of techniques to improve your practice of attentiveness.</span></div>

              <a href="http://www.plumvillage.org/">Thich Nhat Hanh</a> talks about mindfully doing the
              dishes in one of his books; how you’re doing them just to be doing them (being
              attentive of being alive right now), not purely to get them done (being
              otherwise focused on some future event). This sort of everyday activity is
              ideal for practicing attentiveness, exploring the complex interplay of
              sensations, this “dance of creation” that is sensate experience means that
              there’s never any reason to be bored; there is always something to be aware of
              and this is where we can begin practicing properly.</span></div>

              Taking a cue from my personal favourite, the
              batshit mental but never dull, <a href="http://hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib3.html">Aleister Crowley</a>, choose a word, for example
              “I”, and try to delete it from your speech for a predefined period of time;
              should you transgress this self-imposed limitation, Uncle Al would have you cut
              yourself with a razor, however <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Anton_Wilson">Bob Wilson</a> suggests the less masochistic, but
              equally effective, biting your thumb. While this practice is aimed more at
              gaining control of speech, the basic technique can be used as a ‘goad’ for attentiveness.
              My own preference was to use an elastic band to “ping” my wrist . It’s discreet
              enough to be unnoticeable, but it hurts enough to get you back to being
              attentive.</span></div>

              experience when they did things like walking through a doorway, and in fact it
              was this particular technique which allowed me to understand what the guy was
              talking about. He called it “self-observation” but the practice of it, in my
              experience, is phenomenologically the same as being mindful or attentive within
              other models.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: xx-small;">[8]</span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span>Using external objects as triggers for becoming attentive is
              incredibly useful, they’re always available and can be changed to suit wherever
              you are; anything which allows you to simply remind yourself to notice your
              experience will work. Some examples from my own practice include: Noticing when
              going through doorways, setting an alarm to go off every five minutes or some
              other period of time, writing down the word “notice” on my notepad in work and
              remembering to do so each time I see it, noticing every time I check my
              phone...the list goes on, it all comes down to what works for you and reminds
              you to be attentive right now.</span></div>

              When you’re sitting on the train or bus and
              listening to music, notice all the different elements of the sounds you hear.
              Look at how you can hear all the different instrumentation, the pitch and tone
              of sounds, how long each lasts and how attention seems to move between each
              part; feel the vibration of the air as it makes contact with the eardrum, it’s subtle
              but discernible; look at your emotional reaction to the sounds, how feelings
              and thinking can change based on, for example, the lyrics, key or tempo of the
              music. Don’t get involved in the content, just observe how things are at that
              moment and how they change. This can be applied in a similar way to things like
              watching movies, reading books, or engaging in any sort of entertainment
              whatsoever as long as it leads you to be mindful, attentive or aware of your
              immediate experience via the “sense doors”. </span></div>

              Be actively engaged in your experience, aware

              attentiveness will allow people to improve their practice, understand what
              attentiveness “is” and how it works in real terms. I’ll make it clear again
              that this is simply a reflection of my current understanding and is subject to
              change at any time, these are my attempts at describing the basics of the
              practice itself without reference to any particular conceptual map of the

              <div class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">[3] Controversy and accusations of plagiarism aside, the
              fact that Richard, the spectacularly bearded founder of the Actualism method,
              chose to help himself to some of Bhante Gunaratana’s “Mindfulness in Plain
              English” for his “Attentiveness, Sensuousness and Apperceptiveness” article is
              something I find fascinating. It could well prove to be a useful point of
              agreement to work from when trying to discuss how the AF Model can be lined up
              with “spiritual” models of experience. I am unable to find any evidence to
              suggest that the territory Richard has ‘discovered’ is unique to him, although
              the model/ filter/view/map through which his experience is being related in
              written word does seem unique to his oft-mentioned “flesh and blood body”.
              Don’t misunderstand me here, I agree with Richard to a point but I think
              there’s still value in a re-reading, with the clarity of actuality and a
              willingness to question our assumptions about language, the writings and maps
              of other traditions with the idea that they too were trying to describe
              actuality. Then again, I could just be finding evidence to support my current
              “reality tunnel” and purposely excluding information which contradicts my
              current point-of-view; an opinion and nothing more. </span></div>

              technique to it’s inventor,  however some
              of the techniques he uses, and the “self-observation” thing in particular, do
              bear similarities to the bare-bones processes of other models.</span></div>
