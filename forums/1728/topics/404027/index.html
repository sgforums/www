              <p class="article-p">In the wilderness of the spirit, 
                	    how can we know the true direction and limit our wandering 
              missteps? One way 
                	    is to establish a clear goal, against which we can measure 
              ourselves and 
                	    toward which we can see how to move. Continuity of awareness, 
              continuity 
                	    of inner work can be such a worthy, even  necessary, long-term 
              aim for 
                	    our practice.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Every spiritual path puts forward some notion
               of stabilized or continuous conscious <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/Presence.htm">presence</a>.
               In the <strong> New Testament</strong> we find Christ’s admonitions “<em>Watch
               ye therefore: for ye know not when the master of the house cometh</em><em>…</em>,<em> lest … he find you sleeping</em>,” (Mark 13:35-36) and “<em>watch ye 
              therefore, and pray always</em>” (Luke 21:36), as well as Paul’s “<em>pray
               without ceasing</em>” (1 Thessalonians 5:17). The <strong> Philokalia </strong>and
               the <strong> Way of a Pilgrim</strong> offer powerful examples of the 
              Christian approach to continuous prayer. Like the Jesus Prayer, the Sufi
               zikr, or remembrance of the <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/WillAndGod.htm">Divine</a>,
               moves from the mind and the tongue to become the perpetual zikr of the 
              heart.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Sufis, from the early, great masters known as 
              the Khwajagan down to the modern day, have pursued and taught the 
              constant practice of watchful awareness. In  the <strong>Koran</strong> (2:115) we find: <em>Wherever you turn,  there is the presence of God</em>.</p>
              <p class="article-p">In Kabbalah, the goal of devekut, or <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/SurrenderingToTheDivine.htm">cleaving
               to God</a>, comes about through continual remembrance of the Divine. 
              Some of the devout Kabbalists consider it a sin even momentarily to lose
               their connection to the sacred. <em>I have set the LORD always before 
              me…</em>(Psalms 16:8)</p>
              <p class="article-p">Buddhism counsels its advanced practitioners to 
              enter the effortless effort of continuous <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/Mindfulness.htm">mindfulness</a>.
               Zen Buddhism, as well as the Tibetan Buddhist teachings of Dzogchen and
               Mahamudra, extols the wonders of an open, spacious, continuous 
              awareness. Hindu traditions such as Patanjali’s Yoga Sutras and the 
              teachings of Advaita Vedanta present the liberated person as residing in
               stabilized awareness. Buddhist monks and Hindu yogis go to great 
              lengths to attain that station. Taoist practice leads toward non-doing 
              in unbroken presence.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Yet the fact that many generations 
                	    of seekers
                	    
                	    
                	    across the entire landscape of spiritual ways
                	    
                	    have worked to develop stabilized presence does not make it 
                	    any less challenging for us. If there can ever be a critical mass
               of humanity 
                	    from whom stabilized presence could spread to the rest of us, it 
              obviously 
                	    has not yet been achieved. So this incomparable challenge stands 
              before 
                	    us.</p>
              <p class="article-p">First, let us look at what 
                	    we mean by stabilized presence. We use the term stabilized in the
               sense 
                	    of a stable equilibrium: a state to which a system will, of 
              itself, return 
                	    after being perturbed away from it. When a person established in 
              stabilized 
                	    presence gets distracted and falls out of presence, the fall is 
              short-lived 
                	    and self-correcting. Their natural tendency is not to stray far 
              from presence 
                	    and to revert to it very soon. For most of us, the opposite 
              holds: our 
                	    presence is unstable and momentary. When we get distracted we 
              tend 
                	    to move further and further from presence, typically returning to
               it only 
                	    after a lengthy sojourn on autopilot and passive attention, lost 
              in rambling <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/ThoughtsAndThinking.htm">thoughts</a>,
               <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/DestructiveEmotions.htm">emotional
               
                	      reactions</a>, and 
                	    
                	    
                	    half-noticed
                	    
                	    sensory perceptions. But <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/ConsciousEnergy.htm">consciousness</a> is not in time and need not be destabilized by events in time and 
              space. 
                	    Our ordinary thoughts and emotions need not distract us from 
              presence, 
                	    which subsumes all events brought to us by our senses.</p>
              <p class="article-p">We can have early, sporadic 
                	    episodes of unbroken, stabilized presence that last for varying 
              durations. 
                	    All movement toward higher worlds occurs in this way: initially 
              as an 
                	    intermittent experience and later as an enduring change in our 
              being. 
                	    When our entry into presence grows frequent enough, and our 
              sojourns there 
                	    grow long enough, episodic presence merges into continuity. But 
              to realize 
                	    such a steadfast and fully stabilized presence, one that does not
               diminish 
                	    and remains continuous throughout our day and night, even while 
              we sleep, 
                	    marks a very great transformation of a person's <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/Soul.htm">soul</a>, 
                	    a major milestone in their spiritual journey, and a blessing for 
              us all.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Many seekers falsely believe in and search 
              for some hidden secret practice or magical formula that will speed their
               progress on the path. Yet the real requirements stand open for all to 
              see and belong to the realm of will. The key factors in working toward 
              more continuous presence are (1) how much it matters to you, (2) 
              actually deciding to do it now, (3) opening to higher energies, 
                	    
                	    
                	    (4) opening to a higher will, and (5)
                	    
                	    accepting to live in a new way, in the full light of awareness. 
              Any of us can be present for a moment. So we know presence through our 
              momentary tastes of it. The crux of the matter is: at what point do we 
              allow some alluring or repulsive item from the never-ending stream of 
              potential distractions to grab us? If, with the whole of our being, we 
              have truly decided to anchor ourselves to presence, not just in some 
              unknown future but right now, if we wholeheartedly commit ourselves to 
              be here, if this becomes our overarching priority for every moment, as 
              important to us as our next breath, and if through deep meditation and 
              prayer we learn to open to the transformative action of the higher 
              energies 
                	    
                	    
                	    and the higher will, only then is continuity of presence 
              possible. The absolute <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/CommitmentConfidence.htm">commitment</a> attracts help from the spiritual depths. That help, in turn, increases 
                	    our commitment to presence, our love for the Divine, and our 
              attraction 
                	    to the sacred spirit hidden within.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Those of us who aspire to 
                	    a spiritual path tend to wish we could be more present, but 
              generally 
                	    that wish falls short of wholeheartedness. We fear that real 
              commitment 
                	    to continuous presence will interfere with the duties and 
              pleasures of 
                	    life. But it is not like that. Perhaps we would spend more time 
              in <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/Meditation.htm">meditation</a> and <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/Prayer.htm">prayer</a>,
               but certainly not to the point of 
                	    irresponsibility toward our material life. We quickly realize 
              that presence 
                	    is a parallel process that occurs as we move through our ordinary
               daily activities and
                	    experiences. We can learn to be present at any and all times and 
              places. 
                	    Presence can even help us be more effective in life, enable a 
              stronger 
                	    appreciation for the pleasures of life, and serve as a robust 
              framework 
                	    from which to meet life's challenges.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Our first forays into working at 
                	    presence show the difficulty of it. At that point, the danger 
              lies in 
                	    assuming that because presence is hard to maintain, it must be 
              impossible 
                	    to maintain. But that is not so. All the great paths point to the
               necessity 
                	    of continuous presence. If we allow our assumptions based on past
               experience 
                	    to limit our future, we box ourselves into the world of 
              automatic, self-perpetuating 
                	    thoughts and emotions, which control our life and of which we 
              remain only 
                	    half-aware.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Another danger with presence lies 
                	    in pseudo or <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/IllusionOfPresence.htm">illusory
               presence</a>. If 
                	    we believe ourselves already present, we shall make no effort 
              toward real 
                	    presence. But our habitual inattentiveness, forgetfulness and 
              distraction 
                	    expose as false our presumptions of presence. Persistent and 
              intentional 
                	    work at presence gradually teaches us the difference between 
              living on <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/AutomaticEnergy.htm">autopilot</a> and being awake.</p>
              <p class="article-p">The practice of awareness of bodily <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/SensitiveEnergy.htm">sensation</a> offers major help in moving 
                	    toward continuous presence, because sensation creates a platform 
              for consciousness. 
                	    The more we work on establishing and increasing the <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/EnergyBody.htm">sensitive 
              energy in 
                	    our body</a>, the more that energy stabilizes. Sensation can then
               come back 
                	    to remind us to be present at moments when we are lost in our 
              personality, our pre-programmed mode of functioning
                	    
                	    .</p>
              <p class="article-p">Continuity of presence does 
                	    not depend on continuity of effort to be present. Of course, such
               effort 
                	    is most necessary, but not all the time. Instead, we can relax 
              into sensation, 
                	    relax into consciousness and find a natural stability there, a 
              new home 
                	    
                	    
                	    in the light of full awareness. 
                	    Letting go of tensions and distractions carries us more and more 
              into 
                	    this one, eternal present moment.</p>
              <p class="article-p">To sustain continuous presence, we make an 
              active effort at times, an effort that renews our intention to be here, 
              in our body, in our heart, in our mind, and in consciousness. At other 
              times, we receptively open to the higher, to harvest higher energies to 
              fuel our presence. But most of the time, we maintain presence through a 
              third approach that reconciles and synergizes the active and the 
              receptive. In this third way, we are not wholly active, nor wholly 
              receptive, but a little of both and more. We stay here, while pursuing 
              the necessary active external efforts that life requires of us. In that 
              way, our inner synergistic stance of presence does not interfere with 
              our outer activities, nor do our outer activities diminish our presence.
               I engage in life and I continue to be here.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Traditionally, those who were serious 
                	    enough to pursue continuity of presence did so in the context of 
              monastic-style 
                	    seclusion or retreat. Removed from many of the cares, duties, and
               distractions 
                	    of ordinary life, perhaps surrounded by reminders of the practice
               and 
                	    by the intention and energy of fellow travelers on the path, the 
              seeker 
                	    could work out his or her salvation with diligence. It still 
              holds true that a spiritual retreat, during which one works to establish
               continuous presence, proves its possibility.</p>
              <p class="article-p">While the retreat approach certainly 
                	    remains valid and powerful today, we look toward a path within 
              life, a 
                	    way to purify and build our soul in the midst of modern society. 
              Fortunately, 
                	    to meet this challenge, a remarkable array of spiritual 
              practices, hitherto 
                	    hidden, have become widely available during the past century. Any
               of us 
                	    can find genuine and personally-suitable ways to pursue inner 
              work seriously 
                	    during our typical days. Perhaps we begin the day with prayer 
              and/or meditation. 
                	    During the day, we frequently come back to presence through 
              awareness 
                	    of bodily sensation, through <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/ConsciousBreathing.htm">conscious
               
                	      breathing</a>, through prayer, or other practices that build 
              presence. 
                	    The more we practice, the more we wish to practice, the more we 
              are drawn 
                	    toward the spiritual worlds, and the more we can and do practice.
               
                	    
                	    
                	    Aiming at continuous presence, in itself helps move us toward it.
                	    
                	    Depending 
                	    on our understanding and <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/Determination.htm">determination</a>,
               
                	    a state of presence begins to become the norm rather than the 
              exception 
                	    for us. The foreground of our ordinary awareness of thoughts, 
              sensations, 
                	    and emotions opens out to merge into the background and wider 
              context 
                	    of consciousness. Events in time and space stand in the silent 
              midst of 
                	    the higher dimensions. And love finds a home in the clarity of 
              our presence.</p>
              <p class="article-p">As our presence grows we come to the barrier 
              of <a href="http://www.innerfrontier.org/Practices/IllusionOfEgo.htm">egoism</a>.
               Why do we seek presence? Is it to be better than other people? Is it so
               we can congratulate ourselves for it, boast inwardly, if not outwardly?
               Is it to form our soul for our personal salvation? In the end, all 
              self-oriented motivations fall short. Self-centeredness inevitably moves
               from the desire for spiritual advancement to some other attractive 
              item, making continuity of presence based on an egoistic posture 
              impossible. If, instead, we approach presence as an act of service to 
              our neighbor and to the Divine, then we have a chance. If we realize 
              that the true answer to the question “Who is present?” is not me, but 
              rather the sacred higher will, then we have a chance. If we recognize 
              that without opening to the higher, sacred energies, we cannot move 
              toward continuous presence, then we have a chance.</p>
              <p class="article-p">Bring yourself into full awareness 
                	    of body, heart, and mind. Open to your whole presence and be 
              here. This 
                	    state seems so natural, so right for us. Our challenge lies in 
              dropping 
                	    the assumption of impossibility and working diligently, strongly,
               deeply and 
                	    frequently enough to transform our presence from an intermittent 
              and short-lived
