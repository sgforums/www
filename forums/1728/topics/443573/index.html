              <p>Loppon Namdrol:</p>
              <p>The primary MahayÄ�na sutra metaphor for a Buddha is a wishfulfilling gem because a wishfulfilling automatically gem fulfills the wishes of sentient beings <strong>without concepts. </strong></p>
              <p>-------
                      <br><br>What I am saying is really simple: Buddhas do not have 
                      conceptual minds, therefore, their acts of speech are not connected with
                       concepts and signs.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>Buddha's interactions with sentient beings are completely spontaneous and non-conceptual.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p><br>Buddha don't have thoughts, therefore, they have no concepts. They are however omniscient.</p>
              <p>-------</p>

              <p><br><br><br>Buddhapalita comments:</p>
              <ul>
              "'Not
                       known from another"; here not known from another i.e. not scriptural, 
                      but one's direct perception, thus it is a convention for one's direct 
                      perception. "Peaceful"  is a convention for "empty by nature".  "Lacking
                       proliferation with proliferations" is a convention for freedom from 
                      mundane phenomena. "Non-conceptual" means not designated "This is this".
                       Undifferentiated means not different objects such as "though it this, 
                      it is also this". Why is that? Because of lacking concepts, there is no 
                      proliferation with proliferations. Why? Because there is no 
                      proliferation by mundane phenomena. Why? Because that is peaceful, it is
                       undifferentiated. Therefore, the knowledge of such a nature is a 
                      personal knowledge, not known from elsewhere. That should be understood 
                      to be the characteristic of reality. 
              </ul>
              <p><br>According to MahÄ�yÄ�na, a 
                      buddha is in a state of continuous equipoise on reality. It is 
                      impossible therefore that a buddha will experience concepts.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>This is a very huge polemical area in Tibetan Buddhism, but in general, Nyingmas, Sakyapas and Kagyupas hold that a Buddha's actions, whether verbal or physical are completely spontaneous and free from conceptuality and cognition of conventional signs.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>Buddhas perceive only wisdom.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>one perceives all phenomena as the display of one's wisdom.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>A correct perception takes ultimate truth as its object.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p>When in equipoise on reality, is is not like there is some mental focus 
                  that designates an object called "reality". Equipoise on reality is not a
                   mental state. It is beyond mind.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              <p><br>The inexpressible realization of emptiness is the same in every 
                  respect from the moment of the path of seeing until full buddhahood. We 
                  can talk about afflcitive obscurations and knowledge obscurations and so
                   on, but the real difference between buddhas and bodhisattvas on the 
                  stages is whether there is a difference in equipoise and post-equipoise.
                   Buddhas are never not in a state of equipoise. Thus the notion of the 
                  two obscurations apply only in post-equipoise, not while in eqiupoise on
                   the ultimate. However, this crucial difference is responsible also for 
                  the difference in qualities of a buddha and for example, a tenth stager.</p>
              <p>-------</p>
              Well, for bodhisattva on the stages, apprehension of the conventional occurs only in post-equipoise. Buddhas experience no post-equipioise phase, ergo, no apprehension of conventional i.e. deluded phenomena.

              <p>This is eluded to by Kenneth Folk's 8th Stage of Enlightenment. (7th stage = anatta realization)</p>

              <p><em>Antero:</em></p>
              <p><em>The
                   last time I talked with Kenneth about 8th Stage, he defined it as an 
                  end of developmental enlightenment, so after that point no further 
                  progress is possible. It means that the mental fluctuations have stopped
                   completely and there is no unwanted discursive thinking arising at all.<br><br>“Through
                   this process [recognizing your mind and resting loosely], our though 
                  involvement grows weaker and weaker. The gap between thoughts begins to 
                  last longer and longer. At a certain point, for half an hour there will 
                  be a stretch of no conceptual thought whatsoever, without having to 
                  suppress the thinking.<br>…<br>By growing used to this natural, original
                   emptiness again and again, we become accustomed to it. Then there will 
                  be a stretch throughout the whole day from morning to evening, which is 
                  only empty awareness untainted by notions of perceived objects or the 
                  perceiving mind. This corresponds to having attained the bodhisattva 
                  levels, the bhumis. When there is never a break throughout day and 
                  night, that is called buddhahood, true and complete enlightenment.”<br><br>- Tulku Urgyen Rinpoce, Quintessential Dzogchen p. 130</em></p>

              <p>It should be understood that non-conceptuality or non-thought <strong>should not become an object of practice </strong>(like in pure shamatha practice) but rather is a <strong>natural side-effect of arising and abiding in equipoise/wisdom/pure awareness [wisdom of ultimate truth].*</strong></p>
              <p>Part of this process is to give rise to the realization of the twofold emptiness (of self and objects), resulting in a meditative, direct vision of the union of luminosity and emptiness.</p>
              <p>Practicing non-conceptuality without arising wisdom will not lead to liberation. An ordinary unawakened person's sense consciousness is also non-conceptual, however they are not the same as wisdom.</p>
              <p>For someone who awakens, all phenomena are perceived as one's wisdom, eluded by 'eight consciousnesses transforming into the five wisdoms'.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*"Jigmé Lingpa insists upon the importance of the distinction. He argues 
                              that, if the meditator attempts to stop conceptual activity without 
                              distinguishing between mind (sems) and awareness (rig pa), the result is
                               a blank indeterminacy (lung ma bstan). In awareness, he argues, 
                              conceptualisation is neutralised in a state that is “like a crystal 
                              ball”, a simile which points to clarity and vividness, rather than 
                              indeterminacy and blankness." Sam van Schaik</p>

              <p>"having distinguished between reflexive awareness (which is 
                          all-penetrating primordial wisdom) and mind (which is nescient 
                          conceptualization and delusive forms), you should maintain freedom from 
                          limits in the state of the vast spacious expanse of gnosis, without 
                          following after it.  Through this, the imprints of the conceptual mind
