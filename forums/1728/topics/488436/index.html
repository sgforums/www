              with modern-day Pakistan rests an ancient Buddhist city. This ancient city
              named Mes Aynak, or little copper well in Dari, was once at the heart of the
              bustling Silk Road, the revolutionary trade route that tied together China,
              India, the Middle East and the Mediterranean. Buddhists from all over Asia made
              pilgrimages to worship at Mes Aynak, and for thousands of years, it flourished
              as one of the most important cities in the region. As its importance waned
              through the centuries, it was slowly abandoned and eventually, this once mighty
              city was forgotten, its history lost to the sands of time.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>After being re-discovered in the 1960's, it took decades
              for archeologists to make their way to the site, and sporadic rescue excavation
              of the ancient city did not begin until 2009. Since then, what they've
              unearthed is truly astounding: dozens of unique and never-before-seen stupas
              and temples, enormous monastic complexes, vivid murals, thousands of precious
              artifacts, and around 600 large Buddha statues -- similar in style to those
              destroyed by the Taliban in 2001 at Bamiyan. Archaeologists have also begun to
              find written material -- bitch bark manuscripts representing some of the oldests
              Buddhist writing ever discovered.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Archaeologists have also found evidence of an older Bronze
              age site beneath the Buddhist city, meaning there is at least 5,000 years of
              civilization at Mes Aynak. Although only 10 percent of the site has been excavated,
              what they are finding is already rewriting the history of Buddhism, Afghanistan
              and the world.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Tragically, this ancient civilization is in dire peril.
              Mes Aynak sits on the second largest copper deposit in the world, and in 2007
              it was sold by the Afghan government to a Chinese State-owned mining company,
              who plan to harvest that estimated $100 billion dollars worth of copper. MCC,
              or China Metallurgical Group Corporation, plans to open-pit mine at Mes Aynak.
              What does that mean? It means blowing up Mes Aynak and reducing it - and an
              entire mountain range -- to rubble. It means the forced evacuation and
              relocation of countless native Afghans from the area, who will never be able to
              return to their villages due to permanent toxicity from the mining. It means
              leaving a giant crater where there once was a sprawling 500,000 sq meter city.
              It means erasing from the face of the Earth all of the culture and history that
              Mes Aynak contains.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>I first read about Mes Aynak in the<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;"><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">New York Times</span></em><span> </span>in 2010. The story focused on the
              potential economic development in the war-torn region -- the Chinese project
              represents the largest private investment in Afghanistan's history setting up
              in volatile Logar province -- Taliban country. The Buddhist archaeological site
              was barely a footnote in this story.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>I later learned that the archaeological ruins were
              massive, comparable in size to sites like Pompeii and Machu Picchu. At any
              moment the entire ancient city would be completely destroyed. I needed to see
              Mes Aynak for myself before this demolition. I first traveled to Mes Aynak in
              2011, and over the next four years I have been documenting the archaeological
              effort, the race against time by specialists to save small movable artifacts
              before the bulldozers come in.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>It seemed that the Afghan government and MCC thought no
              one would mind if some old dusty statues and buildings vanished overnight.
              Maybe they felt no one would ever know? As lone witness to this impending
              international tragedy, I felt it was my duty to expose this story to the
              international community. To me this was a story of corporate greed and
              corruption versus the most significant archaeological discovery of our time.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Every day that I rode to Mes Aynak from Kabul, the threat
              of death by roadside IED or landmine was always on my mind. The archeologists
              at the site worked under a continuous death threats from the Taliban. Death
              loomed large, but it was a risk we were all willing to take.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>My first impulse was to document all the incredible
              discoveries at Mes Aynak so that after the site was destroyed there would at
              least be some visual record of its existence. But the more time I spent at Mes
              Aynak and saw its epic beauty and importance, the more I realized that I
              couldn't just film the site; I had to do something to permanently stop its
              destruction. The desire to save Mes Aynak wasn't shared by me and the
              archeologists alone, however. In 2012, in response to the media coverage of
              China's proposed actions at Mes Aynak, there was an outcry from Buddhist communities
              around the world. In Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Budapest, India, China,
              Malaysia, and even China, the reaction was strong. In Thailand, the Dhammaykaya
              Temple's Dhamma Media Channel spread the word about Mes Aynak's impending
              destruction. The Temple's monks distributed two official petitions in schools
              and universities throughout the country, one appealing to Afghan president
              Harmid Karzai (see References below) and the other to UNESCO. Both petitions
              gathered over 60,000 signatures each.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>During this time, I took to social media to spread the
              word about Mes Aynak, and decided to turn my footage into a documentary first
              called The Buddhas of Mes Aynak, then ultimately Saving Mes Aynak. Awareness on
              Facebook and Twitter grew by the thousands... and then the tens of thousands.
              Due to public outcry and the attention my film received, MCC and the Afghan
              government delayed the destruction until the end of 2013. When that deadline
              approached, I took to social media to raise even more awareness, and again due
              to mounting pressure, MCC delayed the destruction. But time is quickly running
              out. Despite the delays, the Chinese State-owned mining company still has
              immediate plans to demolish Mes Aynak at any moment.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Afghanistan is trading its history (also humankind's) for
              a quick buck, one that will fail to benefit its citizens economically, since
              China's proposed three billion-dollar payment will most certainly be lost to
              corruption within the Afghan government. The destruction of Mes Aynak will only
              benefit China and temporarily at that. It will permanently erase this important
              piece of Afghanistan's history and leave enormous toxic craters in its stead.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>We as a global society must do something about it. The
              only way that Mes Aynak can be saved is if the Afghan government intervenes to
              stop demolition, and petitions UNESCO to make Mes Aynak a World Heritage Site.
              Only the Afghan government can petition UNESCO. My film Saving Mes Aynak is
              ready to screen worldwide, and I am mounting a global campaign through the film
              to raise awareness about the impending demolition, thus creating an
              international movement to put pressure on the mining company, the Afghanistan
              government, and UNESCO to make Mes Aynak a World Heritage Site. This is how we
              ensure that this irreplaceable ancient Buddhist city can be fully excavated by
              professional staff, and preserved for future generations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>We need help, however. As a filmmaker, I believe in the
              power of documentary to provoke empathy and move people to action. So I've
              recently launched a campaign for #SaveMesAynak Day on July 1st, a global event
              where supporters everywhere will stand in unity together to save this precious
              history. The more people who see and talk about our film and know the beauty
              and importance of Mes Aynak, the greater the chance of Mes Aynak being saved.
              All our funding and efforts are aimed towards this mission. Through social
              media, we plan to use this #SaveMesAynak day to spark worldwide protest,
              conversation, and action. I also aim to return to Afghanistan for the local
              premiere and present the Afghanistan President Ghani with a copy of a petition
              with 100,000 names on it. We currently have 76,000! We hope that united, our
              voices of protest will be too loud to ignore... and not even he can ignore
              100,000 (or more) synchronous voices.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>The idea that corporate profit can erase 2,000 years of
              Buddhist history and 5,000 of human history is unfathomable, yet it could
              happen. And we cannot let this senseless act occur. I believe that my film and
              subsequent awareness campaign give us the best chance at saving this beautiful,
              historic and important cultural heritage.</span></p>
