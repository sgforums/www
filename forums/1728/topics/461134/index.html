              <p>At the core of our exsistence are we not just a vast energetic awareness? I think I've had glimpses, but don't have the words to describe it, at all.</p>
              <p>To directly answer your question, "Before birth, who am I?" Am I not(before birth) who I am now when the noise of my mind subsides, when "I" stop "trying"? So, before birth, I am who I am now. But now I can not see it clearly.</p>
              <p>Somehow we become confused and take our thoughts to be "me/I" and then the problems start. My mind seem to create problems(via thoughts) in order to justify it's own importance and dominance. </p>

              <p>Yes but even thoughts do not fundamentally obscure this awareness... imagine clouds and blue sky... or clouds and sun... actually clouds also show themselves due to sunlight. So what is the sun?</p>

              <h5 class="uiStreamMessage userContentWrapper"><span class="messageBody"><span class="userContent">The
               ego is simply wrong identity of the Self with the non-self, as in the 
              case of a colourless crystal and its coloured background. The crystal 
              though colourless appears red because of its background. If the 
              background is removed the crystal shines in its original purity. So it 
              is with the Self and the antahkaranas.<br> <br> Still again the 
              illustration is not quite appropriate. For the ego has its source from 
              the Self and is not separate like the background from the crystal. 
              Having its source from the Self, the ego must only be retraced in order 
              that it might merge in its source.<br> <br> The centre of the ego and its core is called the Heart, the same as the Self.<br> <br> ~ Sri Ramana Maharshi (from "Talk 398")</span></span></h5>

              <p>Hi Eternal Now,</p>
              <p>Does the awareness arise in our body mean we have the awareness when we will hit the body ie to hit the Xue dao automatically and systematically ? I have attended the Ren Dian Xue course and my chakras have been opened by the master from Taiwan.</p>
              <p>I have read on the Internet, this will release the "ling" or spirit that is trapped at the tail end of the spine, is that true ?</p>
              <p>Can kindly enlighten me further on this ?</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>

              <p>ok,</p>
              <p>Reading of these words right now is happening from somewhere here behind the eyes. The viewing of life is not happening non localized or happning from my belly or foot. Thoughts too are noticed from a place somewhere here in the head. That is my experience, but yes conceptualizing about is not right.</p>
              <p>Thought keeps on saying it is here in the head behind the eyes. That is the place of awareness. It is very hard to say that in the seen only the seen. The seen is out there and the awareness is in here.</p>
              <p>YOu must have heard this question a million times. I will read more about it on this forum.</p>

              <p>I wonder if this "behind the eyes" feeling is actually just us feeling the breath as it goes through our nostrils deep into the nasal cavity together with the feeling of the eyes as it focuses and rolls about the muscles in the eye socket. Sure feels like it.</p>
              <p>Ozean, it will help to check and observe the actual "feeling" of this experience of "behind the eyes". Compare it with the feeling of the experience of everything else you encounter. Is there a difference?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Haven't really looked at that. I 'v read on it one time on some non dual site. The eye balls friction is sensed which is another experience of feeling which happens on itself. Thanks.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;"><strong style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;">Rupert:</strong> It is true that you are that which sees, hears etc. However, you, Awareness, don’t see or hear through a body. In other words, Awareness is not located in a body, looking out through the eyes, or behind the ears hearing.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">The idea that we see through the eyes or hear through the ears is simply another mistaken interpretation by thought superimposed upon the reality of our experience.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">Let us take the experience of hearing. Normally thought conceptualises a ‘me’ inside the head hearing a sound that is considered to be outside the head. Take a sound that you are hearing now, for instance, the traffic. And take the experience of the head, in which hearing is supposedly taking place. Our only experience of the head is a tingling mass of vibration. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">Now is it your actual experience that the sound of the traffic is taking place inside the tingling vibration we call ‘the head?’ Go directly to the experience. Or rather is it your experience that the tingling vibration called the ‘sound of traffic’ <em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;">and</em> the tingling vibration call the ‘head’ both appear in Awareness? </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">Or we can ask ourselves, do we experience the Awareness that is hearing the sound of the traffic as being located in the tingling mass of vibration called ‘the head?’ In other words do we experience Awareness inside a sensation but outside a perception?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">In order to find the answer try to look at this Awareness…..do you know where to look for it, can you see it or find it? No! Whilst Awareness is undeniably present, it cannot be located anywhere. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">Therefore it is our simple, direct experience that Awareness is not located in the sensation we call the head and therefore it is also our simple experience that hearing, which takes place in Awareness, is also not located in the head. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">Our only experience of the head is through sensing and our only experience of the sound of the traffic is through hearing, and sensing and hearing both take place in the same place, that is, in the placeless place of Awareness. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">In fact, it is not even true to say that hearing and sensing take place <em style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: transparent;">in </em>Awareness. Rather, Awareness as it were, takes the shape of sensing and hearing from time to time. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">Awareness then takes the shape of a thought which conjures up a fairy tale about an individual entity that lives inside the head which hears a sound which supposedly takes place in an imagined space outside the head. </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border: 0px; outline: 0px; font-size: 13px; vertical-align: baseline; background-color: #efe9e5; text-align: justify; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 22px;">However, this fairy tale doesn’t change the fact of our experience which is that there is only Awareness, which sometimes takes the shape of thinking, sensing and perceiving, thereby giving birth to the appearance of the mind, body and world.</p>
