If not, just let him go. DonÂ’t need to avoid him purposelly. At the same time, donÂ’t seek him out either. Occupy your time with activities that will take your mind elsewhere. It will still hurt for a while, but you will get over the aching in time.<br><br>If on the other hand, he is someone that you cannot avoid, then it gets a little more complicated. I would suggest seeing the relationship from the following angles:<br><br>You cannot be in love with someone till you spent a lot of quality time together. By quality time, I mean the time you two spent opening frankly up to each other on your feelings, likes &amp; dislikes etc.  Quality time will also include the Â‘downÂ’ side of a relationÂ… I believe that a personÂ’s Â‘trueÂ’ nature can only be revealed in Â‘badÂ’ times. Until this happens, you may be in love only with a mental construct made up by yourself (based on your notion of an ideal lover, and the projection of his outward characteristics), rather than the Â‘actualÂ’ person that he is.<br><br>The Â‘lustÂ’ side of things is actually pretty simple to manageÂ… Whenever I see a pretty lady and felt the first stirring of lustful desire. I just need to imagine the ladyÂ’s appearance 40years down the lineÂ…. Works better than a cold shower. I am not sure this technique will work on man, since man goes by a different yardstick to women when it comes to physical attractiveness etc., but it is still worth a try...<br><br>To feel for someone is a good thing, but if you take that feeling to an extreme, it then becomes an obsession, an attachment and a fetter...<br><br>May you be free of your suffering<br>May all beings be free of sufferings<br><br></div>
