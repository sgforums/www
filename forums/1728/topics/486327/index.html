                      edition of German paper <a href="http://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article132019000/In-meinen-Traeumen-werde-ich-113-Jahre-alt.html"><em><span style="color: black;">Die Welt</span></em></a> has caused
                      quite a stir in the media and in Tibetan communities across the globe.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"> </p>

                      quoted as saying in the interview. “The 14th Dalai Lama now is very popular.
                      Let us then finish with a popular Dalai Lama.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"> </p>

                      German paper seems to have understood this statement to mean that the Dalai
                      Lama wishes to discontinue the lineage, running the interview under a subtitle
                      that includes the statement “the Dalai Lama does not want to have a successor.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">News sources like <a href="http://www.afp.com/en/node/2808688"><span style="color: black;">Agence France-Presse</span></a>,
                      whose version of the story has been reprinted in numerous other publications
                      like <em>Al Jazeera</em> and <em>Yahoo! News</em> (and essentially reworded in the<em> Huffington Post</em>), have interpreted the Dalai Lama’s statement as a reversal
                      of longstanding policy regarding the continuation of the Dalai Lama lineage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"> </p>

                      This morning, government officials called on the Dalai Lama to respect the
                      historic practice of reincarnation in a press conference (no irony intended, we
                      think): “China follows a policy of freedom of religion and belief, and this
                      naturally includes having to respect and protect the ways of passing on Tibetan
                      Buddhism.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The transcript of the <em>Die Welt</em> interview, however, paints a very
                      different picture from that taken up by most media outlets. The Dalai Lama
                      prefaces the aforementioned statement by saying “sometimes I make a joke…” and
                      speaks alternately about his role as a politician and as a spiritual leader.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">“The institution of the Dalai Lama was important mainly because of its
                      political power,” he says earlier in the interview. “Politically . . . the
                      centuries of having a Dalai Lama should be over.” This statement is nothing
                      new, as Tenzin Gyatso relinquished his political power back in 2011.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The Dalai Lama institution led Tibet politically for nearly four
                      centuries, from 1642 until just a few years ago. But it came to represent the de
                      facto leadership of Tibetan Buddhism only recently, beginning when the current
                      Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Speaking of his role as a spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama tells <em>Welt
                      am Sonntag</em> that “Tibetan Buddhism is not dependent on one individual. We have
                      a very good organizational structure with highly trained monks and scholars.”
                      Asked whether the Tibetans will require a Dalai Lama in the future, he responds
                      modestly, “No, I don’t think so.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Robert Barnett, director of Columbia University’s Tibetan Studies
                      program, thinks the meaning of this statement has been lost in translation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">“It is in line with the tradition whereby all lamas are expected to
                      demonstrate diffidence about the question of their return as a kind of
                      humility,” Barnett told <em>Tricycle</em>. “The convention is that they are only
                      able to return if their followers pray intently for them to do so.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Barnett also holds that there is a more significant issue that the Dalai
                      Lama addresses here, which seems to escape both his German interlocutors and the
                      American media. “He is clearly saying that his role as the leading figure in
                      Tibetan Buddhism will not continue,” says Barnett.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The 14th Dalai Lama acquired this role due to the exigencies of exile.
                      In the interview, he seems to say that the robust Tibetan monastic academies
                      that have been established in India over the decades obviate the need for such
                      an institution, and after the current Dalai Lama passes away, other Buddhist
                      sects will likely run themselves with greater autonomy as they have in the past.
                      Barnett points to the fact that although this has long been understood to be
                      the case, the utterance takes on special importance because it constitutes a
                      clear statement of intention.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Several statements of the Dalai Lama that appear later in the interview
                      further contradict the interpretation that he intends to end the Dalai Lama
                      lineage altogether. “I hope and pray that I may return to this world as long as
                      sentient beings suffering remain,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">He goes on to quote the first Dalai Lama: “‘I have no desire for any of
                      these heavenly places. I want to be reborn, where I can be of use.’ This is my
                      wish, too.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 13.1pt;">The
                      suggestion that the Dalai Lama line might be reaching its end seems to be the
                      result of one big misunderstanding.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">If what he have said is considered selfish, it is not selfishness
              for himself, it is more for the wellbeing of the Tibetan peoples. Whether he will
              be considered a legend in the future, let history takes its own course. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 1.231;">By the way, he is not just another guy. To the Tibetan
              Buddhists, he is in the same league as the God of the theist religions. His
              words and action carries as much weight as the WORDS in the holy scriptures of
              the theist religions. That is why the Chinese government was compelled to reply
              when he comments on the subject of the cessation on this linkage. It worries
              them as they have decree the next Dalai Lama must be born in China which would
              means a Dalai Lama under their control. If this linkage ceases, the Chinese government
              would have lost a very important mouthpiece to help them set their agenda for
              the province of Tibet.</span></p>

                  the Faith decides to play ‘God’, interfering, exploiting and making decisions
                  on behalf of the religion for their political end that is doing harm, causing
                  discontent and the lost of lives. We see that happening in Tibet with 125 lives
                  lost so far by self immolation of monks and laypersons. </span></p>
