                      across Greater Jakarta, meeting mourners rich and poor, as well as
                      organizations providing funeral services, to see how the capital and its
                      surroundings meet the needs of the deceased and their grieving families. The
                      following contributed to this report:</span></em><strong><span style="border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;">.</span></strong><strong><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;"><br> </span></strong><br> San Diego Hills Memorial Park in Karawang, West Java, was busy one day with two
                      simultaneous funerals. In the Christian section, a family gathered under white
                      tents to bury a husband and father.<span> </span><br> <br> Around 50 people sat on folding chairs beside the coffin of the 43-year-old,
                      who had died, relatives said, of cancer. The ceremony proceeded with hymns, the
                      reminiscences of loved ones and prayers for the deceased, before proceeding to
                      the burial.<br> <br> Down the hill in the Buddhist section, another group of white tents sheltered
                      mourners dressed in white for the burial of mother, grandmother and great
                      grandmother Kheng Tjin Kwai, 82.<br> <br> Almost 40 people knelt before the altar set in front of the grave. A Buddhist
                      monk led the ritual, while a grief counselor assisted mourners in following the
                      prayers, the burning of joss paper effigies and other traditions.<br> <br> Three mourners said Kheng’s descendants — who included both Buddhists and
                      Christians — wanted to honor her ancient Chinese beliefs and traditions.<br> <br> A day before, at the Tegal Alur II Cemetery in West Jakarta, which primarily
                      serves Muslims, a man sat across from a flower kiosk, where mourners can buy
                      petals and other burial items.<span> </span><br> <br> Hajair, a gravedigger who digs resting places for the unidentified dead, said
                      he had just finished preparing a final resting place for his cousin, Titin
                      Sumarni, 41, a teacher.<span> </span><br> <br> Titin’s mother, Rokyah, said her daughter had, shortly before dying, fulfilled
                      the teaching requirements for a Bachelor’s degree.<br> <br> “We never thought that God would call her so soon,” she said.<span> </span><br> <br> Nobody in the family, including Titin’s husband, Erpin, was prepared to face
                      the challenges of burying someone in Jakarta without assistance.<br> <br> “As it turned out, our community chief assisted us by arranging for chairs and
                      tents for guests at our home, and for the hearse to bring the body to the
                      cemetery,” Erpin explained.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'><br> Dying in Jakarta is a complicated process, even with the bureaucratic reforms
                      introduced in the 2007 bylaw on cemeteries. Yet all of the above families found
                      someone willing and able to assist them in their time of grief.<span> </span><br> <br> The difference in levels of service for the dead, as for the living, depends on
                      social status, wealth, religion, land availability and access to information
                      about regulations, services and costs.<span> </span><br> <br> Land scarcity presents a challenge to the Jakarta administration, as the
                      capital’s already large population continues to grow, with 27,375 people dying
                      annually.<br> <br> The bureaucracy of death requires relatives of the deceased to present the
                      following documents: death certificate from a medical facility, the deceased’s
                      identity and family card, ID of the family member in charge of burial, a
                      subdistrict reference letter to funeral authorities and proof of payment from
                      Bank DKI. All of this is required just for a burial plot.<br> <br> According to Tegal Alur Cemetery administrator H. Suaeb, funerals no longer
                      entail illegal fees solicited at cemeteries, though people often give tips to
                      the gravediggers and groundskeepers.<span> </span><br> <br> Religion and tradition further complicate the funeral process.<br> <br> Kasman Sukandar, a grief consultant from Anugrah Jasa, said he had been
                      providing advice to mourners since the 1990s.<span> </span><br> <br> “Even people of the same religion may practice different rituals, depending on
                      what ethnic group or traditions they have inherited,” he said.<br> <br> Jakarta Cathedral parish priest, Stefanus Bratakartana SJ, explained that some
                      Catholics of Chinese descent might not adhere to church rituals. “If a Chinese
                      family wants to cremate their relative, it is up to them,” he said.<br> <br> Confucians, Buddhists and sometimes Protestants from various ethnicities may
                      also opt for cremation. Only Muslims of all ethnic backgrounds refuse to
                      cremate their dead, insisting on burial within 24 hours.<span> </span><br> <br> Pastor Ainul Nurul said that in the Protestant tradition, the focus was on how
                      to comfort the grieving family. Prayer services “can be held at any time that
                      is convenient for the family and friends”, she said.<br> <br> Buddhists and Confucians generally hold processions before burial, which may
                      mean the dead are not buried immediately.<br> <br> In Hinduism, the rituals following cleansing and shrouding occur simultaneously
                      with the preparation of the body for burial and possible later cremation.<br> <br> Nevertheless, nobody dying in Jakarta needs to worry about having someone there
                      to lay them to rest. If the government does not help you, the community will,
                      and commercial services are always available.<span> </span><br> <br> Under the cemeteries bylaw, all burial costs are borne by the municipality. The
                      only charges imposed are burial plot rents, ranging from nothing to Rp 100,000
                      for three years.<span> </span><br> <br> In Jakarta, each subdistrict has a One-stop Integrated Service Center, which
                      assists with various permits — including access to burial plots.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: normal;">When someone dies, his or her loved ones receive a death
                      certificate to take to their community or neighborhood chiefs, who then gives
                      them a referral letter for the one-stop center determining their payment status
                      based on family income. If the deceased is unidentified or has no next of kin,
                      he or she is buried in Tegal Alur Cemetery. For families of the deceased
                      categorized as poor, burial plots are free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #333333;'>If the family is considered able to pay, the rental fee for a burial plot
                      depends on their level of income. The one-stop center then provides a letter to
                      Bank DKI, which calculates the rental cost and provides three receipts, one
                      each for the family, the cemetery and the one-stop center. Once proof of
                      payment has been established, the deceased can be buried.<br> <br> What the government does not do, the community — religious organizations,
                      foundations, freelance counselors, neighbors, etc. — can.<br> <br> The Pesantren Islam Al-Azhar Foundation, through its funeral process unit
                      founded in 1992, assists with transportation, cleansing and shrouding of the
                      deceased for fees between Rp 1.5 million and Rp 3 million for non-members. For
                      members, who pay a monthly fee of<br> Rp 5,000 each, all services are free.<br> <br> Religious organizations also offer services — counseling, prayer recital,
                      cleansing and cosmetic procedures, coffin procurement, hearses, grave-keeping
                      and administrative assistance.<br> <br> The business sector also provides funeral-related goods and services for anyone
                      requiring them at costs ranging from affordable on a small budget to extremely
                      expensive.<span> </span><br> <br> The Cilincing Crematorium provides coffins and cremations for as little as Rp
                      3.3 million, or less if the bereaved can provide proof of poverty.<span> </span><br> <br> For those with deeper pockets, Heaven Funeral Home and Crematorium in Gedong Panjang
                      provides coffins, funeral service space, cremation and administrative service
                      for total fees ranging from around Rp 40 million to Rp 103 million.<span> </span><br> <br> The Cikini Funeral Home provides preburial and precremation services, covering
                      cleansing, embalming, make-up, coffins and funeral service space. Total fees
                      can reach Rp 43 million.<br> <br> Richer families can also take a luxurious route to laying their loved ones to
                      rest.<br> <br> Lestari Memorial Park in Karawang, West Java, offers burial plots ranging from
                      Rp 58 million to Rp 10 billion, as well as cremation services ranging from
                      cremation alone at Rp 5.5 million, to cremation and the scattering of ashes at
                      Rp 8 million.<span> </span><br> <br> This cemetery complex also provides a columbarium for the storage of crematory
                      urns or boxes.<span> </span><br> <br> San Diego Hills Memorial Park and Funeral Homes, meanwhile, offers burial plots
                      ranging from Rp 26.7 million to Rp 10.1 billion. This 500-hectare funeral and
                      burial complex in Karawang also provides chapels, Islamic prayer rooms, other
                      funeral service spaces and a multipurpose building.<span> </span><br> <br> With such a range of facilities and services, it is no longer necessary to fear
                      the age-old adage: “Don’t die in Jakarta."</span></p>
