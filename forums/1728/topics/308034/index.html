              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then the Devarajas from the four directions rose from their seats and, with palms joined, respectfully addressed the Buddha, saying, </span><span style="font-family: Arial;">"O World Honored One, since Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha took such grand vows vast long kalpas ago, how is it that he has not yet completed his work of deliverance and that he is now, even again, taking extensive, immense vows? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">It is our sole hope that you, O World Honored One, will explain this to us."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Buddha responded to the four Devarajas, "Excellent, excellent! Now I am going to tell you and the present and future devas and human beings about the expedient things which Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha is doing on the paths of birth and death in Jambudvipa of the Saha World to render merciful and compassionate deliverance and liberation to all sinful and suffering beings."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The four Devarajas said, " Yes, indeed, O World Honored One, we will be delighted to listen."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Buddha said to the four Devarajas,<span style="color: #993366;"> <strong>"From vast, long kalpas ago until the present time, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has been delivering and liberating sentient beings, but he has not yet completely fulfilled his vows</strong>.</span> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since he has mercy and pity on all sinful suffering beings in this world and <strong><span style="color: #993366;">sees that their entanglement will not be cut off for countless kalpas in the future, he again has taken further colossal vows to encourage all the Bodhisattvas to resort to hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of expediencies in Jambudvipa of the Saha World in order to teach and convert them.</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #993366;"><a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap4.html">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/ksitigarbha/chap4.html</a></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The highlighted part tells us clearly that two main points:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1) Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is so compassionate that he again undertakes further great vows as of now, to ensure complete and thorough deliverance for all suffering beings while the world waits for the birth of Maitreya Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">2) There are too many suffering beings that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>will not</strong></span> have their evil karmic entanglements cut off for good for<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> countless kalpas in the future</strong></span>.</span></p>
              <p>So what is the message behind this whole excerpt?</p>
              <p>I don't know what it means to each and everyone of you, but it certainly means the following to me:</p>
              <p>From point 2, we can infer that it is not as simple as telling these beings to contemplate on anatta or emptiness or even try to repent.</p>
              <p>If it is so easy to tell beings to contemplate emptiness or to consistently practise repentence, I seriously don't think Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva needs to go to such lengths to help us. I can see the urgency in his actions, I can feel his boundless love and patience if I look at the excerpt from such an angle.</p>
              <p>In a way, I personally feel Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is indirectly saying that even with great wisdom and compassion, there are still many out there who have karmic affinity with him that will not easily repent or will not quickly understand and practise 'emptiness' to the extent of at least gaining 1st bhumi of sainthood (stream-returner or é¡»é™€æ´¹).</p>
              <p>It is because of the truths conveyed in the above paragraphs, just these paragraphs alone, are enough to convince me to want to be with this great teacher and parent of all sentient beings for as long as possible. To be able to witness for myself his skilful means in delivering stubborn, wilful and evil beings. It is these paragraphs that I immediately grow to honour and revere the great compassion and wisdom of the Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>I hope fellow Buddhists will work together, to contribute in any way that will help Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva to fulfill all his Vows completely and as early as possible, so that he may finally attain Buddhahood and again help countless beings to the blissful shore of Nirvana.</p>

              <p>What Buddha meant here is that we all must help Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva fulfill his vows, by transforming the minds of sentient beings here on Earth.</p>
              <p>Because if Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva saved a sentient being from hell but when he becomes human and create bad karma again, he will nevertheless end up in hell again in future lifetimes.</p>
              <p>Hence as my Master said our relation with Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva is to lead people to the righteous path so that they do not have to end up in hell, and to guide these people to the path of liberation.</p>
              <p>Afterall, the only way one can save a sentient being and prevent him from ever falling into hell again is to end their cycle of samsara. The teachings of 'No-self' and 'emptiness' is itself the fundamental skillful means taught that can liberate sentient beings from their vexations and ignorance, so that they may be freed from birth and death, and hence hell will certainly be empty earlier.</p>

              <p>How can it be considered 'saved' if that sentient being commits bad karma and falls into hell again in future lifetimes?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, don't Bodhisattvas like Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva already have å®¿å‘½é€šï¼Œæ™ºæ…§çœ¼ to know that this particular being will still fall into hell after after having delivered them to temporary havens like heaven or human realms?</p>
              <p>If he knows, why still save? If he chooses to save, does that mean that being is 'destined' to be saved and later fall into hell?</p>
              <p>The teachings of "No-self' and "emptiness" is the ultimate reality, the ultimate truth. But I personally don't think Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva would preach these profound truths for those who still have deep and especially very negative karmic entanglements.</p>
              <p>And furthermore if someone with great compassion and wisdom cannot deliver all beings for so many kalpas, surely it shows to some extent that mere unenlightened beings have less to offer in terms of helping him to fulfill his vows?</p>
              <p>For me, at my level, what I can do to fulfill both my wish of helping the Bodhisattva to fulfil his vows and his own personal conviction, is to really promote his name, his great compassion and wisdom to all beings with or without yuan. After all, if this Bodhisattva only has yuan with 5.9 billion people out of the 6 billion world population, who is gonna to care for the 0.1 billion people then?</p>
              <p>I choose to believe that the name, the virtues, the vows of the Bodhisattva have yuan with all the 6 billion in our saha world. That is much simpler to understand and accept for half-hearted, half-evil people like me. haha.</p>

              <p>How can it be considered 'saved' if that sentient being commits
                      bad karma and falls into hell again in future lifetimes?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, don't Bodhisattvas like Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva
                      already have å®¿å‘½é€šï¼Œæ™ºæ…§çœ¼ to know that this particular being will still
                      fall into hell after after having delivered them to temporary
                      havens like heaven or human realms?</p>
              <p>If he knows, why still save? If he chooses to save, does that
                      mean that being is 'destined' to be saved and later fall into
                      hell?</p>
              <p>The teachings of "No-self' and "emptiness" is the ultimate
                      reality, the ultimate truth. But I personally don't think
                      Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva would preach these profound truths for
                      those who still have deep and especially very negative karmic
                      entanglements.</p>
              <p>And furthermore if someone with great compassion and wisdom
                      cannot deliver all beings for so many kalpas, surely it shows to
                      some extent that mere unenlightened beings have less to offer in
                      terms of helping him to fulfill his vows?</p>
              <p>For me, at my level, what I can do to fulfill both my wish of
                      helping the Bodhisattva to fulfil his vows and his own personal
                      conviction, is to really promote his name, his great compassion and
                      wisdom to all beings with or without yuan. After all, if this
                      Bodhisattva only has yuan with 5.9 billion people out of the 6
                      billion world population, who is gonna to care for the 0.1 billion
                      people then?</p>
              <p>I choose to believe that the name, the virtues, the vows of the
                      Bodhisattva have yuan with all the 6 billion in our saha world.
                      That is much simpler to understand and accept for half-hearted,
                      half-evil people like me. haha.</p>

              <p>Someone in the lower realms such as hell will never be able to cultivate the dharma anyway, and they will never become enlightened in the hell realms.

              <p>The most anyone can do is I think to advise them to repent their deeds so that when they got out of hell realm, they will be able to walk the righteous path and the path towards enlightenment.</p>
              <p>As for whether the being will fall back to hell again, it pretty much depends on whether the person cultivates after returning from the hell realm. There is no guarantee a person will not fall into hell unless he is enlightened. Which is also why Ksitigarbha calls for all other bodhisattvas to help him.</p>
              <p>As you said the most we can do is promote Ksitigarbha teachings, as well as promote Buddhism in general, and invite others to join the path towards liberation, the path that asks people to 'avoid evil, do good, purify the mind'.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, or maybe most of time, I wish that I'm already a Bodhisattva like Ksitigarbha so that I can totally not worry about taking tons of time to totally eradicate my delusions and start helping people to achieve liberation in the most shortest time possible for them.</p>
              <p>Yes, it is still pretty egoistic of me, I know....But it's a conflict inside me, between learning to be compassionate and non-attached and wanting to stay safe and happy for my own sake.</p>
              <p>I shall now imagine I am Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. That works to relieve the emotional tension in me. At least to quite some extent.</p>

              <p>These people would not care about what Buddhism has to say about emptiness or Buddha nature. Yes, they would feel empty, instead of  realising the nature of emptiness taught by the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel as if I'm bluffing myself all the time that all sentient beings have Buddha nature. I keep on reminding myself that the Buddha would not lie, but yet it is something I cannot see, touch or feel. It is something that I would take aeons to really see a small part of its 'existence'.</p>
              <p>It is mentioned that even Arahants see only a bit of their Buddha nature. Only Buddhas sees the Buddha nature as if they are looking at the moon in bright sunlight.</p>

              <p>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva will have the wisdom to know what is the best for the sentient being and how to guide him so that he will go back on path. Just like Shakyamuni Buddha knows how to guide sentient beings. But after Shakyamuni taught the dharma, it's up to us to practice, he can't walk the path for us. Similarly those who are saved by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva will still have to cultivate in order not to end up in hell again. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva did his part. Just like Shakyamuni's efforts to tame the sentient beings in Jambudvipa is never wasted, so is Ksitigarbha's effort never wasted. But still he can't control whether you are going to do good or evil or whether you are going to walk the path to liberation.</p>
              <p>Buddha-nature is unavoidable... but the more you seek the more you are trying to avoid it, like riding on a bull finding the bull. Finding the mind outside the mind... In fact precisely because we have been constantly seeking and desiring we forever miss what is ever present and undergo numberless rebirths.</p>
              <p>The sutras say Mind is Buddha.</p>
              <p>The sutras also say, the moment you seek a dharma external to Mind (which is Buddha), you are an externalist (xin wai qiu fa shi wai dao). You seek external proof, then you are seeking something external to Mind, and that can never be the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Buddha said in the Diamond Sutra,</p>

              <p>All forms are illusory, you can never seek Buddha in forms. You can never find proof of Buddha-nature from anything external, because everything can be doubted, maybe everything might be the Matrix, maybe a virtual reality.</p>
              <p>But something cannot be doubted, look into it. Because you can doubt everything from your room to your life story, it may all be a matrix. But what is undeniable and undoubt-able is the doubting itself, i.e. THIS Present Awareness, the reality of This Moment, your very Presence itself, the reality of Mind/Consciousness/Awareness in which doubting arises and IS the arising doubt. Even if you were to doubt that, that would be Mind/Consciousness/Awareness doubting. That is Buddha.</p>
              <p>So can you see now why Buddha Nature is unavoidable? Even if you try to avoid it, it is still Mind running away, Mind trying to avoid Mind. Mind will always be Mind. Can you see that IT is Unavoidable, Undeniable, and Certain? So stop looking elsewhere. Stop all futile seeking and futile avoiding... <em>This</em> is IT.</p>
              <p>You can only know Buddha by turning the light inwards and drop all concepts and external seeking...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. as for your question on Arhat and Bodhisattva, the great Zen Master Huang Po (Master of Zen Master Linji) said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">Our original Buddha-Nature is, in highest 
                  truth, devoid of any atom of objectivity.  It is void, omnipresent, silent, 
                  pure; it is glorious and mysterious peaceful joy - and that is all.  Enter 
                  deeply into it by awakening to it yourself.   That which is before you 
                  is it, in all its fullness, utterly complete.  There is naught beside.  
                  Even if you go through all the stages of a Bodhisattva's progress towards 
                  Buddhahood, one by one; when at last, in a single flash, you attain to full 
                  realization, you will only be realizing the Buddha-Nature which has been with 
                  you all the time; and by the foregoing stages you will have added nothing to it 
                  at all.    You will come to look upon those aeons of work 
                  and achievement as no better than unreal actions performed in a dream.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">This is why the Tathagata said, "I truly 
                  attained nothing from complete, unexcelled enlightenment."  He also said: 
                  "This Dharma is absolutely without distinctions, neither high nor low, and its 
                  name is Bodhi."  It is pure Mind, which is the source of everything and 
                  which, whether appearing as sentient beings or Buddhas, or as the rivers and 
                  mountains of the world which has form, or as that which is formless, or penetrating 
                  the whole universe, is absolutely without distinctions, there being no such 
                  entities as selfness and otherness.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">That which is called the City of Illusions 
                  contains the Two Vehicles, the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva's Progress, and two 
                  forms of Full Enlightenment.  All of them are powerful teachings for 
                  arousing people's interest, but they still belong to the City of Illusions.  
                  That which is called the Place of Precious Things is the real Mind, the original 
                  Buddha-essence, the treasure of our own real Nature.  These jewels cannot 
                  be measured or accumulated.  Yet since there are neither Buddha nor 
                  sentient beings, neither subject nor object, where can there be a Place of 
                  Precious Things?   If you ask, "Well, so much for the City of 
                  Illusions, but where is the Place of Precious Things?", it is a place to which 
                  no directions can be given.   For if it could be pointed out, it would 
                  be a place existing in space; hence, it would not be the real Place of Precious 
                  Things.  All we can say is that it is close by.  It cannot be exactly 
                  described, but when you have a tacit understanding of it, it is there. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My comments: It is close by! It is Intimacy itself. In fact, there is no distance at all between 'you' and 'IT', because IT/Mind is your very Presence.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind, beside 
              which nothing exists.</span>   <span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">This 
              Mind, which is without beginning is unborn and indestructible.   It is 
              not green nor yellow, and has neither form nor appearance.  It does not 
              belong in the categories of things which exist or do not exist, nor can it be 
              thought of in terms of new or old.  It is neither long nor short, big nor 
              small, for it transcends all limits, measures, names, traces and comparisons.  
              It is that which you see before you - begin to reason about it and you at once 
              fall into error.    It is like the boundless void which cannot be 
              fathomed or measured. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">If you are not absolutely convinced that the 
              Mind is the Buddha, and if you are attached to forms, practices and 
              meritorious performances, your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible 
              with the Way.   The Mind <em>is</em> the Buddha, nor are there any other 
              Buddhas or any other mind.  It is bright and spotless as the void, 
              having nor form or appearance whatsoever.  To make use of your minds to 
              think conceptually is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. 
              Awake only to the One Mind, and there is nothing whatsoever to be attained.    </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">If you students of the Way do not awaken to 
              this Mind substance, you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will 
              seek the Buddha outside of yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, 
              pious practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the way to 
              supreme knowledge.</span></p>

              <p>The essence of this sutra, according to Master Chin Kung are as follows:</p>
              <p>1. Fillial piety and respect for teachers and elders - this is the very basic of our Buddha nature, in Chinese, åœ°è—� means treasure within.</p>
              <p>2. If we would like to help others in the three bad realms, we must first first improve ourselves by getting rid of attachments, discrimination and wild thoughts gradually - many examples are given within the sutra about the past lives of Ksitigarbha.</p>
              <p>3. Fillial piety should be expanded to beyond our parents to include all sentient beings - great vow/compassion</p>
              <p>Therefore, in the true spirit of the sutra, it is very important for us to ask ourselves whether we have fillial piety towards our parents. If we already achieve that, then we must spread the messages of fillial
              piety/respect for elders/teachers to others.</p>
              <p>And about hell, what I learn from lecture of Master Chin Kung:</p>
              <p>When the thought of anger arise, one can be said to be in hell at that
              moment. Therefore, hell exists within our mind. If the feeling of anger
              is not controlled, it will eventually lead to harmful actions to others
              and eventually the karmic force is  so poweful that it leads one to be
              reincarnated in Hell. Feeling of anger arise due to our attachments,
              discrimination and wild thoughts, they are not part of our Buddha
              nature. To control anger or all other negative thoughts, training of
              mind to be mindful is absolutely important. There are
              many ways to cultivate mindfulness including meditation, chanting,
              reciting of amitabha as in pureland buddhism etc.</p>

              <p>Hi Spnw07, I think we should always remind ourselves that the more we study the dharma or the more we practised the path, the more clear we should become, not more confused.</p>
              <p>Yes, due to the profound concepts of the dharma, most people like us may naturally in certain stage develop doubts in our minds, which in this case we should at once consult our dharma teachers or any learned Buddhists brothers ( regardless of age of cos, so AEN is one of them<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png">). Studying or reading sutras   without guidance can be dangerous for certain people as they may unknowingly form wrong views or thoughts ( é‚ªçŸ¥ï¼Œé‚ªè§�ï¼‰.  </p>
              <p>So I guess one way for us to keep on the right tract, is to always go back to the basic: Clear our minds. Pull back all wondering thoughts, no matter how noble they may be, just come back. Come back to what you are doing or going to do now, like boiling the water, mop the floor, read the papers, take a nap, take the mrt to work, SMS your friend, help your mom carry her groceries, help your colleagues in work, say hello to your neighbours, etc. Step by step. You then can go further n further, take on responsibilities more n more with ease, grade up your target higher n higher with confidence.</p>
              <p>Master Shen Yan once said that to be a Buddhist is to be a upright person( å¥½å¥½å�šäººï¼‰, then one is not far from being a Bodhisattva or Buddha. This may sound very general and boring to many, but sometimes it is exactly becos we shun the simplicity of the truth and in pursue of the complex that put ourselves in  never ending confusions.</p>

              <p><br>Well, I have been doing most of what you have said in the above examples. But what happened is that I grew tired and lost in such mundane things and wanted to look for something to fill the void inside.</p>
              <p>I somehow don't have the heart to care about people when I'm doing daily tasks. It is only when I have nothing to do that I feel like caring for or about people. Mundane tasks numbs me. I'm after all, not Patriarch Hui Neng.</p>

              <p>Well, true, you can't always spoonfeed or led someone by the nose all the time. But they are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, they have exceptional wisdom and compassion, there are countless ways for them to help those who are lazy, stupid or stubborn, much unlike human beings, who would usually draw a line or pass judgement on certain people that they can't be helped if they continue not to listen and so on.</p>
              <p>If it's really up to us to practise what is taught, then Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's work should have been completed long ago: as in just teach, you follow or don't follow, none of my business. "Don't follow, you go hell loh. You follow, go heaven or Pureland loh."</p>
              <p>If the Bodhisattva began with such an mentality before he started cultivating, I'm sure he wouldn't succeed. And if it's just a matter of "teach the sentient beings and forget", I also don't think Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva still needs to proclaim and undertake greater vows to help all of us when he has already the Tenth level of the Budda-to-be.</p>
              <p>If like that, I don't think anyone should shy away from striving for Buddhahood. Cos so simple mah, you teach, they listen or don't listen, practise or don't practise, is their dai ji (business), then where is the compassion, where is the boundless wisdom? Where is the truth that all can become Buddhas?</p>
              <p>Why talk about skilful means? What's the purpose of achieving Buddhahood when there will always be people who can't be helped? (For example: Icchantika)</p>
              <p>Why not just aim to become an Arahant which is much easier than being a Bodhisattva but yet much more difficult than attaining heavenly birth?</p>
              <p>Even Sariputra gave a sigh that the Bodhisattva way is too tough for a virtuous monk like him in his past life. If a virtuous and wise monk like his previous life cannot past the 'test', who am I to be able to do it?</p>
              <p>I can't help feeling depressed and helpless when reading stories of wise and virtuous practitioners falling down...It's painful to read and recollect...</p>
              <p>I feel afraid cos I worry that raising the thought to attain Buddhahood might lead me to the same end up like Sariputra..falling into the smaller vehicle or quitting cultivation for a long, long time...</p>

              <p>I don't know about anyone here, but I just seriously dislike all those rules taught in Di Zi Gui. I hate being preached and lectured to.</p>

              <p>Well, true, you can't always spoonfeed or led someone by the
                              nose all the time. But they are Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, they have
                              exceptional wisdom and compassion, there are countless ways for
                              them to help those who are lazy, stupid or stubborn, much unlike
                              human beings, who would usually draw a line or pass judgement on
                              certain people that they can't be helped if they continue not to
                              listen and so on.</p>
              <p>If it's really up to us to practise what is taught, then
                              Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's work should have been completed long ago:
                              as in just teach, you follow or don't follow, none of my business.
                              "Don't follow, you go hell loh. You follow, go heaven or Pureland
                              loh."</p>
              <p>If the Bodhisattva began with such an mentality before he
                              started cultivating, I'm sure he wouldn't succeed. And if it's just
                              a matter of "teach the sentient beings and forget", I also don't
                              think Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva still needs to proclaim and undertake
                              greater vows to help all of us when he has already the Tenth level
                              of the Budda-to-be.</p>
              <p>If like that, I don't think anyone should shy away from striving
                              for Buddhahood. Cos so simple mah, you teach, they listen or don't
                              listen, practise or don't practise, is their dai ji (business),
                              then where is the compassion, where is the boundless wisdom? Where
                              is the truth that all can become Buddhas?</p>
              <p>Why talk about skilful means? What's the purpose of
                              achieving Buddhahood when there will always be people who can't be
                              helped? (For example: Icchantika)</p>
              <p>Why not just aim to become an Arahant which is much easier than
                              being a Bodhisattva but yet much more difficult than attaining
                              heavenly birth?</p>
              <p>Even Sariputra gave a sigh that the Bodhisattva way is too tough
                              for a virtuous monk like him in his past life. If a virtuous and
                              wise monk like his previous life cannot past the 'test', who am
                              I to be able to do it?</p>
              <p>I can't help feeling depressed and helpless when reading stories
                              of wise and virtuous practitioners falling down...It's painful to
                              read and recollect...</p>
              <p>I feel afraid cos I worry that raising the thought to
                              attain Buddhahood might lead me to the same end up
                              like Sariputra..falling into the smaller vehicle or quitting
                              cultivation for a long, long time...</p>

              <p>It's not a matter of whether he wants or do not want to guide sentient beings. Of course Buddhas would want and do their best to guide sentient beings, and in some cases would use many skillful means to encourage sentient beings to practice, but in the end its up to us. Buddhas really cannot walk the path for us, this is one of the things that a Buddha cannot do. He cannot grant enlightenment or practice for you. He also cannot change your karma, etc. He cannot control your mind and make you avoid evil, do good, and purify your mind. If all these were possible, there would already be no Hell, and all beings would be long enlightened. Enlightened beings can guide us out of suffering, but it depends on whether we practice as he taught.</p>
              <p>If a sentient being is lazy, the Buddha can teach an antidote to deal with that laziness. But if the sentient being does not apply that antidote, it is also useless. The Buddha cannot make 'laziness' disappear into thin air. If the sentient being is stupid, the Buddha also has a way of guiding him. The stupid monk Chunda also gained enlightenment, but he was sincere and diligent, followed Buddha's advise. Unfortunately, there are some who really cannot be tamed, at least not in that lifetime, as much as the Buddha wants. There is no conditions, the conditions isn't there yet. Everyone will eventually attain Buddhahood, but doesn't mean he will start practicing in that lifetime. You cannot force everyone to follow and practice the dharma or follow a sage's advise.</p>
              <p>As much as Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva would like to liberate all beings, if we do not cooperate with him then it will not happen. Of course, beings in hell will surely listen to Ksitigarbha, because they are in such state of suffering that there is no way he would not want to follow the path that can get him out of suffering.</p>
              <p>But when the being return to the human realm, if he forgot about his past suffering and continue to engage in evil behaviors, then he will then continue to fall back into the lower realms.</p>
              <p>Hence, other Bodhisattvas here on Earth need to guide sentient beings so that they will not fall into hell and walk the path towards liberation. If fewer people fall into hell, Ksitigarbha's vows becomes accomplished easier.</p>

              <p>Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva will have the wisdom to know what is the
              best for the sentient being and how to guide him so that he will go
              back on path. Just like Shakyamuni Buddha knows how to guide
              sentient beings. But after Shakyamuni taught the dharma, it's up to
              us to practice, he can't walk the path for us. Similarly those who
              are saved by Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva will still have to cultivate
              in order not to end up in hell again. Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva did
              his part. Just like Shakyamuni's efforts to tame the sentient
              beings in Jambudvipa is never wasted, so is Ksitigarbha's effort
              never wasted. But still he can't control whether you are going to
              do good or evil or whether you are going to walk the path to
              liberation.</p>
              <p>Buddha-nature is unavoidable... but the more you seek the more
              you are trying to avoid it, like riding on a bull finding the bull.
              Finding the mind outside the mind... In fact precisely because we
              have been constantly seeking and desiring we forever miss what is
              ever present and undergo numberless rebirths.</p>
              <p>The sutras say Mind is Buddha.</p>
              <p>The sutras also say, the moment you seek a dharma external to
              Mind (which is Buddha), you are an externalist (xin wai qiu fa shi
              wai dao). You seek external proof, then you are seeking something
              external to Mind, and that can never be the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the Buddha said in the Diamond Sutra,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: small;"> “He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a
              heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).”<br></span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: small;"> “All forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are
              illusory, one sees the Tathagata.”</span></p>
              <p>All forms are illusory, you can never seek Buddha in forms. You
              can never find proof of Buddha-nature from anything external,
              because everything can be doubted, maybe everything might be the
              Matrix, maybe a virtual reality.</p>
              <p>But something cannot be doubted, look into it. Because you can
              doubt everything from your room to your life story, it may all be a
              matrix. But what is undeniable and undoubt-able is the doubting
              itself, i.e. THIS Present Awareness, the reality of This Moment,
              your very Presence itself, the reality of
              Mind/Consciousness/Awareness in which doubting arises and IS the
              arising doubt. Even if you were to doubt that, that would be
              Mind/Consciousness/Awareness doubting. That is Buddha.</p>
              <p>So can you see now why Buddha Nature is unavoidable? Even if you
              try to avoid it, it is still Mind running away, Mind trying to
              avoid Mind. Mind will always be Mind. Can you see that IT is
              Unavoidable, Undeniable, and Certain? So stop looking elsewhere.
              Stop all futile seeking and futile avoiding... <em>This</em> is
              IT.</p>
              <p>You can only know Buddha by turning the light inwards and drop
              all concepts and external seeking...</p>
              <p>Thusness said to you previously:</p>
              <p><strong>May your wish be fulfilled! <br> <br> For your first wish, you may need to have an initial glimpse of our
              inner most essence. You can try the direct approach by asking
              yourself this,<br> <br> “Without using any languages, ‘I’, ‘me’ or any signs or symbols,
              how is ‘I’ experienced?”<br> <br> Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct
              ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more
              dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the
              ‘touch’.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often
              wrongly understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the
              doctrine of Anatta and Emptiness as antidote. <br> <br> Happy Chinese New Year!</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. as for your question on Arhat and Bodhisattva, the great
              Zen Master Huang Po (Master of Zen Master Linji) said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">Our
              original Buddha-Nature is, in highest truth, devoid of any atom of
              objectivity.  It is void, omnipresent, silent, pure; it is
              glorious and mysterious peaceful joy - and that is all.  Enter
              deeply into it by awakening to it yourself.   That which
              is before you is it, in all its fullness, utterly complete. 
              There is naught beside.  Even if you go through all the stages
              of a Bodhisattva's progress towards Buddhahood, one by one; when at
              last, in a single flash, you attain to full realization, you will
              only be realizing the Buddha-Nature which has been with you all the
              time; and by the foregoing stages you will have added nothing to it
              at all.    You will come to look upon those aeons of
              work and achievement as no better than unreal actions performed in
              a dream.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">This is
              why the Tathagata said, "I truly attained nothing from complete,
              unexcelled enlightenment."  He also said: "This Dharma is
              absolutely without distinctions, neither high nor low, and its name
              is Bodhi."  It is pure Mind, which is the source of everything
              and which, whether appearing as sentient beings or Buddhas, or as
              the rivers and mountains of the world which has form, or as that
              which is formless, or penetrating the whole universe, is absolutely
              without distinctions, there being no such entities as selfness and
              otherness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">That
              which is called the City of Illusions contains the Two Vehicles,
              the Ten Stages of a Bodhisattva's Progress, and two forms of Full
              Enlightenment.  All of them are powerful teachings for
              arousing people's interest, but they still belong to the City of
              Illusions.  That which is called the Place of Precious Things
              is the real Mind, the original Buddha-essence, the treasure of our
              own real Nature.  These jewels cannot be measured or
              accumulated.  Yet since there are neither Buddha nor sentient
              beings, neither subject nor object, where can there be a Place of
              Precious Things?   If you ask, "Well, so much for the
              City of Illusions, but where is the Place of Precious Things?", it
              is a place to which no directions can be given.   For if
              it could be pointed out, it would be a place existing in space;
              hence, it would not be the real Place of Precious Things.  All
              we can say is that it is close by.  It cannot be exactly
              described, but when you have a tacit understanding of it, it is
              there.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My comments: It is close by! It is Intimacy itself. In fact,
              there is no distance at all between 'you' and 'IT', because IT/Mind
              is your very Presence.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">All the
              Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing but the One Mind,
              beside which nothing exists.</span>   <span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">This Mind, which is
              without beginning is unborn and indestructible.   It is
              not green nor yellow, and has neither form nor appearance.  It
              does not belong in the categories of things which exist or do not
              exist, nor can it be thought of in terms of new or old.  It is
              neither long nor short, big nor small, for it transcends all
              limits, measures, names, traces and comparisons.  It is that
              which you see before you - begin to reason about it and you at once
              fall into error.    It is like the boundless void
              which cannot be fathomed or measured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">If you
              are not absolutely convinced that the Mind is the Buddha, and if
              you are attached to forms, practices and meritorious performances,
              your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible with the
              Way.   The Mind <em>is</em> the Buddha, nor are there any
              other Buddhas or any other mind.  It is bright and
              spotless as the void, having nor form or appearance
              whatsoever.  To make use of your minds to think conceptually
              is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. Awake only
              to the One Mind, and there is nothing whatsoever to be
              attained.   </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">If you
              students of the Way do not awaken to this Mind substance, you will
              overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will seek the Buddha
              outside of yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, pious
              practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the
              way to supreme knowledge.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I agree. I was trying to emphasise Buddha's message to us from Ksitigarba Bodhisattva sutra that most sentient being cannot stay firm and steadfast in being good, in being wholesome and pure in thoughts, words and deeds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is this fact that allows us to how important wisdom and compassion is. It is this fact that despite the Buddha cannot control our mind, there is still plenty that he can do to 'influence' us to stay on the course of wholesome deeds and the path to liberation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just like how secret societies work. They are proactive, they know how to judge a lonely and restless person, they attack the very core of your desires and fears.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Buddha has boundless wisdom and compassionate. I'm sure he can do even much, much more, great things than any kind of manipulative human being to help us want to trust, accept and practise his teachings.</span></p>

The stupid monk Chunda also gained enlightenment, but he was sincere and diligent, followed Buddha's advise. Unfortunately, there are some who really cannot be tamed, at least not in that lifetime, as much as the Buddha wants. There is no conditions, the conditions isn't there yet. Everyone will eventually attain Buddhahood, but doesn't mean he will start practicing in that lifetime. You cannot force everyone to follow and practice the dharma or follow a sage's advise.</p>

              <p>As much as Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva would like to liberate all beings, if we do not cooperate with him then it will not happen. Of course, beings in hell will surely listen to Ksitigarbha, because they are in such state of suffering that there is no way he would not want to follow the path that can get him out of suffering.</p>
              <p>But when the being return to the human realm, if he forgot about his past suffering and continue to engage in evil behaviors, then he will then continue to fall back into the lower realms.</p>
              <p>Hence, other Bodhisattvas here on Earth need to guide sentient beings so that they will not fall into hell and walk the path towards liberation. If fewer people fall into hell, Ksitigarbha's vows becomes accomplished easier.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I agree. I was trying to emphasise
              Buddha's message to us from Ksitigarba Bodhisattva
              sutra that most sentient being cannot stay firm and steadfast
              in being good, in being wholesome and pure in thoughts, words and
              deeds.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">It is this fact that allows us to
              how important wisdom and compassion is. It is this fact that
              despite the Buddha cannot control our mind, there is still plenty
              that he can do to 'influence' us to stay on the course of wholesome
              deeds and the path to liberation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Just like how secret societies
              work. They are proactive, they know how to judge a lonely and
              restless person, they attack the very core of your desires and
              fears.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Buddha has boundless
              wisdom and compassionate. I'm sure he can do even much, much more,
              great things than any kind of manipulative human being to help us
              want to trust, accept and practise his teachings.</span></p>

              <p>If one give offering to buddha with wandering thoughts and expect something good in return, then isn't it the same as donating money to temple expecting oneself to become rich in return. It is mentioned in one of the previous post, this kind of "offering" though can give you some good karma, but can never compare with offering out of pure mind.</p>

                      these benefits if no one can prove their effect in their present
                      lifetimes?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If the purpose of revealing these
                      benefits is to encourage people to practise, then first of all they
                      need to be certain they are doing it right and will hence be able
                      to reap those benefits as soon as possible, so as to prevent them
                      from doubting or slandering that such benefits are not real at
                      all.</span></p>

              <p>I don't know how many times is enough, but I think it would need some period of time of sincere and consistent practice. You can proof the effects if you are sincere in your practice, and consistent. If attaining Buddhahood or remember past lives is that easy as to simply give offering once, then I think all Buddhist practitioners can remember past lives or attain enlightenment by now.</p>
              <p>BTW, you may want to check out this sutra, though it's not Ksitigarbha Sutra but it shows what happens (signs) if a practitioner chant a specific number of times (like, 200000, 300000, 600000, 800000 etc). The minimum would be 4320 for some kind of ritual where you will see the appearance of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Otherwise you need to chant a few hundred thousand times in order to clear off your karma, and so on, and there will be visions appearing to you to confirm that you have accomplished that.

              <p>I know that. I was saying it cos I realised the seriousness of the matter concerning sentient being's sinful acts and resultant sufferings in the Dharma-Ending Age.</p>
              <p>No matter how diligent I am, I will not make it in time to help sentient beings in our present dharma ending age; which I suppose is the reason why Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva took on more vows to help us despite the fact he has being doing so for incalculable aeons and that Sakayamuni Buddha entrusted the deliverance of the saha world to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva till the next Buddha finally arrives in our world.</p>

              <p>If one give offering to buddha with wandering thoughts and expect something good in return, then isn't it the same as donating money to temple expecting oneself to become rich in return. It is mentioned in one of the previous post, this kind of "offering" though can give you some good karma, but can never compare with offering out of pure mind</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>However, not many people can give without telling them that they can get some benefit in return.</p>
              <p>If all sentient beings can give with a pure mind without wandering thoughts  and expectations of good returns at the start, seriously I don't think Buddhas need to tell us if there is any benefit at all when reciting/offering anything etc. to the Bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>Only those who have a pure mind will not ask about benefits when doing any good deed in the context of the Triple Gems. Those who will ask are either Bodhisattvas asking on behalf of sentient beings or mere sentient beings like me.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure, maybe for different benefits need different level of practice? I think other factors may include sincerity, one pointedness, and so on. I only chant time to time, but never to the point of ten thousand or hundred thousand times.</p>
