            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br>So far I am not aware of any deviant people in our forum Also regarding attainments, it is fine to reveal one's attainment depending on conditions. In fact Arhats like Dharma Dan (http://www.inter activebuddha.com/ about.shtml) openly announced his attainments of Arhatship and Jhanas... Buddha also announced his attainment of Buddhahood, as well as the top disciples like Shariputra and Mogallana -- the early Arhats all have the tradition of announcing their attainments. So announcing attainment is fine as long as it is not misleading, and truly enlightened people do not boast (I've never seen anyone boasting in this forum of their attainment so that's a good sign). However, if announcing attainment can help others so that others may know who they can learn from, that's not necessarily bad. Just that in modern times, attaining enlightenment is not something people would often discuss, one of the reason is because of taboos.. however that was not the case in early Buddhism. [/b]<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Hmm I think AEN you're introducing lay people who have had some meditative experiences or realizations, with the kind motivation of hoping to point people towards the 'right direction'. In this case, I would have some reservations... and I'll explain my concerns a little more.<br><br>When you say that someone is Enlightened, we don't know what you mean by Enlightenment. You may say that there are different degrees of Enlightenment, but do you know what level of Enlightenment do these people have? Does it mean these people have become Buddhas/ Bodhisattvas (of which bhumi?)/ Pratyekabuddhas/ Arhats/ Arhat-to-be/ or practitioners with some stable meditative experiences? No matter which level of Enlightenment you are referring to, when you say you know some people are Enlightened, the first impression most people get are that these people are some sort like the Buddha, if not like the Buddha, then at least some sort like Bodhisattvas or Arhats.<br><br>The question is, how do you know?<br><br>The problem is when we ourselves are unenlightened, we can't really do the job of knowing who's enlightened and who's not. For you to be able to truly ascertain somebody's level of attainment, you need to be at least at that level, if not higher than that. Only a 10th Bhumi Bodhisattva can authenticate that another fellow being is either a 9th or 10th Bhumi Bodhisattva. The person himself/herself proclaiming that he/she has certain attainments may or may not be correct. Even when we read Dharma texts and then we try to see if this so-and-so speaks like what the Dharma text described - therefore this person must be enlightened --&gt; this doesn't work either; because Enlightenment cannot be quantified into a set of checklists.<br><br>In your example above about the announcement of attainment, remember it's Buddha who said so-and-so has become an Arahant, not any fellow practicing unenlightened being making the announcement.<br><br>When we are stil unenlightened, it is good not to quickly jumping to conclusion and telling others with utmost confidence that so-and-so is enlightened.<br><br>Because:<br>(1) You can never be sure unless you yourself have become enlightened.<br>(2) If that so-called enlightened person is not truly enlightened, you are giving other people the wrong impression &amp; understanding of what enlightenment is.<br>(3) If that so-called enlightened person still have even 0.00001% of ego, then your constant proclamation that they are already enlightened may just give them more burden of ego to unload...thus really delaying them from true accomplishment.<br><br>Even Buddha and his enlightened disciples seldom go around telling people about their attainments, for the very reason because deluded beings like us tend to grasp to such things as enlightenment, accomplishment etc.... but the Dharma path is really <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a journey without goal</strong></span>. You do not get more enlightened by hearing that someone is enlightened. You get more enlightened by hearing the Dharma, engaging in the practice and realizing the true essence of Prajnaparamita.<br><br>Even till today, it is a common advice not to talk about spiritual attainment, because our tendency is to grasp to it.<br><br>Of course to know that some people have certain attainments after embarking on the Dharma path can be very faith-inspiring. I think that's fine and it's sufficient to rejoice wholeheartedly. But we should refrain from getting overly excited about it or go around telling people so and so is enlightened, due to the above reasons I stated. It can attract obstacles to the Dharma path.<br><br>As for Dharma Dan, I have no means of verifying his proclamation that he's an Arhat. But after reading through his stuff, I see nowhere that his Dharma teacher had ever authenticated that he's an Arhat. His Dharma teacher merely told him "Don't go around telling people you're an Arhat." Which could very much imply he is either an Arhat, or he is at a stage where he could mistakenly think he's an Arhat. No matter what level of attainment he has or not, I have no idea why he didn't follow his teacher's advice. Anyway, his writings are quite good, I respect him as a better practitioner than I am, but we should not just take his deeds and actions to be an example of what an Arhat would be.<br><br>I think the Vinaya and Bodhisattva vows did mention something about the need to avoid announcing spiritual attainments, but I am not sure about that, will need to research and find out more to tell you the details.</div>

That means either Sotapanna at least, or 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva.<br><br><blockquote>Pratyekabuddhas/ Arhats/ Arhat-to-be/ or practitioners with some stable meditative experiences? No matter which level of Enlightenment you are referring to, when you say you know some people are Enlightened, the first impression most people get are that these people are some sort like the Buddha, if not like the Buddha, then at least some sort like Bodhisattvas or Arhats. </blockquote>Yes I did clarify in PM..<br><br><blockquote>The question is, how do you know?<br><br>The problem is when we ourselves are unenlightened, we can't really do the job of knowing who's enlightened and who's not.

You get more enlightened by hearing the Dharma, engaging in the practice and realizing the true essence of Prajnaparamita.</blockquote>First of all.. my understanding is not based on unfounded claims or my own judgements.. meaning there are authentications of their understandings, even from teacher of recognised lineages. You can PM me for more information.<br><br>Secondly.. I agree one shouldn't focus so much on accomplishment. However the very least we must say is this: There are people enlightened (even today and not the ancient past), there are those you can learn from, and most definitely you can get enlightened. It's not something only a chosen few can achieve. If one have at least some confidence in this, then they will really want to practise the dharma. Truly the dharma is a pathless path, but what concerns most beginners is "does this path really work?"<br><br><blockquote>Even till today, it is a common advice not to talk about spiritual attainment, because our tendency is to grasp to it.<br><br>Of course to know that some people have certain attainments after embarking on the Dharma path can be very faith-inspiring.

I also won't just tell everyone (i.e someone who doesnt like buddhism).</div>

As _wanderer_ nicely wrote regarding anger..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...(3) Know that your true nature has never ever been stained by such temporary defilements. Therefore such defilements are removable.<br><br>You have to recognize that at that moment you are angry, but you are NOT anger.<br><br>Knowing that you are NOT anger is important, because then anger is removable.<br><br>Just like when there is a stain on your window, you know that the stain is not part of your window, that is why you will clean away the stain. If you don't believe that the stain is removable, if you thought that the stain were part of the window, then you wouldn't even attempt to clean it away.<br><br>Likewise, when your anger arises, recognize the fact that you want to and you can actually remove anger is because it was never part of your true nature. Know that the stain is clean-able. The anger and all other defilements are removable. Your original nature (often referred to as Buddha Nature, or Tathagatha-garbha, or kham) is primordially pure and unstained...<br><br>...(6) Aspire that one day you will be able to enjoy defilements.<br><br>Right now we're still trying to clean the window. Therefore we have methods such as "letting go of the anger", "generating compassion" etc - these are all the practice of "cleaning the stains away". When we practice long enough, we will gradually see the "appearance of a clean window" - i.e. our minds become kinder, softer, etc...<br><br>But actually there is no such thing as the "appearance of a clean window", because the window has never been dirtied before. Remember? The stain was never part of the window. Therefore, while clearing away the stain allows the "clean" window to appear, after your cleaning, the window is not any cleaner, nor is it any less dirty.<br><br>Therefore, the stains (defilements) were never a problem at all. Our primordially pure Buddha nature had never been stained, and has never been moved. Thus the Heart Sutra says "no arising, no cessation; no increase, no decrease".<br><br>At that time, defilements are not an issue anymore....<br><br>For now, it's pretty much beyond us. So the best is just to aspire that one day we will 'realize' that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span><br><br>Though we arent enlightened, the point is that it isnt beyond us, many ordinary practitioners became enlightened too.. including some in this forum.</div></blockquote>thanks for creating this for me! so touched.<br><br>btw... i am "she" not "he"... lol.</div>
