One must transform himself, his 3 poisons, and practise the 6 paramitas and the 4 immeasurables. In this way we are cultivating true merits and true compassion.<br><br>Next after transforming one's inner mind state, which is to say eradicating all unwholesome habits and sentient thoughts through mindfulness, one must practise compassion. It is not superficial compassion or pity... My taiwanese teacher tells us often how to completely live your life for all sentient beings... as a form of Bodhicitta. My master instructed him to practise the four immeasurables, so he emphasize a lot for his practise. One who completely lives his life for others, out of compassion for other beings, he has no concern for himself. My taiwanese teacher encountered a lot of difficulties in life before... many many difficulties such as almost losing his business and entering bankruptcy, ppl trying to obstruct his dharma path, dying 4 times and undergo near death experiences but later revived (in all cases the doctors didnt think he had a chance) and being saved by Guan Yin once... he is completely unaffected. Even during his 'dying moments' he has little concern about his death... he puts all his attention in giving dharma talk to the students beside him. Imagine if you were to practise this.. the Bodhisattva way... how can any worldly and personal problems concern you? Your ego story, personal sufferings and problems become very insignificant and you are no longer attached to them.. your four immeasurables really become immeasurable like the vast sky. One with true bodhicitta: how can he have the five desires of wealth, sex, food-and-drink, fame, and sleep? His whole life is lived not for the ego but for the wellbeing and happiness of all sentient beings. This is far greater than just giving a few donations to charity every year.. it is an entire transformation.<br><br>I am no where near a Bodhisattva or the capacity of a Bodhisattva... but just my 2 cents.</div>

I'm talking about forummers who are enlightened. Like I said earlier, enlightenment is not restricted to chosen few or masters and venerables, ordinary practitioners can also get enlightened <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If there is a sincere wish to ask dharma questions, perhaps those that would probably need someone with deep insights to give advise, it's best to direct them to the right persons.

In fact Arhats like Dharma Dan (<a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/about.shtml</a>) openly announced his attainments of Arhatship and Jhanas... Buddha also announced his attainment of Buddhahood, as well as the top disciples like Shariputra and Mogallana -- the early Arhats all have the tradition of announcing their attainments. So announcing attainment is fine as long as it is not misleading, and truly enlightened people do not boast (I've never seen anyone boasting in this forum of their attainment so that's a good sign). However, if announcing attainment can help others so that others may know who they can learn from, that's not necessarily bad. Just that in modern times, attaining enlightenment is not something people would often discuss, one of the reason is because of taboos.. however that was not the case in early Buddhism.<br><br><blockquote>I will come back to my point<br><br>&lt;&gt;<br><br>Diamond Sutra </blockquote>This is relevant only for people who worships enlightened beings rather than follow their teachings, the dharma they teach. What's more important is to follow their teachings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> However to receive guidance from enlightened ones is important.<br><br><blockquote>Anyway , I see the Sleeping Lion have awaken  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></blockquote>Who?</div>

Whenever we post, we should definitely check on our intentions of posting. Is my post affected by thoughts of mental defilements like the five poisons, and the ego? We have to be very mindful not to be tricked by the ego.</div>
