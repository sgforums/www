            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I'm creating this thread for Winnie because I think it'll be better to start a thread and leave Metta Lounge for pure chatting... for his original posts see <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=196831&amp;page=17" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=196831&amp;page=17</a><br><br>He asked <blockquote>but how do we know our true nature?<br>i am blur liao... it's ok... actually i wan to learn how to be a better person first... all these teachings u mentioned is too tough for me to understand...<br>i do read books about all these and i dun understd at all... </blockquote>among other things like rebirth and karma which you can see in the previous thread...<br><br>As I wrote previously in another thread:<br><br><blockquote>What "circle" or "cycle of life and death" means in Buddhism, is that sentient beings are constantly being reborn in Samsara - the world of sufferings. They are always reborn again in the 6 realms of existence in samsara, according to their karma. Samsara is full of pain and sufferings, even in the Human Existence we have to go through Birth, Ageing, Sickness and Death, and the eight distresses. But even if you are born in a royal family, or even in the celestial/heaven realms, samsaric pleasures are still disatisfactory because of its transiency/impermanence... and by attaching to these transient pleasures thinking they are real and truly existent, permanent, we create even more sufferings. We suffer as we do not know that all compounded phenomena are empty of inherent, permanent, separate existence... and that all arises out of conditions and are always transient. Therefore the Buddha taught that suffering and disatisfactoriness is a fundamental truth in life (i.e first noble truth), however he also teaches the cause of suffering and the solution (second, third, fourth noble truth), the path leading to the liberation from these sufferings.<br><br>Ultimately, through dharma practise one will realise and experience/get in touch with one's primordial state of pure awareness, or one's Buddha Nature, which is like a clear bright mirror reflecting everything we experience in the world. This is just an analogy (and not a very good one since ultimately even the mirror is not a separate entity from its reflection, but rather it is a form of moment-to-moment 'participatory' awareness). It is also an all pervading presence of 'yourself' connected with the universe, so in this state of pure awareness there is actually no seperation between you and me or the universe, and everything is just spontaneous arising of this pure awareness, and we and all Buddhas are all one in a sense. Sentient beings cannot become liberated from samsara because they are tied down by the bondage of their ignorance and karmic propensities... due to an illusion of duality (means subject-object separation) or a false sense of self, sentient beings are constantly grasping on things and craving for samsaric pleasures and existence, thus undergoing never ending suffering. The 'self' is merely an illusion, based on identification with the 5 skhandas, which is why the Buddha taught about no self. If we were to investigate, we will not find 'self' in the 5 skhandas (five aggregates), or our sensory experiences, or even in our thoughts, and therefore it would be meaningless to grasp on this fictitious idea, which is the root of all ignorance, afflictive emotions and sufferings. Through dharma practise one can also transcend this attachment through insights and awakening. Not only are we being reborn lifetime are lifetime, we are constantly reborn moment after moment even in this very life. This is because of our illusion and attachment to our 'self' and our sentient thoughts (our identification and attachment to thoughts and things caused by ignorance), and the process of identification with a 'self' is continued without an ending until we attain insights and enlightenment. To gain these insights we have to practise the eightfold path in our lives.<br><br>So therefore in Buddhism, Buddha showed us the path leading to the complete ending of all sufferings, finding the abiding purity and bliss of Nirvana, to become liberated from the cycle of rebirth in Samsara. Buddha taught that the Buddhas of past and future all teach Buddhism as "avoid all evil, doing all good, and purifying the mind". Most religions only teach "avoid all evil and doing all good", but only Buddhism teaches about liberation and the purification of the mind. The problem with just "avoiding all evil and doing all good" is that as a result we accumulate a lot of good karma and avoid creating bad karma, meaning we can be reborn in the higher realms or even the celestial realms like the heavens, however we still cannot attain nirvana, we cannot be liberated from the cycle of samsara.. and our enjoyment in these higher realms are also limited and transient. Similarly as described just now even if our lives are very good, there is still bound to be unsatisfactoriness and sufferings.. if we cannot be liberated moment to moment. Therefore when we practise Buddhism, also we practise purification of the mind... through mindfulness we become aware of and disidentify from all our sentient thoughts, our habitual tendencies of the mind, the afflictive emotions or the three poisons of Greed, Hatred, Ignorance and so on due to identification with a false sense of self, and the identification is also known as the false 'ego'. <strong>Our Buddha Nature is like a clear mirror, our pure awareness, which unfortunately is obscured from us because of a layer of dust, or mental defilements. Through Buddhism we clean the mirror of its defilements to reveal the clear bright mirror underneath. Therefore through practising Buddhism we gain insights into the nature of reality, the nature of our minds, our Buddha Nature, and through awakening from our delusions we find the nirvanic bliss of clarity and liberation from all sufferings in our lives.</strong></blockquote>Awakening is to directly realise our primordially pure Buddha Nature... or pristine awareness. As _wanderer_ nicely wrote regarding anger..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...(3) Know that your true nature has never ever been stained by such temporary defilements. Therefore such defilements are removable.<br><br>You have to recognize that at that moment you are angry, but you are NOT anger.<br><br>Knowing that you are NOT anger is important, because then anger is removable.<br><br>Just like when there is a stain on your window, you know that the stain is not part of your window, that is why you will clean away the stain. If you don't believe that the stain is removable, if you thought that the stain were part of the window, then you wouldn't even attempt to clean it away.<br><br>Likewise, when your anger arises, recognize the fact that you want to and you can actually remove anger is because it was never part of your true nature. Know that the stain is clean-able. The anger and all other defilements are removable. Your original nature (often referred to as Buddha Nature, or Tathagatha-garbha, or kham) is primordially pure and unstained...<br><br>...(6) Aspire that one day you will be able to enjoy defilements.<br><br>Right now we're still trying to clean the window. Therefore we have methods such as "letting go of the anger", "generating compassion" etc - these are all the practice of "cleaning the stains away". When we practice long enough, we will gradually see the "appearance of a clean window" - i.e. our minds become kinder, softer, etc...<br><br>But actually there is no such thing as the "appearance of a clean window", because the window has never been dirtied before. Remember? The stain was never part of the window. Therefore, while clearing away the stain allows the "clean" window to appear, after your cleaning, the window is not any cleaner, nor is it any less dirty.<br><br>Therefore, the stains (defilements) were never a problem at all. Our primordially pure Buddha nature had never been stained, and has never been moved. Thus the Heart Sutra says "no arising, no cessation; no increase, no decrease".<br><br>At that time, defilements are not an issue anymore....<br><br>For now, it's pretty much beyond us. So the best is just to aspire that one day we will 'realize' that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span><br><br>Though we arent enlightened, the point is that it isnt beyond us, many ordinary practitioners became enlightened too.. including some in this forum.</div>

You have to say that inevitably there ARE some questions that you have to ask someone with deep insights directly. I am certainly not saying anything about qualification on sharing the dharma. Anyone can do so. But for the sake of ourselves and others, if someone wishes to ask something from someone with certain levels of direct insight, why not? Not only is it good for them, it's good for us: we may not give satisfactory answers, or we may give an answer that is wrong somewhere and create karma ourselves.<br><br>Also like I say to deny someone of knowing one with greater wisdom, that, I believe is creating even worse karma. Of course we have to see that person's intentions, but Owl's intention is good and wishes to learn the dharma, so if I deny him that chance to learn from someone of greater wisdom (I have spoken to him privately and he told me he really wants to be liberated <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and says he will ask some dharma questions to one of them), I believe that is creating bad karma for me. In fact there was indeed a true story of a monk of higher rank within his Sangha, who stopped the novice monks from asking questions from their enlightened venerable.. because he thinks he can answer them all. Because of this, he created a very very bad karma and couldnt meet the Buddhadharma for a very very long time. I can't remember the whole story, but it's something like this.<br><br>Time for me to go.... cya guys later <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

This is definitely not happening as all forummers are happily discussing dharma with each other on the equal level. Also just because lets say, someone wish to talk to someone who is enlightened, that certainly doesn't mean I am looking down on someone else. The ego likes to make such assumption, complicate things and become attached to it.<br><br><blockquote>I dun see the need to differentiate who is enlightened here in the forum and who's not ,becos that will bring about schism in the whole Buddhist community</blockquote>I truly do not think that being truthful about these matters leads any way to schism. A monastic Sangha has many venerables, lamas/rinpoches and shi fus as well as many monks following that sangha. Does differentiating a monk and a venerable/lama/rinpoche in any way make it a schism? Similarly does pointing out who is enlightened in any way make schism in the forum? This simply does not make sense. In fact all the sanghas and monks will usually help to answer your question regarding Buddhism, but if it is related to teachings that requires deep insight, they will most certainly refer to the venerables.<br><br>Similarly in an online community, I see nothing wrong at all refering people to other forummers who are enlightened. Why does the mind need to complicate such issues? The purpose of this forum is created so that everyone can receive the benefits from dharma discussions. There are certainly some level that non-enlightened forummers like us can help and share and discuss based on our knowledge and experience, but there are also certain things we must admit that we can't help, and refer to someone else who have the necessary insights. Dharma teachings and advises given by someone liberated and enlightened is definitely different from someone just spewing out from knowledge and limited experiences... and worse of all if we try to answer something with something irrelevant to the conditions of that person or somehow something missing or wrongly stated... then we are creating even worse karma ourselves. So like I said just now:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Also like I say to deny someone of knowing one with greater wisdom, that, I believe is creating even worse karma. Of course we have to see that person's intentions, but Owl's intention is good and wishes to learn the dharma, so if I deny him that chance to learn from someone of greater wisdom (I have spoken to him privately and he told me he really wants to be liberated Smile and says he will ask some dharma questions to one of them), I believe that is creating bad karma for me.

Because of this, he created a very very bad karma and couldnt meet the Buddhadharma for a very very long time. I can't remember the whole story, but it's something like this.</span><br><br>If you enter a monastery with the sincere wish to learn the deep insights and wisdom of someone liberated and wish to speak to the venerable abbot, but instead the monk tell you "no, everyone is treated equally here, you cannot meet the abbot just because he's enlightened, you have to ask your question to the the five hundred monks in our sangha first" what would you feel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>I dun think I will not Support Ren Ci Hospital just becos I feel Ven Mingyi is not in any way enlightened .That is a mistake and is basically an act of selfishness<br>and nothing to do with whether he is enlightened</blockquote>As I wrote in previous thread: <span style="font-style: italic;">Secondly of course I will support Ven Shi Ming Yi... even if he's Pastor Shi Ming Yi or Priest Shi Ming Yi from other religions, I'll still support. Charity is universal.</span><br><br>Secondly I think we shouldn't make assumption that Ven Shi Ming Yi is not enlightened <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway this is off-topic because the case of charity is different from the case of teaching Buddhism. Otherwise why is pure lineages and enlightened masters (ming2 shi1) important?<br><br><blockquote>Buddha takes no form .Any form of experience which you can alleviate your<br>entangled emotions towards enlighten is of TANTAMOUNT IMPORTANCE<br>and not whether he/she is enlighten </blockquote>Enlightenment and direct insight is perhaps much more important than you think and therefore the point of talking to these people is to learn the dharma from them, so that one can advance more quickly on the path.. Without these direct insights, we cannot break our fundamental illusion of duality. Though foundational practises like cultivating virtues and getting beyond our emotions and so on are important, that may not necessarily mean having attained the essential insights into the nature of reality.. or Jian4 Xing4. As Thusness said, practise before and after realisation is different. One can have many experiences of dealing with emotions, which are important, but did not comprehend the 3 dharma seals, Emptiness, etc. These people live a more carefree life but that is different from transcending birth and death/attaining nirvana.<br><br><blockquote>May I wish to tell the Forum owner to refrain from saying who are the enlighten ones , cause will create disharmony among the Sangha community in Wisdom Bliss</blockquote>As far as I know apart from you raising this concern, there is no 'disharmony' or any problems happening related to this issue.<br><br><blockquote>We are Dharma Brothers and Sister on the Path ,not Magicians community who<br>is comparing magic ability and talents<br><br>I know people in the forum do not like me to say this ,but its inside the basics of a Buddhist Precept of Refrain from telling lies and<br><br>the Basic definition of Sangha </blockquote>As far as I know, there is no one comparing supernatural powers and talents here.</div>
