            <div class='col-md body'>In our world today, there are <strong>at least four different types of Buddhism</strong>.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The first type is the authentic Buddhism</span>, the education of understanding the true face of life and the universe originally intended by Shakyamuni Buddha. Unfortunately, the authentic Buddha's education is rare nowadays, and difficult to encounter.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The second type of Buddhism is the religious Buddhism</span>. Originally, Buddhism was not a religion, but now it has become one. We can no longer deny that there is a 'Buddhist religion' because everywhere we look, Buddhism is displayed as a religion. Unlike the monasteries in the past which held eight-hour classes per day and provided another eight hours for self-cultivation, today's Buddhist 'temples' no longer uphold such a perseverance of the Buddha's Teachings. Today we mainly see people offering to the Buddha statues and praying for blessings and fortune. In this way, Buddhism has been wrongly changed into a religion. (However time has changed many have buck up and start to spread dharma)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>The third type of Buddhism is the <span style="color: darkred;">philosophical study of the Buddha's teachings.</span> Many universities today open courses on the study of Buddhist Sutras, considering the teachings as a philosophy. The content of the Buddha's education is actually a complete university of knowledge and wisdom. Philosophy is only one of its courses. Just as it is wrong to recognize an university as a single course, it is also inappropriate to think of and limit the Buddha's education as only a philosophy. The Buddha's education can help us resolve our problems - from family difficulties to the great issue of life and death. <span style="color: darkred;">The Buddha's teachings are deep and vast, and teach us the truths of life and the universe. It should not be mistaken as only a philosophy.  </span><br><br>The fourth type of Buddhism we see in our world today is the <strong>deviant and externalist Buddhism.</strong> This is an <strong>extremely unfortunate affair which only came to be in the past 30-40 years. </strong>We must know that the religious <strong>Buddhism persuades people to be decent, and the philosophical Buddhism pursues truth, neither cause much harm to the society</strong>. <span style="color: red;"><span class="large">If Buddhism is changed into a deviant and externalist path, using the weakness of the human nature to cheat and harm living beings; disturbing the peace and safety of the society, then this conversion of Buddhism has gone too far.</span> </span>The speech and actions of these deviant and externalist paths can be very attractive and enticing. One should be very careful as not to be mislead by these deviant ways, or regretting it would be too late.<br><br>These four types of Buddhism exist in our society today, <strong>we should recognize them as they are and think carefully as to which way is most beneficial to us, and the one we will ultimately follow. </strong><br><br>Latest development of Buddhism ...<br><br>Buddhism is gaining wide appeal across the globe. The large international membership of the World Buddhist Sangha Council is clear evidence. There are a growing number of internet sites that offer information about Buddhism. Many companies produce music, videos, and multi-media educational material on Buddhism. Buddhism has even influenced pop culture and permeated into the psyche of the masses. In Singapore too, Buddhism has not only retained its relevance, but is gaining popularly. Between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of Singaporeans above 15 years old who are Buddhists increased from 31% to 43%, the largest increase amongst all major religions. Dharma talks in Singapore are now also conducted in English, to reach out to young Singaporeans, including professionals. Devotees today do not just visit the temples to pray. They are eager to delve deeper into the Buddhist scriptures and reflect upon their philosophical and spiritual significance<br><br><a href="http://www.4ui.com/eart/165eart2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.4ui.com/eart/165eart2.htm</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In India, during Buddha time the followers of many orthodox religious groups tried to condemn the Buddha because of his liberal teachings which revolutionised the Indian society. Many regarded him as an enemy when increasing numbers of intellectuals as well as people from all ranks of society took up the religion. When they failed in their attempt to destroy him, they adopted the reverse strategy of introducing him as a reincarnation of one of their gods. This way they could absorb Buddhism into their religion.<br><br><strong>Even today </strong>there are certain religionists who try to absorb the Buddha into their beliefs as a way of gaining converts among Buddhists. Their basis for doing so is by claiming that the Buddha himself had predicted that another Buddha would appear in this world, and that the latest Buddha will become even more popular. These groups of people advised Buddhists to give up their old Buddha and follow the so-called new Buddha. While it is good to see them giving the Buddha the same status as their own religious teachers, we feel that these attempts to absorb Buddhists into another faith by misrepresenting the truth are in extreme bad taste.<br><br><strong>Those who claim that the new Buddha had already arrived are obviously misrepresenting what the Buddha had said</strong>. Although the Buddha predicted the coming of the next Buddha, he mentioned some conditions which had to be met before this can be possible. It is the nature of Buddhahood that the next Buddha will not appear as long as the dispensation of the current Buddha still exists.<br><br></div>

Everyone should decide for themselves. For me, my Buddhist teachers and I are against such practises - that is the furthest I can comment, but I do not think we have the right to criticise others if they do not promote those practises under the name of Buddhism or in this Buddhist forum.<br><br>Similarly, if you do not agree with Religion X (for example), you have the right to disagree and not practise it but you should not go overboard, we must have tolerance. We have freedom of religion and spirituality.<br><br>And even if you hate MLM, not everyone hates MLM. So what if you hate MLM? Anyway MLM is NOT a religion or a spiritual practise and therefore not protected under Religious Laws in Singapore - you can bash all you want without getting into trouble with the Law. When we come to things like Religion or Spirituality, it is very sensitive, we have to show restrains in our speech. Furthermore, this is not MLM forum. If you argue about MLM here, it will be considered off-topic and the topic will be closed.</div>

Therefore it is inappropriate to comment it here - in a Buddhist forum. And whether it is scam job, I would say no, there are such practises.<br><br>And whether what others teaches is right or wrong, you can only agree or disagree, but you cannot criticise them. If you think 'Religion X' is teaching the wrong things, so be it, but do not go overboard because this is Singapore.</div>

For example, you do not believe in Christianity, will you say that Jesus is a con man? I do not think you have the right to make such comments on others and their practises.<br><br>I will never say that anyone is a con man. If he is really a con man, then he would already have been punished under law.<br><br>But what you are saying here, could land yourself in trouble under law.</div>
