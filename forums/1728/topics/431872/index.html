              <p>There is a very vast misconception that there are people with great capacity and thus great potential for awakening, and some with small capacity and little potential for awakening. This is half right, half wrong.</p>
              <p>Worse still, some people imagine that enlightened practitioners are all 'special emanations of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas coming to the saha world to save sentient beings' as if those practitioners are somehow more 'special' than us, that they are some sort of gods or deities descending from the sky to 'save us'.

              <p>Buddhism is not easy for our intellectual minds to understand.</p>
              <p>When I first look into buddhism. I was thinking how come buddha is not affected by pretty girls. I never seen a guy that can do this.</p>
              <p>There was a story abt buddha cutting flesh to give to eagle or something, I also think got people so noble meh.</p>
              <p>Buddhism can be a hard pill to swallow.</p>
              <p>I also discusses with my secondary school friends, all of them say they are pretending to be é�’é«˜ã€‚</p>

              <p>Indeed...</p>
              <p>Like what Loppon Namdrol said here about Dzogchen practice, however it can be applied to other forms of Buddhism, especially the third paragraph:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><br>Dzogchen is not rocket science. It is very easy to understand if
                       you have an open mind and you do not go around complicating things. <br><br>Sometimes,
                       the biggest obstacle to understanding Dzogchen that people have is 
                      Buddhism, so they constantly try to compare Dzogchen with the vehicles 
                      of cause and result. This causes them to automatically deviate. Dzogchen
                       is completely beyond cause and result. All notions of paths and stages 
                      are completely irrelevant in Dzogchen. <br><br>There are mainly one 
                      thing that matters in Dzogchen -- whether or not you are a fortunate 
                      person. If you are a fortunate person you will meet a master who has 
                      experience who can demonstrate to you your real condition and the 
                      methods to discover that for yourself. You do not have to be an educated
                       person like me who has studied way too many books. There is a saying in
                       Dzogchen, an illterate person who has personal experience of their real
                       state will gain liberation far sooner than a Pandita who is expert in a
                       hundred dharma systems but does not have that experience. Dzogchen is 
                      not intellectual. It is based on personal experience. You do not have to
                       be literate, or particularly well educated to have that experience. Our
                       friend adinatha will tell you that realization of Dzogchen based on the
                       blessings of the lineage. But actually, it is based on recognizing a 
                      personal experience. Maybe we mean the same thing. Certainly having that
                       recognition is wonderful thing, inexpressible, a cause for faith and a 
                      great blessing. But collecting blessings and reciting supplications will
                       never get you that experience. Only an experienced master who has that 
                      experience will able to introduce it to you in a direct personal way. 
                      That is the best blessing.  <br><br>N</p>
