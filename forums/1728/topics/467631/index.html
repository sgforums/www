              </p><p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><span style="line-height: 24.44444465637207px;">To obtain real peace and happiness</span><br> by Kyabje Chadral Rinpoche</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; line-height: 1.231;">The unimaginable benefits of such noble deeds are described in different Sutras 
                and Tantras taught by Lord Buddha. The practice of such acts have been recommended 
                by all the Siddhas, both Indian and Tibetan Buddhist pandits in various scriptures. 
                Compassion, being one of the main tenets of the Mahayana, also forms the foundation 
                of the Hinayana sect which sets great store by abstaining from killing, or even 
                harming any living being. The Tantrayana, on the other hand, has one additional 
                facet; it lays great emphasis on maintaining a moral relationship, Samaya, between 
                the saviour and the saved. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"> <br> Behind all these teachings, there is one single fact of cardinal importance: 
                that on this earth, a human being can commit no greater sin than taking the 
                life of another living being. By implication, there is no bigger source of accumulating 
                merit than saving life. <br> To obtain real peace and happiness in this world, one has simply to follow the 
                path of Ahimsa (non violence), which naturally is common to all the religions 
                of the world. If we do not like to experience any pain or suffering of any kind, 
                how can we expect any other creature, whether big or small, to feel otherwise? 
                <br> There is no better prayer or worship we can offer to the Lord Buddha than by 
                being thoughtful, kind, compassionate and abstaining from taking the life of 
                any fellow human being, animal, bird, fish, or insect. Trying to save any life 
                from imminent danger, or trying to mitigate their pain and suffering, is one 
                more step further in the active practice of loving other living beings. <br> The next logical step, in this regard, is saying prayers for those who die owing 
                to some other persons' thoughtless cruelty. Following this path automatically 
                puts an end to conflicts, or obstacles, if any, within our inner self, generates 
                spontaneous happiness, and bestows absolute inner peace. If your deeds flow 
                from a genuine purity of the heart and are imbued with selflessness, they will 
                enable you to attain enlightenment in the long run. <br> Conscious abstension from hunting and killing living beings, besides inspiring 
                others to do the same, are actions behoving the kind-hearted and pious. For 
                instance, the milk of human kindness requires us not to harm migratory birds 
                in any way, such as casting stones or nets or shooting them while they are resting 
                for brief moments in the course of their long journey from one country or continent 
                to another. On the contrary, we should provide help to them in all possible 
                ways before they reach their final destination. <br> A renowned Buddhist scholar from Bengal, Pandit Atisha Dipankara, said that 
                giving compassionate love to the helpless and the poor is as important as meditating 
                on Shunyata, i.e. Emptiness. This virtue of compassion is the principal foundation 
                stone of the Mahayana Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Hence, I passionately appeal to humanity at large, 
                irrespective of nationality, caste, or religion to practice this most simple 
                but profound virtue of compassionate love. We can praise and please our Lord 
                Buddha in no better way than by doing all we can to save the lives of innocent, 
                mute and defenceless animals and birds, fish and insects and thereby grant them 
                the precious gift of life. <br> Moral values abjure us from taking anything which we can not give to others. 
                We can not give life to anybody; it is the sole discretion of the Lord. So it 
                will be shameless arrogance and heinous sinfulness on our part if we snatch 
                life from others. <br> It is my firm belief that if people adopt this practice by universal consensus, 
                everlasting peace and all round happiness will descend on this earth, and human 
                suffering in all its forms will become a thing of the past. All of us will become 
                privileged enjoyers of peace, prosperity, good health and increased longevity. 
                In such an ideal situation, human beings will experience peace of mind and contentment 
                of heart even at death. Bereft of any disturbing thoughts or hallucinations 
                but aware of the essence of Dharma, he or she will leave for their heavenly 
                abode in perfect serenity and, in due course, will be born in higher spheres. 
                Continuous practice of this noble path will ultimately lead to the attainment 
                of Nirvana, i.e. Buddhahood. <br> May one and all follow this most meritorious path and benefit all living beings 
                besides accumulating meritorious riches for themselves in the process. </span></p>
