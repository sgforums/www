Its when southern France was independent and France consisted of only the Northen parts. The French marched south and massacred everyone by the tens of thousands.

            <div class='col-md body'>You are probably wondering what is the aggression caused by Christians in India. You may wonder how can a minority religion that is only 3% of the population cause aggression in a nation of over 1,000,000,000 people. In the press, the aggresion and "persecution" of Christians is often publicized. However it is never publicized how Christian Fundamentalists often incite this cycle of violence and aggression.<br><br>The root cause of Christian aggression in India is caused by the fact that Christianity believes that Jesus Christ is the only son of god. He is supposed to have been sent to earth to wash away the sins of the people, and so redeem them. Of course, this happens only to those who accept him as the only son of god. All the others do not get the benefit who do not have this shared belief will be burnt in hell for all eternity.<br><br>Christianity says that it has a unique path to salvation, and all the other paths are false. While there is supposed to be some modification in these views, the acceptance is that all the other paths may at most be second best. Therefore, it is better if people accept Christianity and not take a chance.<br><br>Christians believe that they have been commanded by Christ to go and Â“saveÂ” (convert) the people of this world. This is also supposed to give them special merit when it comes to the day of final judgment.<br><br>While there are many Christians who today do not believe in this exclusivity, there are a still large number of misguided Christians who still believe that in the exclusivity of Christianity and the concept of saving souls.<br><br>It is this misguided belief that causes breeds a hatred and intolerance for other religions. and from this hatred, these Christian Fundamentalists begin their aggression to convert. And often they will go to any means to convert even if it means violence.<br><br>This website seeks to educate the world about the atrocities that conversions bring and to bring this aggressive nature of Christianity to an end.<br><br>http://www.christianaggression.org/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Millions of African-Americans are Christians today because their ancestors were converted against their will to the religion of the slave-master.<br><br>Hundred of thousands of American-Indians are Christians today because the Christian missionaries converted their ancestors against their will.<br><br>In Europe, it was the same thing. When Rome controlled most of the world, the Roman Emperor, Constantine, in 325 CE forced Christianity onto his subjects.<br><br>The people of Lithuania did not become Christians because they read the Gospels and decided to accept their teachings. On the contrary, the people of Lithuania were forced into Christianity against their will, as a result of relentless military force.<br><br>From The Crusades, by Bernard Hamilton 1:<br><br>Â“In 1309 the Teutonic Order moved its headquarters to Marienburg in Prussia. It had a papal license to wage perpetual war against the pagans and used this to launch annual crusades against Lithuania. These expeditions were very popular the nobility of northern Europe: campaigns were held twice a year, in the summer and in the winter when the order laid on special Christmas festivities for visiting crusaders.Â”<br><br>Â“The excuse for men who enjoyed fighting and to lay waste large parts of Lithuania in the name of Christ was removed in 1386 when the King of Lithuania, Ladislas Jagiello, married Queen Jadwiga of Poland and received Catholic baptism. The two kingdoms were united under Christian rulers and the Teutonic Knights no longer had any justification for crusading against pagans there.Â”<br><br>Lithuania was not the first country that fell victim to a campaign of lethal military force, for the purpose of forced conversion to Christianity. Three entire European nationalities became victims of genocide because they refused to become Christians:<br><br>Â“...the Vandals, Ostogoths, and Heruli. The last three were destroyed by the Pope of Rome because they refused to become Â‘Christian.Â’ The armies of Emperor Justinian, in cooperation with the Pope, thrust the Ostrogoths out of the city of Rome. They have become extinct.Â”2<br><br>Jews had to endure the sword too. Millions of Jews from the fourth century CE until the 20th Century were forced to Â“kiss the swordÂ” of Christ, or be put to death by that sword. So very many Jews have died at the hands of Christians in the name of Jesus. However, many Jews managed to survive. They survived by lying they converted, but secretly remained Jews. The Christian Church finally realized what was happening and in 1492, the Spanish Inquisition tried to purge the country of these Â“SecretÂ” Jews, called Marranos.<br><br>Christianity cannot take any pride for their large numbers of subjects. Almost all Christian ancestors, Catholics and Protestants really had no choice in the matter. They were forced to accept Jesus as their Lord. Christianity was a forced religion. Today it is being forced in another manner, through an army of missionaries beating on your door.<br><br>Jews today know that their forefathers heard God speak to them at Mount Sinai, commanding them to follow His Laws. Christians today cannot make this claim. Perhaps this is the major reason for the anti-Semitism in Christianity, the hatred and jealousy of Jews throughout history.<br><br>http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=ARTICLES&amp;id=1137165211</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>exactly. Christians and Christianity caused more people to die than any other religion. And im not talking about those who gave their lifes up for Christianity. I'm talking about those who were killed because they didn't agree with Christianity. Sometimes, worse. They were Christian in principle but were killed anyway because they were not following Rome's idea of what Christianity should be. Or else, corrupt popes and bishops used the catholic religion as an excuse to wage war and gain land, gold and power for their own greedy gains. Need I name the French crusade against the Pays d'Oc Cathar "heretics"? What about hmmm.... Pope Leo X? Let me whisper loudly: "Medici family of Florence!" Opps! another embaressing name?

Christians and Christianity caused more people to die than any other religion. And im not talking about those who gave their lifes up for Christianity. I'm talking about those who were killed because they didn't agree with Christianity. Sometimes, worse. They were Christian in principle but were killed anyway because they were not following Rome's idea of what Christianity should be. Or else, corrupt popes and bishops used the catholic religion as an excuse to wage war and gain land, gold and power for their own greedy gains. Need I name the French crusade against the Pays d'Oc Cathar "heretics"? What about hmmm.... Pope Leo X? Let me whisper loudly: "Medici family of Florence!" Opps! another embaressing name? How about... Salem....?<br><br>I don't think I need to say more.</div></blockquote>The New York Times edition of November 14, 2005 highlighted the global nature of the "Missionary Business" or in other words, evangelical missionaries who run businesses to fund conversion activities around the world.<br><br>Andy Newman, in this NYT article called "Their Mission: Spreading the Word Through Business", has painted a glowing picture of these "preying vultures". Yet we quote "faithfully" from the article:<br><br>'Tom Sudyk is not most people's idea of a missionary. On paper, he looks like a modern global capitalist, which he is. Mr. Sudyk, an entrepreneur from Michigan, runs, among other things, an outsourcing company in Chennai, India, providing medical transcribers and software engineers to American businesses. In six years, the Indian company -- a subsidiary of EC Group International, a larger outsourcing company that Mr. Sudyk founded in Grand Rapids -- has grown to 75 employees and is moving into a building triple its present size.<br><br>But the Gospel, Mr. Sudyk says, illuminates every aspect of his business, from its ethics to its help to local ministries to the technical support it lends a Christian-run vocational school for polio victims in Chennai. Each afternoon at the Chennai office, there is a 10-minute prayer, and while the prayer is interdenominational, employees who ask to learn more about Jesus Christ -- as many have -- are gladly accommodated.'<br><br>While portraying their tactics in a positive light, the NYT article continues:<br><br>'Christian-run companies are multiplying in just about every corner of the globe, reshaping overseas mission work. These businesses form a movement known variously as business as mission, kingdom business and great commission companies, after the biblical charge to "make disciples of all the nations."<br><br>In Romania, for example, a Californian who runs a Tex-Mex restaurant and catering hall said that he expected to clear $250,000 in profit this year, most of which will be donated to local ministries. And in a Muslim country with a history of hostility to Christianity, a medical-supply<br>importer from the Midwest leverages the trust she earns through her business dealings to quietly spread the word.<br><br>Full Article here: http://www.christianaggression.org/item_display.php?type=ARTICLES&amp;id=1133940251<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
