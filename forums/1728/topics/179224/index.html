And yes, if you disagree with my points, I will not defend further.</span></span><br><br>Brey, as a moderator, we need to wear two hats. One as a member of the forum, another a moderator of the forum. It has to be distinct. I agree that our faith must be defended unabashedly.

A sceintist also said "With or without religion you will have good men doing good things and evil men doing evil things. For good men to do evil things, that takes religion." [nb: Not exact quote, but something like that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> )<br><br>However to be fair, there are some pretty decent Christians out there. It is only unfortunate that the more evangelical ones are much more vocal than the 'decent' ones.<br><br>Murdering their fellow Christians? That is news to me. To the best of my knowledge, that kind of thing only happened during medieval times but not in recent times. My personal opinion is that Christians can somewhat be a grave  discomfort in the posterior, but I don't think they are the murderous type (in recent times that is). BTW, who is Cathars?</div>
