Is resistance-obsession to be abandoned with regard to all painful feeling? Is ignorance-obsession to be abandoned with regard to all neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling?"<br><br>"No... There is the case where a monk Â— quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful qualities Â— enters &amp; remains in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. With that he abandons passion. No passion-obsession gets obsessed there.4 There is the case where a monk considers, 'O when will I enter &amp; remain in the dimension that those who are noble now enter &amp; remain in?' And as he thus nurses this yearning for the unexcelled liberations, there arises within him sorrow based on that yearning. With that he abandons resistance. No resistance-obsession gets obsessed there.5 There is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain Â— as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress Â— enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.

            <div class='col-md body'>"You've gone too far, friend Visakha. You can't keep holding on up to the limit of questions. For the holy life gains a footing in Unbinding, culminates in Unbinding, has Unbinding as its final end. If you wish, go to the Blessed One and ask him the meaning of these things. Whatever he says, that's how you should remember it."<br><br>Then Visakha the lay follower, delighting &amp; rejoicing in what Dhammadinna the nun had said, bowed down to her and, keeping her to his right, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he told the Blessed One the full extent of the conversation he had had with Dhammadinna the nun. When this was said, the Blessed One said to him, "Dhammadinna the nun is wise, Visakha, a woman of great discernment. If you had asked me those things, I would have answered you in the same way she did. That is the meaning of those things. That is how you should remember it."<br><br>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Visakha the lay follower delighted in the Blessed One's words.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Notes<br><br>1. Verbal fabrication grows still on attaining the second jhana; bodily fabrication grows still on attaining the fourth jhana; mental fabrication grows still on attaining the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.<br><br>2. Emptiness, the signless, &amp; the undirected are names for a state of concentration that lies on the threshold of Unbinding. They differ only in how they are approached. According to the commentary, they color one's first apprehension of Unbinding: a meditator who has been focusing on the theme of inconstancy will first apprehend Unbinding as signless; one who has been focusing on the theme of stress will first apprehend it as undirected; one who has been focusing on the theme of not-self will first apprehend it as emptiness.<br><br>3. According to the commentary, "seclusion" here stands for Unbinding. On emerging from the cessation of perception &amp; feeling, and having had contact with emptiness/the signless/the undirected, the mind inclines naturally to a direct experience of Unbinding.<br><br>4. In other words, once the pleasure of the first jhana has been used as a basis for giving rise to the discernment that leads to arahantship, the mind has no further passion-obsession with pleasant feeling. (The commentary says that this is true at attainment of non-returning, but this must be a mistake, as non-returners are still subject to passion for form and formless phenomena.)<br><br>5. Once this sorrow has been used as a basis for giving rise to the discernment that leads to non-returning, the mind has no further resistance-obsession with painful feeling.<br><br>6. Once this feeling of neither pleasure nor pain has been used as a basis for giving rise to the discernment that leads to arahantship, the mind has no further ignorance-obsession with feelings of neither pleasure nor pain.<br><br>7. This reading follows the Thai edition of the Pali canon. The PTS edition of the Pali canon gives the first two questions and answers in this exchange as follows:<br><br>"Now what, lady, lies on the other side of pleasant feeling?"<br>"Painful feeling lies on the other side of pleasant feeling."<br>"And what lies on the other side of painful feeling?"<br>"Pleasant feeling lies on the other side of painful feeling."<br><br>For some reason, the editors of neither edition seem to have been aware of the reading in the other edition.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Bohiruci,<br><br>I am not familiar with the Culavedalla Sutta so I will just share what is in my mind after reading it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>First, I think it is unlikely that Visakha, who has attained the stage of Anagami, is confused with what Buddha meant by the term "self".  I will take it that Visakha is seeking for the deepest level of understanding on the doctrine of Â‘no-selfÂ’ from sravaka viewpoint  --  progressing from a third stage of holiness to the final stage of Arahatship that Dhammadinna has attained.<br><br>If we were to ask what is Â‘selfÂ’? A series of questions may follow like the case of Visakha. This form of enquiries will continue without end like a never ending samsaric cycle. It is analogous to rebirth where the previous question serves as the cause and the answer serves as condition for the next question to arise.  We witness old mental tendencies in action, replacing one fragment of thought with another fragment where every fragment is unsatisfactory during the process of enquiry.  How is it that we can't even know who we really are?  What exactly is lacking?  If we were to replace the question to Â“without using any languages, any symbols to represent Â‘IÂ’, how is Â‘IÂ’ experienced?Â”  To answer such a question, the old chain-cycle habit of answering must come to a halt.  To answer,  the mind cannot continue its chats. The mind must be silent, raw, undefined, direct and attentive Â– it must be mindful.  A question arises, the answer isnÂ’t made up of words but rather a raw direct naked experience of what it is, i.e., using mindfulness as the way of knowing.<br><br>The entire teaching of Buddha is very much alive.  When Buddha taught us Â‘impermanenceÂ’ and Â‘interdependenceÂ’, he does not only teach us the analytical and logical mode of knowing the seals but also the direct mode of knowing -- being participative and experiential in all moments.  He taught us the four foundation of mindfulness that brings about clear knowing that eventually leads to nirvana.  It is amazing to realise the immense clarity that arises in mindfulness, knowing that arises not out measurement and comparision.  Apply mindfulness as the mode of knowing in all that can be experienced Â– body, feeling, perception, mental formation and consciousness.  Leave nothing out.  It is through this sort of concentrated mindfulness of phenomena that can give rise to the flow of clear knowingness that comes only with the absence of words, labels and perceptions.  This signless clear knowingness is release, it is bliss, it is what that leads to the other side of unbinding:<br><br>"What lies on the other side of ignorance?"<br><br>"Clear knowing lies on the other side of ignorance."<br><br>"What lies on the other side of clear knowing?"<br><br>"Release lies on the other side of clear knowing."<br><br>"What lies on the other side of release?"<br><br>"Unbinding lies on the other side of release."<br><br>"What lies on the other side of Unbinding?"<br><br>-- Cula-vedalla Sutta<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Bohiruci,<br><br>I am not familiar with the Culavedalla Sutta so I will just share what is in my mind after reading it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>First, I think it is unlikely that Visakha, who has attained the stage of Anagami, is confused with what Buddha meant by the term "self".  I will take it that Visakha is seeking for the deepest level of understanding on the doctrine of Â‘no-selfÂ’ from sravaka viewpoint  --  progressing from a third stage of holiness to the final stage of Arahatship that Dhammadinna has attained.<br><br>If we were to ask what is Â‘selfÂ’? A series of questions may follow like the case of Visakha. This form of enquiries will continue without end like a never ending samsaric cycle. It is analogous to rebirth where the previous question serves as the cause and the answer serves as condition for the next question to arise.  We witness old mental tendencies in action, replacing one fragment of thought with another fragment where every fragment is unsatisfactory during the process of enquiry.  How is it that we can't even know who we really are?  What exactly is lacking?  If we were to replace the question to Â“without using any languages, any symbols to represent Â‘IÂ’, how is Â‘IÂ’ experienced?Â”  To answer such a question, the old chain-cycle habit of answering must come to a halt.  To answer,  the mind cannot continue its chats. The mind must be silent, raw, undefined, direct and attentive Â– it must be mindful.  A question arises, the answer isnÂ’t made up of words but rather a raw direct naked experience of what it is, i.e., using mindfulness as the way of knowing.<br><br>The entire teaching of Buddha is very much alive.  When Buddha taught us Â‘impermanenceÂ’ and Â‘interdependenceÂ’, he does not only teach us the analytical and logical mode of knowing the seals but also the direct mode of knowing -- being participative and experiential in all moments.  He taught us the four foundation of mindfulness that brings about clear knowing that eventually leads to nirvana.  It is amazing to realise the immense clarity that arises in mindfulness, knowing that arises not out measurement and comparision.

The Commentary informs us that the Buddha teaches the devata in terms of the paradox in order to subdue her pride. To give this paradox some context, you might want to read other passages from the Canon that discuss right effort.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then a certain devata, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, she stood to one side. As she was standing there, she said to him, "Tell me, dear sir, how you crossed over the flood."<br><br>"I crossed over the flood without pushing forward, without staying in place."1<br><br>"But how, dear sir, did you cross over the flood without pushing forward, without staying in place?"<br><br>"When I pushed forward, I was whirled about. When I stayed in place, I sank. And so I crossed over the flood without pushing forward, without staying in place."<br><br>[The devata:]<br><br>At long last I see<br>a brahman, totally unbound,<br>who     without pushing forward,<br>without staying in place,<br>has crossed     over<br>the entanglements<br>of the world.<br>That is what the devata said. The Teacher approved. Realizing that "The Teacher has approved of me," she bowed down to him, circumambulated him Â— keeping him to her right Â— and then vanished right there.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Note<br><br>1.
