              <p>Just attended an event with them on Saturday along with Thusness, and Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche was there also (he is the interim leader and caretaker of this project). Must say that this is a very important and impressive effort and this a major project that is going to span 100 years, this is only just beginning... we should show our support for this as this ensures the survival of a large portion of the Buddha's teachings/Dharma.</p>

                                          Buddhist sacred literature translated into modern languages and made 
                                          universally accessible"<br> <br> <a href="http://www.buddhistliteraryheritage.org/">www.buddhistliteraryheritage.org</a><br> <strong><br> What is the Buddhist Literary Heritage Project (BLHP)?<br> </strong><br> The Buddhist Literary Heritage Project (BLHP) is a long-term global 
                                          initiative with the goal of seeing the riches of Buddhist sacred 
                                          literature translated into modern languages and made universally 
                                          accessible.<br> <strong><br> Why is BLHP necessary?</strong><br> <br> A vast portion of the Buddha's teachings is locked away in the classical
                                           Tibetan language. Translating these texts requires proficiency in 
                                          classical Tibetan and Sanskrit, as well as an advanced understanding of 
                                          the Buddha's teachings. To date, <strong>less than 5%</strong> of the classical 
                                          Tibetan texts have been translated. Yet very few people alive today 
                                          still hold the deep traditional learning necessary to interpret these 
                                          texts accurately. Before the meaning becomes irretrievable, there is an 
                                          urgent need to amass and coordinate the talents of translators, 
                                          teachers, scholars, and wisdom-seekers to uncover the meaning of these 
                                          texts and make them universally available.</p>

                                          civilization.<br> <br> - Buddhist practitioners. The words of the Buddha, and the treatises 
                                          that clarify their meaning, are the source of the Buddhist doctrine. 
                                          Today's teachers and students must have a reliable and authentic 
                                          reference to support the transmission of the teachings of the Buddha.</p>

              <p><strong>Returning to the Source: Report on 
              Translating the Words of the Buddha Conference</strong><br> <br> For five days in March, several lamas and many of the world’s leading 
              Tibetan Buddhist translators came together at the splendid Deer Park 
              Institute in the Himalayan foothills of Northern India for Translating 
              the Words of the Buddha, an impeccably organized conference that was 
              several years in the planning. The aim was to discuss the current state 
              and future direction of Tibetan Buddhist translation, but as we arrived 
              few of us had any idea what to expect.<br> <br> From the very beginning however, it was clear that this would be an 
              extraordinary event. For one thing, there was our spontaneous audience 
              with the Gyalwang Karmapa while en route to Bir. Then, there was the 
              unprecedented gathering of illustrious lamas and translators, including 
              Jigme Khyentse Rinpoche, Tulku Pema Wangyal Rinpoche, Dzigar Kongtrul 
              Rinpoche, Doboom Tulku Rinpoche, Orgyen Tobgyal Rinpoche, Ven. Matthieu 
              Ricard, Robert Thurman and Gene Smith—so many luminaries, in fact, that 
              some of us worried that an act of sabotage or a stray missile might set 
              back the transmission of the Dharma to the West by several decades.<br> <br> But, above all, there was Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche’s defining and 
              momentous keynote speech. Standing before the Institute’s magical 
              Manjushri statue, modelled on one of the most sacred images in Tibet, he
               announced: “The stakes are high. It’s our generation who will shoulder 
              the responsibility for ensuring that the Buddhadharma continues to 
              flourish in the world. We need to make a thorough and effective plan for
               the future, and we must put it into action.”<br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://lotsawaschool.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/group_photo_bir.jpg?w=500&amp;h=305" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Both Khyentse Rinpoche and the conference chairman, Dzogchen Pönlop 
              Rinpoche, wasted no time in revealing what that plan would be. Rather 
              than focus on the works of Tibetan masters—as we had all largely been 
              doing up to that point—they suggested we must turn our collective 
              attention and resources to the vast Tibetan Buddhist canon, comprised of
               the Kangyur, the ‘Words of the Buddha’, and the Tengyur, the 
              commentaries (Å›Ä�stra in Sanskrit) of the great Indian masters.<br> <br> Khyentse Rinpoche told us frankly: “If I were given the chance to set 
              our priorities, what would be the top of my list? Without doubt I would 
              have to say that the teachings of the Buddha—the sutras—should take 
              precedence over the shastras. Then, as the shastras written by Indian 
              authors are more authoritative and carry more weight, I would say that 
              they should be translated before those of the Tibetan authors.”<br> <br> “Painful as it is for me to admit,” he continued, “Tibetans often 
              promote the teachings of their own teachers far more than those of the 
              Buddha… Today, as a result, our vision is quite narrow, and instead of 
              dedicating our limited resources to translating the ‘Words of the 
              Buddha’, we pour them into translating the teachings of individual 
              lineage gurus, their biographies, their long-life prayers, and prayers 
              for the propagation of the teachings of individual schools.”<br> <br> Dzogchen Pönlop Rinpoche, in his speech, told us: “It would be quite 
              ironic to claim to be a Buddhist but have no idea what the Buddha 
              taught.” It is therefore crucial, he said, that western Buddhists have 
              access to the words of the Buddha.<br> <br> Later in the week, His Holiness the Dalai Lama also spoke to us of the 
              importance of a return to the Buddha’s own words and especially the 
              classical Indian commentaries. Candid as ever, he explained that the 
              writings of the Indian masters contained in the Tengyur are 
              indispensable aids to understanding the words of the Buddha, and more 
              applicable to the modern world than the works of later Tibetan teachers.
               “Tibetan authors,” he said, “often took it for granted that their 
              writings would be read by Buddhists, whereas the Indian masters never 
              took that for granted, leading to a big difference in how their 
              teachings were presented… Indian masters, like Nagarjuna, Dignaga and 
              Dharmakirti, presented the Buddha’s teaching through reasoning and 
              logic, which is why they are so relevant to today’s world, in which many
               people are sceptical about religion.”<br> <br> <img class="tcattdimgresizer" src="http://lotsawaschool.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/conference.jpg?w=479&amp;h=320" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Excitement was generated on the second day of the conference when we 
              received a letter from Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche announcing that his 
              Dharmachakra Translation Committee would appoint fifteen full-time 
              translators to the project of translating the Tibetan canon. Then, in a 
              second message, this time on video, he went on to say that his group 
              would commit to translate the entire Tantra section of the Kangyur. This
               precipitated a unique wave of ‘bidding’, as other lamas made similar 
              commitments on behalf of their groups and individual translators 
              volunteered to work on particular texts. Buoyed and emboldened by all 
              these pledges, which made the plan seem that much more realistic and 
              achievable, we somehow set a goal of translating the entire Kangyur, and
               a substantial portion of the Tengyur and related Tibetan 
              commentaries—amounting to perhaps as many as two hundred large volumes 
              in total—within the next twenty-five years.<br> <br> Outside the plenary sessions there were group discussions on issues like
               translator training, resources, funding and peer review. Many of these 
              topics were also addressed informally, during mealtimes and especially 
              on the long bus rides to and from Himachal Pradesh. There was obviously 
              much to talk about and far too little time to cover it all adequately, 
              but steps were taken towards establishing what Dzongsar Khyentse 
              Rinpoche called “an ongoing conference… that never closes because all 
              the attendees continue to consult and work together.”<br> <br> As the days unfolded, there was a growing sense that we were witnessing 
              history in the making, an impression that had little to do with the 
              reporters and photographers, the team of bloggers offering instant 
              updates on our progress via the internet, or the slightly incongruous 
              Bhutanese television crew clad in their traditional robes and 
              knee-length socks. By the close of proceedings, we had created something
               provisionally called the Buddhist Literary Heritage Project, with 
              Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, after repeated requests, agreeing to be its 
              leader. We had finalized goals for the next five, twenty-five and one 
              hundred years, and drawn up a long list of pledges from the various 
              translators and groups involved. Messages of support had come from the 
              president of Taiwan and the prime minister of Bhutan, and more than 
              eleven thousand people had signed an online petition expressing their 
              gratitude for our work. At the precise moment that we completed our 
              conference resolutions, a clap of thunder resounded loudly overhead.<br> <br> From start to finish, everything had gone auspiciously, and there were 
              indications of greater collaboration among translators than ever before.
               In his closing remarks, Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche told us that the 
              conference had made the importance of translating the Kangyur and
