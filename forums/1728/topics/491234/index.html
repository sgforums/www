              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>Ideologies are pre-set forms of thinking
              that shape people’s worldviews and, supposedly, help to order and simplify
              reality. While this supposition is always flawed to one extent or another,
              ideologies can be very seductive. In part this is because they free their
              adherents from the hard work of critical thinking. Thus, they are often held
              onto tenaciously.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>Because ideologies distort
              reality, they are particularly unsuited for those aspiring to power as well as
              their devoted supporters. History is full of examples of politically powerful ideologies
              that underscore this fact: fascism, communism, various military cults
              (particularly popular in South America and the Middle East) and even the
              ideology of democracy as manipulated by corrupt elites, who play the Pied Piper
              to the masses.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>Yet there is still one more
              ideology out there which, even now, wreaks havoc by either claiming for itself
              the trappings of secular power or attaching itself in some influential advisory
              way to the institutions of power. That ideology is religion in its various institutional
              manifestations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>I want to emphasize that I am not
              referring to the personal religious convictions of millions by which life is
              made to appear understandable and meaningful. Whether such convictions are
              accurate or not, they play an important role at the individual level and, as
              long as they do not promote harmful intolerance, should be left to benignly
              function at the local level. What I am referring to are religious ideologies
              that are institutionalized in bureaucracies that can project power much as do
              secular institutions of authority. Religious ideologies so institutionalized
              see themselves as possessed of God-given truth while playing the game of power
              amidst human competitors.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>It is often said that we live in
              an age of religious revival. Whatever this might say for the “spiritual”
              shortcomings of modernity, this is a state of affairs rife with political
              danger. A quick look at history can again easily demonstrate why this is so.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>* In the 10th through 15th
              centuries in Europe, Roman Catholicism was a strong political power centered in
              the Papacy. Historians often claim it preserved what was left of Greco-Roman
              civilization ((despite the fact that the Church closed down the ancient system
              of public baths.) It also brought with it the bloodletting of the Crusades and
              the tortures of the Inquisition.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>* When, briefly, the
              Protestants tasted political power in the form of Calvin’s Geneva, Savonarola’s
              Florence, Cromwell’s England, and the early New World establishments of North America,
              the result was widespread intolerance, civil war, burning flesh at Salem and
              elsewhere and, of course, no dancing. It does not take great imagination to see
              the potential for high levels of intolerance occurring if some representative
              of today’s Christian right, say Ted Cruz, takes power in the U.S.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>* Buddhism used to be
              universally revered as a religion of peace and tolerance. However, put it in
              power or ally it to those who politically rule, and what once was benign turns
              malignant. Thus, consider the self-identified Buddhist government of Sri Lanka
              and its brutal campaign against the Tamils in the north of that country.
              Likewise, you can find Buddhists allied to the government of Myanmar crying for
              the blood of the country’s Rohingya, a Muslim minority.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>* There is a lot of Hindu
              fanaticism in India, and It remains to be seen if the present government of
              that country, dominated now by Hindu nationalists, will again turn loose the
              religious passion which, in the recent past, has led to sectarian violence and
              massacres of India’s religious minorities (again, notably Muslims).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>* Where the Muslims seek or
              hold state power, the situation is little different. According to Sunni
              tradition, the ethical standards of behavior set down in the Quran did not dictate
              state behavior beyond the brief reign of the so-called “rightly guided
              Caliphs.” Shiites often point out that things fell apart almost immediately
              upon Mohammad’s death. Civil war and internecine slaughter followed in both
              scenarios.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>Today, in Saudi Arabia and most
              of the Gulf emirates, one finds Sunni intolerance of Shiite Islam and the
              exploitation of non-citizen laborers despite their being fellow Muslims. In
              Shia Iran, authorities seem unsure just how tolerant or intolerant to be toward
              more moderate interpretations of their own, now politicized, religious tenets.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>Then, of course, you have various
              organizations, claiming to be Sunni Muslim, ranging from ISIS to Al Nusra or
              some other Al Qaeda variant, all reaching for political power. Where they have
              tasted success, as in the case of ISIS, the consequences have been particularly
              bad.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>* Since 1948 Judaism has
              succumbed to the same fate as other world religions entangling themselves in
              politics. Despite all the rationalizations, propaganda, and self-deception, it
              is clear that institutional Judaism is now firmly melded to the deeply
              discriminatory and particularly brutal political ideology of Zionism. I use the
              word “melded” because what we have here is something more than just an alliance
              of two separate entities. The Zionists have insisted since 1917, the year of
              the Balfour Declaration, was proclaimed, that the fate of Judaism and an
              Israeli “national home” are thoroughly intertwined. Their insistent
              manipulations have resulted in a self-fulfilling prophecy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>The consequences of this melding
              have been horrific. If you want to know just how horrid things have become,
              there are numerous Palestinian and Jewish human rights groups that are easily
              found on the web which will document Israeli behavior in all its dehumanizing
              detail.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>For
              a more personalized assessment of just what this melding means for Judaism as a
              religion I recommend the recent book by Marc H. Ellis entitled<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0996592407/counterpunchmaga"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>The Heartbeat of the Prophetic</span></em></a><span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'> </span></em></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>(New Diaspora Books, 2015)<em>.</em><span><em> </em></span>Ellis is a Jewish theologian
              who, in the 1970s, was greatly influenced by the work of Roman Catholic priests
              in Latin America who were promoting “liberation theology.” That “for the good
              of the people” interpretation of religion was corrosive of the
              institutionalized Church, and so the movement was ultimately stifled. However,
              Ellis thought that the same philosophy could be applied to Judaism – an insight
              that eventually led him to denounce Zionized Judaism in a manner reminiscent of
              the prophets of the Old Testament.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt 9.35pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'> </span></p>

              Judaism has been reduced to an adjunct of an expansionist and racist political
              ideology. He feels that there is no getting around the inherent evil of this situation.
              No two-state solution or other “progressive” approach can erase it. As long as
              Judaism persists in identifying itself in terms of the Israeli state and
              Zionist ideology, the ethical underpinnings of the religion are left behind in
              the wreckage of an evolving “Jewish empire.”</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>What have all these historical
              examples to teach those of religious faith? Some fundamentalists would have us
              believe the lesson is to remain humble and obedient in the face of an
              unfathomable deity whose mysterious purposes are simply beyond human
              comprehension. Yet there is nothing incomprehensible about the repetitive
              death, destruction and intolerance bred by institutionalized ideologies. And,
              as the historical  examples given above tell us, religious ideology is no
              exception.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 18.7pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.4pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #111111;'>A better lesson learned seems to
              be: if you want to be religious, keep it personal and tolerant, avoid
              tendencies toward institutionalization beyond the level of local charity and
              organized good works, and stay clear of political alliances. It is said that
              Jesus told his disciples that “where two or three of you are gathered together
              there I too will be.” Those are just about the right numbers when it comes to
              keeping religion safe for the believers and non-believers alike. After all,
              when you have two or three thousand, or two or three million gathered together,
              for whatever purpose, then something quite different from a helpful and humane
              spirit is likely to be present.</span></p>
