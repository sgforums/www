            <div class='col-md body'>There are many complicated situations in life, we can face in workplace or in school or home ETC. Thus i think it important to learn how to prevent this undesirable Situation by learning how to cope with it...<br><br>Afterall, things don't always go your way. What important is @ the end of the day, you are happy and not letting these afflictive emotions get into you; making you a hateful and unhappy person. We all know when you think happy thoughts, you are happy. When you think unhappy thoughts, you are unhappy.<br><br>it's obvious having hateful thought makes you a unhappy person... right ?<br>It's important to start learning how to be mindful then can we learn to curb our anger and prevent bad impulsive behavour .. Learning to have compassion and loving-kindness for others prevent the arising of anger..<br><br>Some of you might have though it unrealistic to behave NICE to someone who is being very Nasty to you. Yeap, you don't have to if you don't feel like it.<br>being too nice to them will encourage more of their nasty behaviour but don't downgrade yourself to their standard. The best thing you can do is learn not to have bad feelings for them and try to be gracious to them as much as you can.<br><br>or learn not to get attached to their remarks or behaviour. Learn to see things lightly. For all things are fleeting and impermanent, what the point of holding grudges towards these people? For these people are creating future bad karma ( future sufferings ) for themselves if they continue to behave so to others. We, as buddhist should wish them to repent and have compassion for them instead.<br><br>our TRUE enemies are not the people but the afflictions in our Mind which lead to undesirable behaviour etc. The three posions known as greed, hatred and delusions.These are three evil roots primarily source of all evil deeds. These are our true enemies! we should strive to cultivate to unroot them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elaborating on my last paragraph...<br><br>For example,<br><br>i hate<span style="font-style: italic;"> Mr John </span>cos he was cruel to animals.<br><br>But what cause Mr john to act cruelty to animals?<br><br>The 'afflictive thoughts' in him creating negative actions. The ignorance in him  of the sufferings he has created as he cannot place his shoes in the shoes of the suffering animals. The ignorance in him for he does not know that his actions is sowing a seed and will reap in the future. He does not understand  how operating system of the universe works.. The law of karma.<br><br>When hating your enemy, u associate 'there person' with your feeling of hatred. When hatred is so deep that even by mentioning his name, your blood can boil. It is because of 'attachment' cause ur still-fueling rage. You are get attached to his actions and him which is why u can't get over it.<br><br>If you investigate deeper, the cause of his negative actions are caused by the 'three posions' arising also from ignorance. The cause of his actions are not <strong>him</strong> but the 'three posions'.. the three afflictive Qualities. Our true enemies are not the person but the three posions.. Not ourselves, not themselves but the three posion.<br><br>we strive to unroot the three posions.. cos all of us have the tendency to perform negative actions due to three posions ( the PRIMARY cause of all bad karma ).<br><br>To repel ignorance, Buddha, dhamma and sangha are the way.
