              Tbs and lsy is full of lies and deceit. Could someone, maybe wiser pls paste the facebook article I quoted for everyone to see.
              
              I am baffled by your ignorance of buddhism. Even buddha did not deny the lower realms and here you are denying it? He also specifically said that those entering the stream will no longer suffer the lower realms and is destined for liberation. If you realize anatta this will be the result.
              
              And why assume I am aiming for pure land? I am not a pure land sect practitioner.

              <div class="acw apm">Lu
                           Sheng Yen or Grandmaster Lu (aka Lian Shen Huo Fo, Padmakumara), a 
                          Taiwanese living in Seattle, USA, is on the guru business. A nice 
                          attempt to combine the Shingon teachings with the Tibetan practices. But
                           Lu has included the practices of Chinese folk religions into the 
                          Buddhadharma. Those Chinese worldly deities which are supposed to be 
                          unworthy object of refuges, are included in the practice. Declaring the 
                          teachings which he taught, are received from Pure Vision. Boastful of 
                          his personal achievement, there are many times in the public, Lu 
                          displayed several miracles, such as emanating lights in the public, 
                          speaking of his own powerful achievements on pyschic powers. He said 
                          that he is an incarnation of a celestial being by the name of 
                          Padmakumara, who lives in Maha Twin Lotus Pond at Buddha Amitabha's Pure
                           Land, Sukhavati. <br><br><br>"True Buddha Sutra", a
                           sutra which is not included in the Tripitaka, is it a work of Mara or 
                          self-deluded vision? Lu has other similar 'sutras' like this one - "True
                           Buddha Sutra": <br><br>"Thus have I heard. At one time, white 
                          Mahapadmakumara was at the Maha Double-Lotus Ponds, sitting upon the 
                          great white lotus dharma-throne; surrounding him were seventeen other 
                          great lotus blossoms. The green lotus radiated green light, the yellow 
                          lotus yellow light, the red lotus red light, the purple lotus purple 
                          light. Each lotus blossom was mysteriously wonderful, pure and full of 
                          fragrance. <br><br>The White Padmakumara, silently calling forth his 
                          spiritual power, transformed the Maha Double-Lotus Ponds into an 
                          extraordinarily splendid place filled with golden light. All the 
                          flower-buds simultaneously burst into fragrant blossoms. Jade grasses 
                          sent forth a wonderful scent. White cranes, peacocks, parrots, saris, 
                          kalavinkas and jivajiras all took on a golden hue and sang graceful 
                          heavenly songs in harmony. The sky filled with golden light. A pure and 
                          wonderful heavenly melody resounded from the sky, The fragrance of 
                          blossoms suffused all realms. Golden sky-abodes, adorned throughout with
                           golden lotuses, radiated splendor. From the sky there showered heavenly
                           flowers. <br><br>At that moment, the ground shook violently in Maha 
                          Double-Lotus Ponds and throughout countless heavens the tremors could be
                           felt. Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and Sravakas all felt it as well as came to
                           Maha Double-Lotus Ponds, as did the rulers of all the Thirty-Three 
                          Heavens. The assembly included beings from the Twenty-Eight Heavens, 
                          Lords Indra and Brahma, the eight classes of supernatural beings and the
                           Fourfold Sangha, all of whom came to hear the revelation of 
                          quintessential teaching. <br><br>At that moment, the Golden Padmakumara 
                          emitted the Great Wisdom Light. The White Padmakumara emitted the Dharma
                           Realm Light. The Green Padmakumara emitted the Ten Thousand Treasure 
                          Light. The Black Padmakumara emitted the Subjugation Light, Red 
                          Padmakumara the Vow Light, Purple Padmakumara the Proper and Dignified 
                          Light, Blue Padmakumara the Virtuous Fruit Light, Yellow Padmakumara the
                           Fortune Fulfilling Light, and the Orange Padmakumara emitted the Child 
                          Innocence Light. <br><br>Upon seeing this, all the heavenly beings were 
                          greatly awed. Then Indra arose from his seat and bowing to White 
                          Padmakumara said, "This is most rare, O Holy and Revered One. By what 
                          cause does the Maha Double-Lotus Ponds emit such great light and 
                          splendor? <br><br>White Mahapadmakumara said, "I will expound this for 
                          everyone present." Indra said, "The Holy Revered One is the most mighty 
                          and powerful. Please explain to everyone present, that all Men and Devas
                           may know where to turn. <br><br>At that moment, White Mahapadmakumara 
                          addressed Indra and the assembly as follows: "Very well, very well. I 
                          will now explain to you and all the beings of the last period of this 
                          Buddha-kalpa and all those in the future who have an affinity with the 
                          Dharma, that all may know the True-Buddha Dharma and the principle which
                           remove obstacles and bestows good fortune." <br><br>White 
                          Mahapadmakumara then said, "All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have, in order 
                          to liberate living beings, manifested the worlds known as 
                          'All-Conquering', 'Wonderful Treasure', 'Round Pearl', 'Sorrowless', 
                          'Pure Rest', 'Dharma Thought', 'Full Moon', 'Profound Joy', 'Profound 
                          Completeness', 'Lotus', 'Immutable', and 'Omnipresence'. Now, there 
                          shall be the 'True-Buddha World'." <br><br>Thus the Buddhas, 
                          Bodhisattvas, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas and all the heavenly beings 
                          witnessed the Holy Revered One bringing forth the True-Buddha World, 
                          understanding it to be a manifestation of the great compassion of the 
                          auspicious Sugatas of the past, present and future, and realizing that 
                          the Holy Revered One came for the sake of all beings. All present were 
                          moved by joy as never before. Then bowing their heads they made praise 
                          with these verses: <br><br>The Holy Revered One of great compassion, <br>the Secret One who is most supreme, <br>had attained enlightenment in the past, <br>and transcended all worldly passions. <br>He now establishes the True-Buddha World, <br>showering compassion on all living beings. <br>Transforming Himself into a Pure Land founding Buddha, <br>He descends into the Saha World. With Lian-Shen as His name, <br>He announces and proclaims the Dharma to all. <br>We have all now heard and shall vow to protect and uphold His Dharma. <br><br>At
                           that moment, the holy revered White Mahapadmakumara instructed the 
                          assembly, saying "In cultivation, the key to realizing the Buddha Jewel 
                          Sambodhi is a quiescent mind; that of realizing the Dharma Jewel is 
                          purity of body, speech and mind and that of realizing the Sangha Jewel 
                          in refuge in a True-Buddha Guru." <br><br>The Holy Revered One further 
                          instructed the assembly, saying "If good men or women, on the eighteenth
                           of the fifth month of each lunar year, make ablution and abstain from 
                          flesh and wear new and clean clothes, or on the eighteenth of each lunar
                           month, or on their own birthdays, call upon the Two Buddhas and Eight 
                          Bodhisattvas before the shrine and reverently recite this Sutra of 
                          Authentic Dharma that Removes all Hindrances and Bestows Good Fortune, 
                          then their supplications will be answered. Moreover, if incense, 
                          flowers, lamp, tea and fruits are offered, along with sincere prayer, 
                          then all wishes will be granted. <br><br>The Holy Revered One told the 
                          assembly, "People of this saha world, be they high officials, nobility, 
                          renunciates, householders, yogis, or commonfolk, who upon learning of 
                          this sutra, uphold, read and recite it, shall prosper above all others, 
                          have greater lifespan, obtain either a son or daughter as sought, and be
                           blessed with measureless fortune. This is indeed a great 
                          fortune-bestowing sutra for obtaining blessings. <br><br>"One may have 
                          deceased ancestors, enemies, close ones or creditors who are unable to 
                          obtain liberation and remain lost in the nether world. However, by 
                          upholding, reciting, and propagating this sutra, the deceased will 
                          ascend to heaven, enemies will be turned away, and those living will be 
                          blessed. If there be man or woman seized by negative forces, afflicted 
                          by spirits, or confused and haunted by nightmares, then by upholding and
                           propagating this sutra, all negative influences shall be banished, 
                          thereby restoring peace and ease. <br><br>If one suffers the physical 
                          retribution of illness and calamity, whether due to nonvirtuous body 
                          karma from previous lives, or due to the afflictions of spirits, then by
                           holding, reciting and propagating this sutra, ill omens will 
                          immediately disappear and the cause of illness is quickly removed. If 
                          one suffers from misfortune, legal entanglement or imprisonment, then 
                          upon upholding, reciting and propagating this sutra, all such obstacles 
                          will be removed, and the suffering of birth and death extinguished." <br><br>Then in the Western True Buddha Assembly at Maha Double-Lotus Ponds, White Mahapadmakumara proclaimed this mantra: <br><br>"Om, guru, Lian-Shen siddhi, hum." <br><br>When
                           the holy Revered One completed this discourse, Indra and the whole 
                          assembly, including devas, nagas and the Fourfold Sangha all paid 
                          reverence. They brought forth faith and upheld the teaching. <br><br>Thus ends the Sutra of Authentic Dharma that Removes all Hindrances and Bestows Good Fortune."<br><br><br><br>Lu

                          this. <br><br>With best wishes, <br>Tenzin Wangden Andrugtsang <br>ohhdl@vsnl.com" <br><br>This is another interesting and encouraging comment written by Alice Shieh: <br><br>"Greetings, Henry :) <br><br>I hope this was the correct e-mail address, and if you are reading this, then obviously it was the right one! <br><br>I
                           personally would like to commend you on your "Controversial.." page. I 
                          just wanted to send you some thoughts on this controversial subject, 
                          since I am so happy to find someone who's taken initiative to put up a 
                          site like yours. Consider me a fellow Buddhist and supporter, and please
                           consider my following words to have been written and conceived in 
                          humility- I know through a written medium it can be hard to not come 
                          across as preaching! <br><br>Beginning students (and many times seasoned
                           ones) are altogether too quick and eager to find and attach themselves 
                          to a teacher. And especially with beginners who do not understand what 
                          someone is telling them could be misguided information, their innocence 
                          is taken advantage of. <br><br>To give my personal thoughts on what to 
                          look for and what not to look for, I'll have to state that I believe 
                          firmly that as a true Buddhist practitioner, I follow and practice the 
                          teachings of the Buddha and the Buddha only. Some may say this is my own
                           personal bias, but doing so does not stop me from appreciating other 
                          faiths. I may appreciate them, but I made the vow to follow the Buddha's
                           teachings and live them, and I come from a standpoint that I am 
                          honoring my vow. <br><br>A cult, in my opinion, has no standing faith or
                           practice of it's own. Thus, a cult "borrows" popular ideas from other 
                          faiths and makes it seem like it were its own. <br><br>I'm going to stick to Buddhism now :) <br><br>-
                           A righteous Buddhist practice is not stingy with its knowledge, and 
                          I've yet to hear of a righteous and truly compassionate Dharma master 
                          tell prospective students they had to enter intitiation rights (be it by
                           way of practice or way of 'donations') to receive their wisdom. Even in
                           the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha did not force the monks and nuns guilty of 
                          ego to retreat before speaking the sutra. They did so on their own 
                          terms. I've yet to see one truly following the Bodhisattva path force 
                          beings to yield to them; in most cases, Bodhisattvas yield to what we 
                          need most, thus is why so many times in sutras they deliver 
                          "expediencies." <br><br>- Secondly, a righteous Dharma master is not 
                          guilty of ego. For me, the second I see someone call themselves the 
                          "true" or "supreme" anything, I turn away. A true Dharma practitioner 
                          acts out of compassion, and with great compassion there is lack of self,
                           and with lack of self it's proposterous to believe oneself to be the 
                          "one and only," "true," or "supreme" anything. I find most times these 
                          titles are meerly hooks for baiting the innocent into following them, 
                          for they hold their "true" liberation in their hands. I believe in 
                          searching for a master, we must remember that Buddha could not even, in 
                          his infinite wisdom, convert every being. We would not be still in this 
                          Saha world if he possessed that capability. It's self defeating to 
                          Buddhism if someone claims to possess a capability of liberating all who
                           take refuge in him/her if even the Buddha could not do such a thing in 
                          his lifetime. Also, everytime His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, gives a 
                          lecture, he has always stressed he is but a simple monk- no better or 
                          worse than anybody else. When asked if he is the Buddha or a great 
                          Mahasattva reborn, he replies the same, "I am a simple monk." A Dharma 
                          master needs neither self-declared titles or secret methods of 
                          cultivation to attract students. He cares not for the adoration that 
                          comes with these titles. A Dharma master is compassionate and doesn't 
                          need students, but teaches the Dharma out of compassion. So we must be 
                          upmost careful and vigilent when choosing a teacher and pay attention! <br><br>-
                           Thirdly, evil is clever. Evil is very, very clever. Evil understands 
                          human nature and how to take advantage of it. When evil demons told 
                          Sakyamuni Buddha of how they would attack Buddhism from without, the 
                          Buddha responded that his Sangha would not succumb. But when the evil 
                          demons replied that they would then attack Buddhism from within, 
                          Sakyamuni Buddha shed a tear. To those who are not strong in their 
                          convictions and pure in intention, it is altogether too easy to lead 
                          them astray. <br><br>For example, today, I was surfing the web for "five
                           pungent plants" since I remembered garlic and onions were considered 
                          among them, but I could not remember the rest. That brought me to Lu 
                          Sheng Yin's page to a lecture where he discussed "vegetarian vs. 
                          non-vegetarian" debates. My first reaction to seeing his picture in the 
                          upper left hand corner of the page and a "supremer master Samantha 
                          Chou's" picture below it gave me an immediate feeling of uneasiness. 
                          Something just did not look right. Whether it was the lack of humility 
                          depicted on their faces or anything else, I do not know, but I had my 
                          moment of doubt. Regardless, we're taught to respect the Sangha. So, I 
                          read the article. It nearly had me convinced it was true Dharma. It 
                          sounds like Dharma, and it sounds like everything I've heard before, but
                           it seemed.. changed. The terminology was there, the anecdotes were 
                          there, but it all just wasn't something I could picture Buddha saying, 
                          or my own Dharma master saying. So I thought, "now it's ok to kill as 
                          long as I use Tantric methods to liberate beings before killing or 
                          eating them?" My next thought was, "how irresponsible this monk is to 
                          not tell his students that that level of Tantric power is held only by 
                          great Dharma practitioners, that it is not something the average layman 
                          can achieve!" Of course, that led to these series of concerns: "If it is
                           true that killing is all right as long as you liberate the beings' 
                          souls before killing them, and that they gain benefit from doing so, 
                          then why isn't a Bodhisattva here trying to kill me for my sake?" 
                          Finally, this led to this conclusion: "It's bull." <br><br>Then I 
                          scoured that webpage and found the master's name was a name I was often 
                          warned about as a child by Chan master, the Venerable Sheng Yen, and 
                          another monk, the Venerable Ching Jing. I say this because it was not 
                          that I entered the site with the bias already in my mind, it was after 
                          having doubts that I decided to find the name of this teacher only to 
                          find afterwards it was someone I had been warned against long ago. <br><br>It
                           was also a reminder to me that although I was born into a Buddhist 
                          household and for all my life I've followed the path of the Buddha, I 
                          was fooled for a while into believing I was reading a true Dharma 
                          lecture. It is a reminder to all who follow a spiritual path to never 
                          stop questioning, for in the end, we must find our own answers and 
                          liberation rests solely in our hands. <br><br>In searching for a Dharma 
                          master, we must use all our senses. We must see humility, hear humility,
                           feel humility, and sense humility. Likewise with compassion and wisdom.
                           Our gut reactions and feelings are stronger than we think they are, and
                           though we must'nt be attached to our emotions, we must be mindful of 
                          them. Only when we believe something is truly "right" is it right, and 
                          someone who tries to tell you they're right because they have some 
                          divine secret, or are the "sumpreme" whatever is often wrong. Likewise, 
                          the mish-mashing of many faiths together into one so-called faith is a 
                          big warning sign of a cult. A true faith has its own essence, it doesn't
                           need to borrow from other faiths to make up for its lack of 
                          credibility. <br><br>Of course, out of curiosity I had to verify my 
                          findings and it was further searching that led me to your site. Good 
                          work, and may there be peace and prosperity in your life wherever it may
                           lead you. <br><br>- Alice Shieh"</div>

              <p>u are the one who dont have a clue what dharma eye means</p>

              <p>and my statement is not made out of biasness as i have taken the time to go and read lsy articles to see whether there were any insights</p>
              <p>in fact some of those teachers generally recognised as unorthodox by buddhist, such as master ching hai, osho, etc still were at the beginning stages of realisation though they have not realised twofold emptiness</p>
              <p>but it is quite clear lsy dont have such realisation. it is apparent that he could have experienced jhanic bliss resulting in certain powers and visions that had led him astray. shurangama sutra as quoted by zero thought seems appropriate</p>
