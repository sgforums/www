              <p><br>don't think they are qualified as ä½›å¼Ÿå­�, more like Mara's å¼Ÿå­�.   Mara will advocate supernatural power over wisdom.  Mara will advocate twin body sex is the highest level of cultivation.  Mara will lie and twist truth and defame others in order to show how wonderful he is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True Buddha School circulate the lies that mainstream buddhists tried to burn down IMM during one of their praying event there. lols...without any evidence.</p>
              <p>They just want to put the mainstream buddhists in bad light.  I wonder how many mainstream buddhists know that they are being accused of trying to burn down a building. lols....</p>

              <p>I am baffled by your ignorance of buddhism. Even buddha did not deny the lower realms and here you are denying it? He also specifically said that those entering the stream will no longer suffer the lower realms and is destined for liberation. If you realize anatta this will be the result.</p>

              <p>precisely, have u ever seen me talk about these powers here. i only mentioned it in this rare occasion because deluded members of a cult thinks that their leader somehow have powers that are special that others dont... and using that to lure and mislead masses. showing off powers to lure people is a characteristic of mara's work. not only is it discouraged but it is actually banned by buddha in precepts</p>

              <p>precisely, have u ever seen me talk about these powers here. i only mentioned it in this rare occasion because deluded members of a cult thinks that their leader somehow have powers that are special that others dont... and using that to lure and mislead masses. showing off powers to lure people is a characteristic of mara's work. not only is it discouraged but it is actually banned by buddha in precepts</p>

              <p>Yeah, we have to wake these people up and lead them to the right path whenever there is an opportunity. I believe some are really ignorant and really do not know what is true Buddhism. Sometimes I do not blame them as their first encounter with Buddhism is True Buddha School. However, it is up to them to find out what is Buddhism.</p>

              <p><strong>Supernatural powers aside, true buddha school have many problems that they hide and sweep under the carpet. Only recently, the Taiwan court charged two tbs masters of rape. Previously there were already a few cases in a few tbs temples but the victims were either silenced by threats or money.  One ex famous taiwan singer dies from mysterious bullets hit in her neck and head while trying to get her lawyer to sue Seattle temple for her whole life savings back.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Only one is still fighting to get her justice. SHC a housewife of 3 kids from Sarawak who is determined to sue lu sheng yen in court for misleading her to twin body sex rape.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Beside rape victims, there were also victims of cheated donations, one happened in Hong Kong whereby one member from the tbs chapter ran away with one million donations from the grand praying event at the Hong Kong stadiium. There were a few more cases in a few countries.  One ran away from Seattle temple with donations. </strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then last but not least, the hardest to prove ,  a few mental wreck cases from practising the dharma of tbs with no proper lineages ( as claimed falsely by lu sheng yen).</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>True Buddha School is such a dangerous cult that many suffered and may carry the wounds for life.</strong></p>

              <p>this is why masters and shurangama often warn people not to be enticed by visions of buddhas or pure lands as doing so will often lead to 'run fire enter demon' (zhou huo ru mo).. also very impt is dont deal with the spirit realm, very easy zhou huo ru mo also. That is why it is impt to learn the right method from a qualified buddhist teacher. received an email from another moderator:</p>

              <p>Haha yeah.  Good bed time stories more interesting than è¥¿æ¸¸è®°.  :)
              It was many years back, more than 25 years ago where I think he mentioned his teacher is ä¸‰å±±ä¹�ä¾¯å…ˆç”Ÿandä¹�å¤©çŽ„å¥³from the spiritual realm.</p>
              <p>He started from teaching å�¯ç�µ (much like shamism) and gradually move into vajrayana Buddhism claiming that he had initiation Padmasambhava in his dream.  His books are often banned in authentic Buddhist organizations.</p>
              <p>Have not heard of him for many years now but not to get involved too much; rather focus on maturing ur insights.</p>

              <div>Why the name, does it imply that other Buddhist schoosl is false?!</div>
              <div>Or to convince it is a true"authentic"as same as other schools?</div>
              <div>If that being so, </div>
              <div>2)And if it is indeed a new religion, why True Buddha School?</div>
              <div>3)And also why style himself Living Buddha?</div>
              <div>Shakyamuni have never trail on the tail coats of any of the previous</div>
              <div>philosophies and religions, calling himself the "Buddha" the awaken</div>
              <div>one. Nowhere did he call himself "Brahma" or maybe even style </div>
              <div>himself "Supreme Yogi of Atman and Brahman", </div>
              <div>4)Also whose tulku is he supposed to be? </div>
              <div>5)Who is Padmakumara? </div>
              <div>Where can I find historical reference of this entity? </div>
              <div>  </div>
              <div>You either espouse core Buddhist teachings or you don't, and therefore</div>
              <div>a new religion.</div>
              <div>And why the oblique reference of "Three Marquis Nine Mountain "as </div>
              <div>his teachers. No references can be found on his lineage page.</div>
              <div>Sorry, I am unable to relate the "Three Marquis Nine Mountain " as </div>
              <div>of an authentic Buddhist lineage.</div>
              <div>6)Who  are the "Three Marquis Nine Mountain ", </div>
              <div>7)Which buddhist scriptures can I find reference</div>
              <div> <a href="http://www.tbsn.org/english2/gm3.php">http://www.tbsn.org/english2/gm3.php</a></div>
              <div>or: <a href="http://www.tbsn.org/english2/liansheng.php">http://www.tbsn.org/english2/liansheng.php</a></div>
              <div>Also references made are very vague, there is no direct endorsement </div>
              <div>or direct accreditation by any Buddhist teachers of him to be qualified </div>
              <div>to teach Mahamudra, Guru Deity Yoga,Deity Yoga, Vajra Practices,</div>
              <div>Highest Tantra  Yoga. </div>
              <div><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Sheng-yen">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Sheng-yen</a></div>
              <div>These teachings do not originate from True Buddha  School, otherwise</div>
              <div>it should be of a different name.</div>
              <div>8) Perhaps outside or independent corroboration of actual empowerment to </div>
              <div>teach these teachings would be useful, and also the chronology of how long,</div>
              <div>where the training have taken place. And I do not mean the initiation or </div>
              <div>empowerment, but the actual retreat. </div>
              <div>these  </div>
              <div>Thank You in advance!</div>

              <p>As I think the discussions have reached a point of being useless and a waste of time, I have decided to close this thread.</p>
              <p>Perhaps some people may be curious about my Master's account of Pure Land... if so I have included something below for people to read. However this is not to 'compare' with cult master lu sheng yen, cos no matter what I say I can never win him. Why? Since cult master lu sheng yen having gained the vision of pure land from mara and claims himself to be Amitabha, his followers will forever treat him like buddha himself.</p>
              <p>But for those interested:</p>
              <p><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Disciple: Master, how do we
                                      witness Sukhavathi?<br> <br> Master Shen Kai: That's easy. But Sukhavathi is very far away. How
                                      far? It's passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                      Buddhalands. In between this hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                      Buddhalands are not Buddhalands but Hui Tu. Buddhalands are pure
                                      where Buddhas dwell. Sukhavathi is hence very very far away. Far
                                      does not mean we don't believe.<br> <br> In the sutras, Buddha used to explain that it's very very near. So
                                      near that nobody believe it's true. There's no choice as sentient
                                      beings are too greedy, hence say it's very very far away and not
                                      easy to go or reach. So He expound the Amitabha Sutra, where Buddha
                                      spoke without people asking. If a person is not greedy, then
                                      Dharmakaya is very near as it encompass everything.<br> Since it's entire existence, it's so near to reach like space
                                      everywhere exist Dharmakaya. Without Dharmakaya, Earth cannot be in
                                      the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by
                                      Dharmakaya.<br> <br> When people do business, they need an initial funding, now Buddha
                                      say you don't need that initial funding, you believe in Amitabha
                                      and recite His name.<br> When one see people wearing a gold necklace, but it's just a piece
                                      of metal chain like the one you see in jail to chain prisioners.
                                      Then Buddha told sentient beings not to be obsess with gold, you
                                      just need to recite Amitabha and don't need any initial funding and
                                      you can reborn in a place where gold is use for building
                                      constructions.<br> So does Sukhavathi really exist? Yes. Don't think Buddha is lying.
                                      You can GO NOW and witness yourself and come back to tell people.
                                      Master tell you I been there before, you all might disbelieve. So I
                                      will describe it to you.<br> Sentient beings on Earth are very small, Bodhisattvas of Sukhavathi
                                      are really Big and tall. A person standing next to Amitabha only
                                      reach the height of Amitabha's toe! When I reached Sukhavathi, only
                                      wish to pay homage to Amitabha, and adore Amitabha.<br> Amitabha Buddha reply: What do you seek here in Sukhavathi?<br> Shen Kai: Honored One, i came to seek Dharma.<br> Amitabha Buddha ask: What kind of Dharma?<br> Shen Kai: i'm not sure. Seeing Amitabha's forehead is adorned with
                                      a curled hair. i wisk to seek that Dharma, Honorable One.<br> (Back to reality.) That's how I cultivate and got my curled hair,
                                      but this Dharma method cannot anyhow expound to people. It's is
                                      because you people have doubt in Sukhavathi. Thinking it doesn't
                                      exist. Hence I tell you my experience. Due to the busy schedule,
                                      the white hair is curled. When it grew longer to 3 inch, it will
                                      extend when i'm washing the face. That's the proof.<br> <br> How did Ocean of suffering (ku hai wu bian) come about? Because
                                      beings of samsara cannot sever emotion, love and greed. Sentinet
                                      beings cry a lot. Separation from friend, family, love ones, people
                                      cry. Son is leaving, mother crys, so does the son. Mother is dying,
                                      sons also crys. When people want's to eat, the mouth starts to
                                      water. This is greed. People need to work, they swear. In a life
                                      them, people generate so many water. One person, say one bucket of
                                      water, 100 pax, 100 bucket form a pool of water. If millions of
                                      millions of people cannot sever emotion, love and greed, form an
                                      Ocean of water.<br> <br> In our world there's male and female. Those who goes to jail, 99%
                                      are involve with female. But in Sukhavathi, there's not male nor
                                      female form.<br> <br> (translated by Sinweiy)</span></p>
