              <p><br> you are absolutely right on that. Many bring along their
                          unsuspecting friends and relatives, family members for
                          blessing. </p>
              <p>The crowd made up of people who attended just for blessing
                          pulled along by their friend/family yet TBS boasted that they had
                          so many followers.  TBS just loved to make up stories to
                          market the school.</p>
              <p>The truth is many had left disappointed, hurt, abused and
                          cheated quietly. Cos they are fearful of the threats made by
                          TBS people ( like you will get cancer, you will be punished by Gods
                          etc ).  Typical behaviours of a cult.  Using threat to
                          shut people up.</p>
              <p>There are a few ended up in the mental hospital. I met
                          someone who told me a real story of his friend. 20 years of youth
                          wasted in the mental hospital after his childhood friend started to
                          follow tbs and became mad. His friend was given the clearance after
                          20 years but the family would not want to hear a single word of
                          TBS. He wasted 20 years in IMH/</p>

              <p>Your words carry no value.</p>
              <p>Just like you, when you were doing Dharma dancing that time, going around to beat people up, you were not being possesed at all, you danced to your own will.  TBSers trying to calm you down but to no avail, trying to communicate with you but you insisted your own way and refused to accept consultation/treatment,.for more than 10 years.</p>

Just like what you wrote in the forums, nobody experience what you've been thru (the Spontaneous Human Combution, the serpent fire ignited from your sex spot etc.) and you too claimed that no one in TBS will understand your acheivement except Mr. Lu Sheng Yen.<br><br>Is your ego, that drives you into your action.<br><br>If TBS causes madness to the followers, why not all the few millions followers ended up in mental hospital or dance like you?</p>

Ok, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">why not you all sign up to DONATE ALL YOUR ORGANS after your death, then see whether you all manage to cremate with SIRARIS/RELICS or not?</span></strong><br><br>Sure you all can right?<span style="color: #ff0000;"> <strong>IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU ALL WILL DIE WORSE OFF THAN THE TBS HUNG DEATH ROW INMATES</strong></span>, I GUESS, BUT, IF YOU ALL COULDN'T OR HAVE NO CONFIDENCE TO PRODUCE ANY SIRARIS/RELICS, THAN YOU ARE LYING ABOUT HOW TO EDUCATE PEOPLE TO ATTAIN ENLIGHTENMENT HERE, HOW?!<br><br>I don't understand, HOW COULD YOU ALL, IF WILL TO DIE WORSE OFF, AND WITH LESS CONFIDENT THAN THE HUNG TBS DEATH ROW INMATES, TO CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO TEACH/GUIDE OTHERS OF HOW TO ATTIN ENLIGHTENMENT?<br>Sounds funny right?</p>
              <p>No offence. But if you feel so, I couldn't help. I am just quoting the FACT.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Between, do you all know the reason why those TBS death row inmates requested for EARLY EXECUTION?<br></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is because (in their prison stamped letters to their Master, Mr. Sheng-yen Lu, “è�©è�¨çŽ°å‰�è·Ÿæˆ‘è¯´ï¼Œé“�å®šå¾€ç”Ÿ”. And Mr. Sheng-yen Lu confirmed with him that the prophet was a real one. Thereafter, they appealed for early execution!) The TBS HUNG DEATH ROW INMATES were very sure that, with great confident that, they WILL DEFINITELY enter into the pure land. Don't you all have that kind of confidence while you are still alive too? <br></span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">So, why ban a group that frequenly materialize and honour the words of BUDDHA and HIS TEACHINGS, if you yourself don't even have that kind of believe and confidence? </span></strong></p>

              <p><br>Not really. Singapore is independant of USA.</p>
              <p>China can ban cults that threaten their society's peace, they do not have to follow USA. </p>
              <p>In fact USA have so many cults ( christian, buddhist and others) that they allow to thrive in their big country. </p>
              <p>Besides, what and how much do USA knows about Buddhism ? They are more into Christianity.</p>

              <p>Wiser aka Arica Lim mentioned the way of serpent fire cultivation, was not following TBS teachings and was objected by the fellow TBSers, knowing the announcement made by their master, Mr. Lu in 1980s. Arica Lim wrote on forums that her serpent fire came naturally and automatically on age 22, without any needs for such cultivation. And now she is still talking such topics on kundalini websites and internet. Therefore, the twin-sex cultivation as she mentioned, is Arica Lim's linage, not TBS's method.</p>
              <p>Who ever claims that Mr. Lu encourages twin-sex cultivation, he/she already eagerly plan/plot to do such kind of illegal cultivation in TBS, all TBSers please look up for this kind of liars.</p>
              <p>Anyway, this kind of people will definitely surface up on internet in future and cry out loud that they are the SEX VICTIMS of Mr. Lu.</p>
              <p>The fact is, nobody perform TWIN SEX on Arica Lim even though she claimed to be the perfect partner for such kind of cultivation, because she has a fine line in between her eyebrows.</p>
