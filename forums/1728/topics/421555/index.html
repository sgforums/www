              <p>Does it really matter?</p>
              <p>Yes it does.</p>
              <p>As a primary 2 child, I was already taught the basics of morality in Civics and Moral Education. The approach was generic and simple. This is your father. This is your mother. This is your sibling (I have one sister who is proudly now a 25 year old working in the medical line). I am ahem.. still looking for a part-time job to sustain my fulltime postgrad studies.</p>
              <p>There are several ways to pitch a baseball, just as there are several ways to engage in spiritual cultivation. The Buddha himself spoke of at least 86400 approaches.. but I mastered none. Maybe I just had a little bit of affinity with Zen, and Zen practitioners are TROUBLE.</p>
              <p>They read sutras like every other Buddhists do, they uphold precepts, they practise samadhi, and the ultimate purpose is transcendental wisdom and compassion, but yet, they are notorious for speaking in Greekish connotations which make it impossible for moderators to moderate in a forum, and for readers to read either.</p>
              <p>And so, for convenience, we need to go back to basics. There are five basic precepts across the board in all Buddhism, have you (or I) done it today?</p>
              <p>No I didn't.</p>
              <p>Ok it's alright, try harder tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Still, the Gautama Buddha was not only a Master of Dharma, a Teacher, a Healer, he was too a Universal Parent who viewed all as children, and knew them by their characteristics. As a growing young adult, I learned alot from him, heck, I loved that guy :)</p>
              <p>So you have brothers and sisters, classmates and family, friends, bosses and coworkers, if you cannot become a monk today, what can you, or rather, I, a helpless weak and underperforming blue collar worker and impoverished postgrad student, do for this world?</p>
              <p>As a college student, I once listened to Japanese music (it was the beginning of my foray into Japanese culture, and subsequent Zen-ish), and a band struck me as using a unique name: Do As Infinity.</p>
              <p>I was like, wow. Doing, as if this world was, Infinite.</p>
              <p>I knew it was something important, eventually I had my first contact with Samantabhadra, the nice gentleman who sits beside Avalokitesvara at KMSPKS monastery, on top of a six-tusked elephant. His ten vows were special, and I learnt to do at least one of his ten vows, because the other ten were too difficult, if not impossible in the Dharma-ending era.</p>
              <p>Which vow was easy then?</p>
              <p>The 10th vow: To transfer all merits and virtues to benefit all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>I was like wow. Buddhism is just so ... broad.</p>
              <p>Yet, like my words, which nobody understands anyway, how many can hold a Buddhist sutra and proclaim full comprehension?</p>
              <p>I have a juicy mango in my hand, this is not a religion where the moderators are allowed to break it up like five loaves of bread into two fishes into millions, and everybody's stomaches are filled to the brim and their hungers satisfied,... this is.... the real deal. Work for it, pretend to work if you cannot work, and if you do not know how to pretend, then just look nerd and stupid.</p>
              <p>Take care of yourself, because this is retrenchment, these are other religions, this is credit card debts, these are long queues to the psychiatrist, your family members are your nemesis in a previous reincarnation, watch the step. To get from here to there, you can use the raft, or you can use the causeway, you can use the undersea internet cable pipes. But if you choose to go the undersea path, stay on the dry side of the pipes.</p>
              <p>Oh no, this is also misrepresentation.</p>
              <p>Oh great.</p>
              <p>Just ignore me. In Singapore, most practitioners are hobbiest like me. Without the ability to devote time, effort and wholehearted attention into practice, and with computers running at 3000 millions per second, and 1 retreat in a year, no wonder people change religions like they change boy/girlfriends and jobs and houses in this sunny island.</p>
              <p>Still, due respect to the the gentleman who 2500 years ago, founded this time-tested religion.</p>
              <p>I tried my best as a student. =)</p>

              <p>The truth is, one can still remain as pious and pure as a monk while holding a job and stay with one's parents.  In fact,  in today's context, there are indeed such a lifestyle which is more practical.

              <p>I am taught how to live a life of strict inner discipline by cultivating meditation everyday, read spiritual books and hold a full time job just like anyone. The only difference is that I don't smoke, drink alcohol, remain celibate for the rest of my life. It's a life of simplicity, sincerity, and honesty. I don't need to ask people for donation money as I earn my own money, I practice my virtues at work, I treat people with respect and integrity.

              <p>It's not necessary to be a monk in order to be enlightened. I've seen many great and highly realized practitioners who are lay persons.</p>
              <p>However, entering monkhood is also good so that you can devote your entire life into spiritual practice and propagating the teaching to the masses, cos no matter what... lay life is busy and limiting so you cannot devote your full time to a spiritual cause.</p>
