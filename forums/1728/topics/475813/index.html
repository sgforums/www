              Not having enough awareness of oneself is one of the problem. I remember I read an article of how Ajahn Chah explained the moment he experienced just before a great awakening in which he personally said he could have gone crazy if not for the great mindfulness he had in those situation. U see, if your awareness is not strong enough, u could have lost yourself in those experiences and can't come back again. That's when u have gone too far away without proper awareness of what's happening.
              
              Also, getting a trustworthy teacher is also important.

              <p>Hi Eternal Now,</p>
              <p>I am an adult and would like to learn more about Meditation and Qigong.</p>
              <p>Can you kindly suggest a buddhist organisation or temple that I can learn more about Meditation and Qigong ?</p>
              <p>Alternatively, can you kindly show me reliable weblinks to learn more about meditation and qigong ? (I can read Chinese. So, I am okay with chinese weblinks. Thanks)</p>
              <p>I understand that without proper guidance for the learning of Meditation and qigong one can lead to èµ°ç�«å…¥é­”.</p>
              <p>Thank you for kind attention and help.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>

              <p>Do you have that article? I am really curious what could possibly happen
                   during meditation. I have asked a lot of people who is either buddhist 
                  or yoga practitioner about meditation. Most of them have different 
                  experience to tell..Some go into a trance state. Some feel nothing. Some
                   start to open 3rd eye and can start seeing spritual stuffs.Some can 
                  start communicating with spirits (not necessary ghost). Some can 
                  even recall their past life.</p>
