            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Then Mahamati said to the Blessed One: You have spoken of an astral-body, a "mind-vision-body" (manomayakaya) which the Bodhisattvas are able to assume, as being one of the fruits of self-realization of Noble Wisdom: pray tell us, Blessed One, what is meant by such a transcendental body?<br><br>The Blessed One replied: There are three kinds of such transcendental bodies: First, there is one in which the Bodhisattva attains enjoyment of the SamÃ¡dhis and Samapattis. Second, there is the one, which is assumed by the TathÃ¡gatas according to the class of beings to be sustained, and which achieves and perfects spontaneously with no attachment and no effort. Third, there is the one in which the TathÃ¡gatas receive their intuition of Dharmakaya.<br><br>The transcendental personality that enters into the enjoyment of the SamÃ¡dhis comes with the third, fourth and fifth stages as the mentations of the mind-system become quieted and waves of consciousness are no more stirred on the face of Universal Mind. In this state, the conscious-mind is still aware, in a measure, of the bliss being experienced by this cessation of the mindÂ’s activities.<br><br>The second kind of transcendental personality is the kind assumed by Bodhisattvas and TathÃ¡gatas as bodies of transformation by which they demonstrate their original vows in the work of achieving and perfecting; it comes with the eighth stage of Bodhisattva-hood. When the Bodhisattva has a thoroughgoing penetration into the Maya-like nature of things and understands the dharma of imageless-ness, he will experience the "turning-about" in his deepest consciousness and will become able to experience the higher SamÃ¡dhis even to the highest. By entering into these exalted SamÃ¡dhis he attains a personality that transcends the conscious-mind, by reason of which he obtains supernatural powers of self-mastery and activities because of which he is able to move as he wishes, as quickly as a dream changes as quickly as an image changes in a mirror. This transcendental body is not a product of the elements and yet there is something in it that is analogous to what is so produced; it is furnished with all the differences appertaining to the world of form but without their limitations; possessed of this "mind-vision-body" he is able to be present in all the assemblages in all the Buddha-lands. Just as his thoughts move instantly and without hindrance over walls, rivers, trees, and mountains, and just as in memory he recalls and visits the scenes of his past experiences, so, while his mind keeps functioning in the body, his thoughts may be a hundred thousand yojanas away. In the same fashion the transcendental personality that experiences the SamÃ¡dhi Vajravimbopama will be endowed with supernatural powers and psychic faculties and self-mastery by reason of which he will be able to follow the noble paths that lead to the assemblages of the Buddhas, moving about as freely as he may wish. But his wishes will no longer be self-centered nor tainted by discrimination and attachment, for this transcendental personality is not his old body, but is the transcendental embodiment of his original vows of self-yielding in order to bring all beings to maturity.<br><br>The third kind of transcendental personality is so ineffable that it is able to attain intuitions of the Dharmakaya, that is, it attains intuitions of the boundless and inscrutable cognition of Universal Mind. As Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas attain the highest of the stages and become conversant with all the treasures to be realized in Noble Wisdom, they will attain this inconceivable transformation-body which is the true nature of all the TathÃ¡gatas past, present and future, and will participate in the blissful peace which pervades the Dharma of all the Buddhas.</blockquote>The Lankavatara Sutra</div>

Anyway not so good to discuss in detail on open forum and may not be the path of everyone... but anyway,<br><br>Since that day you have already received fa wang fa, fa wang fa should become your natural state. Fa wang fa isn't practised, it isn't a method, it is a 'wu wei fa'. If you can just remain in this natural state, then you can 'guan tong' everything... even precepts, samadhi, wisdom is in it. Therefore master says, 'xiu1 xing2 bu ru xiu1 shen1' (cultivate moral conduct is better than cultivating our actions), 'xiu1 xing2 bu ru xiu1 xin1' (cultivating mind is better than cultivating moral conduct), 'xiu1 xin1 bu ru wu2 sheng4' (therefore birthlessness is our natural state, and is not called 'cultivation'/'xiu', is wu wei). We should maintain this natural state, which is to 'chi2' this 'fa', as far as possible in our lives. But most of us can't (maintain natural state throughout our living), so we can practise certain methods like meditation, chanting, etc... to gather strength. But if you can sit in your natural state, that is also 'methodless meditation', wu wei sitting. The difference between natural state and breathing mindfulness is that for breathing mindfulness, the awareness/mindfulness is on breathing, while natural state is 'whole awareness'. Sitting meditation is impt to keep as a habit (at least 30 min a day) especially those who 'chuan fa'. For me I still practise breathing mindfulness. If you received 'shi wei yi fa' you can practise that, that is also 'you wei fa' but you haven't receive and neither has I.<br><br>Furthermore I must say, this cultivation thing in Buddhism isn't just following methods... although depending, they may help. 8 Fold Path is not a method.. following certain methods gather strength but doesn't mean we will become enlightened just by that. Cultivation is the entire way of being, living the enlightened way. If you have any habits left, that is an opportunity to cultivate. If you meet someone and is angry, that is an opportunity to cultivate. When you are in a tense situation you can't just tell him 'excuse me, let me meditate for 5 minutes before continuing my argument'.</div>
