Friendship is a "togetherness" you know... in it separation lightens or dissolves... we're in this together... but instead we try to make use of 'friends' for our benefit we are reinforcing the separation, craving more for <span style="font-style: italic;">myself</span>..<br><br>And yea what you said is right.. the problem with craving is its never satisfactory.. and even if its satisfactory its actually transient and still unsatisfactory...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Liberation cannot exactly be put into words but there can be a few good pointers...<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/l/liberation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/l/liberation.htm</a><br><br><strong>Liberation</strong><br><br>Liberation or freedom is not really concerned with any particular essential aspect, quality, or state. It does not matter what essential state exists in the experience of liberation. If you are free from personality, you are free no matter what the state is. In the state of liberation the content of experience becomes unimportant. It is very ordinary. Nothing specific happens, no huge realization or mind shattering experience. It is the most natural state. It is so ordinary and so natural that when we have it, we don't know we have it. It is so uneventful that almost everyone goes in and out of it frequently. (Diamond Heart Book 2, pg 2)<br><br>Being liberated means there is no clinging to anything; there is no worry, no concern, no heaviness. The mind is not fixated, focused or bound to any particular content; you are aware of whatever arises in the mind, without effort, without even trying to be aware. You don't care whether you are sensing your Essence, or even whether your Essence is there. Whether you are happy or sad, whether a person is there with you or not, none of these things seem important. For the moment you are completely free from all the concerns in your life. This state can never be achieved by striving for it. It will just happen one day, and if you notice it you won't think it's a big deal. You'll go on eating your dinner or whatever you are doing. The moment it becomes a big deal, it's gone. (Diamond Heart Book 2, pg 3)<br><br>Throughout life it comes and goes, for some people more often than others. It is a state of release, but without conscious feeling of release; everything is loose. This condition of freedom is not like liberation from some particular oppression; it is the raw state of liberation itself, so liberating that it doesn't matter what your experience is. You don't care what you're experiencing. Your heart is open and your mind doesn't fixate on preconceived ideas or worry about imagined possibilities. You're completely accepting without thinking or feeling that you're accepting. Essence will be there freely in whatever way your being needs at the moment, but still the Presence of Essence is not your focus, it's just who you are, what is present in your experience now.
