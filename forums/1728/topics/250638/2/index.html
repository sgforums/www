In fact you can be happy with more and more.... do you think the person with "more wealth" can do more harm and do more compassionate deeds or the person with less?<br><br>It is the same with the people in your life...<br><br>If you are not attached to them, that is when you can form the deepest bonds with them. If you are attached to them, you have the illusion that you have strong bonds with them but it is just an illusion...<br><br>The way Jesus suggest is the easy way because the attainment of non attachment is almost instantaneous with proper guidance... (so I suggest you do not do what Jesus advocated - because Jesus said to do it AND follow him, not just sell everything. There must be proper guidance).<br><br>It is a difficult way because people cannot get themselves to do it... and it is an impossible way because you cannot do it and follow Jesus physically any more... (you can do it that way and follow a teacher even if you cannot follow Jesus but then some so called "teachers" are crooks...)<br><br>There are other ways without taking such drastic actions... and in fact if you are mindful and aware, you can get there with patience and simply learn the lessons from everyday life.
