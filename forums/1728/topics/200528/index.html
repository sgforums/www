            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'm new here. I'm from Indonesia... still in high school  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I got these from website:<br><br>THE FIRST NOBLE TRUTH TAUGHT by Shakyamuni Buddha is that life is<br>suffering. The Buddha also imparted that the four primary forms of<br>suffering are birth, illness, old age, and death. Taken alone, these<br>pronouncements set the stage for a life-denying tradition in which birth is<br>viewed as a descent into the vale of misery. <span style="color: blue;">However, these negative<br>assessments are more than counterbalanced by the Buddha's central teaching<br>that human life offers a unique opportunity to discover the truth</span>. The same<br>potential for spiritual awakening is not presented by birth as an animal,<br>as a supernatural being, or even as a privileged dweller in one of the<br>heavenly realms. The Buddha himself embodied the fruition of human<br>potential: the attainment of infinite knowledge, wisdom, and compassion.<br>Therefore, the belief that prevailed in Buddhism is that birth in human<br>form is a rare and precious event. In place of the lamentation that one<br>might expect, one finds that birth has been celebrated in numerous ways in<br>Buddhist art, myth, and philosophy.<br><br>The Buddhist celebration of birth first found expression in exaltations of<br>Queen Maya, the Buddha's mother. Some accounts suggest that Queen Maya was<br>on her way to her parents' home when she unexpectedly had to stop and give<br>birth in a forest. Other sources, however, reveal that the queen sought out<br>a sacred grove where all the women of her lineage gave birth under the<br>watchful care of the grove goddess. The goddess created a suitable<br>environment by hanging jewels and flower garlands from the trees and making<br>lotuses bloom in all the ponds. She summoned the females of all species to<br>bring offerings to the foot of the tree where Buddha would be born. Queen<br>Maya bathed in a lotus pond and then grasped the branch of a fig tree,<br>which served as her midwife for the auspicious birth.<br><br>The Buddha was born from Queen Maya's right side. Scholars have interpreted<br>this as a negative motif, a sign that the womb is too impure and defiling<br>for a Buddha to inhabit. However, Buddhist texts explain that a Buddha by<br>nature causes no suffering and that this was true from the very moment of<br>his conception. Queen Maya experienced no discomfort during her pregnancy,<br>and her son considerately emerged from her side so that the delivery would<br>be painless.<br><br>When the Buddha's mother died during the first year of his life, she merged<br>into the goddess of the sacred grove. It is Maya's image that is enshrined<br>in the temple at the site of the Buddha's birth in Lumbini, Nepal. Women<br>from surrounding villages have come here over the centuries not to worship<br>the Buddha, but to pray to the holy mother for protection in childbirth and<br>healthy children. They honor her image with seasonal flowers and with red<br>powder and vermilion paste signifying the life-blood with which mothers<br>animate their children. Drinking water that has been poured over the statue<br>is believed to cure infertility. An archaeological record reaching back<br>thousands of years preserves the worshippers' handmade offerings of<br>terracotta beads, bracelets, miniature horses, and human figurines. Despite<br>the fact that one of the world's greatest religious leaders was born here,<br>worship at the site glorifies the mother who gave birth, not the son who<br>was born.<br><br>THE Flower Ornament Sutra (first--second century C.E.), an early Mahayana<br>scripture, further exalts the Buddha's mother in passages voiced by the<br>goddess of the sacred grove, who witnessed the nativity. In a poetic stream<br>of visionary ecstasy, the goddess eulogizes the miracles that took place in<br>Queen Maya's body, beginning with an outpouring of brilliant healing light:<br><br>As Lady Maya leaned against the holy fig tree, all the world rulers, gods<br>and goddesses... and all the other beings... were bathed in the glorious<br>radiance of Maya's body .... All the lights in the billion-world universe<br>were eclipsed by Maya's light. The lights emanating from all her pores...<br>pervaded everywhere, extinguishing all suffering... illuminating the<br>universe.(n1)<br><br>Queen Maya's womb attained cosmic proportions. Universes streamed forth<br>from her body, while everything in this universe was in turn visible in her<br>womb. All the worlds, lands, and Buddhas were visible in each of her pores.<br><br>No stigma attaches here to the process of birth or to the womb. In<br>dualistic philosophies that separate mind and body, pure spirit and impure<br>matter, the female body and especially the womb are often negativized as<br>the gateway into the prison of matter. However, according to the<br>nondualistic Mahayana philosophy of emptiness, birth and indeed all<br>phenomenal arising is miraculous and illusory. Ail things are born out of<br>emptiness, shimmer momentarily in empty space, and then dissolve back into<br>the cosmic source. Emptiness is the fertile womb of reality, and the human<br>womb possesses the same wondrous power of manifestation.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Perfection of Wisdom philosophy elevates the concepts of birth and<br>motherhood above even that of Buddhahood itself. This philosophy introduces<br>a cosmic female who embodies the radiant wisdom that gives birth to<br>Buddhas.</span> The goddess, known as Prajnaparamita, or Perfect Wisdom, shares<br>the name of the literature in which she appears and the knowledge that she<br>personifies. One of her rifles is Mother of Ail Buddhas, for she is the<br>maternal source of saving knowledge. As the mother, she endures, while her<br>offspring, the Buddhas, come into existence and pass away:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">She is the Perfect Wisdom that never comes into being and therefore never<br>goes out of being .... She can never be defeated in any way, on any level<br>.... She is the Perfect Wisdom who gives birthless birth to all Buddhas.<br>And through these sublimely Awakened Ones, it is Mother Prajnaparamita<br>alone who turns the wheel of true teaching.(n2)</span><br><br>The Buddhas recede in importance as their birth-giver, Prajnaparamita,<br>emerges as the supreme teacher, the source of all religious truths. Seekers<br>of wisdom must sit at her feet and drink from the endless stream of<br>teachings that flow from her presence. Without her, the Buddhas would have<br>nothing to teach. She is the source and content of their teachings, the<br>eternal font of revelation; the Buddhas are her messengers.<br><br>Mother Wisdom is put forth as the highest object of worship, more worthy of<br>reverence than a Buddha or Buddharelics, for only those who prize wisdom<br>above all else may attain it. Buddhas and their relics are indeed holy;<br>however, the Buddhas are sacred because she brought them into being, while<br>the relics are venerable because they are saturated with her energy.<br>Therefore, Buddhas and bodhisattvas, too, revere her. Recognizing their<br>dependence upon her, they<br><br>devotedly contemplate the spontaneously revealing Goddess Prajnaparamita<br>with deep consecration and respect--revering, worshiping, and ecstatically<br>adoring her .... The omniscience... which alone constitutes Buddhahood<br>springs from Mother Prajnaparamita, and therefore all Buddhas and<br>bodhisattvas are intensely grateful and thankful to her and only to<br>her.(n3)<br><br>The entire edifice of Prajnaparamita philosophy is built upon the principle<br>that the birth-giver is greater than the one who is born. As long as there<br>is a mother of Buddhas, there will be more Buddhas, and she will continue<br>to exist long after they have passed away.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>TANTRIC BUDDHISM, which arose in about the seventh century, added its own<br>distinctive valuation of birth. As a tradition that treasures the human<br>body as the abode of bliss and vehicle of enlightenment, it is natural that<br>Tantra proclaims that women, the givers of birth, are to be honored. The<br>Candamaharoshana Tantra has harsh words for those who disparage the source<br>of life, pleasure, and kindness:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Woman alone is the birth giver, the giver of true pleasure to the Three<br>Worlds, the kind one. Those chattering fools engaged in evil action, who<br>now disparage her out of hostility, will, by their action, remain<br>constantly tortured for three eons in the fathomless Raudra Hell, wailing<br>as their bodies burn in many fires.(n4)</span><br><br>The text pronounces that those who fail to honor women can not attain<br>liberation, but those who render to women their due homage will be rewarded<br>with supreme enlightenment. Toward this end, a man should seek a woman upon<br>whom he can focus his devotion. When he finds a spiritual consort, he<br>should approach sexual union with her as a sacred act. Envisioning her as a<br>living goddess, or female Buddha, he should bow at her feet, beg her to<br>grace him with a loving glance, and worship at the altar of her thighs. He<br>should lovingly kiss her stomach, thinking, "This is where I formerly<br>dwelt; from here I was born," and grant her any form of pleasure that she<br>desires.<br><br>Although the honor accorded to women in Tantric Buddhism goes beyond their<br>role as mothers, the high value placed upon the human body and upon birth<br>is the cornerstone of this--and any--female-affirming philosophy.<br><br>The theme of rebirth, like that of birth, was elaborated and assumed grand<br>proportions in the Buddhist imagination. Early Buddhism envisioned six<br>forms in which one could be reborn: that is, as a denizen of hell, animal,<br>human being, hungry ghost, demigod, or god. The six realms of rebirth<br>correspond to mental drives and psychological temperaments. For example, a<br>preponderance of hatred and aggression will lead to rebirth in hell among<br>violent beings. Greed and perpetual dissatisfaction lead to rebirth as a<br>hungry ghost, while excessive envy results in birth among the demigods. A<br>person's thoughts, motivations, and behavior plant the seeds of karma that<br>will ripen in future lives. Enlightenment offers the hope of escape from<br>the round of rebirth.<br><br>As Buddhism evolved, rebirth came to be seen a process that can be mastered<br>and engaged in consciously. In Mahayana Buddhism, a bodhisattva aspires to<br>become free from karmic impurities and to renounce the selfish desire for<br>personal existence. Once freed from this desire, however, the bodhisattva<br>does not simply dissolve into the blissful expanse of ultimate reality. The<br>paradox inherent in this process is that, having transcended the thirst for<br>personal selfhood, one attains the Buddhist equivalent of immortality. No<br>longer subject to the laws of karma and rebirth, bodhisattvas are free to<br>recreate themselves eternally, in innumerable times, places, and bodily<br>forms, to lead others to the same state of liberation. Such beings will<br>fearlessly descend to the hell-realms to bestow cooling water and the<br>nectar of compassion upon their tortured inhabitants, or visit places<br>frequented by alcoholics, derelicts, and compulsive pleasure-seekers of<br>every description, for it is necessary to appear among those who will most<br>benefit from even the slightest glimmer of wisdom.<br><br>These bodhisattvas, too, fashion divine bodies of unspeakable beauty and<br>infinite glory to enchant the senses and awaken spiritual aspiration.<br>Bodhisattvas do not even necessarily take rebirth in human form. They may<br>choose to be reborn as crops to feed the hungry, rain to end drought,<br>medicine to cure the sick, roads and bridges to aid travelers, trees to<br>provide shade, and houses to provide shelter. They can manifest in many<br>forms and places at one time and travel into the past, present, and future.<br>Having mastered illusion, illusion becomes their plaything, reality their<br>playground, and conscious rebirth their entertaining and liberating<br>pastime.<br><br>TANTRIC BUDDHISM adds yet another dimension to the concept of rebirth. In<br>Tantra, death and rebirth are regarded as experiences that one may undergo<br>in one's present lifetime through yogic practices that simultaneously<br>purify the mind and body. The subtle psychic energies that carry a person's<br>thought and emotions are normally dispersed throughout the body. A<br>practitioner of Tantric yoga learns to draw these energies into the<br>central, spinal channel, where they no longer support dualistic thought.<br>Egoic selfhood, which is predicated upon dualistic thought, is thereby<br>deprived of its foundation and spontaneously dissolves. Further<br>concentrating the energies into a single point, or drop, at the heart, the<br>seat of consciousness, brings about a psychic death. The illusory self, the<br>false ego, dies, and the clear light of universal awareness dawns in its<br>wake.<br><br>This process of psychic death and rebirth is depicted in Tantric<br>iconography in various ways. One is the motif of a Buddha trampling upon a<br>corpse. The corpse does not represent external beings or forces that must<br>be defeated but rather the unenlightened self that is left behind on the<br>journey to liberation. The Buddha pins down its chest, the seat of the mind<br>and emotions, showing that egoic tendencies have been conquered. Above the<br>gray, prostrate corpse, the lifeless shell of the former self, the Buddha<br>dances in a magnificent, divine body. Tantric Buddhas are customarily<br>adorned with skull-crowns, necklaces of skulls, and ornaments made of human<br>bone, demonstrating that they have overcome the dualism of life and death<br>and know the secrets of the art of rebirth.<br><br>The Flame-Dancing Dakini epitomizes the Tantric understanding of spiritual<br>rebirth. Her golden body shines with the radiance of perfect wisdom and the<br>life-force in its purest essence. Flames burst from her body, for the fire<br>of spiritual transformation blazes within her. She wears none of the usual<br>adornments of deity, for only the barest naked awareness, stripped of all<br>conceptual overlay, can accomplish this transition. Her face is drawn into<br>an expression of supernatural intensity, for she experiences all the<br>passions as pure energy-waves that she may ride, enjoy, and use at will.<br>The flame-dancer emerges from a cloak of human skin with a bloody lining.<br>She leaps free of her former self, leaving it behind like an afterbirth;<br>she sheds it just as a snake sheds its skin, glowing with the ecstasy of<br>rebirth. She waves aloft a ball of string, a Tantric symbol of continuity,<br>expressing that death, or what the unenlightened regard as death, has<br>become child's play to her--an illusory threshold that she has crossed many<br>times.<br><br>This Tantric goddess occupies the vantage point from which life, death, and<br>rebirth are one grand process, a never-ending process of transformation.<br>She knows that, in the face of death, there is no cause for sorrow, for<br>there is no permanent loss or separation. Thus, she dances exultantly,<br>victoriously, rejoicing, filling the universe with her cosmic laughter.<br><br>Sarwa manggalam,<br>Om mani padme hum</div>
