               is more important for me is to expereince no-self in what is happening.
               It doesn't matter whether there are thoughts or not. There is a 
              difference in experiencing the world through a self and one without it. 
              This to me is more important.</span><br><br><span>The
               Now concept can put one into a state of wanting to get into such a 
              state. This will cause a thinking that there is a Now state and a 
              non-now state... and that the Now state is better.</span><br><br><span>However,
               the insight of spontaneous manifestation will change this view. 
              Spontaneous manifestion need a clear understanding and experience of 
              no-self. Here, it doesn't matter whether there are thoughts, feelings or
               not... these expereinces are arising not from a self... and cannot be 
              stopped by a self.</span><br><br><span>From
               the practice point of view, meditation is essential. It is also 
              important to have the ability to realise one's blindspots... that is 
              when one is unconsciously caught up. This can be very very subtle... and
               hard to discover... and presented the main difficulties for me.</span><br><br><span>The conceptual understanding is much easier that the realtime practice."</span><br><br><span>In 17 December 2008 I asked Thusness after Longchen (Simpo/Sim Pern Chong's posting):</span><br><br><span>(9:57

              arising.. to remain in 'now' doesnt mean there's no sense of self isit? 
              and there's still the sense of effort to achieve or sustain the state</span><br><span>(10:00 PM) Thusness: 'Now' is a concept for what they really want to convey is a direct experience of a sense of presence.</span><br><span>(10:00 PM) Thusness: spontaneous arising is different.

               PM) Thusness: what they want to bring across to the readers is to tell 
              them not to lost themselves in stories so that they missed the direct 
              experience of 'Presence'.</span><br><span>(10:07 PM) Thusness: This is just the first step.</span><br><span>(10:08 PM) AEN: icic..</span><br><span>(10:09 PM) Thusness: Stressing the importance of 'Now' has no other purpose other than that.</span><br><span>(10:09 PM) Thusness: What longchen said is a more important truth.</span><br><br><span>....</span><br><br><span>In August 2008:</span><br><br><span>(8:27 PM) Thusness:	what is so great about being 'Now'?</span><br><span>(8:28 PM) AEN:	because 'now' is the only reality?</span><br><span>(8:28 PM) Thusness:	so what is so great about 'Reality'?</span><br><span>(8:29 PM) AEN:	its clear and liberating?</span><br><span>(8:30 PM) Thusness:	???</span><br><span>(8:30 PM) Thusness:	who tell u that?</span><br><span>(8:30 PM) Thusness:	Buddha tell u that being in the 'Now' moment u will be liberated?</span><br><span>(8:30 PM) AEN:	no</span><br><span>(8:30 PM) Thusness:	then why u say that?</span><br><span>(8:31 PM) AEN:	hmm</span><br><span>(8:31 PM) AEN:	by clearly perceiving the true nature of the 'now' moment then there is liberation?</span><br><span>(8:31 PM) Thusness:	who tell u that?</span><br><span>(8:31 PM) Thusness:	no such thing.</span><br><span>(8:31 PM) AEN:	icic</span><br><span>(8:31 PM) Thusness:	It was derived.</span><br><span>(8:32 PM) Thusness:	By some practitioners and masters.</span><br><span>(8:32 PM) AEN:	being "now" means going pre symbolic?</span><br><span>(8:32 PM) AEN:	oic</span></span></span></span></span></p>

              <p>Thanks for this post!  It helps to clarify what I'm experiencing(I think).</p>
              <p>I have been focusing on the now for some time, but as I've mentioned else where, I've       recently been having an experience of presence. I've used the "now" as a gateway to the feeling of presence, and this post helps clarify how that may occur.</p>
              <p>I have not clearly recognized, until now, the difference between the two. I feel a difference in experience but have not to able to intellectually distinguish the two. The "effortlessness" which thusness speaks <span style="line-height: 1.231;">about</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">, regarding spontaneous arising, is very recognizable in what I experience. Like wise, the need for effort to maintain the "now state" is exactly my experience as well.</span></p>
              <p>I came across a statement that seemed to really resonate with me right now. To paraphrase:</p>
              <p> "If their is no "I", then what is in it's place? What is there? What is where you would    expect  the "I" to be?"</p>
              <p>I've found this line of inquiry to really highlight the feeling of presence and the fact that thoughts and feelings do not arise from "I" as was previously assumed. Seeing in this way allows thoughts and feelings to just be, with no effort to alter there arising or duration.</p>

              <p>Yes. For example I just passed The Power of Now to my dad because if he could have a glimpse of I AM Presence that would be good too.<br><br>If you have a powerful glimpse of Presence, your whole life will be shifted towards spiritual rather than merely material pursuits.</p>

              <p>Yes you may be having some glimpses of non-doership and spontaneity, though not exactly the anatta that longchen spoke of. When your experience matures into impersonality one may feel that one is not a personal doer but one is being lived, being done, being expressed by a higher power or source. However that is also not yet non dual, or anatta.</p>

              <p>The realisation of no-self and the characteristics should lead to a gradual dispassioning. Attachment, desire is 'self'... In meditation, when 'self' is dissolved, the whole lot of attachment, imagination, ideas pertaining to self also all drop... this will result in a kind of release/bliss. When there is release, 'I/you/self' is not there to experience it.</p>
              <p>As for the Now/Presence, it is merely the result of a certain condition.. that is the alignment of attention to the Present Moment. That is it. If we focus/or try to go into presence/Now... what may be occuring is the 'self/grasping' grasping towards a certain state. ... 'Now' is merely the resultant experience due to the fulfilling of certain conditions... unbiasely speaking... it is not something that one can attain to or acquire.</p>
              <p>From my experience, the insights (no-self, emptiness) served to bring 
                      one out of the wrong way of experiencing/understanding. It is work that one needs to practice constantly.. The incorrect way of understanding 
                      our experiences/interaction is so ingrained that initial insights do not
                       overturn them permanently.</p>
              <p>For example, i still have anger problems... From a ignorant point of view, anger is resulted from not seeing the situation clearly... for in truth, there is only the arising of aggregates and no persons to direct the anger at. But habit dictates that we associates in terms of entities and persons although in actuality there are mere arising of conditions .</p>
              <p>Also, my opinion is that, the furthest, Practitioners who live conventional lifestyles (with families, spouses, etc) can attain is Anagami. For Arhatship, there must be a fully relinquishing of lifestyles that continue to re-inforce attachment.</p>

Very often, due to lack of insight, the "present moment" becomes reified and grasping occurs.

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">I wrote in http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html :<br> <br> A few months later, even though it has been seen that ‘seeing is always the
              sights, sounds, colours and shapes, never a seer’, I began to notice this
              subtle remaining tendency to cling to a Here and Now. Somehow, I still want to
              return to a Here, a Now,</span><span style="line-height: 115%;"> like 'The actual world right here and now', which I can 'ground myself in',
              like I needed to ground in something truly existing, like I needed to return to
              being actual, here, now, whatever you want to call it. At that point when I
              detected this subtle movement I instantly recognised it to be illusory and
              dropped it, however I still could not find a natural resolution to that.</span><span style="line-height: 115%;"> </span></span></span></p>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: 115%;">Until,
              shortly maybe two weeks later, a deeper insight arose and I saw how Here/Now or
              something I can ground myself in doesn't apply when the "brilliant,
              self-luminous, vivid, alive, wonderful textures and forms and shapes and
              colours and details of the universe", all sense perceptions and thoughts,
              are in reality insubstantial, groundless, disjoint, unsupported and
              spontaneous, there was a deeper freedom and effortlessness. It is this insight into
              all as insubstantial, ephemeral, bubble-like, disjoint manifestations that
              allows this overcoming of a subtle view of something inherent. There is no
              observer observing something changing: simply that the "sensate
              world" is simply these disjoint manifestations without anything linking
              each sensation to another, without some inherent ground that could link
              manifestations, so manifestations are 'scattered', disconnected, self-releasing
              and traceless. Somewhere around this time, Thusness wrote me a post in our blog:

              <p>King Milinda did asked Ven Nagasena whether laypeople can attain Arhatship. The answer was yes from Nagasena's reply... but however, that particular layperson will seek a monk to ordain him/her to monkhood...</p>
