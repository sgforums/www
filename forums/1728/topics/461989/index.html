              <p>Capala (Pacala) Sutta: Nodding</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.058.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.058.than.html</a></p>
              <p>Once<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.058.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> the Blessed One was living among the <a id="bhagga" name="bhagga">Bhaggas</a> in the Deer Park at Bhesakala Grove, near <a id="croc-haunt" name="croc-haunt">Crocodile Haunt</a>. At that time <a id="moggallana" name="moggallana">Ven. Maha Moggallana</a><a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.058.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> sat nodding near the village of <a id="kallavalaputta" name="kallavalaputta">Kallavalaputta</a>, in <a id="magadha" name="magadha">Magadha</a>.
               The Blessed One, with his purified divine eye, surpassing the human, 
              saw Ven. Maha Moggallana as he sat nodding near the village of 
              Kallavalaputta, in Magadha. As soon as he saw this — just as a strong 
              man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm — he 
              disappeared from among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at Bhesakala Grove, 
              near Crocodile Haunt, and re-appeared near the village of 
              Kallavalaputta, in Magadha, right in front of Ven. Maha Moggallana. 
              There he sat down on a prepared seat. As he was sitting there, the 
              Blessed One said to Ven. Maha Moggallana, "Are you nodding, Moggallana? 
              Are you nodding?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p>"Well then, Moggallana, whatever perception you have in mind when 
              drowsiness descends on you, don't attend to that perception, don't 
              pursue it. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your 
              drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then 
              recall to your awareness the Dhamma as you have heard &amp; memorized 
              it, re-examine it &amp; ponder it over in your mind. It's possible that 
              by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then 
              repeat aloud in detail the Dhamma as you have heard &amp; memorized it. 
              It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then pull 
              both your earlobes and rub your limbs with your hands. It's possible 
              that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then get 
              up from your seat and, after washing your eyes out with water, look 
              around in all directions and upward to the major stars &amp; 
              constellations. It's possible that by doing this you will shake off your
               drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then 
              attend to the perception of light, resolve on the perception of daytime,
               [dwelling] by night as by day, and by day as by night. By means of an 
              awareness thus open &amp; unhampered, develop a brightened mind. It's 
              possible that by doing this you will shake off your drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then — 
              percipient of what lies in front &amp; behind — set a distance to 
              meditate walking back &amp; forth, your senses inwardly immersed, your 
              mind not straying outwards. It's possible that by doing this you will 
              shake off your drowsiness.</p>
              <p>"But if by doing this you don't shake off your drowsiness, then — 
              reclining on your right side — take up the lion's posture, one foot 
              placed on top of the other, mindful, alert, with your mind set on 
              getting up. As soon as you wake up, get up quickly, with the thought, 'I
               won't stay indulging in the pleasure of lying down, the pleasure of 
              reclining, the pleasure of drowsiness.' That is how you should train 
              yourself.</p>
              <p>"Furthermore, Moggallana, should you train yourself: 'I will not visit families with my pride<a id="fnt-3" class="noteTag" name="fnt-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.058.than.html#fn-3">[3]</a> lifted high.' That is how you should train yourself. Among families 
              there are many jobs that have to be done, so that people don't pay 
              attention to a visiting monk. If a monk visits them with his trunk 
              lifted high, the thought will occur to him, 'Now who, I wonder, has 
              caused a split between me and this family? The people seem to have no 
              liking for me.' Getting nothing, he becomes abashed. Abashed, he becomes
               restless. Restless, he becomes unrestrained. Unrestrained, his mind is 
              far from concentration.</p>
              <p>"Furthermore, Moggallana, should you train yourself: 'I will speak no
               confrontational speech.' That is how you should train yourself. When 
              there is confrontational speech, a lot of discussion can be expected. 
              When there is a lot of discussion, there is restlessness. One who is 
              restless becomes unrestrained. Unrestrained, his mind is far from 
              concentration.</p>
              <p>"It's not the case, Moggallana, that I praise association of every 
              sort. But it's not the case that I dispraise association of every sort. I
               don't praise association with householders and renunciates. But as for 
              dwelling places that are free from noise, free from sound, their 
              atmosphere devoid of people, appropriately secluded for resting 
              undisturbed by human beings: I praise association with dwelling places 
              of this sort."</p>
              <p>When this was said, Ven. Moggallana said to the Blessed One: 
              "Briefly, lord, in what respect is a monk released through the ending of
               craving, utterly complete, utterly free from bonds, a follower of the 
              utterly holy life, utterly consummate: foremost among human &amp; 
              heavenly beings?"</p>
              <p>"There is the case, Moggallana, where a monk has heard, <strong>'All 
              phenomena are unworthy of attachment</strong>.' Having heard that all phenomena 
              are unworthy of attachment, he fully knows all things. Fully knowing all
               things, he fully comprehends all things. Fully comprehending all 
              things, then whatever feeling he experiences — pleasure, pain, neither 
              pleasure nor pain — he remains focused on inconstancy, focused on 
              dispassion, focused on cessation, focused on relinquishing with regard 
              to that feeling. As he remains focused on inconstancy, focused on 
              dispassion, focused on cessation, focused on relinquishing with regard 
              to that feeling, he is unsustained by<a id="fnt-4" class="noteTag" name="fnt-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an07/an07.058.than.html#fn-4">[4]</a> anything in the world. Unsustained, he is not agitated. Unagitated, he
               is unbound right within. He discerns: 'Birth is ended, the holy life 
              fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>
              <p>"It is in this respect, Moggallana, that a monk, in brief, is 
              released through the ending of craving, utterly complete, utterly free 
              from bonds, a follower of the utterly holy life, utterly consummate: 
              foremost among human &amp; heavenly beings."</p>
