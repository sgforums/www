This will lessen their suffering and they will reborn into a better realm earlier.<br><br>But when they are reborn into animal realm, while having to pay back for their past bad deed, they most likely will create new bad karma, for example, insects eat another insects, or cow grow hatred when being slaughtered.<br><br>Due to this, it will take very long time (could be a few aeons) before they are reborn as human again.<br>Therefore, do cherish your life as a human, and opportunities to know buddhism.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Extracted this from the wonderful world of internet:<br><br><blockquote>Can animals be reborn as humans beings? Yes, if they come into contact with the Dharma, see a Buddhist temple, or smell incense burning. The contact can plant a Dharma seed which takes root when they're reborn as humans. They can achieve their full potential and become enlightened, but only as a human being. So, it's up to all of us to help our pets be reborn in the human realm.</blockquote>Hence for us, human to help our insect counter parts to reincarnate into human realm, we need to dedicate our merits to them, together with all sentient beings.  If you came across a dead insect in your path, you could do a simple chanting for them, as though their body is dead, their consciousness is still there.  No doubt they have created negative karma by preying on other animals/insects, these are karma of ignorance, cos they do not have our wisdom, but all beings have the same Buddha Nature as us.</div>

"retributions" will still be over.<br><br>i think animal killing animal is neutral karma btw. some animal are carnivores, they have no choice but to kill and eat other animal. so it is for severing hunger rather than for Fun. only we human can kill for fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>/\<br></div>

Evil right? Then there must be many animals and insects than human as the former usually takes so many many years to exhaust their bad karma to become human again.

Are there any proofs? </div></blockquote>As I said there are no proof, I am saying that this is what the Buddha said. But we can logically conclude since we still know so little about the universe. Scientists have recently discovered hundreds of extrasolar planets, and that is the beginning. In the future, thousands or millions more planets will be discovered, and any one of them may harbour life. Beyond this universe, scientist does not know what is there. There could very well be other universes. In Buddhism, the cosmology is really vast and wide without boundaries.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no2a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no2a.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Earth is not the only world. It is only one of the innumerable planets in the vast universe. It is analogous to a grain of sand in the riverbed of the Ganges River and is called the Earth. The "Jambudvipa" mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures refer to the Earth in which we live. Our earth is one of the many planets of the "small chilocosm". To understand the extent of the vastness of the whole world as described by the Buddha, it is necessary to explain the term "Three Thousand Great Chilocosm".</span><br><br>----------<br><br>Oh and I just remembered. It is prophecised by the Buddha that, during the period of the next Buddha, Maitreya Buddha, 4 different planets from different parts of our galaxy will be united under one rule. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fyi:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Why Does the World Population Increase?<br><br>There is really no ground to think that this is the only period in which the population of the world has increased.<br><br>If Buddhists do not believe in the soul created by god, how are they going to account for the increase of population in the world today? This is a very common question that is asked by many people today. People who ask this question usually assume that there is only one world where living beings exist. One must consider that it is quite natural for the population to increase in such places where good climatic conditions, medical facilities, food and precautions are available to produce and to protect living beings.<br><br>One must also consider that there is really no ground to think that this is the only period in which the population in the world has increased. There are no means of comparison with any period of ancient history. Vast civilizations existed and have disappeared in Central Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Ancient America. No census figures on these civilizations are even remotely available. Population, as everything else in the universe, is subject to cycles of rise and fall. In cycles of alarming increases of birth rate, one might be consequently tempted to argue against rebirth in this or other worlds. For the last few thousand years, there has been no evidence to prove that there were more people in some parts of the world than there are today. The number of beings existing in the various world systems is truly infinite. If human lives can be compared to only one grain of sand, the number of beings in the universe is like the grains of sand all the beaches in the world. When conditions are right and when supported by their good kamma, a few of these infinite number of beings are reborn as human beings. The advancement of medicine especially in the 19th and 20th centuries has enabled human beings to live longer and healthier lives.<br><br>This is a factor that contributes to population increase. Population can further increase unless sensible people take measures to control it. Hence, the credit or responsibility of increasing the population must be given to medical facilities and other circumstances available today. This credit or responsibility cannot be allotted to any particular religion or any external sources.<br><br>There is a belief among certain people that all unfortunate occurrences that destroy human lives are created by god in order to reduce the population of the world. Instead of giving so much suffering to his own creatures, why cannot he control the population? Why does he create more and more people in thickly populated countries where there is no proper food, clothing and other basic and necessary requirements? Those who believe that god created everything cannot give a satisfactory answer to this question. Poverty, unhappiness, war, hunger, disease, famine are not due to the will of god or to the whim of some devil, but to causes which are not so difficult to discover. </span>http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/Clubs/buddhism/dhammananda/241.htm<br><br>/\</div>

The most important thing is, to start cultivation from self, and gradually spread the influence around.
