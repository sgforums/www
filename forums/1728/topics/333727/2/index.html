              <p>You don't have to hide in temple and chant. Chanting is one way,
              and you can practice chanting anywhere, not just in temple but on
              the bus/train, when you are walking, doing your things. Instead of
              thinking of past, present, future, one simply concentrates his
              awareness on the chanting and avoid distraction.</p>
              <p>What is important is maintaining present moment awareness,
              whatever you are doing, whatever you are experiencing, you are
              aware. Including the chanting. Some people don't chant as often,
              but still they can practice being aware.</p>

              when we are so busy with our careers and constantly facing a
              shortage of time?<br></a><br></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a id="stateofmind" rel="nofollow" name="stateofmind">In cultivation, at what state of the mind does one
              awaken? What is the state of awakening
              like?</a><br></span></span><br></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means
              cultivating in the midst of our activities. This is a point that
              many people do not understand. They think that cultivation will
              result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
              mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of
              our daily activities. Many retired old folks have no need to attend
              to household chores anymore, thus they can afford to spend their
              time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the
              midst of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need
              to tend to their children, household chores and many other matters.
              How do you expect them to cultivate in their leisure? Thus, the
              need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking
              they could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No
              matter what activities they are engaged in, it is always possible
              to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our neighbours and
              friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from
              all these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate
              in the midst of our activities do we understand the meaning of
              cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may cause others a lot of
              frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
              neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or
              running from temple to temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her
              husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If she understands the
              principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would
              be acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of
              vice, he would know how to turn them down because his wife is a
              diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then cultivating at
              the same time.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in
              our society when we understand the principle of cultivation.
              Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few decades, I
              have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are.
              When we possess the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an
              appropriate time for cultivation, any place can be the place for us
              to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct ourselves
              in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think
              that we can only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot
              cultivate when we are working, then it is very possible that we
              commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
              every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly
              practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the
              cultivation process does one awaken and what it is like to be
              awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put
              it into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink
              the water, only you know how warm or cold it
              is.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Because your mind can't rest. We got so used to our mental mode of constantly seeking, seeking for things to think, things to do, things to entertain ourselves (otherwise i'll feel 'bored'), things to get, etc etc. This has been pretty much part of our ordinary way of life for our whole life, and in fact, in our innumerable previous lifetimes. So much so that we do not know that there is a different mode of being.</p>
              <p>We are unable to understand that there is a deep state of rest, which is effortless, totally blissful, boundless and full of clarity. This sort of bliss and clarity far transcends all mundane experience of pleasures. When we know that this is possible, our mind is willing to totally let go. We do not fear dropping all our attachment, mental conditioning, our body and mind, because we understand that dropping is bliss. As our moderator Thusness have said,</p>
              <p><em><br>Every major
                      dropping results in a totally new experiential reality. Perhaps that is
                      why Lao Tze teaches us to eliminate until none to experience Tao.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial;">To
                      drop the bondage/deep conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another
                      way of 'knowing' is possible; an effortless, total sensing and
                      experience of wholeness. Next the experiences of the joy, bliss and
                      clarity of wholeness. Without the insight into the possiblity and the
                      experience of the positive factors, the mind will not release itself
                      from holding.</span></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Even open
                      pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind
                      chatters incessantly. Every what, when, where and why by itself is a
                      distancing from start. Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry aka
                      'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced
                      for the 'willingness' to arise.</span></em></p>

              <p>Jesus is one with deep mystical knowledge (i.e. knowledge of the true nature of God, experienced the union with divine reality) and also his miracles and supernatural powers were not unlike those performed by Buddha and the Indian yogis of the past.</p>

              <p>Sorry it seems the link no longer works... someone took it down.</p>
              <p>Buddhists don't 'worship' Buddha, but we honour him, respect him, venerate him and treat him as our greatest teacher. Ultimately, we ourselves want to attain Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>As Buddha himself said, all sentient beings have Buddha Nature, but it is due to our delusory thoughts and seeking that we have obscured our true nature.</p>
              <p>People to this day continue to attain realisation of our original nature which is identical to all Buddhas and all sentient beings, though sentient beings have deep layers of intellectual and emotional obscuration that serves to block us from that knowledge... like the clouds blocking the sun.</p>

              <p><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>2. Since we also have Amitabha Buddha in our mind, how should we cultivate so that we can manifest our Own-nature Amitabha?<br><br><em>i.</em></strong> If somebody scolds me with unkind words, I shall respond by saying "Amitabha Buddha". By this, not only am I not accepting the abuse, in contrast the infinite brightness that illumines with the recital of "Amitabha Buddha" eliminates the darkness brought by the abuse.<br><br><em><strong>ii.</strong></em> If somebody gives me a present, I shall say "Amitabha Buddha". By this I mean, "thank you very much". Therefore, not only do we have infinite brightness in our heart, by virtue of giving the giver shall have infinite blessings and merits as well. In this way, we are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><em>iii.</em></strong> If I see someone who is well endowed, good-looking, kind and peaceful, I shall remark "Amitabha Buddha". By this, I congratulate the person for having such attributes similar to the Amitabha Buddha. I compliment him as Amitabha Buddha to mean that he is similarly well endowed.<br><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><em><strong>iv.</strong></em> If I see a student studying, I shall say "Amitabha Buddha". It is also acceptable if you say that he is very hardworking or very clever. However, sometimes an intelligent person may be fooled by his own intelligence. There is no guarantee that a student who does well in his studies now will definitely grow up to be good. But, when we use the name "Amitabha Buddha" to compliment him, then we evoke the brightness to illumine in him. Not only will he do well in his studies and his career, he will also be a Bodhisattva when he grows up, or even become Buddha someday.<br><br><em><strong>v.</strong></em> If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If we say "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in our mind.<br><br><em><strong>vi.</strong></em> If we come across two parties bickering, quarrelling or fighting with each other, we do not join in. By our participation, we plant the cause to be reborn in the realm of the Asura, which is not a desirable thing. We only need to have Amitabha Buddha in our mind and say "Amitabha Buddha" just once, and then in future we will not be in spiritual union with the beings of the Asura realm.<br><br><em><strong>vii.</strong></em> If we chance on seeing some traders in the market cheating on the scales, we immediately say "Amitabha Buddha". Because cheating arises from greed which resonates with the realm of the ghosts, it is a cause for rebirth in such a realm in future. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" just once, then not only do we not resonate with the realm of ghosts but also we are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha and we become illumined with infinite brightness.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><em>viii.</em></strong> People in general have a curious nature. If we stumble upon someone else's secrets, we are driven by our curiosity to peek into it to find out more. If this person is committing a crime, this may spell trouble: our life may be in danger. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" in our mind and we quickly distance from it, then we are in union with all that are virtuous and bright. We do not resonate with darkness.<br><br><em><strong>ix.</strong></em> If we come across a drowning man, of course, we save him if we have the ability. However, if we could not be of help and in the meantime someone else is saving him, we say "Amitabha Buddha". By calling out "Amitabha Buddha" just once, it strikes resonance with the drowning person and he immediately attain the brightness and accomplishment of Amitabha Buddha. Then, our mind is also in spiritual union Amitabha Buddha.<br><br></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><strong><em>x.</em></strong> If a person tells you tales about someone else, those tales are not your business. The Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch states, "I see someone engaging in gossip-mongering, I do not participate. If I participate in the gossiping, then I have done wrong." That the person is wrong is his own business. Your participation means that you have also done wrong. If this person speaks a lot of ills about another person and in the end you say just once "Amitabha Buddha", that is good enough. If you participate in the gossiping, this person may go around speaking ill of you too. But, when you say "Amitabha Buddha", then you are in resonance with brightness and that person would not be able to invent gossips and speak ill of you. Therefore, "Amitabha Buddha" is indeed really very useful. Regardless of whether the situation is good, bad or neither good nor bad, when we say "Amitabha Buddha", our mind will be at ease and we attain brightness, and in this way we resonate with brightness. <br></span></p>

              <p>Steve Hagen, from a book 'Meditation Now or Never' (a good book to introduce you to Buddhist meditation):</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>...For most people, the first taste of meditation quickly reveals how we commonly live in a state of constant distraction. Our minds jabber away, flashing images and emotions as if we were fixed on a television set that was permanently switched on. Noises, colors, and personal dramas play out in mental commercials and soap operas all of our own making. We live tuned into ourselves, but out from life.</p>
              <p>In meditation we switch the television set off, step away from this busy, hectic mind, and taste the experience of this moment -- not as we judge it or comment on it or think about it, but as we live it <em>now</em>.</p>
              <p>Meditation doesn't only take place when you are seated in a formal meditation posture. It begins the moment you turn your attention to what is taking place right <em>here</em>, right <em>now</em>. Thus we can bring awareness to any activity -- whether we're at work, playing with our children, eating dinner, washing the dishes, or taking out the garbage.</p>
              <p>Meditation begins <em>now</em>, right <em>here</em>. It can't begin someplace else or at some other time. To paraphrase the great Zen master Dogen, "If you want to practice awareness, then practice awareness without delay." If you wish to know a mind that is tranquil and clear, sane and peaceful, you must take it up <em>now</em>. If you wish to free yourself from the frantic television mind that runs our lives, begin with the intention to be present <em>now</em>.</p>
              <p>Nobody can bring awareness to your life but you.</p>
              <p>Meditation is not a self-help program -- a way to better ourselves so we can get what we want. Nor is it a way to relax before jumping back into busyness. It's not something to do once in awhile, either, whenever you happen to feel like it.</p>
              <p>Instead, meditation is a practice that saturates your life and in time can be brought into every activity. It is the transformation of mind from bondage to freedom.</p>
              <p>In practicing meditation, we go nowhere other than right here where we now stand, where we now sit, where we now live and breathe. In meditation we return to where we already are -- this shifting, changing ever-present <em>now</em>.</p>
              <p>If you wish to take up meditation, it must be <em>now</em> or never.</p>

              <p>IMO,</p>
              <p>Meat eating should be minimized or gradually be dropped.... especially red meat. Lots of pain for the animals are generated in the eating of them.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, the attachment to meat cannot be dropped and compassion not actively performed.</p>

              <p>IMO,</p>
              <p>Meat eating should be minimized or gradually be dropped....
              especially red meat. Lots of pain for the animals are generated in
              the eating of them.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, the attachment to meat cannot be dropped and
              compassion not actively performed.</p>

              <p>There is a student that I am currently teaching. He used to work in the medical lab.... not anymore.</p>
              <p>He tell me and show me pictures of how stray animals that are caught, are experimented with until they die. Very cruel.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, he dream of the animals that he has killed.</p>
              <p>The way human beings treat other animals are inhumane... including those that are going for the slaughter house as meat. Try minimising being part of the process.</p>

              <p>I see... wow I didn't know they experiment on stray animals also... it's sad how these people have little compassion and awareness of the animals' pain.</p>
              <p>Actually in accordance to Lankavatara Sutra there is a chapter that is against the practice of meat eating and presents its case well and the Buddha talks about forbiding meat eating. I think, eventually from the Mahayana point of views all Buddhist practitioners will have to relinquish meat at some point.</p>

              <p>By saying that vegetarianism is not compulsory is simply an expedient means for people who still couldn't give up meat to embrace the teachings of Buddhism...</p>

              <p>Maybe he can dedicate merits to those killed by him.</p>
              <p>Last time there was a person who wanted to test my Master and dressed very professionally and nicely. If I remember correctly he works at a slaughterhouse. He wanted to know of my Master could tell that he was into slaughtering.</p>
              <p>To his surprise my Master knew and when asked why he could know it, my Master replied that there are one whole group of killed chickens and animals following behind you...</p>
              <p>Even animals know to take revenge. Those karmic debtors can chase you and cause you misery and death in this life and the next. So one has to be very wise about one's actions.</p>
              <p>Also to take precepts seriously... avoid any activities that harms life... such as fishing etc. People lack of wisdom just don't know that the seemingly harmless activities are causing great karmic consequences for his future.</p>
