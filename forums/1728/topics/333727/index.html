              <p><br>That teaching is the Mahayana (east asian) buddhism teaching, there are lots of different buddhist teaching due to humans different thinking and also wanted to promote their sect and temple business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Namo amituofo is nothing but a gesture, a greeting of something like buddha is with you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you will to open the sutras of buddhism and read it, be it the diamond or lotus or 10 world sutras etc etc,...Buddha is in you, what Gutama did (2500 years ago) was to preach to those suffering lower caste indians so as to enable them to find comfort in their soul  while they are suffering form poor and hardship life. He is somebody that wanted very much to study humans and way of our life, he is a person, not god, nor saint, nor some holy spirit. I respected him for his contribution to the human kinds, everyone of us is a buddha, it just that we did not show it often, by helping a old man crossing the road or giving a seat to cripple one, you are the buddha of the moment. If i will ask you how you feel after you helped someone, that feeling is buddha, for no amount of money can buy that feeling, and to him that feeling within you at that moment is called heaven.</p>

              <p>First of all, welcome 4 of you to join this buddhism forum, really seldom see you all here.</p>
              <p>Yes, buddhism teach us not to find faults with others because there is no such need. Even if you can prove that the whole world is at fault, it doesn't make you any happy. If one understand the basics of buddhism like rebirth, cause and effect concept, he should know that whatever suffering one go through is due to his past karma. The real culprit is your bad karma not any tom dick or harry.<br><br>Some people recite namo amituofo to overcome the habit of fault finding when situation arise. Some use other method. It's up to each individual.</p>

Many youths and adults want to enjoy life, and only think of themselves. Thus, they cannot see the rationale of being caring to others to a point of sacrificing one's enjoyment and alike.

              <p>To answer the original question. There are different kinds (or capacities) of human beings in this world. Some like meditation, some like reciting amituofo, some like reciting mantras, some like Zen, some like Heart/Diamond Sutra. Buddha is very compassionate, you want apple he gives you apple, you want orange he gives you orange as long as you have faith in Him and practise accordingly.</p>
              <p>All of these are skillful means to train your mind that is conditioned by greed, hatred and ignorance (including finding faults at others). Imagine your mind is like a  hard disk full of rubbish. Information pops out randomly following some probability. Normally, rubbish information will pop out frequently. Now because you keep reciting amituofo, you constantly store good information (amituofo is pure and good) into your hard disk until it becomes the dominant information. So the probability of good information coming out from your hard disk become higher and higher. Until at a certain stage, when you want to find fault at others, suddenly this amituofo will pop out just in time to stop you.</p>
              <p>Of course the story about amituofo (Western PureLand Buddhism) is much more than this ...</p>

              <p>many people think that Buddhism is serious and buddhists are taught to abide rules and regulations. That includes putting others above oneself. Many youths and adults want to enjoy life, and only think of themselves. Thus, they cannot see the rationale of being caring to others to a point of sacrificing one's enjoyment and alike. This is the difference. But people are not perfect.. thats why respect for one another is very important.</p>

              <p>You don't have to hide in temple and chant. Chanting is one way, and you can practice chanting anywhere, not just in temple but on the bus/train, when you are walking, doing your things. Instead of entertaining discursive thoughts of past, present, future, one simply concentrates his awareness on the chanting and avoid distraction.</p>
              <p>What is important is maintaining present moment awareness, whatever you are doing, whatever you are experiencing, you are aware. Including the chanting. Some people don't chant as often, like me, but still they can practice being aware.</p>

              <p> <strong><br>Cultivating amid our activities</strong></p>
              <p><br>Many of us think that learning and practising Buddhism means utilising Sundays, our rest days or daily, to pray or meditate in temples. This perception is neither right nor wrong. We may be busy with our work and other activities, but, Buddhism is best practised amid these activities. Should one be totally inactive or free, what else is there to practise?<br><br>It is common to see people working and singing at the same time; machinists talking while working the machines; housewives working on their chores and exhorting their children at the same time; others work with their minds preoccupied with all sorts of other problems not related to their work. In short, they may be occupied physically, but mentally, their minds are not free or empty. As such, does learning and practising Buddhism really pose a problem to our heavy schedules? This is definitely not so. A verse from the "Seven Buddhas" reads: "Avoid all evils; do all that are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas".<br>So, we just need to purify our minds. While at work, although our body may be in action, it is actually amid these actions that we cultivate. The mind should not wander and the mouth should not chatter unnecessarily. We should concentrate on the work wholeheartedly, and constantly act on purifying our thoughts. This is practising Buddhism, and in fact it is the right approach. With this in mind,    <br>the busier we are, the more opportunities we have in cultivating. Let us not treat Buddhism as a form of superstition and think that to practise means having to make extraordinary efforts such as going to the forests or temples to meditate or to chant.<br><br>A commuter, when travelling in a train for example, may emulate the mental purity of the Buddha, and listen to the rumbling of the wheels and at the same time rythmically chant the name of the Buddha or Bodhisattva so that the mind does not wander. Naturally the mind will become pure and calm. Learning Buddhism means emulating the mental purity of the Buddha. Buddha is one who has already attained perfect enlightenment, sublime wisdom and blessings. On the other hand the commoner has lesser blessings and wisdom. Still, he would have made tremendous advancements if he merely practises Buddhism amid his daily activities to the extent that he attains purity in his bodily actions, speech and thoughts.<br><br>Thus, no matter what we do, where we are or how busy we may be, we can still practise Buddhism. As long as we put this into practise, our wisdom will develop and our blessings will gradually grow. For this reason, Jen Chen Buddhism advocates practising amid the activities of our daily lives; practising without attaching to the notion of practice; maintaining awareness without attaching to the notion of awareness; and attaining without attaching to the notion of attainment. When we understand this principle and have no more confusions, we can be considered great practitioners of Buddhism.</p>

              </span></p><p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation?
                                          Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I
                                          travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was
                                          in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the
                                          temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you
                                          cultivating? I replied, "That’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha
                                          teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down!
                                          In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel
                                          about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds,
                                          I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the
                                          Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our
                                          activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that
                                          cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
                                          mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities.
                                          Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can
                                          afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst
                                          of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children,
                                          household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their
                                          leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they
                                          could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they
                                          are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our
                                          neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all
                                          these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our
                                          activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may
                                          cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
                                          neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to
                                          temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If
                                          she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be
                                          acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to
                                          turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then
                                          cultivating at the same time. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in our society when we understand
                                          the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few
                                          decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess
                                          the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any
                                          place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct
                                          ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can
                                          only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is
                                          very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
                                          every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and
                                          what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it
                                          into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know
                                          how warm or cold it is.</strong></span></p>

                      beings and we all have a mind. We are frequently ‘deceived’ by our minds. For an
                      entire lifetime we are ‘deceived’ and ‘misled’ by our minds without
                      ever realizing it! If the mind is good, then of course, it is all very well. Such a mind
                      creates a good person; one can ascend to the heavens or one can perform a lot of virtuous
                      deeds. What happens if the mind is evil and becomes defiled? It can drag us to become
                      animals, ghosts and deities, or descend to hell. This is because our mind is not pure, and
                      therefore the world becomes a sea of suffering. This suffering world of ours is called the
                      "Saha World". It means having to endure and is also called the "World of
                      enduring sufferings".</strong></span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>If
                      we all purify our minds, then the world becomes a heaven. Everybody is very happy and
                      there is no suffering. In learning and practising Buddhism, the most important thing is to
                      purify our minds. When we can purify our minds, then naturally there will be happiness in
                      our world.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>To do that we have to observe the
                      non-arising of the mind. This is called ‘contemplation of the mind’. When the
                      mind is polluted, then we cleanse it with the dew of the Buddha. And when our minds have
                      been purified, then they are the same as those of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In this
                      way, we will progress very quickly in our cultivation.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>Observing the mind is very simple.
                      It is like watching out for the mouse. Everybody dislike mice because they steal our food
                      or they damage our clothings. An idiom describes this sentiment with the phrase,
                      ‘When the mouse crosses the street everybody goes after it.’ Obviously mice are
                      not welcomed and they have to be dealt with. One method of dealing with it, is the cat. At
                      the sight of a mouse, the cat puts his paws firmly on the ground and fixes its steely eyes
                      on the mouse. On seeing the cat, the mouse trembles with fear, not daring to make even the
                      slightest movement. Treat your mind as if it were a mouse and your awareness as the cat.
                      At every moment observe your mind, in the same way as the cat watching the mouse. The
                      mouse wants to live and hardly has time to think of its own safety, let alone of stealing
                      food. If we can observe our minds, then we will hardly have time enough to treasure our
                      wisdom life, let alone think of committing evil deeds.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>Therefore when we are learning and
                      practising Buddhism, we need to learn to "contemplate the mind". In this way, we
                      will very quickly be able to avoid all evils and do all that are good.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>"Avoid all evils; do all that
                      are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". Besides
                      avoiding all evils and doing all that are good, we need to purify our thoughts. When our
                      thoughts have been purified, then the mind is pure. The purpose of learning and practising
                      Buddhism is to purify the human mind. If the minds of everyone in the family is pure, then
                      our home is pure; if the minds of everyone in this society is pure, then our society is
                      pure; if the minds of everyone in the country is pure, then our land is pure; if the
                      entire human race in the world is pure, then our world is as happy as the Western Pure
                      Land. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>Our mind is like the stealthy
                      mouse, ever watchful of a chance to creep out to commit evil deeds, and we are not even
                      aware of that. I hope all of us will keep a cat to watch our minds, so that we can become
                      Buddha quickly.</strong></span></p>
