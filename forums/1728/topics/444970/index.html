The Catholic Church might be the first association to come to mind. Yet similar challenges confront faiths all around the world, and Buddhism is no exception.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

As Buddhist monks and leaders were among the country’s intellectual elite, many were persecuted and killed in the 1970s. Rebuilding the Buddhist community—known as the sangha—has been an ongoing effort ever since.</span></span><span style='font-family: "MS Gothic";    ' lang="EN">â€¨â€¨</span><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> Moreover, modern ways of life divergent from traditional Buddhist values hardly provide a breeding ground for faith, especially for the young people. Add in a few recent incidences of shameful monk behaviour and it might even be said that the state religion is in crisis.</span></span></p>

As most visitors to Angkor Wat discover, King Jayavarman VII is credited with turning the formerly Hindu kingdom into a Buddhist realm.</span></span></p>

Approximately 4,000 Buddhist pagodas, known as wats, are found throughout the country and around 95 percent of Cambodians are said to be Buddhists.</span></span></p>

They fall asleep.”</span></span></p>

Rampant consumerism, high-speed technology and changing perception of morality can encourage a lifestyle that is the antithesis of the traditional Buddhist principles of life. Humility, reflection and charity are simply not the ideals of the modern age.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

They like drugs and alcohol, they like girls.”</span></span></p>

All the lures, the consumerism that’s so rampant, especially in Phnom Penh, I’m sure it has an effect on the monks here.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Whereas all Buddhists are expected to hew to five precepts in daily life—referred to colloquially as no killing, no stealing, no sexual misconduct, no lying and no indulging in drugs and alcohol—ordained Theravada Buddhist monks must adhere to 227 precepts. Whether through intentional adaptation to the modern age or slack regulation from Buddhist leaders, these precepts are not always obeyed.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Monks using cell phones and riding motorcycles—those scenes of traditionalism intersecting modernism captured by many a tourist’s digital camera—are emblematic of a changing way of life for the Buddhist clergy.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“They have to adapt with the modern day, we cannot see that as bad,” says Say Amnann, a lecturer at a Buddhist university, department director at the Ministry of Cult and Religion and former monk. “Buddhism accepts change. If the Buddha were here, he would allow monks to use cell phones.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">”Other Buddhists hold on to more traditional expectations of the monkhood. “I see monks at the shopping mall eating ice cream,” says Sorn Chantha, a sales professional in her late twenties. “It’s weird to me. The monk is supposed to live lightly, not have anything except knowledge. But in Phnom Penh, what I see is exactly different.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Purity of mind, body and action is seen by some to be the essence of the monkhood—the reason why monks are considered worthy mentors for their believers. When the line between monks and laypeople becomes blurred, respect for Buddhist leadership may be tested.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">“In my opinion, what I hear and what I see, monks can have girlfriends. That’s why it’s hard to believe anymore. It’s impossible to trust,” says Sorn. “When I ask a monk for advice, sometimes I am not sure that this person is able to advise me or if what he advises me comes from a clear mind.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Deviant behaviour by some Buddhist monks contributes to her sense of disillusionment in the monkhood. Sorn cites a much publicised case from last year, when a well-known monk was arrested for producing and distributing pornographic material, made when filming women at a Phnom Penh pagoda in secret.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But Say Amnann warns against letting such incidents blight perceptions of the monkhood as a whole. “If we see that those monks are bad, we start to think all monks are bad,” he says. “But we forget to look at the history, everything is interconnected and interrelated. We have to compare with the good things. I think that the good things are more than the bad things.”</span></span></p>

It means that there’s trouble and help is needed. These people need good education and good teachers."</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

It’s part of an effort to reestablish Buddhism as a “wisdom tradition.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

But, according to Gyallay-Pap, a national movement to adopt standards from the West and secularise the school system in the 1950s eliminated religious curriculum, and brought education away from Buddhist Sangha control.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Monks are taught elementary courses at the temple, and can receive discounts or free tuition to study at universities.</span></span></p>

I would maybe be a farmer. My father did not want me to follow him, so he sent me to be a Buddhist monk.”</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

At a class at the Preah Sihanouk Raja Buddhist University, nearly all monks present raised their hands when asked if they entered the monkhood younger than age 20. Several students explained that being monks allowed them to pursue an education they would not otherwise have had the opportunity to access.</span></span></p>

The university was founded in 1954 but closed down in 1972 with the onset of civil war. In 1997, the institution reopened and now offers bachelor degree courses in the faculties of Khmer literature, Pali and Sanskrit studies, philosophy and religion, educational and information technology and teacher training—with plans to offer a Master’s of Arts programme in Buddhist Studies. Courses such as accounting and English provide more practical career prospects for those who are not a part of, or do not remain in, the monkhood.</span></span></p>

They get a degree, and then they become a normal person and get a job. For me it’s not moral to use the monkhood. It’s hard to respect the people like that.”</span></span></p>

It’s just a common social rite of passage. You take the vows then you can disrobe whenever you want.”</span></span></p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing this article. I had just been to Cambodia Siem Reap last week lol.. Not only visited the centuries-old Angkor Wat Temple, I also took the opportunity to see the Theravada temples over there.</p>
              <p>sad to say... what the article said is quite true... Not only that, there are many poor children soliciting money from tourists. They first appear very friendly with you and started suggesting to  you to see buddhist statues, etc etc. After that, they will ask you to give them some money for their school, teachers and monks lol</p>
              <p>The laypeople and the sangha's houses or resting area are quite blur to me... They seems to be living together in the same place. I tried to see how is buddhism over at Cambodia but the children is one obstacle for me to overcome haha... I have also seen a monk smoking right before the presence of these poor children. I can't say monks cannot smoke but definitely smoking brings negative image and it's not a healthy habit too.</p>
              <p>In the morning, I didn't see any monks walking around at the tourist attractions for alms. I'm not sure whether is it forbidden by the authorities, but I thought in Thailand, it's quite common to see the monks walking at the streets for alms...?</p>
              <p>I also thought of looking for buddhist robes (checking out the price...) But I couldn't find any shop selling it. Most shops are mainly open for tourists selling souvenirs, food, drinks etc etc</p>

              <p>Been to siem reap before too. Quite nice the place, different feeling.  But i did not see many signs of Buddhism there too.  </p>
              <p>Quite sad that all these Buddhist countries like Cambodia, Korea, Japan etc. the true Dharma is almost fading away there and people are not much interested. Instead the other beliefs and materialism is mainly taking a very strong hold. I hope more Bodhisattvas and realised people go there to propagate the true dharma.  I strongly believe that as long as there is one realised being propagating the dharma somewhere, there is going to be a very strong response and benefit for the people eventually. This is because our innate Buddha nature somehow has some kind of recognition when it meets the truth, it is just a matter of degree ...</p>
              <p>May more people gain true realisations and propagate the true Buddhadharma!!!</p>

              <p>In the east, many people simply don't really understand nor practice buddhism as it was meant to be practiced. Just do rituals, prayers, hope for a better rebirth via accruing merits. Then maybe 10000 lifetimes from now, hope they get enlightened. Young people look at this (without bothering to understand what buddhism really is about) and think it's bullshit. Might as well turn to material stuff for comfort now, then believe in other religions where you get one life, then go to some nice place up there.</p>
              <p>In the west, many people after having been born in a much heavier materialism culture realised that using materialism for comfort is also bullshit, and don't think the faith based religions work either. So they look to the great eastern religions.</p>
              <p>Also, I believe a lot of westerners also miss the mark; from what I read online, a lot of people just practice meditation for stress relief, using buddhism more like psychotherapy, mixing and matching whatever appeals to themselves to develop some kind of "personal dharma" etc. But still, true seekers who are into correct practise abound and here's hope that the scene there grows healthily and in the right direction.</p>
