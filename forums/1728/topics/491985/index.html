              sadly becoming one of the main conversion ploys in the country.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>In the nineteenth century, Hindu gurus and Western mystics,
              while examining teachings of the Gospels about non-violence and turning the
              other cheek, came to the conclusion that Jesus must have been a yogi who
              visited India.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>The Ahmadiyya movement : a new nineteenth century sect of Islam
              centered in Kashmir , added much to the idea. They claimed their founder, Mirza
              Gulam Ahmad, was in fact Jesus reborn to fulfill the prophecies of Islam.
              Ahmadiyyas taught that Jesus survived his ordeal on the cross and went to
              Kashmir where he was later buried.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Stories of Jesus in India began popular, with claims of secret
              teachings found in ancient monasteries confirming this, though no such
              documents seem to have ever been verified.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Mysticism in the
              Greco-Roman World</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>There are certainly mystical teachings in early Christianity,
              particularly in unorthodox and syncretic Gnostic sects, that have Vedantic and
              Buddhist affinities. But these can be found in all the literature of the
              Greco-Roman era with its many combinations of mystical teachings from Greece,
              Egypt, Persia and India. The entire Greco-Roman world was exposed to teachings
              from India through an extensive mercantile trade and travel.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Apollonius of Tyana, who also lived in the first century CE, was
              a miracle working mystic like Jesus, famous for having travelled to India to
              study with its great gurus. Some scholars claim that the Jesus and Apollonius
              stories were at times confused. Even the great Neo Platonic philosopher
              Plotinus in the third century CE made an abortive effort to travel to India,
              indicating that the mystical journey to India was a common theme of the
              Greco-Roman world. This means that a yogic influence existed in the mix of
              contemporary teachings that Christianity came out of.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Compounding the issue is the ongoing debate about the
              historicity of Jesus. The Jesus story that mainstream Christianity accepts of
              the four Gospels was not finalized and made authoritative until the fourth
              century. Yet these gospels do not agree as to the timing of the birth of Jesus.
              Actual historical records of the Christians of the first century are limited
              and questionable.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Modern scholarship does not accept the Jesus in India story,
              though it does accept that mystics like Apollonius traveled to India.<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">No
              major Western scholars, religious or not, place Jesus in India during any
              period of his life.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Yogi Jesus as a Conversion
              Ploy</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>To date, no major sect of Christianity outside of India,
              including the Catholic Church, regards the Jesus as a yogi story as more than
              fantasy or heresy.<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box;">However, Christian groups in India do circulate
              the Jesus as yogi story to aid their efforts to convert Hindus.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>In India today, the image of Christ as a yogi is not used by
              Christians to honor the teachings of Yoga. Jesus as a yogi is a new form of
              conversion propaganda employed by those who do not follow Yoga at all, but use
              the story to subvert a deeper questioning of their motives and the biases of
              their theologies.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Missionaries tell uninformed Hindus that Jesus was a yogi or the
              avatar Kalki (a ploy Muslim missionaries use for Mohammed). But they do not
              direct people to honor Yoga teachings or Yoga gurus as well. Rather they say
              that since Christ was a great yogi, you can gain everything spiritually by
              converting to Christianity and do not need the rest of Yoga. They quote Hindu
              gurus praising Jesus but do not praise these gurus or their teachings in turn.
              Some Christian priests in India formally study Yoga or Vedanta, not to follow
              these teachings, but to aid in communication for converting Hindus, using Hindu
              concepts for their advantage, like Jesus as a yogi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>If Christians want to honor the image of Christ as a yogi, let
              them first use it in Rome or in any other major Christian country or church!
              Otherwise it is dishonest. Let them honor Yoga, not simply Jesus, and the Hindu
              background of the Yoga tradition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><strong style="box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Subversion of Hindu
              Practices</span></strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>The Christ as yogi image is combined with an entire range of
              missionary subterfuges. Missionaries take Hindu bhajans to deities like Rama,
              Krishna or Shiva and substitute the name of Jesus. A Christian form of Bharat
              Natyam has been invented, with traditional Hindu dance forms as offerings to
              Jesus. Hindu pillars or stambhas are placed in front of churches in South India
              as if these were types of Hindu temples. Churches perform aratis to Jesus
              rather than the usual Christian rituals. Mother Mary is made to resemble Hindu
              Goddesses in her depictions. Such practices are used to draw people away from
              their Hindu roots and make them receptive to conversion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Rather than affording a greater respect for Hindu and Buddhist
              teachings, the Jesus as a yogi story is sadly becoming one of the main
              conversion ploys in the country.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>We must be very clear about this fact: Regardless of whether
              Jesus was a yogi (which remains debatable) the exclusion and conversion based
              theology and practices of Christianity must be understood along with their
              consequences. The idea of only One True God, church, savior, or scripture, a
              single life for the soul, with sin and salvation to heaven and hell are
              contrary to Yoga philosophy, which aims at Self-realization, a state of unitary
              awareness beyond body and mind, time and space.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif"; color: #555555;'>Unfortunately, when one exposes Christian conversion efforts
              today, some Hindus rush to the defense of the church under the response that
              Jesus was a yogi! They forget to note that whether Jesus was a yogi, the
              churches do not honor or represent the tradition of Yoga. If it is Yoga that
              people want to learn, it will not happen in the churches or by the priests, but
              by true Yoga gurus in the traditions of Sanatana Dharma, which remain abundantly
              available today.</span></p>
