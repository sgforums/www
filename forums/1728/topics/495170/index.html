              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">China's "Buddha-like" youth quietly accept life for
              what it is </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Xinhua|2017-12-28|Editor: Liangyu </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">HEFEI, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- Life's tough for China's younger
              generation. Finding jobs or spouses, and settling down in a sometimes tough and
              cruel world often lend itself to either giving up outright, or detached ironic posturing.
              Many of China's youth of today have opted for the latter and refer to
              themselves as the "Buddha-like" generation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zhang Min, 23, is one of this generation. He is just about to
              graduate and has been informed that he has failed yet another job interview --
              he has already sent out over 60 applications and attended 20 job fairs, but
              they all came to nothing, and he has no choice but to be philosophical.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"[Failure] does not bother me as much as before,"
              Zhang says. "Whatever will be, will be."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The phrase "Buddha-like youth" recently went viral
              after a popular WeChat article used the term to describe China's post-1990s
              generation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Having seen everything and keeping a casual and calm
              mindset toward life and career under mounting social pressure," the article
              wrote, "it's fine to have something or not. There is no need to pursue or
              win anything."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Young Chinese, perhaps ironically, have been quick to label
              themselves as Buddha-like youth. A Buddha-like relationship is, apparently, one
              of forgiveness, never forcing your better half to make changes, and accepting
              things as they are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A Buddha-like career means employees no longer concerning
              themselves with promotion or office politics, but simply getting on with the
              job in hand instead.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But there has been a backlash against the Buddha-like
              mindset, particularly among the older generation. They argue that such an
              approach is one defined by pessimism, indolence and sloth, leading to a reduced
              work ethic, lack of self-motivation and apathetic demeanor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"A rapidly developing China brings about many reforms
              and changes, which inevitably create challenges and great pressure to its
              younger generations, notably in career and life," says Tian Feng, a
              research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "It's understandable
              that such a self-mocking subculture is buzzing on China's internet and
              prevalent among youngsters."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Far awway from her hometown in east China's Anhui Province,
              Li Xiao, 22, works in an architectural design company in Guangzhou, south
              China's Guangdong Province. Last year, she failed the graduate-study admission
              exam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Li had intended to prepare for the exam in her spare time
              after work, but a lot of overtime caught her unguarded. She often gets off work
              at 11 p.m. and is invariably burnt-out.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After taking this year's exam, Li says she has little
              expectation about the result.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"I've tried and participated, that is what counts,"
              she says, sounding every inch a Buddha-like youth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The difficulties faced by the post-1990s generation lead them
              to describe themselves in mocking tones as, "prematurely balding,"
              "monks or nuns," "divorcees," or the "middle-aged
              obese." Though they are nowhere near these things, they certainly feel
              like they are. Life has simply ground them down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Saying 'It's OK,' or 'All right it doesn't matter' is
              just a disguise we put on in the face of the rigors of life," says Zhang
              Li, who works as a product manager in a Beijing-based internet company.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A new product is about to be launched in Zhang's office, and
              she will have to stay in the office until 4 or even 5 a.m.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">She says the Buddha-like generation appear casual about minor
              matters but spare no efforts on things that really matter.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For Zhang Min, Buddha-like job seeking is "preparing for
              the worst outcome but still doing whatever one can to best present oneself in
              front of an employer."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Life itself is hard enough, and we just can't afford to
              make it harder on our own," he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Several days later, he is invited for an interview to teach
              in a high school in east China's Ningbo city, six hours away by train. Without
              hesitation, he books a ticket and starts packing. He does not know if he will
              get the job, but instead resolves to "be Buddhist about it."</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The Buddha-like' mindset helps keep today's young
              people calm and flexible, which better prepares them to take more
              responsibilities in the future," says Xu Hua, professor of the School of
              Sociology and Political Science of Anhui University. "An ambitious,
              competent and responsible young generation is vital to a nation's development.
              We should pay more attention to their needs and create a suitable environment
              for them to prosper."</span></p>
