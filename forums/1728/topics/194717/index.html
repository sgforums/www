            <div class='col-md body'>me also have this (half dream half awake moment) before, especially when one's greatly involve in contemplation, the consciousness wants to go back into the alaya, but part of it wants to stay thinking...but now no more though.<br>remind me of this song by Tang Yong Ling - walking in ban meng ban xing zhi jian... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>the stifled effect is ghost pressing, when we are weak in yang energy, ghost would come and bully ppl. also have before, now no more. and yeah the scientists don't believe saying it's stress. okai no big deal.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see no reason this topic deserves to be closed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yes I agreed, the sleeping times are more difficult to practise mindfulness and it is easy to slip into the 'alaya scenes'. But it is also very important because there is a saying - it is harder to practise in life than in (sitting) meditation, more difficult to practise in sleep than in life, and even more difficult <strong>when death is approaching</strong>. Not exact words but something like that. So if we want to conquer death, we also need to conquer death in sleep. My shi fu taught us certain dharmas that are suitable to be practised during sleep, but it is inappropriate for me to discuss them here. Also 'wu wei fa' doesnt need to be 'cultivated' but only 'sustained' (chi2) - don't need xiu1, only chi2. But my practise is really lousy, so pai seh, I dont have such 'sleeping experience' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Maybe at a more advanced level...<br><br>But I can share what I learnt from others I heard. I have a young friend from my dharma centre however, his cultivation is quite strong and I believe has awakening experiences recently as he hinted in his essays (diary rather - he writes diary entries on his daily practise in living/meditation) and some of them which my teacher asked to be published on magazine. I requested to read some of them. I'll copy a bit here on his experience of Sleeping.<br><br><img src="http://xs101.xs.to/xs101/06235/SleepAwake.JPG"><br><br>Another thing is my dharma teacher mentioned before she could remain lucid throughout her sleep, and she says 'it may be because of her meditation-before-sleep habits'. My shi fu and dharma teacher also mentioned, meditation will allow one to rest very well and be very awake the next day. If we look at the Chinese words 'Shui Jiao', the 'Jiao' is the same as 'Jue', so we should 'Jue Shui', 'mindful sleeping' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> In this way we will be very awake the next day.<br><br>One of our ex-moderator, Namelessness who no longer comes to the forum... who is also highly realised... bcos of his practise he can sleep very little yet isnt tired. He can go 4 days without sleeping, although he does sleep everyday la (a few hours)... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> as due to his busy schedule etc maybe he needs more rest.<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha is known to sleep <strong>only one hour per day</strong>. I believe it is because of his 'mindful sleeping' and his meditation. Sometimes a little meditation can equate to lots of sleep.</div>
