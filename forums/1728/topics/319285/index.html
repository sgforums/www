              <p><span class="postbody"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Four Types People </span> <br> <br> Today's Dhamma Talk is about "Four Types of People" as expounded
              by Lord Buddha to King Pasenadi Kosala of Savatthi, a province in
              India. Lord Buddha in his discourse explained that there are persons
              who go -
              <br> <br> (1) To darkness from darkness.
              <br> <br> (2) To brightness from darkness.
              <br> <br> (3) To darkness from brightness.
              <br> <br> (4) To brightness from brightness
              <br> <br> Lord Buddha further elaborated that:
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Firstly </span>a person is
              born in the lower strata of life, with ugly appearance, poor health,
              with bodily defects such as blindness, deafness, inarticulateness,
              deformation, etc., and has no food to eat, no clothes to wear, no house
              to dwell and no medicine for health. Though born in such a miserable
              state he has no repentance, but indulges in unwholesome activities such
              as killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and taking intoxicants.
              He fails to observe moral purification. Committing such unwholesome
              deeds without repentance, he is no doubt likely to be reborn in the
              nether worlds as in hell, in the animal world or in the ghost worlds.
              Such type of a person is categorized as one who goes to darkness from
              darkness. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Secondly</span>, a person
              is born poor with bodily defects as above. Though born miserable he
              felt repentant and realised that due to his unwholesome activities done
              in the past existence, he was consequently born in such miserable state
              and mended his mental attitudes. He observes morality unbroken, does
              all wholesome activities utmost to his ability, giving meritorious
              danas (generosity), etc. Moreover, he practises wholesome thought,
              speech and actions and totally abstains from killing, stealing, sexual
              misconduct, lying and taking intoxicants. His status gradually rises or
              ascends higher and higher as one living on the ground to sitting on a
              chair, to riding on a horse to riding on an ornamented elephant and
              then on to residing in a fully decorated house. Thus a person who mends
              his ways understandingly is sure to achieve a better kind of existence
              with healthy and wealthy 00 and even may land it the deva worlds. Such
              type of a person is categorized as one who goes to brightness from
              darkness. <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thirdly</span>, a person
              born high of rich parents, endowed with good appearance, health and
              wealth without having to worry about food, clothing, dwelling and
              medicine and leads a luxurious life. Though born fortunate, he lacks
              morality, does not understand the benefits of wholesome thoughts,
              speech and actions and enjoys doing mischievous deeds such as killing,
              stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and taking intoxicants. Moreover, he
              is inconsiderate towards others and never cultivates sympathetic
              feelings. Committing such unwholesome activities throughout his life
              his status falls or descends gradually, from the dwelling in the fully
              decorated house to riding on an ornamented elephant, to riding on a
              horse, to sitting on a chair and then fallen to the ground level. Such
              type of a person is categorized as one who goes to darkness from
              brightness. He is likely to be reborn in the nether world after death.
              <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fourthly</span>, a person
              is born high of rich parents fully endowed with all necessary
              requisites of life as above. Though he enjoys the higher standard of
              living, he is far-sighted, intelligent and realises that his present
              status of richness and amenities of good life is due to his wholesome
              activities of his previous existence. So he carries on the meritorious
              way of giving charity to the needy, practising wholesome thoughts,
              speech and actions observing morality, etc. He abstains from killing,
              stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and taking intoxicants, is
              considerate to others and always cultivates sympathetic feeling towards
              others. Leading such a puritanic way of life, his status ascends or
              rises higher and higher as one living on the ground to sitting on a
              chair, to riding on a horse, to riding on an ornamented elephant and
              then on to residing in a fully decorated house and thus he is sure to
              reborn in the higher deva worlds or at least in the human world at a
              higher influential position. Such type of a person is categorized as
              one who goes to brightness from brightness.
