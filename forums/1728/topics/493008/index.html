              Decline in Dementia Rates Among Seniors</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">Craig Lewis Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2016-11-22 |</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">The
              results of a recently published study carried out at the University of Michigan
              indicate that dementia rates among seniors in the US are falling, with a marked
              decline recorded since 2000.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              research, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, suggests that among
              the key reasons for the improvement is an increase in education, as well as
              improved treatment for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. “Our results add to
              a growing body of evidence that this decline in dementia risk is a real phenomenon,
              and that the expected future growth in the burden of dementia may not be as
              extensive as once thought,” said Prof. Kenneth Langa, a co-author of the new
              study. (BBC)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dementia,
              also known as senility, is a broad umbrella term for brain conditions that
              result in a gradual, long-term decline in memory and cognitive function, the
              most common type of which is Alzheimer's disease, accounting for 50–70 per cent
              of cases. More than one type of dementia may manifest in the same person.
              Common symptoms include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and
              decreased motivation. A formal diagnosis of dementia requires a recorded change
              in a person's mental functioning and a greater decline than would be
              attributable to normal aging.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Comparing
              data samples of more than 21,000 Americans aged over 65 from across the
              country, the researchers found that 11.6 per cent of subjects were diagnosed
              with some form of dementia in 2000, declining to 8.8 percent by 2012. “That’s
              well over a million people who don’t have dementia, who would have had it if
              the rates had stayed the same as 2000 rates,” said John Haaga, director of the
              Division of Behavioral and Social Research at the National Institute on Aging,
              which funded the study. (NPR)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">According
              to the researchers, the fall in dementia occurred despite increases in
              conditions considered risk factors, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and
              obesity, suggesting that improved treatments for these conditions may have been
              a contributing factor. Spending more years in education may also help the brain
              compensate for abnormalities that occur as the body ages. “Our study, along
              with prior studies, supports the notion that ‘cognitive reserve’ resulting from
              early life and lifelong education and cognitive stimulation may be a potent
              strategy for the primary prevention of dementia in both high- and low-income
              countries around the world,” the researchers wrote. (NBC News)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              average amount of education received by the people in the data samples was 11.8
              years in 2000, representing a little less than a full high school education.
              That average had risen to 12.7 years by 2012.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Dr.
              Langa, noted that there was no conclusive explanation yet for why education
              might be such a significant factor. “One [theory] is that education might
              actually change the brain itself,” he said. “We think that it actually creates
              more—and more complicated—connections between the nerve cells so that you're
              able to keep thinking normally later into life.” (NPR)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              findings of the study are supported by similar research in Europe, which found
              that dementia rates had declined in Britain and Spain, and had stabilized in
              other parts of Europe. Prof. Carol Brayne, who participated in the European
              study, said the new research from the US represented compelling further
              evidence of a decline in dementia rates in some countries. “These findings are
              incredibly important for the world and underlie the importance of access to
              education,” she said. “But it is likely to be a combination of risk
              factors—better health from conception, vaccinations, access to education,
              medical care, not smoking—that taken together will have an impact.” (BBC)</span></p>
