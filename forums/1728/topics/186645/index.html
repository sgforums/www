And secondly it is really not for everyone to try healing the others.<br><br>And another thing is, in Buddhism this kind of Blessing/Jia Chi, although can be very effective, is not called 'suffering in place of the other'. Although it is through that sometimes by jia chi if the person karma too strong the person who bless him will become affected, but this is less suffering compared to his suffering.<br><br>It is also possible that I bless you in meditation - by a visualisation process.. which I do not know and I do not practise.
