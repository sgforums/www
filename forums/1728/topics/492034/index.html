              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">A common debate among people in modern times, especially
              among westerners, is that Buddhism is not a religion — but a philosophy or way
              of life. This of course, is something people are divided on and really depends
              on various technicalities in how one defines religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">So what is the argument for Buddhism being a philosophy and
              what is the argument for Buddhism being a religion?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Arguments for Buddhism Being a Philosophy</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Since Buddhism does actually have a clear belief system on
              the afterlife, I would say it is more than a “way of life” or “lifestyle” as
              some people say. However, calling Buddhism a philosophy is pretty accurate. One</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/philosophy?s=t"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">definition of philosophy</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">from Dictionary.com is “the rational
              investigation of the truths and principles of being, knowledge, or conduct.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This is indeed something that fits into Buddhism very snugly.
              The Buddha’s teachings are referred to as the Dhamma (or Dharma in Sanskrit),
              which literally means the ultimate truth or the truth about reality, and the
              Buddha encourages followers to investigate his teachings for themselves. One of
              the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.thedhamma.com/anguttaranikaya.htm"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">six qualities of the Dhamma</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">is described as “Ehipassiko”, meaning
              roughly “encouraging investigation” or “inviting to come and see for
              themselves.” In the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Kalama Sutta</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">, the Buddha states that one should not believe in things
              simply because they hear it, it comes from their masters, is a part of
              tradition, etc.; but to investigate for themselves and if they find that:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #444444;">“... these things are good; these things are
              not blamable; these things are praised by the wise; undertaken and observed,
              these things lead to benefit and happiness, enter on and abide in them”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Not to mention, the Buddha’s teachings emphasized personal
              practice and adhering to moral principles above any kind of dogma. Even in
              regards to the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/pancasila.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Five Precepts</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">, the Buddha doesn’t describe them as divine laws, but as
              practical guidelines to follow for one’s own happiness in</span><a href="http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/2.22-Bala-Pandita-S-m129-piya-proto.pdf"><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">this life and
              the next.</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Although he mentions karmic
              consequences if one chooses to break them, the Buddha provides practical
              benefits to following them also, such as “freedom from danger... animosity...
              suspicion,” etc.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">While the Buddha did discuss some metaphysical aspects of
              reality that people would often associate with religion, he made it clear that
              the most important aspect of Buddhism is how you practice, not what you know. A
              good example can be seen from the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html"><span style=" color: #2e7061;">Cula-Malunkyovada
              Sutta</span></a>, where the monk Venerable Malunkyaputta asks the Buddha a
              series of metaphysical questions such as whether:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #444444;">“The cosmos is eternal,’ ‘The cosmos is not
              eternal,’ ‘The cosmos is finite,’ ‘The cosmos is infinite,’ ‘The soul and the
              body are the same,’ ‘The soul is one thing and the body another...”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Buddha responds to these inquiries by saying that such
              questions are not important and that asking such is like being shot by a poison
              arrow and saying,</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>“I
              won’t have this arrow removed until I know the given name and clan name of the
              man who wounded me.”</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Of course, the logical thing to do would be to go to a doctor
              about the wound rather than wasting precious time asking such questions. So the
              lesson is, knowing such things doesn’t really have a use and it’s a waste of
              time to focus on them, that time could be much better spent developing oneself.</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><br> <strong><br> </strong></span><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>Arguments for
              Buddhism being a Religion</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Buddhism is still considered to be a religion by the majority
              of the public, so clearly there have to be reasons for this also. So what are
              the arguments for Buddhism being a religion? Unless one defines religion as
              having a centralized belief system based on a god or set of gods, which isn’t
              the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/religion"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">definition used by everybody</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">, Buddhism does have religious aspects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As previously mentioned, the Buddha did discuss metaphysical
              aspects of reality that are typically associated with religion. While the
              Buddha stressed this wasn’t as important as the practice, he still mentioned
              them, and they are a part of Buddhist teachings. The most “religious” aspects
              of Buddhism are probably the Buddha’s discussions of the afterlife and the
              various realms of existence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Buddha does mention the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html#arupa"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Thirty-One realms of existence</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">that one can be reborn in after death
              throughout many of his sermons, and references to supernatural beings and the
              other realms can even be seen in his first and most famous discourse, the</span><a href="http://www.buddha-vacana.org/sutta/samyutta/maha/sn56-011.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">. These aspects of Buddhism are often
              times overlooked by those who advocate Buddhism as a philosophy, which is
              understandable since knowing details about the Brahma and Deva worlds isn’t
              particularly useful for most people. Whether you find it useful or not, the
              Buddha did mention them and such details are still parts of Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Buddha also addresses various questions about society
              that can sometimes be seen as being similar to religious questions, such as why
              there are so many differences between people and why the world is so unfair. In
              fact, this very question was asked in the</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.135.nymo.html"><span style=" color: #2e7061;">Cula-kammavibhanga
              Sutta</span></a>, in which the Buddha gives a brief summary of the famous Law
              of Karma to explain the “unfairness” of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Another, not so scriptural, argument for Buddhism being a
              religion is that it’s just easier for everyone if it’s simply classified as
              such. It’s much easier for keepers of religion statistics to classify Buddhism
              as a religion than to ask people what their “religion or philosophy is”. And
              whether or not it is technically a religion, it essentially serves a similar
              purpose to most people in the world as (other) religions like Christianity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There are those who firmly believe Buddhism is a religion and
              those who firmly believe it is a philosophy, some are casual about it; some are
              quite meticulous about it. Believe it or not, I have encountered people who
              actually put in the effort to carefully look for details and technicalities in
              how people talk about Buddhism or how things are run at some Buddhist
              organizations for the sole purpose of preaching about how Buddhism is one or
              the other.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In the end, each side has their own points, and it is a
              legitimate debate with solid arguments both ways depending on how one defines
              religion. However, the lesson of the Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta mentioned earlier
              is that one should focus more on personal practice above any kind of
              superficial concept, or definitive knowledge.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There’s a story I heard in college that would explain this
              point in regards to the religion-philosophy debate quite well. An associate of
              mine told me a story of this staunch nihilist who gave a long speech to a group
              of people about how nothing in the world means anything, ever will mean
              anything, and that there is no point to anything, etc. He was very adamant
              about it, and was quite passionate about his nihilistic views. After he
              finished his tirade, one of his listeners turned to him and replied:</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    color: #222222;'>“Who cares?”</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;"></span></p>

              It all depends on whether a Buddhist practises as a matter of religion or philosophy. It also matters how one is introduced into Buddhism; whether faith based or wisdom based.
                          Also when one is freed from the fetters of attachment to the (wrong) rites and ceremonies, it becomes less religion based.

              Buddhism even within the so called confines of different paths, eg. Theravada(yana?), Mahayana, and Vayjayana, has expediency depending teacher and audience.
              As one practises Buddhism, one's outlook changes and hopefully, one's cravings and attachments reduces and looking back, one's wisdom will rise.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Buddhism reveals the Bodhicitta or Buddhahood of all sentience. One of several metaphors for Bodhicitta used by Buddha Shakyamuni mentioned in the sutra is liken to Cosmos. Cosmos is vastly beyond, present timelessly and everywhere, in body and outside of body, quite similar to bodhicitta because it can't be physically seen, felt, heard, tasted, smelt and intellectually engaged, practically beyond six senses and omnisciently, and also can't claim its non existence. Thus, in this regard, is buddhism a philosophy or religion? Generally, religions are coined as religions because there are "invisible superpower" governing and control, liken to ancient China dynastic era where the Emperor is the superpower, all commoners can only be as lower caste. In philosophy, it is only a few hundred years that based only on a very narrow aspects of perceptions and conducts of human sphere or realm alone. It does not taken into account of animals, ghosts, non living beings, deities, bodhisavatt etc</p></div>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"> <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">One of key tenets in Buddhism is non/not self. Without this realization, one cannot be said to have understood Buddhism. This where Buddhism separates from other beliefs.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">It is without self that dreams are just an arising algamation of experiences, within our minds during sleep. They are just thoughts without emotional attachment. Stored in our memories, it arises in to the forefront of our unwaking consciousness, and contents of it quickly disappears upon waking</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Just as if we had the luxury of watching cloud formations in the sky, each conceptual entity arises in our mind, and the cloud formation changes even as we begin to label it as such.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Maybe I "saw" a rabbit or I "saw" a dog, and yet it is not so now. Did many clouds merge to be a bigger cloud, or has one big cloud "breaks up" into tinier clouds. Does any of it really matter? Be they  a cluster of clouds or simply clouds, simply conceptual thoughts!</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Thus we don't "see" cloud as cloud, but instead,  ascribing our values on what is basically water vapours affected by wind movements.</p>

              <p>exactly. Trying to create confusion amongst buddhism. The lesser strength of true buddhism, the world will gradually enter into severe calamity. Religions wars and different kinds of belief systems will engage in conflicting and people are lack of a good basis to embrace. Buddhism even flourishes also must maintain its humility to benefit even more. Buddhism assists other religions in understanding its religions so as to achieve its desired destination, once buddhism ceased or only within its buddhist community, there will be misunderstanding. In fact, it is better for buddhists community to stay recluse or closed door meditational practice within themselves for the time being owing to many kind of belief systems masquerading as buddhism.</p>
