              <h1>Emptiness / Buddhanature</h1>
              <p class="byline">by Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche</p>
              <p>The Buddhist schools are rich and varied in their perspectives, but
                   these many points of view all advance the Buddhist concept of the 
                  middle view (<em>madhya-drshti</em> in Sanskrit and <em>ume</em><em> tawa</em> in Tibetan).</p>
              <p>The middle view avoids the extremes of eternalism and nihilism. Any 
                  view that does not fall into the parameters of the middle view—in other 
                  words, all views that fall into the extremes of eternalism or 
                  nihilism—are referred to as wrong views in Buddhist literature. The 
                  Buddha and his subsequent followers have called these wrong views 
                  because the nihilistic view minimizes what is there in reality, while 
                  the eternalistic view adds more to reality than
                  what is really there.</p>
              <p>Adherents of all Buddhist schools try to understand everything about 
                  themselves—their consciousness, the material world, sentient life, their
                   karmic inheritance and its history, even rebirth or reincarnation—in 
                  terms of this middle view. In the Mahayana tradition, the establishment 
                  of the middle way is also an aspect of one’s own practice, because the 
                  Buddhist adherent steers a course between the two extremes to cultivate 
                  the two wisdoms: transcendental knowledge (Skt.,
                  <em>prajna</em>) and wisdom/gnosis (Skt., <em>jnana</em>).</p>
              <h2>The 
                  Madhyamaka and Yogacara Schools</h2>
              <p>With the emergence of Mahayana 
                  thought, this middle view was critically examined and taken to highly 
                  refined levels of philosophical sophistication. There were two major 
                  strands of Buddhist thought in the Mahayana: Madhyamaka and Yogacara. 
                  These two schools have had an enormous impact on the cultural, 
                  philosophical and religious landscape of Buddhist thinking in the whole 
                  of Asia, from India to Japan and beyond. Madhyamaka and Yogacara have 
                  produced original and somewhat different (although not necessarily 
                  incompatible) interpretations of the middle view. Their perspective on 
                  how enlightenment is to be attained is also different.</p>
              <p>For the Madhyamikas (or Shunyatavadins), enlightenment is obtained by
                   the practice of the two accumulations, merit and wisdom. In order to 
                  carry out this necessary but difficult task with minimal risk of 
                  deviations and diversions, the practitioner must engage in the six 
                  transcendental actions (Skt., <em>paramitas</em>). From the first four 
                  transcendental actions one accumulates merit, while the last two 
                  transcendental actions lead to the accumulation of wisdom (which 
                  includes both transcendental knowledge and wisdom/gnosis). The reason 
                  for practicing these accumulations is to reduce one’s negative karmic 
                  inheritance and delusional tendencies. As Nagarjuna, the founder of the 
                  Madhyamaka school, continually stated, it is only by developing the 
                  middle view that one can gain an understanding of emptiness (Skt., <em>shunyata</em>),
                   which is ultimate reality itself. This understanding of emptiness is 
                  applied to the rest of the transcendental actions, so that even the 
                  merit that issues forth from one’s practice is seen to be empty of 
                  substance or inherent existence. In other words, it is through the 
                  realization of emptiness that one attains enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The Yogacarins (or Vijnanavadins), on the other hand, advanced a 
                  slightly different perspective on how the two accumulations are to be 
                  realized. For Maitreya and Asanga, the founders of the Yogacara school, 
                  the main concern was establishing buddhanature (Skt., <em>tathagatagarbha</em>)
                   as fact.</p>
              <p>It was their firm belief that the reality of buddhanature was the 
                  foundation upon which all the Mahayana paths and stages were to be 
                  erected. They reasoned that if enlightenment were possible—not just in 
                  principle but as a realizable actuality—then each sentient creature must
                   possess that enlightened nature. It is only due to the presence of 
                  ignorance that sentient creatures have not realized their “existentially
                   intimate” and yet “experientially and cognitively distant” nature.</p>
              <p>The key text that Maitreya and Asanga authored—which is widely used 
                  by followers of the Kagyü and Nyingma traditions of Tibetan Buddhism—is 
                  known as the <em>Mahayanuttaratantra</em> (in one of its shorter names). 
                  Its recurrent theme is the removability of the defilements. These 
                  defilements are all that obscure the innate purity of one’s inherent 
                  buddhanature, which exists in an uncorrupted and incorruptible fashion 
                  within the continuum of one’s being.</p>
              <p>The difference between these two philosophical schools is that the 
                  Madhyamikas see the realization of emptiness as the one uniquely 
                  significant insight, whereas the Yogacarins see the realization of 
                  buddhanature as the very essence of awakening. In the <em>Prajnaparamita</em> sutras,
                  the canonical Mahayana Buddhist sutras upon which Nagarjuna singularly 
                  relied, the subject matter is principally about emptiness. In them, 
                  shunyata is portrayed as the “Mother of all the buddhas,” because 
                  enlightenment arises from the realization of emptiness. According to the
                   Yogacarins, the source of enlightenment is buddhanature, which is pure 
                  and untainted by defilements. However, it is the understanding of 
                  emptiness that allows one to realize this buddhanature.</p>
              <p>There is 
                  very little evidence in Indian literature to suggest that there were any
                   critical exchanges in India between these two prominent Buddhist 
                  philosophical schools. However, after the transplantation of Buddhism to
                   Tibet, matters became wildly different. Rival schools of Tibetan 
                  Buddhist tradition, each claiming to be faithfully following the 
                  preceding Indian schools, engaged in a flurry of scholarly exchanges in 
                  which the concept of buddhanature was subjected to severe critical 
                  discussion.</p>
              <p>These rival schools could not agree on the nature of buddhadharma and
                   its status within the Mahayana teachings as a whole. Their disputes 
                  mainly came down to this: “Is buddhanature to be treated as a definitive
                   teaching, or is it an interpretative teaching that relies on 
                  explanations to reveal itself?” Many latter-day Kagyü masters, for 
                  example, came to accept the teachings on buddhanature as belonging to 
                  the definitive class of Mahayana teachings. Those who followed strictly 
                  Madhyamaka interpretations of emptiness, on the other hand, did not 
                  accept this interpretation. For them, it had pedagogical value only, 
                  something that an individual grows out of as he or she develops a deeper
                   understanding of emptiness. They argued that it is only through 
                  emptiness that all conceptual categories are deconstructed, and that 
                  these conceptual categories include the notion of buddhanature.</p>
              <p>We can see, then, that the Yogacara teachings have had just as much 
                  influence on the development of Kagyü and Nyingma thought as the 
                  Madhyamaka ones, although no Kagyü or Nyingma teacher would consider 
                  him- or herself to be a Yogacarin. What the early and contemporary Kagyü
                   teachers have done is combine the Yogacara teachings on buddhanature 
                  and the Madhyamaka teachings on emptiness.</p>
              <h2>The Rangtong and 
                  Shentong Distinction</h2>
              <p>Further complications regarding the 
                  understanding of buddhanature occurred in Tibet as a result of the 
                  marriage of these two streams of thought within the Kagyü and other 
                  Buddhist schools. This marriage led to the development of the distinctly
                   Tibetan philosophical tradition called the <em>Shentong</em> (“emptiness 
                  of other”) school. The Shentongpas charged those schools that 
                  interpreted the teachings on emptiness as definitive with falling into 
                  the extreme of nihilism. These schools, known in this context as 
                  upholders of <em>Rangtong</em> (“emptiness of itself”), counter-charged 
                  the Shentongpas with falling into the extreme of eternalism.</p>
              <p>It should be noted at this point that many great Kagyü and Nyingma 
                  masters have not arrived at the same conclusion as the Shentongpas 
                  regarding the concept of buddhanature. Rather, they have accepted the 
                  reality of buddhanature while maintaining the Rangtong view of emptiness
                   of itself. Accepting the reality of buddhanature does not mean that one
                   has to accept the Shentong interpretation of emptiness. Shentongpas 
                  regard the nature of mind as empty of defilements but not empty of its 
                  intrinsic nature. The notion of buddhanature, however, does not in 
                  itself imply that mind has any intrinsic nature. Many of the great Kagyü
                   and Nyingma masters, in fact, have interpreted buddhanature to mean 
                  that mind is empty of both the defilements and any kind of inherent 
                  existence.</p>
              <p>The <em>Mahayanuttaratantra</em> itself may yield a conclusion that is 
                  consistent with the Rangtong
                  view of emptiness of itself. A true Shentongpa, if there is such a 
                  person, is seen by Rangtongpas as
                  always being at risk of reifying buddhanature, thus falling into the 
                  extreme of eternalism—a Buddhist heresy. However, for our purposes, we 
                  need not be detained by these different interpretations. Suffice it to 
                  say that the appropriations and intermingling of the Madhyamaka and 
                  Yogacara traditions within Tibetan Buddhism has had a rather complicated
                   and illustrious history. This is not the place to assess and evaluate 
                  the legitimacy of the claims and counter-claims, let alone defend this 
                  or that master’s favored interpretation. Rather, I would like to offer a
                   general outline of buddhanature, with certain inspirations drawn from 
                  the teachings of the mainstream Kagyü
                  tradition.</p>
              <h2>Teachings on Buddhanature</h2>
              <p>The Kagyüpas rely on the <em>Mahayanuttaratantra</em> as the main text 
                  on buddhanature. According to the <em>Uttaratantra</em> (its shorthand 
                  name) we all possess buddhanature. Our true nature is said to be 
                  untainted and not devalued by defilements, delusions, obscurations and 
                  other pollutants. However, buddhanature is obscured by those 
                  defilements, which have their origins in primordial ignorance. As such, 
                  these defilements and obscurations have to be removed. Their removal 
                  will lead to the realization of buddhanature, and the realization of 
                  buddhanature is equated with the attainment of true freedom or 
                  liberation.</p>
              <p>Thus, freedom and determinism are not incompatible in the Buddhist 
                  philosophical tradition. In fact, according to the Buddhist teachings, 
                  freedom is contingent on understanding the prevailing and predetermined 
                  karmic causes and conditions in our lives. An act of freedom is not 
                  regarded as something that occurs in a miraculous fashion, as if our 
                  actions had no antecedent causal conditions. Only by understanding the 
                  governing causes and conditions—which have led to our present state of 
                  bondage in samsara—can we entertain the possibility of achieving true 
                  freedom. If we are to have any real chance of realizing ultimate 
                  freedom, we need to understand how such and such causes and conditions 
                  have contributed to our state of bondage, and we need to understand the 
                  factors that sustain the underlying mechanisms of samsaric imprisonment.
                   According to the teachings on buddhanature, our state of ignorance and 
                  the obscurations that govern our current state of being are
                  caused by distorted thoughts, conflicting emotions and unbridled 
                  instinctual feelings. However, because these things are a product of 
                  causes and conditions, they can be illuminated and renounced. Their 
                  potential removability, combined with the primordial presence of 
                  buddhanature, is what makes liberation possible. In the <em>Uttaratantra</em>,
                   the following three reasons are given for this possibility of 
                  liberation:</p>
              <p><em>The defilements are removable.</em></p>
              <p>Owing to ignorance, we have unconsciously become afflicted by 
                  distorted thoughts, corrupted by conflicting emotions, and led astray by
                   erroneous views and misunderstandings. These various states and 
                  tendencies of the mind supply the necessary materials for the formation 
                  of fairly stable and persistent character traits, personality 
                  structures, self-images and habit patterns. However, although these 
                  deluded states of mind—the source of all of one’s misery and anguish—are
                   persistent, they are not permanent fixtures of one’s dispositional 
                  properties. Therefore, they are removable and can be jettisoned, 
                  provided one engages in the appropriate methods of training.</p>
              <p><em>The remedial qualities and attributes that tend towards 
                  enlightenment are already present.</em></p>
              <p>We have the ability to accomplish the difficult, although not 
                  impossible, task of eradicating undesirable, self-destructive and 
                  degrading states and habits of mind. This is due fundamentally to the 
                  wholesome states of the mind and traits that one can cultivate and 
                  develop by and within oneself. Therefore, we do not need to draw on 
                  divine inspiration in the form of grace. It is evident that liberation 
                  is attained through personal effort and not through the bestowal of 
                  salvation by an ultimate Other.</p>
              <p><em>Buddhanature</em><em> is not different from the nature of a fully 
                  enlightened being.</em></p>
              <p>Our true nature is buddhanature and that buddhanature is the nature 
                  of all sentient beings. Therefore, it is not our nature that separates 
                  sentient beings such as ourselves from the fully enlightened 
                  beings—although there certainly is a temporal gap that separates the 
                  time before and the time after the onset of enlightenment. Since our 
                  true nature is the nature of the buddhas, the temporal divide that 
                  separates these two states can be narrowed for now and completely 
                  bridged in the future.</p>
              <h2>The Conditioned Nature of Mind</h2>
              <p>Heeding the authoritative nature of the <em>Mahayanuttaratantra</em> and other such texts, followers of Mahayana are counselled to become 
                  what they were portended to become in the first place. In a manner of 
                  speaking, buddhanature is the very purpose of one’s life, the destiny 
                  that one is almost necessarily propelled towards—the very <em>raison 
                  d’être</em> of one’s existence. The <em>Uttaratantra</em>, in fact, 
                  suggests that our sense of incompleteness and meaninglessness, our 
                  feelings of emptiness, dissatisfaction and disquiet, our experience of 
                  unhappiness and the litany of other samsaric misfortunes we have, are 
                  all indicators of the stirrings of buddhanature that we must heed and 
                  respond to.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the <em>Uttaratantra</em> elaborates upon the reasons why,
                   as human beings, we fail to achieve our potential, to actualize our 
                  true nature. This temporary failing on our part—which is all that it is 
                  according to the <em>Uttaratantra</em>—is attributable to the conditioned 
                  nature of our minds. Although our own nature is buddhanature, our 
                  thoughts and actions spring not from this unconditioned state but from 
                  the deluded and conditioned nature of our minds. As such, every 
                  physical, verbal and mental act we perform leaves imprints on our 
                  body-mind complex.</p>
              <p>It is worth pointing out that in Buddhism, mind does not refer to 
                  what we normally mean by consciousness, where consciousness is narrowly 
                  defined as that which is opposite to the material or corporeal, and thus
                   of a totally different nature. In Buddhism, mind encompasses the 
                  working of any organism that has input/output functions and responds to 
                  stimuli. In other words, what is mental is the same as what is sentient.
                   (The term <em>sentient</em> covers a broad range of living organisms, 
                  from the microscopic organisms of aquatic life to highly intelligent, 
                  fully realized human beings.) Nothing that sentient beings 
                  experience—either on the conscious sentient level or the unconscious
                  level—vanishes. The resulting imprints influence, mold, shape and color 
                  the subsequent experiences of the individual.</p>
              <p>The Mahayana teachings mention four different imprints, known as 
                  traces and dispositions:</p>
              <p><em>Perceptual traces and dispositions: </em>This means that if we 
                  perceive something through our sensory apparatuses, those experiences 
                  leave imprints on our brain/mind structure. If we perceive a visual 
                  object, even after we stop seeing it in our visual field, that object 
                  will continue to appear to our consciousness. For example, an item of 
                  clothing in a shop window that caught our eye will subsequently appear 
                  to the mind as a mental image. Similarly with audial perceptions, if we 
                  hear music that we enjoy, we will continue to hear that tune played over
                   and over in our mind. Of course, these sensory experiences are not 
                  simply mentally registered; we respond to them in various ways because 
                  of our likes, dislikes, attractions, aversions and so on, thus 
                  inculcating ever more fixed
                  predilections and propensities.</p>
              <p><em>Traces and dispositions of apperception: </em>This means that every
                   experience we have is processed, organized and edited, as it were, by 
                  the self, although the subject may not be conscious of this process at 
                  the time. In other words, there is a self-referential element attached 
                  to most of our experiences, so that the experiences that we have through
                   the self are given certain unique characteristics. In this way, they 
                  become dispositional properties of the self.</p>
              <p><em>Traces and dispositions of conditioned existence: </em>According to
                   Buddhism, particularly Mahayana Buddhism, there are no physical or 
                  mental substances. There are only interacting, mutually interconnected 
                  networks of states and processes, brought about by causes and 
                  conditions. The causes and conditions themselves are not based in any 
                  kind of metaphysical ground. They simply constitute a network of 
                  interacting states and processes. The mind, with its conceptual 
                  categories and schemas, creates our dispositional properties—in 
                  conjunction with the neurochemical activities of the brain, other 
                  psychophysical states and processes, and external sensory stimuli.</p>
              <p><em>Traces and dispositions of homogeneity: </em>This last category 
                  simply means that our imprints will reflect our current state of mind, 
                  as will the future experiences these imprints bring about. For example, 
                  if one has the experience of anger, the imprint of anger will give rise 
                  to future experiences of anger. A similar process will operate with 
                  regard to the wholesome states.</p>
              <h2>The Four Renunciations</h2>
              <p>We can see, then, that to realize our buddhanature we have to deal 
                  with causes and conditions and work with our states of mind with 
                  ever-increasing vigilance, mindfulness and awareness. We have to become 
                  aware of what sort of likes and dislikes we have, what sort of thoughts 
                  we entertain most of the time, what kind of emotional conflicts we 
                  habitually perpetuate, and the manner in which we habitually respond to 
                  various circumstances, situations and events in life. Knowing more about
                   our potential, on the one hand, and the states and propensities that 
                  prevent us from realizing that true 
                  potential, on the other, is what leads to the attainment of true freedom
                   or enlightenment.</p>
              <p>In order to realize our true potential, we have to engage in what are
                   known as the four renunciations. One engages in these practices to 
                  attenuate the forces of habit, so that there will be a marked decrease 
                  in the unwholesome, non-virtuous, dispositional properties and a 
                  corresponding increase in the wholesome and virtuous dispositional 
                  properties.</p>
              <p>The first two renunciations consist of thinking about one’s 
                  unwholesome states of mind, dispositional properties and habit patterns.
                   Having done so, one should make a pledge to oneself, appealing to one’s
                   own more noble nature by saying, “Whatever unwholesome states of mind, 
                  dispositions and propensities that have not yet arisen, I will do 
                  everything to make sure that they will not arise in the future.” By 
                  engaging in pre-emptive measures, such as the cultivation of mindfulness
                   and awareness, one should also do whatever one can to reduce those 
                  unwholesome, non-virtuous states that have already arisen and in so 
                  doing attenuate their force.</p>
              <p>The second two renunciations consist of the positive side. One must 
                  ensure that all of the wholesome states of mind and the virtuous 
                  dispositional states and habit patterns that have not yet arisen <em>will</em> arise in the future. One must also vow to do everything within one’s 
                  power to increase and inculcate those virtuous and wholesome 
                  dispositional properties and habit patterns that have already arisen. By
                   the cultivation of virtues and wholesome qualities and the renunciation
                   of vices and unwholesome qualities, one realizes buddhanature and thus 
                  attains buddhahood.</p>
