              <p>"In the sparsely populated prefecture, many families living in the countryside have no schools in their neighbourhoods and have to send their children to Yushu prefecture to be educated. As a result, the prefecture has a high concentration of schools - 192 - and most of them are boarding schools with 99 per cent of pupils Tibetans. The head of the Red Cross in the prefecture said 70 per cent of the schools in Yushu had collapsed, China National Radio reported. Karsum Nyima, the deputy head of news for the Yushu county television station, said he saw many students trapped under toppled schools that were made of mud and wood but the number of casualties was unclear. In Yushu county, which was the worst hit, at least five primary and secondary schools collapsed, killing many schoolchildren trapped inside. Nyima Gyaltsen, principal of Yushu No3 Primary School, said all 18 single-storey campus buildings had collapsed and many students had no chance to escape. "So far we have pulled out 16 bodies from the rubble - 15 students and one teacher," the principal said. "I'm busy rescuing my students and don't have time to talk." NGO staff who provided financial support to the Tibetan primary school said the death toll could be much higher, as some 2,000 to 3,000 schoolchildren were enrolled there."<br> (source: South China Morning Post)</p>

              <p>BEIJING - EARTHQUAKE survivors say the Tibetan monks helped first, bringing food, pitching tents and digging through rubble after disaster hit far western China a week ago, killing and injuring thousands.</p>
              <p>Now the Buddhist monks who responded first are being pushed out of the disaster area and off of state media - apparently sidelined by Beijing's unease with their heroism and influence.</p>
              <p>Monasteries were given verbal orders this week to recall their monks. Amid hours of coverage for China's national day of mourning on Wednesday, no monks were visible in the official proceedings. sIt was a jarring omission in light of their contributions to the weeklong rescue and relief effort following the quake, which killed 2,064 people and injured more than 12,000 others.</p>
              <p>Tsebtrim, an ethnic Tibetan who works as a translator in Yushu, the county in Qinghai province hit hardest by the April 14 quake, was among thousands left homeless. He said: 'There were these monks from Sichuan's Ganzi who had put up all these tents, 100 tents, in just a couple of hours and they provided drinks and food,' said Tsebtrim, 31, who like many Tibetans has one name. In the days that followed, Tsebtrim saw monks digging through rubble for survivors or bodies, first alone and then with Chinese soldiers. He also saw them handing out food and medicine.</p>
              <p>Chinese military officials said this week nearly all the roughly 12,000 soldiers who rushed to the quake area struggled with altitude sickness and many had trouble communicating with Tibetan survivors. Tibetan-speaking monks, many of whom live in high-altitude areas or frequently make pilgrimages to them, didn't have those problems. They flooded into Yushu within hours, on motorbikes and packed in the back of trucks. On Saturday, they held a cremation ceremony, preparing hundreds of bodies, praying and burning the corpses in a massive trench outside of Yushu.</p>
              <p>Yet state-run broadcasters have given scant attention to their efforts, spotlighting instead the hard work of the military and the People's Armed Police as they delivered tents, water and food, and lifted injured people from cracks of crumbled buildings. -- AP</p>

              <p>It's all about politics. They don't want another case of influential monks leading or assisting in political revolutions like Myanmar, Thailand, Sri Lanka, etc. And it's only a matter of time such a thing happens in China. (Oh and... think of the recent Tibet riots, CCP must have freaked out from that incident and started to fear monks) CCP is paranoid now after the incident. They must be thinking the people are going to make use of this situation to plot something behind them. Rather than helping the people they are seeing the people as a threat.</p>
              <p>It is an unfortunate fact that most governments treat religion as a threat to political stability, which is why there are so many controls on religion by the governments everywhere we see.</p>
              <p>This is the reason why Falungong is banned - it has so many followers that it becomes a political threat in their view. Not that I support Falungong anyway, I think it's a cult.</p>

              <p>I am not sure I agreed to your justification.....just look at it in this perspective....</p>
              <p>the chinese has a history of more than 5000 years......you would think the communist govt would at least accumulate some wisdom from it......power is perpectual in China.... Outsiders who dominate China eventually had been assimulated by the Cultured. That is China Greaterest Defence it is never by FORCE.</p>
              <p>The struggle with Tibet is a lost cause......the chinese Govt will Fail. With one simple rationale......Tibet believe in rebirth of its Buddha. Essentially the struggle will be perpectual........try to containt the struggle forever????</p>

              <p>my view is different, i think tibet will fail... but they may hopefully be able to reach a kind of compromise... not independence, but somekind of freedom to practice their religion... and hopefully build up trust with the chinese 2 generations or so from now...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Earlier on this same thread,  i posted a possible avenue for donating funds thru a centre of Garchen Rinpoche.... clarifications from the centre...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">________________________________________</span></p>
              <p>Clarification on Funds Raising on Yushu Earthquake<br> <br>Dear friends in the mandala,<br> <br>We have received some concerns with regard to the recent fund-raising for Yushu earthquake. On this, we wish to clarify on some areas of concern to set the mind of some:<br> <br>1) Why the Centre’s Account is not used for this Project<br> <br>As Dri Thubten Dargye Ling is registered as a society and not as a charitable organization, it is not authorized to make public fund raising. Therefore, the centre’s bank account cannot be used in this project to avoid any complication as the audited accounts of centre have to be submitted to Registrar of Societies for every financial year. We have supported Rinopche’s project as we really hope to fulfill His Eminence Garchen Rinpoche’s wish to help the people in Yushu and we sincerely wish you can help us in this.<br> <br>2) Why is a POSB Saving Account used in this case?<br> <br>The reason why centre’s bank account is not used is explained as above. The POSB Saving Account is my personal saving account which I am using to give public the convenience to do fund transfer. If any omission is to occur, I will face the karma of misappropriating funds from public. If you are not comfortable to transfer to my account, you can personally donate at the centre or donate via <a href="http://www.tibetaid.org">www.tibetaid.org</a>.<br> <br>3) Why is the centre’s name misspelled in His Eminence’s official letter?<br> <br>The letter is prepared by and sent by Abao Lama (Rinpoche’s attendant) to centre’s email account. Some is questioning whether we are imposing to be another centre called “Dri Thubten Darjey Ling” as the letter spelled the centre’s name as” Dri Thubten Darjey Ling”. If you check the letter carefully, there are also other minor spelling mistakes made in other centres’ name such as the one in Taiwan and in Germany. Public could personally verify if there is another centre with Registrar of Society or verify  the letter with Garchen Institute or His Eminence Garchen Rinpoche. <br> <br>4) How the funds will be sent to Gar Monastery?<br> <br>The current instruction from Abao Lama is to wait for them to pass the money to them when they arrive in Singapore. The rebuilding of the homes is a massive project and a huge sum of money will be required to make any significance. Currently, Gar Monastery is still aiding the victims. Nevetheless, every dollar donate by each of u still makes a difference to their lives.<br> <br>We hope the above clarify any doubt that may have arisen and sincerely hope this will not deter Rinopche’s project.<br> <br> <br>With prayers,<br>Agnes Ong<br>Dri Thubten Dargye Ling</p>

              <p>Yes, this might be the last of the Dalai Lama lines.</p>
              <p>According to him, that doesn't mean of course that he will no longer return.</p>
              <p>But even if he returns and is recognised as the previous dalai lama, he will not be reinstated into the Dalai Lama role again (unless the role is still necessary, which will depend on circumstance).</p>

              <p>If I remembered correctly, Dalai Lama said he will be return (reborn) but may not be in Tibet. He said it depends on the situations.</p>
              <p>Tibet to be independent as a statehood is far from possible. Just hope that they will treat the Tibetans fairly and not 2nd class citizens but we can't expect much from a communist country.</p>
