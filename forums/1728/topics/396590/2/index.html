              <p>Hi Longchen,</p>
              <p>It's interesting that you chose to share this. I always thought such stuff have been dismissed as "New Age" stuff in this forum? :)</p>
              <p>Just to share with forumers:</p>
              <p>What Longchen said above is true, but I need to share that the timeline for the 'lightbody upgrade' is much much much nearer than the 1800 years into the future... at least for those who are ready. :)</p>
              <p>The future that we'll be seeing in this lifetime is going to be very strange, very different and very uncomfortable for many people used to the current way of life, unless we give ourselves a chance to understand more... But most importantly, don't lose your heart for others (people, animals, environment, etc) and don't just focus on self needs in times of crisis, and all will be well. In any case, the world will not end in our lifetime. :)</p>
              <p>For the time being, I just need to highlight that all of us need to control air pollution in our world today, to avoid bigger problems ahead... Things that have no need to be burnt should not be burnt. Following burning rituals or procedures, passed down through history, for reasons believed by people in the past, but actually serve no real purpose, should be refrained, as far as possible. </p>

              <p><br>You have a point, ie. people should start taking actions today, and do their part for the environment now, to avoid even bigger problems later. As for the future, it's everyone's choice how they plan to approach it, but fear is not encouraged, as it doesn't help anything. As I've said earlier, and I've to highlight this: as long as we open our hearts for others (people, animals, environment, etc), all will be well, one way or another.</p>
              <p>As for whether we'll live tomorrow, those who are meant to know will know. Once a person has reached a certain level of spirituality, he/she will know when is his/her time to leave this physical world, so that he/she can do it with preparedness, not fear. :)</p>

              question is 
                      often asked, "Will the world end someday; and if so, when?" 
              Perhaps, we 
                      can get a better perspective by looking at what scientists have 
              discovered. 
                      Out there in the vast universe, changes take place continuously,
               many 
                      of which science has only recently come to learn about. For 
              example, in 
                      1967, scientists detected unusual signals of violent bursts of 
              gamma-ray 
                      radiation caused by titanic explosions at the far edges of the 
              universe. 
                      This was the beginning of our knowledge on the birth of the very
               first 
                      stars. Einstein's Theory of Relativity led to the discovery of 
              black holes 
                      or extremely high energy regions in space which are created when
               stars 
                      die. The current exploration of the planet Mars has found ample 
              evidence 
                      that water - the source of life - was once flowing on the planet
               (New 
                      York Times, June 8, 2004). Yet, today Mars is a dead planet.</em></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> </span> </em></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">
              <p><em>According
               to a 
                      Nobel laureate, religious beliefs were stand-ins for the 
              mysteries that 
                      science is still unable to explain. But, by the time the world 
              ends, who 
                      will be here to unravel the mysteries? The wisdom of Buddhism is
               different; 
                      it addresses the end from the beginning. When will it be the 
              "End of the 
                      World"? Venerable Shen-Kai explains…</em></p>
              <p>The 
              expression "End 
                      of the World" originated from Christianity or religious groups 
              which agree 
                      with the notion that an almighty god created the world. But when
               asked 
                      when the world will end, no one can give a clear answer! They 
              would only 
                      say that the morals of people have deteriorated and disasters 
              are occurring 
                      everywhere, so the world will be destroyed soon and we will then
               see the 
                      end of the world. It is commendable that efforts have been made 
              to use 
                      the potential suffering of the "Three Normal Calamities" to guide
               people 
                      and persuade them to be upright. </p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another 
              unorthodox 
                      version emphasizes the coming of the "Three Periods of the End 
              Kalpa" 
                      and claims that the "End" is already here. This group further 
              persuades 
                      that if one is quick enough to embrace their teachings, one can 
              be saved; 
                      drawing an analogy of "having your name struck off from the Roll
               of Hell 
                      and instead submit an early registration for a place in Heaven."
               Such 
                      an argument is superficially attractive, but is in fact also 
              baseless 
                      and false. In addition to using fear as a means to urge people 
              to believe 
                      in them, the doctrine also contradicts the factual concept of 
              the evolution 
                      of the world, viz. "Formation, Existence, Destruction and Void".
               Therefore, 
                      we should not be erroneous in our belief.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Instead of 
              equating 
                      the planet Earth with the "world", in Buddhism, the term "world"
               goes 
                      beyond the Earth. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When will we
               witness 
                      the "End of the World"? Let us now discuss this topic, which is 
              worthy 
                      of examination and deliberation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">What do we 
              understand 
                      by the term "World"? (In the Chinese language, it comprises 2

                      It is analogous to a grain of sand in the riverbed of the Ganges
               River 
                      and is called the Earth. The "Jambudvipa" mentioned in the 
              Buddhist scriptures 
                      refer to the Earth in which we live. Our earth is one of the 
              many planets 
                      of the "normal chilocosm". To understand the extent of the 
              vastness of 
                      the whole world as described by the Buddha, it is necessary to 
              explain

                      There are many other planets within this world which are 
              incomplete or

              Existing beneath

              Chilocosm 
                      comprises 1,000,000,000 "normal worlds". When the other space 
              systems have 
                      also been taken into account, then the sum of planetary worlds 
              of the 
                      Three Thousand Great Chilocosm becomes innumerable. All of the 
              above constitute 
                      a Buddha's sphere for teaching and guidance. The Buddhist 
              scriptures state 
                      that within the Ten Directions (The ten directions of space, 
              i.e. the 
                      eight points of the compass and the nadir and zenith), there are
               numerous 
                      Buddhas who are "presently speaking the Dharma". In one Buddha's
               sphere 
                      for teaching and guidance there are 1,000,000,000 suns. When 
              there are 
                      innumerable worlds, there are countless suns, and consequently, 
              even more 
                      moons and planets. In the entire universe, the magnitude of 
              planets is 
                      even more incalculable; hence, the Buddha's analogy of the sands
               of the 
                      Ganges River. The sand deposits in India's Ganges River is 
              greater than 
                      all other rivers in the world; hence, Buddha always used this 
              example 
                      whenever he needed to illustrate a large number. In our current 
              space 
                      age, astronomers use the most powerful telescopes to observe 
              space. But 
                      the distance reachable by these means is limited to a few larger
               planets. 
                      As for the stellar systems lying beyond the scope of view, they 
              use the 
                      terms "galaxies" and "Milky Way". In the future when more of the
               stellar 
                      systems are discovered, they will have to use terms such as 
              "galactic 
                      ocean" to describe them more appropriately.</span></p>

                        died. In fact, Buddha has been liberated from birth and death,
               being 
                        non-arising and non-ceasing. When the causality for his

                      In the Three Thousand Great Chilocosm, the 4 evolving stages of 
              "Formation, 
                      Existence, Destruction and Void" will run concurrently, as each

              poisonously 
                        hateful and instinctively murderous. At an instant, the people
               can pick

              not only 
                        strife and fighting, but also cruel injuring and killing. 
              Human life 
                        is worth less than that of ants and insects. At the end of the

              pestilence,

              poisoned with

               their

                        seasonal changes result. Lengthy droughts occur, destroying 
              the harvests. 
                        People suffer from hunger. Even feeding on roots and bark will
               not sustain 
                        life. There is no livestock remaining. People resort to 
              cannibalism. 
                        The duration of such calamity is longer, persisting for 7 
              years, 7 months

                      of all suffering. Meanwhile, the minority of people who have 
              been cultivating 
                      and performing virtuous deeds for aeons of lifetimes are 
              repulsed by the 
                      immoral state of society. They withdraw and live in solitude in 
              the mountains. 
                      They only just manage to escape the calamities and survive. In 
              time, when 
                      people have suffered enough and are seeking deliverance, these 
              survivors 
                      will emerge and return to society. They will advise and 
              encourage whomever 
                      they encounter, so that these people may learn to lead wholesome
               lives 
                      and perform virtuous deeds. As a result, people are inspired to 
              develop 
                      their virtuous minds, conduct and karma, which in turn allows 
              their societies 
                      to once again thrive and prosper. The life-span of human beings 
              will then 
                      begin to increase, lengthening a year per century, until the 
              average person's 
                      life-span reaches 84,000 years. At this point, the cycle repeats
               such 
                      that the human life expectancy decreases again. This marks the 
              beginning 
                      of the shortening life-span phase of the 10th normal kalpa of the
               Existence 
                      Kalpa. At this time, the next Buddha, Maitreya Buddha will come 
              down to 
                      be born into this world.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">After 
              the Existence

              Destruction Kalpa, 
                            there are also 20 normal kalpas. During the 19th normal

                            beings in every world, including the earth world, of the 
              Three Thousand 
                            Great Chilocosm will be the first to be destroyed. Then, 
              through 
                            aeons of kalpas, as a result of the efforts of many

                            Bodhisattvas of the Ten Directions in the Three Periods 
              (past, present 
                            and future) to enlighten sentient beings, all sentient

                            to change their wicked ways and lead virtuous lives 
              instead. When 
                            many sentient beings transmigrate from the six realms of 
              existence 
                            into the human realm and successfully received the 
              guidance, and 
                            when hell has emptied so that there isn't a single 
              sentient being 
                            left there, then the 20th normal kalpa of the Destruction 
              Kalpa starts. 
                            Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva (<img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/dicangpusa.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="59" height="14">) 
                            vowed: "As long as hell is not empty, I shall not become 
              Buddha. 
                            Only when all sentient beings are guided and saved, will I
               attain 
                            supreme enlightenment." One can thus see that the great 
              vow of Ksitigarbha 
                            Bodhisattva can be accomplished. All sentient beings can 
              be guided 
                            and saved, and he will then attain Buddhahood.</span></p>

              of the 
                      past. Some will transmigrate above the 2nd Jhana; some will

              Great 
                      Calamities" occur, destroying all the material worlds. These 
              three calamities 
                      of fire, water and wind will not occur simultaneously, but each 
              will take 
                      its turn. At that time, balance in space will be lost, planets 
              of all 
                      the worlds will leave their orbits, and looking from the earth, 
              one will 
                      see seven suns appear in the sky at the same time. The suns' 
              fiery heat 
                      will burn up all the worlds. The destruction will reach the 
              farthest depths 
                      of the Hell of Ceaseless Suffering, including all the worlds of 
              the Three 
                      Thousand Great Chilocosm World of Desires, and even the 1st

              The worlds 
                      from the 2nd Jhana Plane in the World of Form down through the 
              Hell of

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Next, the 
              Great Wind 
                      Calamity follows. All the worlds below the 3rd Jhana down to the
               Hell 
                      of Ceaseless Suffering will be blown away like dust. All the

               be over 
                      in the passing of a single event. Each event will recur one 
              after another. 
                      First, there will be seven Great Fire Calamities followed by one
               Great 
                      Water Calamity. This sequence of seven Fire and one Water 
              Calamities will 
                      recur seven times, after which the Great Wind Calamity will 
              finally occur. 
                      So altogether, there will be 56 Great Fire Calamities, seven 
              Great Water 
                      Calamities, and one Great Wind Calamity, making a total of 64 
              calamities. 
                      When all the worlds go through the course of these Great 
              Calamities and

              <p>just looking at the current rate of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, as well as the cold spell experienced at the northern hemisphere earlier this year, we all need to stop and pay attention to what Mother Earth is telling us.</p>
              <p>if ever the greenhouse effect crosses a tipping point and all glaciers melt we're done for. sea level rising will flood singapore which is heavily tunnelled for its size. desalination may cause an cooling effect similar to that of the cold ages (read  this somewhere forgotten source).</p>
              <p>here's a good series called Earth 2100 which tries to visualize what might happen to earth by 2100. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNSLxDmMCM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHNSLxDmMCM</a></p>
              <p>anyway in actuality i dun think what's gonna happen is as simple as the series try and depict. it's probably gonna be something sudden which may span only weeks at most and the extent of rebalancing might bring everything close to null.</p>

              <div><br><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The 7.1-magnitude quake, which struck the Yushu County in China has left <span>12,128 </span>injured, of whom 1,<span>424</span> are in critical <span> </span>condition. Hundreds of thousands have been also left homeless in the freezing weather.</span></div>
              <div><br><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">More than 200 lamas from Gongya Monastery, led <span>by </span>Paljin Rinpoche and Pema Rinpoche, rushed from Nangchen to Yushu County on the day of the disaster, trying their very best to aid the victims and families of the deceased. They have been working tirelessly round the clock, at sub-zero temperature, in order to help as many as they could. Food supplies are extremely short at this moment. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Since the Qinghai earthquake, out of great compassion, Paljin Rinpoche has ordered food supplies from Nangchen and Xining to be delivered to the affected areas immediately. He will continue to order these necessities for the survivors to the best of his efforts.<br> <br>We appeal for your kind donation to aid the victims together with Gongya Monastery. <span>Pls kindly let me know by <span>30th</span> April if you wish to contribute - 93258710</span>.ã€€</span></div>

By bearing witness to the harshness of cyclic existence and allowing this to broaden our hearts and minds, may we all be able to extend our effort in meaningful ways, for the sake of both the living and the dead. I offer my deeply heartfelt aspiration that all affected by this calamity will see the swift easing of the pain of separation from those they love.<span>"</span> — The Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje (Source: </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kagyuoffice.org/#earthquake"><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #0066cc; font-family: Arial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.kagyuoffice.org/#earthquake</span></span></a><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">)<br></span></div>

              <p>JIEGU, China — The Buddhist monks stood atop the jagged remains of a vocational school, struggling to move concrete slabs with pickax shovels and bare hands. Suddenly a cry went out: An arm, clearly lifeless, was poking through the debris.</p>

              <div class="articleBody">
              <p>But before the monks could finish their task, a group of Chinese soldiers who had been relaxing on the school grounds sprang to action. They put on their army caps, waved the monks away, and with a video camera for their unit rolling, quickly extricated the body of a young girl.</p>
              <p>The monks stifled their rage and stood below, mumbling a Tibetan prayer for the dead.</p>
              <p>“You won’t see the cameras while we are working,” said one of the monks, Ga Tsai, who with 200 others, had driven from their lamasery in Sichuan Province as soon as they heard about the quake.</p>
              <p>“We want to save lives. They see this tragedy as an opportunity to make propaganda.”</p>
              <p>Since <a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/world/asia/15quake.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">a deadly earthquake</span></span></a> nearly flattened this predominantly Tibetan city early Wednesday, killing at least 1,400 people, <a class="meta-loc" title="More news and information about China." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">China</span></span></a>’s leadership has treated the quake as a dual emergency — a humanitarian crisis almost three miles above sea level in remote Qinghai Province, and a fresh test of the Communist Party’s ability to keep a lid on dissent among restive Tibetans.</p>
              <p>President <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Hu Jintao." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/hu_jintao/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Hu Jintao</span></span></a> cut short a state visit to Brazil <a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/17/world/asia/17quake.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">to fly home and supervise</span></span></a> relief efforts, while Prime Minister <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Wen Jiabao." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/wen_jiabao/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Wen Jiabao</span></span></a> postponed his own planned visit to Indonesia and came to the quake site promising that China’s Han majority would do whatever it could to aid the Tibetans.</p>
              <p>The official state media prominently featured stories of grateful Tibetans receiving food and tents, and search and rescue specialists toiling to reach survivors even as they cope with altitude sickness.</p>
              <p>The relief effort has indeed been impressive. With thousands of soldiers and truckloads of food clogging Jiegu’s streets on Saturday, earth-moving equipment started clearing away toppled buildings from the downtown. More than 600 of the seriously injured have been taken to hospitals in the provincial capital 500 miles away. In recent days, blue tents bearing the Civil Affairs Ministry logo have popped up across the city.</p>
              <p>But despite outward signs of government largess and ethnic unity, the earthquake has exposed stubborn tensions between Beijing and Tibetans, many of whom have long struggled to maintain their autonomy and cultural identity amid a Han-dominated country. Widespread Tibetan rioting against Han rule severely disrupted Beijing’s planning to host the Summer Olympics in 2008, and China has kept Tibet and predominantly ethnically Tibetan regions of China under tight police and military control since then.</p>
              <p>The <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Dalai Lama." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/_dalai_lama/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Dalai Lama</span></span></a>, the Tibetan leader who has not set foot in China since 1959, has issued a formal request to visit the disaster zone. It will most surely be denied.</p>
              <p>Since the <a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/14/world/asia/14quake.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">quake hit</span></span></a> early Wednesday morning, thousands of monks have come to the city, some making a two-day drive from distant corners of a largely Tibetan region that spreads across three adjoining provinces.</p>
              <p>It was the burgundy-robed monks who were among the first to pull people from collapsed buildings. On Saturday at dusk, long after the rescue experts had called it quits, they could be still be seen working the rubble.</p>
              <p>“They are everything to us,” said Oh Zhu Tsai Jia, 57, opening the trunk of his car so a group of young monks could pray over the body of his wife.</p>
              <p>On Saturday morning, the monks ferried 1,400 bodies from the city’s main monastery to a dusty rise overlooking the city.</p>
              <p>There, in two long trenches filled with salvaged wood, they dumped the dead and set cremation pyres ablaze.</p>
              <p>As the fires burned for much of the day, hundreds of mourners sat mutely on a hillside next to the monks, who chanted aloud or quietly counted prayer beads of red coral and turquoise.</p>
              <p>The police and Han officials were conspicuously absent.</p>
              <p>The monastery’s leaders said no one from the local government had included their dead in the official tally although they were careful not to voice any criticism. Many of the younger monks, however, were not as reticent.</p>
              <p>At the No. 3 Primary School, the monks said they had pulled 50 students from collapsed classrooms but when an official came by to ask how many had died, the police offered half that number. “I think they’re afraid to let the world know how bad this earthquake is,” said Gen Ga Ja Ba, a 23-year-old monk.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the most persistent complaints, however, was that many of the official rescue efforts have focused on the city’s larger structures and ignored the mud-brick homes that, with few exceptions, collapsed by the hundreds. Others spoke of skirmishes with the police over bodies, although such accounts could not be verified.</p>

              <p>The other more incendiary criticism heard wherever monks gathered was that soldiers had prevented them from helping in rescue efforts during the first few days after the earthquake.</p>
              <p>Tsairen, a monk, spoke about how he and scores of other monks tussled with soldiers at a collapsed hotel that first night. “We asked why they wouldn’t let us help, and they just ignored us,” said Tsairen, who like some Tibetans, uses only one name.</p>
              <p>Later, he and more than 100 others headed to the vocational school, where the voices of trapped girls could still be heard in the rubble of a collapsed dormitory.</p>
              <p>They said the soldiers blocked them from the pile and later, the chief of their monastery, Ga Tsai, scuffled with a man they described as the county chief.</p>
              <p>“He grabbed me by my robe and dragged me out to the street,” Ga Tsai said.</p>
              <p>In the evening after the soldiers had left the scene, they went to work, eventually pulling out more than a dozen bodies.</p>
              <p>Even if exaggerated, such stories can only work against the government’s efforts to win over Tibetans.</p>
              <p>In recent days, the government has vowed to rebuild Jiegu, which is also known by its Chinese name Yushu, promising to spare no expense. But while many Tibetans expressed gratitude for the relief efforts and the official outpouring of concern, others were less appreciative.</p>
              <p>As an excavator and a bulldozer sifted through the remains of the vocational school dormitory on Saturday, Gong Jin Ba Ji, a 16-year-old student, stood watching.</p>
              <p>A day earlier, she said, the machinery inadvertently tore apart the body of a classmate. She was still waiting for them to recover the body of her older sister.</p>
              <p>“I wish they would work more carefully,” she said numbly. “Maybe they don’t care so much because we are only Tibetans.”</p>

              <p>The other more incendiary criticism heard wherever monks gathered was that soldiers had prevented them from helping in rescue efforts during the first few days after the earthquake.</p>
              <p>Tsairen, a monk, spoke about how he and scores of other monks tussled with soldiers at a collapsed hotel that first night. “We asked why they wouldn’t let us help, and they just ignored us,” said Tsairen, who like some Tibetans, uses only one name.</p>
              <p>Later, he and more than 100 others headed to the vocational school, where the voices of trapped girls could still be heard in the rubble of a collapsed dormitory.</p>
              <p>They said the soldiers blocked them from the pile and later, the chief of their monastery, Ga Tsai, scuffled with a man they described as the county chief.</p>
              <p>“He grabbed me by my robe and dragged me out to the street,” Ga Tsai said.</p>
              <p>In the evening after the soldiers had left the scene, they went to work, eventually pulling out more than a dozen bodies.</p>
              <p>Even if exaggerated, such stories can only work against the government’s efforts to win over Tibetans.</p>
              <p>In recent days, the government has vowed to rebuild Jiegu, which is also known by its Chinese name Yushu, promising to spare no expense. But while many Tibetans expressed gratitude for the relief efforts and the official outpouring of concern, others were less appreciative.</p>
              <p>As an excavator and a bulldozer sifted through the remains of the vocational school dormitory on Saturday, Gong Jin Ba Ji, a 16-year-old student, stood watching.</p>
              <p>A day earlier, she said, the machinery inadvertently tore apart the body of a classmate. She was still waiting for them to recover the body of her older sister.</p>
              <p>“I wish they would work more carefully,” she said numbly. “Maybe they don’t care so much because we are only Tibetans.”</p>

              <p>JIEGU, China — Prime Minister <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Wen Jiabao." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/w/wen_jiabao/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Wen Jiabao</span></span></a> spent Friday in the Tibetan high country, comforting survivors of this week’s devastating earthquake in a prominent display of concern by the country’s Han leadership for one of <a class="meta-loc" title="More news and information about China." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/china/index.html?inline=nyt-geo"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">China</span></span></a>’s most troubled ethnic minorities.</p>
              <p>“No matter whether you are Tibetans or Hans, you are all in one family,” Mr. Wen said during a visit to an orphanage in Yushu Prefecture, a remote area of western China to which he had raced on Thursday after canceling a trip to Indonesia, state news media reported. President <a class="meta-per" title="More articles about Hu Jintao." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/hu_jintao/index.html?inline=nyt-per"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">Hu Jintao</span></span></a> also changed his plans after the quake, cutting short a trip to Brazil.</p>
              <p>The government’s efforts will be closely watched. Although the scope of destruction does not compare with the <a title="More data on this quake, United States Geological Survey" href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqinthenews/2008/us2008ryan/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">2008 earthquake in Sichuan Province</span></span></a>, which killed about 87,000 people, the disaster in Qinghai Province presents a delicate political challenge.</p>
              <p>The government raised the official death toll of this week’s quake to 1,144, from 791 earlier in the day, with many thousands more injured and suffering in the freezing cold at 13,000 feet. Most of those affected are ethnic Tibetans, whose relations with the Chinese government have never been easy.</p>
              <p><a title="Times article" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/world/asia/18china.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #004276;">In 2008, those tensions flared</span></span></a> in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, during deadly rioting that pitted local residents against ethnic Han migrants. Since then, sporadic unrest and crackdowns have occurred across Tibetan areas of the country, Qinghai included, although Jiegu has been relatively quiet.</p>
              <p>At a news conference on Friday in Beijing, government experts seemed at pains to stress that the distribution of relief supplies had been unaffected by ethnic considerations, and that supplies had been handed out solely on the basis of need.</p>
              <p>But there were obvious tensions in the earthquake zone. Many monks said that the army and the police had prevented them from searching for survivors in the first few days after the quake and that the emergency teams that came from other parts of the country worked with a lack of urgency. “We have been digging with our bare hands to save lives,” said Tsewang, a 21-year-old monk who, like some Tibetans, uses only one name. “We are very disappointed in them.”</p>
              <p>For now, people here seem most concerned with survival or recovering loved ones lost beneath the ruins that dot the city. After a day of rescue efforts led by shovel-wielding monks, hundreds of rescuers with heavy machinery began arriving Thursday. They clambered over the remnants of schools, hotels and mud-brick homes looking for signs that some of the hundreds of people still missing might be alive.</p>
              <p>But with time passing and nightfall bringing freezing temperatures, the chances of survival seemed to be dimming, and bodies, wrapped in colorful shrouds, piled up in the city.</p>
              <p>Ger Lai Tan Zeng, a 20-year-old Buddhist monk, was the recorder of the dead, his graceful Tibetan script filling an old datebook. By Friday morning, he estimated that there were 900 bodies spread across the brightly painted pavilion that normally functioned as a seating area for the monks at his monastery. “We’ve been too busy tending the living to count the dead,” he said.</p>
              <p>In one piece of good news, two people, including a 13-year-old girl, were pulled from a toppled three-story hotel here on Friday, witnesses said.</p>
              <p>Relief efforts picked up the pace, with caravans of bottled water and instant noodles arriving, much of it transported from the provincial capital 12 hours away. With desperation mounting among the survivors, the provisions seemed to arrive just in time.</p>
              <p>Still, there were some strained moments. Outside the toppled gate of the municipal government headquarters, several hundred hungry people tried to push their way through a cordon of riot police officers, who tried to assure them that there were tents and food for all. As the crowd’s anger reached a boiling point, the police gave up and allowed them to stream past.</p>
              <p>Conditions remain dire. There is no running water or electricity. Thousands of people are living outdoors; few buildings escaped damage, and the wood-and-mud structures that housed many of the city’s nearly 100,000 residents were particularly vulnerable.</p>
              <p>Several school buildings in town pancaked during the earthquake, once again raising questions about substandard construction. No one seemed to know how many schoolchildren might have died, but there were suggestions that the numbers could reach into the hundreds.</p>
              <p>At the Yushu Ethnic Minority Vocational School, where a section of the girls’ dormitory turned into rubble, teachers said more than 200 students might have been lost. Cheng Guangming, the assistant principal, said he and others pulled out five students, but two later died. “We could only save three,” he said, his voice weary after spending three days watching workers poke at the remains of the three-story building.</p>
              <p><span>(Page 2 of 2)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said the dorm, built 15 years ago, was structurally deficient, but he was reluctant to assign blame. “At the time, everything was built from mud, so we thought it was modern construction,” he said.</p>
              <p>Most of the students came from far-flung corners of the county, a wild region thinly populated by nomads and farmers who scrimp to send their children to school in the city.</p>
              <p>The girls had just finished their morning calisthenics and were washing up or eating breakfast when the quake struck at 7:49 a.m. “A few minutes earlier, and they still would have been outside and alive,” said Luo Na, a teacher.</p>
              <p>All across the city, there were tales of lives saved and lost. He Jie, 23, said a friend and his wife kept calling him from their hair salon in what had been the ground floor of a hotel. On Thursday, however, a fire erupted inside the rubble, probably a crushed gas canister, he said, and by the time rescuers found the couple, they were dead, their charred bodies in an embrace.</p>
              <p>But in another section of the same ruined building, there were signs of life. Just after daybreak on Friday, a man said he heard the voices of friends from deep inside the debris. A crowd gathered to watch while rescue workers with listening devices, sniffer dogs and chain saws picked at the pile. By evening, their work was still not done.</p>
              <p>Halfway up the dusky mountain that overlooks the city, the monks of Jyegu monastery were busy praying for the dead, including eight of their own. The bodies arrived in the trunks of cars, or in one case by the dozens on two flatbed trucks. With 500 monks, the monastery is one of the most cherished in the region, and many residents dropped off bodies so prayers could be said for the required three days of mourning.</p>
              <p>Under normal circumstances, many of the dead would be given sky burials, the traditional Tibetan ritual in which vultures consume the bodies. But Pu Be, the monastery’s chief lama, said the sheer number of corpses made such a ceremony impossible. Instead, he said, there would be a mass cremation on Saturday.</p>
              <p>“This is the unfortunate reality of our situation,” he said.</p>
              <p>A few mourners, however, were determined to give their relatives traditional burials. Qi Min pulled up on a motorcycle to claim the body of his older brother. A group of robed monks gently lashed the body, bent at the waist, to the back of the motorcycle. Then, Mr. Qi drove off.</p>

              <p>The Chinese government, which is run by the Communist Party, has responded to Wednesday's disaster with a heavily-publicized rescue effort. Beijing is eager to show that its growing wealth and strength give it the means to surmount natural disasters that would paralyze other developing nations.</p>
              <p>The thousands of soldiers and rescue workers in orange jump suits carrying out the government rescue and relief effort are joined by hundreds, if not thousands, of Tibetan Buddhist monks in crimson cloaks and jackets. Many</p>
              <p>"We're organizing ourselves. We don't need the government to take care of everything," said Cairang Putso, a 28-year-old local monk who was helping to look for survivors in the mud-and-brick homes that crumpled in the earthquake.</p>
              <p>"It's easier for us to help Tibetan people."</p>
              <p>The monks are part of an unofficial relief effort that has underscored the ethnic and religious politics of this mainly Tibetan area, where many locals resent the central Chinese government and Han Chinese presence.</p>
              <p>"We monks were the first ones on the scene to help people after the earthquake, not the officials and soldiers," said Duojia, a 25-year-old monk from the Gyegu monastery in Yushu.</p>
              <p>"We've done more than the government, because we know our people so well."</p>
              <p>He and hundreds of other monks from the monastery were helping locals identify kin among hundreds of corpses that the monks had helped assemble on a covered platform, while monks seated in front recited Buddhist prayers for the dead.</p>
              <p>Other Tibetans have flocked online, posting mournful poems, calls for solidarity, and images of traditional Tibetan butter lamps on Tibetan-language websites in China. One China portal oriented to Tibetans is publishing only in black and white, to mourn the dead.</p>
              <p>ENDURING POWER OF LAMAS</p>
              <p>Yushu is in a part of Qinghai province, bordering the Tibet Autonomous Region, historically known to Tibetans as Amdo. Many of its inhabitants say they are loyal to the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader who Beijing reviles as a "separatist" for demanding autonomy for his homeland.</p>
              <p>In March 2008, Tibetan areas of Qinghai were among the swathe of western China struck by protests and riots, sometimes involving monks, angry at religious controls and economic policies that they believe are skewed against Tibetan people.</p>
              <p>Many Tibetans are devoted Buddhists, while traditional regional rivalries have given way to a shared sense of culture among younger Tibetans, especially after 2008.</p>
              <p>Some monks have journeyed hundreds of kilometers in buses or crammed on the back of trucks, to help search for bodies, cook food and tend to the dead in Yushu county's ruined main town, Gyegu.</p>
              <p>Some came with shovels and wooden stakes, which were of little help in searching the ruins of larger concrete buildings.</p>
              <p>The volunteer monks avoided any forthrightly political comment, but many said they wanted to show Tibetans and the Chinese government the enduring power of the Tibetan Buddhism and its "lamas," or clergy.</p>
              <p>"This shows that we lamas are not, as the rumors say we are, rioters and troublemakers," Jiumi Jiangcuo, head abbot at the main monastery above town, told Reuters.</p>
              <p>"It's our duty to help people and we must set aside all our own concerns," he told an assembly of monks, many of them in tears.</p>
