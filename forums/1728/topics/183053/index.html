This ascetic had practised austerities for 25 years. The Buddha asked him what he had received for all his labor. The ascetic proudly replied that, now at last, he could cross the river by walking on the water. The Buddha pointed out that this gain was insignificant for all the years of labor, since he could cross the river using a ferry for one penny!</span><br><br>Also see <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Library/Other/Miracles/miracles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Library/Other/Miracles/miracles.html</a> by the same author of the previous articles Buddhism and Science. BTW even Ajahn Brahmavamso also had some psychic powers, because a friend of mine actually visited Ajahn Brahmavamso, and he could penetrate his consciousness and know him directly - even his cultivation and meditation experiences. Alot of Buddhist monks, masters, have these powers. Some of whom happen to be my dharma teachers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> This is no big deal in Buddhism.<br><br>Anyway, attaining such psychic abilities is really also easier than attaining enlightenment. People who have psychic abilities does not necessarily mean they are enlightened.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">[03:35]  not surprise but no big deal<br>[03:35]  in fact i suspect most monks have<br>[03:35]  u mean powers or realisations<br>[03:35]  but if u say those power<br>[03:35]  i actually have a fren who can read mind<br>[03:36]  he is not a buddhist but practice many years of meditation<br>[03:36]  so i am not actually surprise<br>[03:38]  but i am disappointed if he shows such power<br>[03:38]  a monk ever say<br>[03:38]  showing such things for pple to know<br>[03:38]  is no diff from a gal showing underwear for a few coins<br>[03:38]  haha<br>[03:39]  those are refering to ppl who show powers to get money la<br>[03:40]  bhikkhu shouldnt show powers to make a living<br>[03:40]  laity should show also la or make a living out of it<br>[03:40]  *shouldnt<br>[03:40]  even laity also<br>[03:40]  oic<br>[03:41]  its mention to refrain from showing<br>[03:41]  icic..<br>[03:41]  seriously no big deal abt such power after i know taht muslim fren<br>[03:41]  who has mind reading power from meditation<br>[03:41]  muslim fren?<br>[03:41]  meditation?<br>[03:42]  he is a doc in psychology<br>[03:42]  they have a topic in it<br>[03:43]  like..?<br>[03:44]  meditation<br>[03:44]  oh... icic<br>[03:44]  but they refer it calling reaching alpha stage of mind<br>[03:44]  which is similar to sleeping<br>[03:44]  icic..<br>[03:44]  he say among his fren in that course<br>[03:44]  after knowing the method<br>[03:44]  abt 1/4 of it have similar power<br>[03:45]  oh haha<br>[03:45]  after certain years<br>[03:45]  oic..<br>[03:45]  thats alot<br>[03:45]  so seriously after seeing him make me realise its just that we din put enough time and effort<br>[03:45]  that why we are so amazed by it</span><br><br>Again, miracles and siddhis are just a small part of the NATURAL that has just yet been discovered or explained by modern science. But it can be realised in meditation.</div></blockquote><blockquote><strong>If people can levitate, modern scientists would name it an 'Anomoly', because they cannot explain it. There is so much anomolies in the world but textbooks are not rewritten. Modern science has sought so much about the 'outside' but forsaken the 'within'. Thats why it will never be able to explain such phenomena any time soon. I dont know about other yogis, but I am sure Buddhist monks wont bother proving these abilities to anyone. But if you are close to them you will realise it eventually. If you are fortunate enough to meet someone who has such abilities, maybe one day you'll be convinced yourself. I am fully convinced but no matter what I say, I'm afraid you wont believe it until you see for yourself.<br><br>The point is - whether or not you believe in these things, its really unimportant. So what if you have these powers? So what if you dont? Does having such powers make you any more wiser or enlightened?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Kalama Sutra<br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha</span></strong></blockquote><blockquote><br>Buddhists do <strong>not</strong> see it as an anomaly, but scientists would.<br><br>There is an interesting website in my bookmarks, it gives many sound account of various human abilities that are widely known as paranormal. There is also a levitating chapter. Many other chapters are equally interesting.<br><br>Many are those who practise meditation for many years. But of course, they are not Buddhist, mostly the indian yogis, because it is against Buddhist laws to demonstrate it.<br><br><a href="http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze8a.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazingabilities.com/amaze8a.html</a><br><br>And although I have not personally seen levitating feats, I have seen and heard many examples. Of course it is up to you to believe or not.<br><br>I will stop discussing regarding levitation and other 'paranormal feats' because this discussion is not worthy to discuss <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> A buddhist forum shouldn't promote too much interest in the 'paranormal' and 'psychic abilities' stuff. I have already presented you enough info in many previous posts for you to decide yourself. Whether you believe it is fine and there is only so much the internet can show.. you have to meet one of those people yourself. I do not need to convince anyone of anything at all.</blockquote></div>

My taiwan teacher warned ppl who practise reiki (i tink reiki? not too sure) not to anyhow heal people.. (ppl who practise it can heal ppl's illness) bcos sometimes, you will get into trouble with spirits. If it is the spirit's intention to make someone sick and seriously ill to seek revenge, and you try to heal that person, u will be in direct confrontation with the spirit. Ppl with no wisdom and a little supernatural abilities will then innocently be in for a lot of trouble.</span></div>
