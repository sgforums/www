              <p><strong>Is there a way to control and tame the thoughts ?</strong></p>
              <p>Well, this is a very good question. To talk of the method is easy, to do is difficult. As said by many masters, there is no way to stop the thoughts from appearing unless one is in jhana. But to control and tame the thoughts once it has manifested and appeared is possible.The secret to this is mindfulness. With good mindfulness, thoughts will be easliy seen and known and immediately identified as wholesome or unwholesome. If it is identified as unwholesome, then using concentration, investigate the thought, looking directly upon it, establish it as the centre of your concentration, somewhat like directing a ray of light using a mirror onto a point. The unwholesome thought being the point, your concentration being the light, the mirror being your mind. Understand from which of the 3 poisons it stems from. Which of the 3 poisong produced the intention of the thought. Once identified, forget abt whether it is wholesome or unwholesome or which poison came from. Just concentrate on objectifying that thought as what it really is, which is just a passing phenomena in your mind that has nothing to do with you and just watch it, it should automatically dissolve away without remainder. </p>
              <p>An important thing is that do not give rise to secondary unwholsome thoughts of remorse during the process, such as thoughts that you are a really defiled and lousy practitioner. As
                  long as one has not reached a mind state similar to that of an arahant, one will still have unwholsome thoughts so just do your best. The important thing is to never give up the fight against your defilements. If you never give up, one day you will reach there.</p>
              <p>Another thing is that if you find yourself being confused during the process when directing your concentration to investigating your thoughts, it means that your concentration is lacking. If that is the case, it is no problem, just practice more samatha meditation. Your skill would improve. Although the process seems rather long here, it actually happens quite fast depending on skill of your concentration and the heaviness of feelings and poisons associated with the thought. If during the process, you find yourself being sucked into the unwholesome thoughts and feelings, it also means your concentration is lacking, means more meditation practice at the cushion. If you find yourself unable to objectify the thoughts and feelings, then more practice is needed on the meditation cushion too.</p>
              <p>I must apologise for my rudimentary explanation for I am also a beginner myself and might have made some mistakes explaining the method along the way. Please find a good teacher and consult them!! This question is at the heart of Buddhist practice.</p>
              <p><strong>Is it evil thoughts will create less bad karma than
                                          evil actions ?</strong></p>
              <p>Yes that is true. The karma created of the thoughts will be dependent on the weight of the thoughts. To give an example of what I mean by weight of thoughts, bliss and joy give you a refined, light feeling. Thoughts of anger, hatred and greed give you a crude, hard, heavy feeling. The greater the feeling of anger, hatred and greed associated with the thought, the heavier the thought. You just have to feel yourself to know how "bad" or weight a karma your have created. To initiate an action based on evil thoughts would require allowing the evil thoughts and intentions to perpetuate and generate more evil thoughts and intentions, so of course, the karma will be more heavy.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps :)</p>

              <p>Don't try to control thoughts. It won't work. It will just create more thoughts.</p>
              <p>Instead, just watch the thoughts. If you watch it and stop chasing after thoughts, that's enough, the thoughts will subside on its own.</p>
              <p>But if you are not aware of your thoughts, then it's dangerous and will lead to karma.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the replies. It is only recently that I knew evil thoughts will create bad karma. All along, I thought it is ok to have evil thoughts as long as I do not put them into actions.</p>
              <p>I justify my evil thoughts by thinking it is normal to have because I am not enlightened yet.</p>
              <p>After knowing about the bad karma, I am more concious about my thoughts. I will try those methods that you guys mentioned. I will not let the evil thoughts run wild like what they did in the past.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I find one method is quite useful. when you are angry, asks why are you angry with? are you angry with the person or the issue? if it is the person you are angry with, asks yourself if you are angry with his brain, mind, hair or head, arms, hands, legs, body, ankle etc. by the time you asked yourself this questions, your anger may subside.</p></div>

              <p>Bad thoughts somehow run on its own on autopilot.</p>
              <p>Good thoughts need effort to sustain..</p>
              <p>Why I don't know.</p>
              <p>But to control your thoughts, I think identifying them helps. Think on your thoughts, and try to categorise them, as to its genre, or trait, so as to name them. Next time when you are lost in angry thoughts, think who's talking. Try and identify that thought and lable it. E.g. Angie for angry thoughts, Kenevil for evil thoughts, and then watch out for them. Thoughts are shy, they tend to disappear when you look out for them.</p>
              <p>You cannot stop your thoughts, you may do so for a few millli-seconds, but then you need thoughts to practice that.</p>
              <p>So what do you do with thought control?</p>
              <p>Control what you think. Thats why a hobby or a vocation is very helpful.</p>

              <p>When you practice self inquiry, you ask, who am I? Am I my thoughts? No. (you don't have to verbalize the self inquiry process, it's more of an intuitive realisation)</p>
              <p>Eventually you see how the thoughts and body and mind just does its own thing, and you aren't any of it, you stop identifying with the thought and body and mind.</p>
              <p>They're just impersonal happenings in vast aware space. You are that space. That transpersonal witness that has no stake in whether the mind-body lives or dies.</p>
              <p>Then angry thoughts no longer have a hold, since you don't identify with any of those thoughts. Whatever thoughts, they just come and go on its own. Not you, not yours. You will also not be impelled to control thoughts. You realise that thoughts are not you and not yours to control. There is no controller.</p>
              <p>But also, this is not yet the non-dual level, since there is a subtle duality between Witness and witnessed. However, this practice can be like a groundwork for nondual experience later.</p>
              <p>When you practice being the awareness, the witness, then you stop identifying with your mind-made, story based 'small self', or any part of the body mind as 'self'. When you don't identify with your ego-self, you no longer get drawn into ego-based dramas and emotions.</p>

               Wei Wu Wei<br> <br> Why are we so unhappy? Because not everything goes our way. Because we
              dread doing the things we don't want to do, but have to do. And we
              can't do many things we want to do. All this boils down to the fact
              that we feel we are a person with desires that conflict with our
              circumstances and our responsibilities. In other words our 'volition'
              is not always in line with what is happening or what should be done. An
              understanding of what-we-are and what the mind is can free us from this
              false sense of volition and remove the burden of our responsibilities.
              Then, we actually will be happy. Without even trying!<br>  <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. You are not the
              mind.</span> <br> <br> We have been taught that the mind is ourself, thinking.<br> <br> We cannot be the mind because we are what is perceiving the mind. Look
              for yourself right now! You are looking at thoughts from a higher
              (prior) level. We cannot perceive ourself just as our eye cannot see
              itself because it is what is looking. The mind cannot be ourself. The
              Chinese Ch'an master Hsi Yun (Huang Po) said, "A perception cannot
              perceive." So, are you the perceptions (thoughts and feelings) or what
              is perceiving them?<br> <br> We feel we are the mind because of the way the mind itself works. The
              mind understands things by comparing perceptions and creating objective
              concepts of them so it can compare one concept with another. This is
              knowledge. Naturally, it soon creates a concept of itself as 'me' and
              there the trouble begins. Thus, the mind associates the sense of 'me'
              with its operation and with the body and we believe and feel we are an
              individual, thinking, acting entity. This is the origin of all our
              suffering. Once we feel we are an individual we begin to see and
              evaluate everything as it relates to us as an individual. We become a
              thing in a universe of things. A very small, vulnerable, but supremely
              important (at least to ourself) individual, in a vast, infinite,
              seemingly purposeless, uncaring cosmos. We lose our original, true
              sense of identity with the Absolute.<br>  <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. The mind goes
              its own way</span> <br> <br> By watching our thoughts over a period of time, we can see that the
              mind is operating literally 'by itself '. Thoughts 'just appear' and
              keep on appearing automatically. We have this feeling that it is 'me'
              who is thinking, but this is just a conditioned reflex caused by the
              concept of ourself as an individual. By watching thoughts we can see
              how they appear unbidden, uncalled. Just try not thinking for a even a
              few seconds and see that it is impossible. No 'me' is controlling them.
              We may have the illusion of purposely thinking about a particular
              subject, but notice that the idea to purposely think about something
              comes by itself. Then we do it, automatically, but with the false
              feeling we are the 'decider'. That feeling of being the 'decider' is
              not us, it belongs to the mind. It is something we are perceiving.<br> <br> This is not proven in just a few minutes of thought watching. It often
              takes many months of diligent watching to really see it and to be
              convinced. This is because the conditioned feeling of being the
              'thinker' is so deep that the very idea that the mind goes its own way
              seems ridiculous. But the payoff of this single discovery is enormous
              in terms of liberation and deeper understanding of ourselves and the
              universe.<br> <br> The very idea that the mind is operating by itself is unacceptable for
              most people because it seems to remove the control of the mind from the
              individual and allows the individual to cease accepting responsibility
              for his actions. Then they will do all the 'bad' things they want. This
              is a valid reason from the point of view of an 'individual'. Actually,
              because the mind conceives of itself as an individual, it uses this
              fear of harm to itself or reward for itself as a form of inhibition to
              keep from doing things that would be 'wrong' (ultimately harmful to it
              or to its image of itself). However, this is not you, it is the mind
              regulating itself. This is where feelings of bondage and frustration
              come from. Because the mind conceives of itself as an individual, it
              accumulates conflicting needs and desires. The purpose is not just to
              release the inhibitions that keep us under control, but to dissolve the
              mind's illusion of itself as an individual in charge of and identified
              with the mind. That will, at the same time begin to dissolve the
              inhibitions as well as the need for them because the conflicting needs
              and desires will go with the illusory self!<br>  <br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. You are not the
              doer. </span><br> <br> You have never done anything! Because the mind has conceived itself to
              be an individual it also conceives of itself as the Thinker and also
              the 'Actor' or 'Doer'. Yet it is not anyone. The mind is not a 'thing'
              or entity but a process. The thinking process. Simply a process that is
              happening automatically, the same as the heart is beating
              automatically. This is why we cannot live the perfect life even though
              we have been taught how a 'good' person should act. We know we
              shouldn't get angry at our spouse or our children whom we love, but
              despite the greatest resolve, we still do. Why? Because we are not the
              thinker of our thoughts nor the doer of our actions. Because they are
              not our thoughts or our actions. We are not even the experiencer of the
              experience. What are we? We are what is perceiving the mind and that is
              not anyone.<br> <br> We are what is perceiving the doing, but we are not the doer. We never
              were. We have never done the bad things and we have never done the good
              things either. Thoughts are affected by the environment (such as this
              article), inner habits and tendencies, and by the mind's concept of a
              'me', but not by any actual 'me'. We are incapable of interfering with
              the mind. Why? Because there is no one to interfere. We aren't anyone.
              Thus, we absolutely cannot have any volition. The concept of being an
              individual is an invention of the mind itself. It is an artifact of the
              way the mind works. The feeling of volition is an illusion spawned by
              this concept of 'me'.<br> <br> We can never find our own will (volition) in any action. Every so
              called action is actually an automatic re-action of the mind with an
              accompanying feeling of volition. It is not 'me', it is the mind
              automatically going its own way! Simply watch the mind. Be aware of it.
              That's all that can be done because that is all we are doing right now.
              That is all we ever do. That is all we have ever done. It is the mind
              that thinks and feels otherwise and we are what is aware of what the
              mind thinks and feels. We are perfectly open, empty and still. We are
              not in space or time. We can never be affected in any way. We have no
              needs or desires whatever. We just shine brilliantly, effortlessly.<br> <br> We are what perceives what is appearing. In fact, it is because of this
              perceiving that anything at all appears. What we are is the beingness
              of what appears. The isness, or the am-ness, if you will of the very
              sense of 'I am'. Another way to put it is that we are the Awareness in
              which everything appears (the here-now, the sense of presence,
              consciousness). See that we are simply and only the awareness of the
              mind while it goes its own way. Every sensation and feeling it has
              belongs to it, to manifestation…not to ourself. With everything that 
              appears in any way, we can say
              'Not me, not me.'<br> <br> We are the Watcher, or better yet the Watch<span style="font-style: italic;">ing</span>, not the
              thinker, or the
              doer, or the experiencer.<br> <br> Once this is deeply and completely understood, the mind can let go of
              its sense of volition and its sense of being an individual, relax and
              just be. Everything happens by itself. Everything happens as it should.
              Everything happens as it must.<br></p>
              <div style="text-align: left;">When the mind lets go
              of its sense
              of self and volition there is the deepest sense of complete peace and
              fulfillment. It is the Bliss spoken of by the ancient masters. All fear
              disappears.</div>
              <p><br> We are now looking from our true Source (as we always were but didn't
              realize) the timeless, spaceless Absolute. The unmanifest. This is what
              we all are. This is the ultimate source of our light of awareness. We
              are perceiving the manifest from its source, the unmanifest and it
              unfolds spacially and temporally as it eternally IS.<br> <br> END<br> Copyright © 1993,

              <p>I find one method is quite useful. when you are angry, asks why are you angry with? are you angry with the person or the issue? if it is the person you are angry with, asks yourself if you are angry with his brain, mind, hair or head, arms, hands, legs, body, ankle etc. by the time you asked yourself this questions, your anger may subside.</p>

Because not everything goes our way. Because we dread doing the things we don't want to do, but have to do. And we can't do many things we want to do. All this boils down to the fact that we feel we are a person with desires that conflict with our circumstances and our responsibilities. In other words our 'volition' is not always in line with what is happening or what should be done. An understanding of what-we-are and what the mind is can free us from this false sense of volition and remove the burden of our responsibilities. Then, we actually will be happy. Without even trying!<br> <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. You are not the mind.</span><br><br>We have been taught that the mind is ourself, thinking.<br><br>We cannot be the mind because we are what is perceiving the mind. Look for yourself right now! You are looking at thoughts from a higher (prior) level. We cannot perceive ourself just as our eye cannot see itself because it is what is looking. The mind cannot be ourself. The Chinese Ch'an master Hsi Yun (Huang Po) said, "A perception cannot perceive." So, are you the perceptions (thoughts and feelings) or what is perceiving them?<br><br>We feel we are the mind because of the way the mind itself works. The mind understands things by comparing perceptions and creating objective concepts of them so it can compare one concept with another. This is knowledge. Naturally, it soon creates a concept of itself as 'me' and there the trouble begins. Thus, the mind associates the sense of 'me' with its operation and with the body and we believe and feel we are an individual, thinking, acting entity. This is the origin of all our suffering. Once we feel we are an individual we begin to see and evaluate everything as it relates to us as an individual. We become a thing in a universe of things. A very small, vulnerable, but supremely important (at least to ourself) individual, in a vast, infinite, seemingly purposeless, uncaring cosmos. We lose our original, true sense of identity with the Absolute.<br> <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. The mind goes its own way</span><br><br>By watching our thoughts over a period of time, we can see that the mind is operating literally 'by itself '. Thoughts 'just appear' and keep on appearing automatically. We have this feeling that it is 'me' who is thinking, but this is just a conditioned reflex caused by the concept of ourself as an individual. By watching thoughts we can see how they appear unbidden, uncalled. Just try not thinking for a even a few seconds and see that it is impossible. No 'me' is controlling them. We may have the illusion of purposely thinking about a particular subject, but notice that the idea to purposely think about something comes by itself. Then we do it, automatically, but with the false feeling we are the 'decider'. That feeling of being the 'decider' is not us, it belongs to the mind. It is something we are perceiving.<br><br>This is not proven in just a few minutes of thought watching. It often takes many months of diligent watching to really see it and to be convinced. This is because the conditioned feeling of being the 'thinker' is so deep that the very idea that the mind goes its own way seems ridiculous. But the payoff of this single discovery is enormous in terms of liberation and deeper understanding of ourselves and the universe.<br><br>The very idea that the mind is operating by itself is unacceptable for most people because it seems to remove the control of the mind from the individual and allows the individual to cease accepting responsibility for his actions. Then they will do all the 'bad' things they want. This is a valid reason from the point of view of an 'individual'. Actually, because the mind conceives of itself as an individual, it uses this fear of harm to itself or reward for itself as a form of inhibition to keep from doing things that would be 'wrong' (ultimately harmful to it or to its image of itself). However, this is not you, it is the mind regulating itself. This is where feelings of bondage and frustration come from. Because the mind conceives of itself as an individual, it accumulates conflicting needs and desires. The purpose is not just to release the inhibitions that keep us under control, but to dissolve the mind's illusion of itself as an individual in charge of and identified with the mind. That will, at the same time begin to dissolve the inhibitions as well as the need for them because the conflicting needs and desires will go with the illusory self!<br> <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">3. You are not the doer.</span><br><br>You have never done anything! Because the mind has conceived itself to be an individual it also conceives of itself as the Thinker and also the 'Actor' or 'Doer'. Yet it is not anyone. The mind is not a 'thing' or entity but a process. The thinking process. Simply a process that is happening automatically, the same as the heart is beating automatically. This is why we cannot live the perfect life even though we have been taught how a 'good' person should act. We know we shouldn't get angry at our spouse or our children whom we love, but despite the greatest resolve, we still do. Why? Because we are not the thinker of our thoughts nor the doer of our actions. Because they are not our thoughts or our actions. We are not even the experiencer of the experience. What are we? We are what is perceiving the mind and that is not anyone.<br><br>We are what is perceiving the doing, but we are not the doer. We never were. We have never done the bad things and we have never done the good things either. Thoughts are affected by the environment (such as this article), inner habits and tendencies, and by the mind's concept of a 'me', but not by any actual 'me'. We are incapable of interfering with the mind. Why? Because there is no one to interfere. We aren't anyone. Thus, we absolutely cannot have any volition. The concept of being an individual is an invention of the mind itself. It is an artifact of the way the mind works. The feeling of volition is an illusion spawned by this concept of 'me'.<br><br>We can never find our own will (volition) in any action. Every so called action is actually an automatic re-action of the mind with an accompanying feeling of volition. It is not 'me', it is the mind automatically going its own way! Simply watch the mind. Be aware of it. That's all that can be done because that is all we are doing right now. That is all we ever do. That is all we have ever done. It is the mind that thinks and feels otherwise and we are what is aware of what the mind thinks and feels. We are perfectly open, empty and still. We are not in space or time. We can never be affected in any way. We have no needs or desires whatever. We just shine brilliantly, effortlessly.<br><br>We are what perceives what is appearing. In fact, it is because of this perceiving that anything at all appears. What we are is the beingness of what appears. The isness, or the am-ness, if you will of the very sense of 'I am'. Another way to put it is that we are the Awareness in which everything appears (the here-now, the sense of presence, consciousness). See that we are simply and only the awareness of the mind while it goes its own way. Every sensation and feeling it has belongs to it, to manifestation…not to ourself. With everything that appears in any way, we can say 'Not me, not me.'<br><br>We are the Watcher, or better yet the Watch<span style="font-style: italic;">ing</span>, not the thinker, or the doer, or the experiencer.<br><br>Once this is deeply and completely understood, the mind can let go of its sense of volition and its sense of being an individual, relax and just be. Everything happens by itself. Everything happens as it should. Everything happens as it must.</p>
              <div style="text-align: left;">When the mind lets go of its sense of self and volition there is the deepest sense of complete peace and fulfillment. It is the Bliss spoken of by the ancient masters. All fear disappears.</div>
              <p><br>We are now looking from our true Source (as we always were but didn't realize) the timeless, spaceless Absolute. The unmanifest. This is what we all are. This is the ultimate source of our light of awareness. We are perceiving the manifest from its source, the unmanifest and it unfolds spacially and temporally as it eternally IS.<br><br>END<br>Copyright © 1993, 2007 by Galen Sharp  <br><br>Learn more about Wei Wu Wei whose real name was Terence Gray at <span style="font-style: italic;">The 'Wei Wu Wei'  Archives:</span>  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.weiwuwei.8k.com/">http://www.weiwuwei.8k.com/</a><br><br><br>                                                     <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.galensharp.com/GSAuthor.html#Top">Return to top</a></p>

              <p>Guilt is a western teaching, especially Christianity, and is not really emphasized in Buddhism. In Buddhism however, we do teach repentance of our mistakes, which can lighten our karma and prevent future bad karma (future mistakes). However to dwell in guilt of the past is counterproductive. In Buddhism it is important not to dwell on the past, present, and future. Not to dwell on thoughts of good and bad. Everyone has made mistakes, it's important not to dwell.</p>
              <p>Next is, thoughts that are left to self-liberate on its own will not be a cause for future births. It is like drawing on water, appearance vividly appearing but leaving no trace, self-liberate as it arises. However for ordinary beings, this is often not the case.</p>
              <p>As Guru Padmasambhava says:</p>
              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/self-liberation-through-seeing-with.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/self-liberation-through-seeing-with.html</a></p>
              <p><br>If you understand (intrinsic awareness), all of your merits and sins
                       will be liberated into their own condition.<br>But if you do not 
                      understand it, any virtuous or vicious deeds that you commit<br>will 
                      accumulate as karma leading to transmigration in heavenly rebirth or to 
                      rebirth in the evil destinies respectively.<br>But if you understand 
                      this empty primal awareness, which is your own mind,<br>the consequences
                       of merit and of sin will never come to be realized,<br>just as a spring
                       cannot originate in the empty sky.<br>In the state of emptiness itself,
                       the object of merit or of sin is not even created.<br>Therefore, your 
                      own manifest self-awareness comes to see everything nakedly.<br>This 
                      self-liberation through seeing with naked awareness is of such great 
                      profundity,<br>and, this being so; you should become intimately 
                      acquainted with self-awareness.<br>Profoundly sealed!</p>

              <p>Dear Dawnfirstlight,</p>
              <p>Yup, as Isis mentioned, these evil thoughts come and go as influenced by cause and conditions. However, if your mind latches onto these thoughts and proliferate it, continue it, giving it more energy, then that is volition, which creates more karma.</p>
              <p>For example, someone bullies you and start to think, how can this guy bully me like this( this is the first thought, still not very bad but notice the ignorance here? who is 'me'?). Then you plot revenge thinking I will get back at him for this! (notice the anger involved here..this is already proliferating the first thought). Then you start to search through your arsenal of methods to plot revenge (more proliferation, as anger and ill-will increases). Thus, if you are good, you realise the problem with the first thought and see through it and it's energy is naturally used up and dissolved. If it is too late, then try to dissolve the second thought, and so forth. Know that these thoughts are not you. You can respond differently from how it wants you to respond. Giving in to these evil thoughts will only bring further suffering and unhappiness. These evil thoughts are just like a hook waiting to catch a fish. Don't get tricked and hooked up by them!</p>
