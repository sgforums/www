              America</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Justin Whitaker
              Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-07-21 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              Buddhism has grown in popularity in North America, one aspect that has come to
              increasing prominence is its potential affinity for secularism. Books such as
              Stephen Batchelor’s Buddhism Without Beliefs: A Contemporary Guide to Awakening
              (Riverhead Books 1997), Confessions of a Buddhist Atheist (Spiegel &amp; Grau
              2011), and Secular Buddhism: Imagining the Dharma in an Uncertain World (Yale
              University Press 2017) have given shape to the meeting of Western curiosity and
              skepticism with Asian Buddhist traditions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Defining
              Secular Buddhism presents a number of challenges. Each of the terms “secular”
              and “Buddhism” lends itself to a variety of meanings depending on context.
              Secular, for instance, is defined by the Concise Oxford Dictionary primarily in
              the negative: “adj. not religious, sacred, or spiritual.” It continues by
              giving the origin in Christian Latin as meaning “the world.” Batchelor himself
              notes his own struggle with terms such as “spiritual,” “religious,” “secular,”
              “agnostic,” “skeptical,” and others in the preface to Secular Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              not all types of Buddhism that have arisen in North America match well with
              secularism, as many have retained a markedly non-secular quality. Before
              disrobing, marrying Martine Fages, and settling in Devon, England, Batchelor
              spent 10 years as a monastic in the Tibetan and Korean Seon (Zen) traditions,
              which Batchelor refers to as “traditional Buddhism.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              “traditional Buddhism” I mean any school or doctrinal system that operates
              within the soteriological worldview of ancient India. Whether TheravÄ�da or
              Mahayana in orientation, all such forms of Buddhism regard the ultimate goal of
              their practice to be the attainment of nirvana, that is, the complete cessation
              of the craving (tanhÄ�) that drives the relentless cycle of birth, death, and
              rebirth. . . Despite their apparent differences, TheravÄ�da, Zen, Shin,
              Nichiren, and Tibetan Buddhism share the same underlying soteriology, that of
              ancient India outlined above. (Secular Buddhism)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              opposition to this, "secular Buddhism” refers to a Buddhism that rejects
              the supernatural, most prominently in doctrines such as rebirth, or many
              interpretations of karma, or beliefs in spirits or gods. Other aspects of
              Buddhism rejected by secular Buddhists include strong emphasis on ritual,
              belief in the power of amulets or relics, and notions of extraordinarily
              powerful teacher-student relationships. A tension arises here, as traditional
              Buddhists object that without these, one cannot be a “real Buddhist.” Batchelor
              responds: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Each
              Buddhist tradition maintains that it alone possesses the “true” interpretation
              of the Dharma, whereas all the other schools either fall short of this truth or
              have succumbed to “wrong views.” Today, from a historical-critical perspective,
              these kinds of claims appear strident and hollow. For we recognize that every
              historical form of Buddhism is contingent upon the wide array of particular and
              unique circumstances out of which it arose. (Secular Buddhism)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Is
              it possible for a “real” Buddhist to reject many of the beliefs of previous
              Buddhisms? Secular Buddhists think so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a survey sent out to secular Buddhists, respondents defended their place under
              the umbrella of “Buddhism.” Jennifer Gentile, an atheist yoga instructor
              married to a Buddhist Zen priest, describes secular Buddhism as, “a guide for
              living ethically and morally, becoming more present without causing harm.” When
              asked about disadvantages, she responded, “I can’t imagine a disadvantage,
              other than some people might not understand what that means and be
              disrespectful or discriminatory.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Similarly,
              Tina Hamilton, a member of the board of directors of the Association of
              Mindfulness Meditation and Secular Buddhism, notes: “There have been numerous
              studies that show that meditation actually changes the brain in many positive
              ways. In my personal practice, I find that I’m less reactive, and able to think
              things through. I was diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, and have found that with
              meditation, I no longer need the medication to help me focus (no medication for
              10 years now). Other things that I see secular Buddhism helping with is
              increasing compassion and equanimity.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Doug
              Smith, study director of the Secular Buddhist Association, defines secular
              Buddhism as: “Buddhism without speculative supernatural elements.” When asked
              about the benefit of this approach, he noted that, “We get the gains of
              Buddhist practice (wisdom, kindness, less stress) without the false or
              unscientific beliefs.” Gary Donnelly, a doctoral research student at Liverpool
              University in England, notes that secular Buddhism provides a “lack of hokum
              and regional superstition” and a “more realistic worldview.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mark
              W. Gura, executive director of the Association of Mindfulness Meditation and
              Secular Buddhism (AMMSB) and vice president of the Atheist Alliance of America,
              suggests that “secular Buddhism is based on critical thinking, neuroscience,
              and the essence of Buddhist meditation and philosophy, without its supernatural
              elements. Its beliefs are held only on facts, while any other information is
              considered opinion or hypothesis.” To this, Gura adds that the AMMSB has
              recently become an official affiliate of the large American Atheists
              organization, which was founded in 1963. This, Gura holds, marks a “historical
              event for secular Buddhism” as it is the first time secular Buddhists “have
              been embraced by another large national atheist group.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Several
              respondents pointed to Batchelor’s books and videos as inspiration for their
              move into Buddhism, many coming from atheistic or secular backgrounds. Others
              actively practice with one or more traditional schools of Buddhism (Zen,
              Tibetan Buddhism, and Theravada were all mentioned several times), but do not
              hold many of the beliefs of those schools. Dr. Carol Creech, community health
              coordinator for the Health Education Learning Project in Dallas, Texas, has
              stated that, “I am a former Christian practicing Tibetan Buddhism with a near
              complete absence of literal belief in Tibetan sectarian practices, such as
              Dharma protectors. And thus ‘maybe’ a secular Buddhist.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">However,
              Julie Brefczynski-Lewis, assistant professor of neuroscience at West Virginia
              University, says, “Sometimes there is a condescending attitude towards those
              with beliefs—I see that in Stephen Batchelor’s writings. This attitude, I fear
              could steer people away from more traditional approaches, or create a safe
              bubble so they never would venture into concepts like karma and rebirth, which
              can be tremendously beneficial (even if just taken as a provisional ‘raft’ to
              help one cross difficult waters, but with knowledge that it will someday be
              left behind).”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jennifer
              Hawkins, community director for the Secular Buddhist Association, who describes
              herself as a 32-year-old African-American, notes that her status as a minority
              has helped her establish greater dialogue with some traditional Buddhists. Her
              nuanced discussion of secular Buddhism suggested both hermeneutical and
              historical defenses of secular Buddhism. On the hermeneutical front, she
              suggests that secular Buddhists work to determine whether passages are to be
              interpreted literally or not: “It’s looking at these suttas and finding
              value—even if the original composer believed in yakshas and that one thing has
              turned out not to be true, does that somehow negate the whole value of a sutta?
              No.” </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              the historical side, echoing Batchelor, she states: “Buddhism changed as it
              entered each new land—and so it changes a little as it enters ‘the West.’ It is
              simply the natural process of change and not disrespect. Personally, I have a
              great deal of gratitude to Gotama Buddha for sharing what he found and to all
              of those who transmitted his ideas (and some of their own) through time so that
              it could reach me. Really looking closely at the suttas and at the history of
              Buddhism’s changes does not diminish that respect or gratitude—if anything, it
              adds to it.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is an excerpt of Jayarava's Raves definition of ‘Karma
                      and Rebirth’ from BWB website which might be of some interest. Here is his definition
                      on both subjects:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My attempt at a non-controversial definition of Buddhist
                      karma and rebirth is as follows: Karma is the Anglicised word for the process
                      that links consequences (phala, vipÄ�ka) to actions (karman), as well as the
                      actions themselves. Because karma does not immediately manifest as
                      consequences, it accumulates over time. The main consequence of karma is
                      rebirth (punarbhava), but karma may also manifest as sensation (vedanÄ�).
                      Rebirth is governed by a theory of how experiences arise, i.e. by dependent
                      arising (pratÄ«tya-samutpÄ�da). Enlightened people don't make new karma. When
                      enlightened people die they are not reborn.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine of karma is the Buddhist version of the
                      just-world myth and like other versions is tied to an afterlife in which the
                      injustice of this life is balanced out. This myth produces a cognitive bias, in
                      the Wikipedia definition:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The just-world hypothesis or just-world fallacy is the
                      cognitive bias (or assumption) that a person's actions are inherently inclined
                      to bring morally fair and fitting consequences to that person, to the end of
                      all noble actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually
                      punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency to
                      attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of—a universal
                      force that restores moral balance." </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If we replaced "just-world hypothesis" with
                      "Buddhist karma" in this statement, we would have a serviceable
                      definition of karma. All the major religions have a version of this myth. And
                      yet the world clearly is not fair or just. Evil actions go unpunished and good
                      actions go unrewarded. The idea that actions always have timely and appropriate
                      consequences is debunked by lived experience. And this inevitably leads
                      religions to link the myth of the just-world with the myth of the afterlife.
                      Judgement and reward in the afterlife is how religions rationalise an unjust
                      world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine of rebirth is the Buddhist version of the Myth
                      of the Afterlife. This myth is correlated with the cognitive dissonance
                      associated with the knowledge of our own inevitable death. Life
                      "wants" to go on, self-conscious beings consciously want to live
                      forever but come to understand that they die. In the tension of the
                      irresistible force (life) meeting the immovable object (death), the afterlife
                      is born and thrives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A seldom noticed feature of the Buddhism version of the
                      afterlife is the bifurcation into a metaphysical narrative and a moral one.
                      Buddhist metaphysicians have always stressed that the relation between us and
                      our rebirths is governed by dependent arising (pratÄ«tyasamutpÄ�da). This is
                      first and foremost a description of how mental states arise, but is applied in
                      all sort of other ways. Thus the one who acts is neither identical with or
                      totally different from the one who experiences the consequences. The latter
                      arises in dependence on the former. Buddhist moralists (often the same people
                      in a different didactic mode) emphasise that actions have consequences for us.
                      Many suttas and all jÄ�takas explicitly relate how actions rebound on us in
                      subsequent lives, or that what we now experience is the result of our actions
                      in a past life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I conjecture that this moral version of the Buddhist
                      afterlife is necessary because without a strong connection between action and
                      consequence for the agent, morality is not possible. That this contradicts
                      Buddhist metaphysics is not problematised in Buddhism teaching, it is simply
                      that in switching from one mode to the other, Buddhists simply ignore the
                      contradiction. I don't see this as a disputed teaching, since the ability to segue
                      back and forth between metaphysical and moral discourses with respect to the
                      afterlife seems to be universal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pure Land Buddhism completely circumvented karma by
                      introducing the concept of a living Buddha from another universe responding to
                      our cries for help. Now karma doesn't matter because it can all be over-ridden
                      by AmitÄ�bha who, simply because we call his name, ensures a good rebirth and
                      subsequent liberation. The magic of the name is so powerful that it can
                      overcome aeons of bad karma. </span></p>

              <div>Rebirth and karma pt ii</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Permit awhile my opinion:-</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <p>Alaya consciousness, also known as storehouse consciousness, implies memory. While we are alive, conscious and interacting, we create and store memories.  Neutral memories, generally inconsequential, if the mind is focused and undistracted, may be stored as memories. Thus we have dreams when we sleep. Memories of such are subtle as compared below.</p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Created memories with strong attachments, or emotional labelling as stronger, more distinct, especially if it corresponds with our core failings. Storehouse consciousness contain "seeds" which I consider one's karmic inclinations.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>We have a personality, we develop character, implying prenatal and postnatal tendencies. However, nothing is impermanent, we change according to our circumstances.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Rebirth is very related to karma, our emotional tendencies. For instance, stories like <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Liao Fan's four stories, takes a social/ moralistic bent and its rebirth sounds more like reincarnation instead. It was meant for a certain audience of a period of time</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Nevertheless, if you do inherit it as part of your culture, it becomes part of your psyche, especially from an impressionable age. Similar, worlds differ if you are from an Hindu background or likewise, abrahamic beliefs. We have an inkling of what karma is because someone more authoritarian told us .</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"> Most of the time, it does not affect us, until it hits our conscience, when we are posed with a moral dilemma. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: sans-serif;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">Also, contradiction grows when we don't  have science explaining the mechanics of rebirth and karma. Science, do not even recognize rebirth and karma, not as an established fact anyway. Most beliefs system have an expectation of invested faith anyways.</span></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Now using the term memory in lieu of storehouse consciousness, we have the active component, the creation and transition stage , then the storage in physical stage and physical storage in itself. (I will explain using computer technology as analogy even though I am not particularly IT endowed. Please correct me if it makes sense to you.)</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Let use the user of a computer as "Self" entity, it creates an identity and an avatar which it wants others to identify with. As we have thoughts as we type, electrical impulses are created and when viewed, is recognized as thoughts. But these are just electrical impulses without the proper transmitter or receiver. There are also protocols necessary. When they are created by the processor, they are held ;in the active cache and subsequently stored in the hard drive or memory storage.</div>
              <div>
              <div><br style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">When we are conceived as a human, we are predisposed to being a human with human mental and physical faculties. What happens to us physically is physical karma, being born a partially or fully functional human. This only one aspect. Then we have  mental faculty which is developed somewhat to the level of an infant.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">It is believed in some circles that when we are born, die and even when we dream, we release the drug dimethyltrypamine (or DMT for short) from our pineal gland, sometimes referred as our third eye. DMT is a well known psychedelic drug which induce strong hallucinogenic effects.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">When we dream we release or create thought waves or energy from our memories. More so when we die, we trigger a massive amount DMT, releasing our memories and core karmic tendencies as energy. So in way, we transmit our storehouse consciousness or memories. With karmic seeds being the strongest. Our "memories" have a certain profile, or protocol. Perhaps password or passkey is suitable for this instance.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">Correspondingly, although not at the same time, it is believed that when we are born, we also release tremendous amount of DMT. Other then physical and mental attributes we have not yet developed our core personalities we can begin to described as "us". As we release our DMT, we also open or start receiving  seed consciousness or memories. Thus the moment of our DMT release fits a certain protocol or profile, equivalent of a password or passkey. Thus " memory files" are send off, or more appropriately released on one side, and another side, the recipient, open to receive "karma or personality software". </div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">Thus we are now born with a personality which is a combination of all those conditions. Each sides is attracted to each others due to both affinities with each other.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">This is just a theory circling around my mind for awhile. May it offer you some food for thought.</div>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is an excerpt of Jayarava's Raves
              definition of ‘Karma and Rebirth’ from BWB website which might be
              of some interest. Here is his definition on both
              subjects:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My attempt at a
              non-controversial definition of Buddhist karma and rebirth is as
              follows: Karma is the Anglicised word for the process that links
              consequences (phala, vipÄ�ka) to actions (karman), as well as the
              actions themselves. Because karma does not immediately manifest as
              consequences, it accumulates over time. The main consequence of
              karma is rebirth (punarbhava), but karma may also manifest as
              sensation (vedanÄ�). Rebirth is governed by a theory of how
              experiences arise, i.e. by dependent arising (pratÄ«tya-samutpÄ�da).
              Enlightened people don't make new karma. When enlightened people
              die they are not reborn.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine of karma is
              the Buddhist version of the just-world myth and like other versions
              is tied to an afterlife in which the injustice of this life is
              balanced out. This myth produces a cognitive bias, in the Wikipedia
              definition:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The just-world hypothesis
              or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias (or assumption) that a
              person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and
              fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble
              actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually
              punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency
              to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result
              of—a universal force that restores moral balance."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If we replaced "just-world
              hypothesis" with "Buddhist karma" in this statement, we would have
              a serviceable definition of karma. All the major religions have a
              version of this myth. And yet the world clearly is not fair or
              just. Evil actions go unpunished and good actions go unrewarded.
              The idea that actions always have timely and appropriate
              consequences is debunked by lived experience. And this inevitably
              leads religions to link the myth of the just-world with the myth of
              the afterlife. Judgement and reward in the afterlife is how
              religions rationalise an unjust world.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine of rebirth is
              the Buddhist version of the Myth of the Afterlife. This myth is
              correlated with the cognitive dissonance associated with the
              knowledge of our own inevitable death. Life "wants" to go on,
              self-conscious beings consciously want to live forever but come to
              understand that they die. In the tension of the irresistible force
              (life) meeting the immovable object (death), the afterlife is born
              and thrives.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A seldom noticed feature of

              that in switching from one mode to the other, Buddhists simply
              ignore the contradiction. I don't see this as a disputed teaching,
              since the ability to segue back and forth between metaphysical and
              moral discourses with respect to the afterlife seems to be
              universal.</span></p>

One can be reborn into the Pureland until the final birth before one attains Buddhahood. Even with a single distraction at death, one will still fall back into samsara according to one's karma.</span></div>

              <p style="line-height: normal;">I agree there is no doer, however, there is a tendency to link one's(self) origination as a consciousness transitioning one previous person(deceased) to another (present).</p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;">There is a linear flow chart past~present~future. We tend to ignore or rather don't relate karma to the physical part,eg. our parents their conditions and our ancestors before us. Bodily imperfections is a potential for the ripening of karma. We tend to identify previous lives experiences as point of origination, your "mango seed", if you will.</p>
              <p style="line-height: normal;">Affinity in this context means attracted to. Imagine karmic seeds as different genres of videos. We tend towards certain genres. Seeing the number of bookmarks we also see a tendency.  So perhaps we should see our present human consciousness gravitating towards certain memories. Just like when before watching a movie, it is just a title, but only after watching it, it then becomes part of your memory and you will form an impression if it moves you. In a way, you now own the movie(or rather its content), much like you own a consciousness of previous lives.</p>

              When we ask ourselves questions; what is rebirth and what is

              entails?
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If we talk about rebirth, then who or what is being reborn,
              where does it comes from, and if we are really reborn, what enters
              us and becomes us. And how is it that as buddhists, we experience
              rebirth and yet not reincarnation?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Regarding karma, is it a matter of what you reap is what you
              have sown? Poetic, or divine justice? So of a scale of balance,
              just simply your just desserts? Then what of the downfalls of

              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">There is no single stream of thought, just appears so, what seems continuous is actually memories of thoughts arising.<br>
              <div>I use the concept the eight consciousness not as if they are separate, but rather as different aspects of the whole mind process. The eighth consciousness is simply memory. Memory is a retention of thought processes that happened, interpreted by the mind.

              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This is an excerpt of Jayarava's Raves
              definition of ‘Karma and Rebirth’ from BWB website which might be
              of some interest. Here is his definition on both
              subjects:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My attempt at a
              non-controversial definition of Buddhist karma and rebirth is as
              follows: Karma is the Anglicised word for the process that links
              consequences (phala, vipÄ�ka) to actions (karman), as well as the
              actions themselves. Because karma does not immediately manifest as
              consequences, it accumulates over time. The main consequence of
              karma is rebirth (punarbhava), but karma may also manifest as
              sensation (vedanÄ�). Rebirth is governed by a theory of how
              experiences arise, i.e. by dependent arising (pratÄ«tya-samutpÄ�da).
              Enlightened people don't make new karma. When enlightened people
              die they are not reborn.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine of karma is
              the Buddhist version of the just-world myth and like other versions
              is tied to an afterlife in which the injustice of this life is
              balanced out. This myth produces a cognitive bias, in the Wikipedia
              definition:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"The just-world hypothesis
              or just-world fallacy is the cognitive bias (or assumption) that a
              person's actions are inherently inclined to bring morally fair and
              fitting consequences to that person, to the end of all noble
              actions being eventually rewarded and all evil actions eventually
              punished. In other words, the just-world hypothesis is the tendency
              to attribute consequences to—or expect consequences as the result
              of—a universal force that restores moral balance."</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If we replaced "just-world
              hypothesis" with "Buddhist karma" in this statement, we would have
              a serviceable definition of karma. All the major religions have a
              version of this myth. And yet the world clearly is not fair or
              just. Evil actions go unpunished and good actions go unrewarded.
              The idea that actions always have timely and appropriate
              consequences is debunked by lived experience. And this inevitably
              leads religions to link the myth of the just-world with the myth of
              the afterlife. Judgement and reward in the afterlife is how
              religions rationalise an unjust world.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The doctrine of rebirth is
              the Buddhist version of the Myth of the Afterlife. This myth is
              correlated with the cognitive dissonance associated with the
              knowledge of our own inevitable death. Life "wants" to go on,
              self-conscious beings consciously want to live forever but come to
              understand that they die. In the tension of the irresistible force
              (life) meeting the immovable object (death), the afterlife is born
              and thrives.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A seldom noticed feature of
              the Buddhism version of the afterlife is the bifurcation into a
              metaphysical narrative and a moral one. Buddhist metaphysicians
              have always stressed that the relation between us and our rebirths
              is governed by dependent arising (pratÄ«tyasamutpÄ�da). This is first
              and foremost a description of how mental states arise, but is
              applied in all sort of other ways. Thus the one who acts is neither
              identical with or totally different from the one who experiences
              the consequences. The latter arises in dependence on the former.
              Buddhist moralists (often the same people in a different didactic
              mode) emphasise that actions have consequences for us. Many suttas
              and all jÄ�takas explicitly relate how actions rebound on us in
              subsequent lives, or that what we now experience is the result of
              our actions in a past life.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I conjecture that this
              moral version of the Buddhist afterlife is necessary because
              without a strong connection between action and consequence for the
              agent, morality is not possible. That this contradicts Buddhist
              metaphysics is not problematised in Buddhism teaching, it is simply
              that in switching from one mode to the other, Buddhists simply
              ignore the contradiction. I don't see this as a disputed teaching,
              since the ability to segue back and forth between metaphysical and
              moral discourses with respect to the afterlife seems to be
              universal.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Pure Land Buddhism
              completely circumvented karma by introducing the concept of a
              living Buddha from another universe responding to our cries for
              help. Now karma doesn't matter because it can all be over-ridden by
              AmitÄ�bha who, simply because we call his name, ensures a good
              rebirth and subsequent liberation. The magic of the name is so
              powerful that it can overcome aeons of bad karma.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Everything else about karma
              and rebirth seems to be complex and disputed. There are a number of
              main areas of contention related to karma and rebirth. The next
              section of this essay will set out these areas.</span></p>

              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">It gets are reinforced or weakened according to conditions according to its usefulness to "Self". Sort of survival instinct.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">Merits : We cannot have karma without talking about merits. Karma is a personality traits, it is also a basic(survival) instinct. There has to be a "benefit" just as much as it is considered a "defect" . As long as we are in samsara, it is a survival tool. Also, at whichever level of  success affords us a certain karmic traits. You can only sustain prideful thoughts and action only if you live like a deva. Also, when exhausted you merits you can no longer live like a deva.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">Morality :If we were only one person in the world, does morality exist. If I run around wagging my dong, does it matter? Who am I offending? Nobody around other than me. Who me? offended by myself? It is only when I do wrong by others then morality ensues. </div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">There was the story of Milarepa, the cotton clad, when he was practising in a cave, his sister gave food and clothing. As he only felt cold at his extremities, he only wore clothing on his fingers to keep them warm. All is well as long as Milarepa was alone in the cave. However, when the sister, being a woman was embarrassed when she visited him.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">So morality in a nutshell is a social restraint we must wear if we are living in that particular society.  We are simply conditioned along the way as we interact with others, anyone.</div>

              <div>The first six consciousness explains the relationship of different sense consciousness with perception consciousness. Operating system/ user interface perhaps.

              <div>We all have needs and wants, our basic cravings and aversion. We have limited access to what we want and need. "I" or "Self" is a software serving the perceived wants and needs and on how get it or avoiding the undesirable. The "Self" is constantly updating itself to the current situation.</div>

              <div>As kids,when parents gives us something we desire, we may be thankful, but generally, we take things for granted, when we desire something but not granted we sulk. Caveman talk: give me, friend, not give me, not friend, don't like you.</div>
              <div>If we are a bit more sophisticated, we show affection and shower hugs and kisses to get what we want, if not successful, we attempt to make them feel guilty.</div>
              <div>If we are rich and powerful, we can steamroll over without an iota of guilt. We are entitled.</div>
              <div>Against people like that, we feel agrieved and we plot against them until they fall. Because they deserved it.</div>
              <div>Obligation and identity: we are decent folks with no major flaws however, if a war breaks out, and they put us in an uniform, we will have no compunction in killing the other side not because you personally want to win but because you don't want to lose or die.

              <div>Memory or eighth consciousness, here I am treading on thin ice .</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If asked casually where we do store our memories, casual answer is in our brain. Processes are happening within the brain. If perceiving mind indeed is a process/ activity then the memory which we perceive is active and running, however, there should be a physical storage in brain which is not the memory that as we perceive it. It is information within our brain matter, much like data the sense consciousness receives before it interacts with our perception (sixth consciousness). By these I meant the steps before it becomes our consciousness.The active memory can be likened to activity in a RAM or random access memory, while the physical storage may be compared to flash memory card.  It needs to be retrieved and converted first.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Current, short term and long term memory we perceive in our minds are all current and active memory. If we need to ponder or make association before we remember, probably we have'nt retrieved it yet.</div>

              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">Usually, intentions is an impulse to act, strengthened by deliberations, both feasability and logic, not forgetting one's moral incalcution. Emotions rising from right and wrong arises from moral values.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">The will to act or impulse of one's intention, congenital trait if you will, how much is karmic imprint and how much are antenatal physical conditions. Post natal conditions are environmental and social upbringing with existing prenatal conditions. Postnatal and physical traits can be observed, but not karmic traits.</div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;"><br></div>
              <div style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: large; line-height: normal;">Psychopaths and sociopaths shows no empathy or remorse, we rate them in terms of degree of severity. However, it had been claimed people with psychopathic trait makes the best leaders or CEOs. Most people in prison are also considered psychopaths and sociopaths. So some do not lack intelligence. Is it possible that karmic tendencies will not ripened with the intention to act cruelly in the absence of ideal conditions and triggers or it is inevitable these people will ultimately turn into sociopaths and psychopaths?</div>

              <div>Incapable of empathy suggests an impairment of sorts.</div>
              <div>When one commits certain acts in the absence of guilt or shame suggest a fascination or predisposition to such activities. Such an obession ready imprinted as there is  an attraction to unwholesome or violent acts. Karmic debts from the past ripening now.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              Imagine you are watching a very violent scene, but somehow you can't hear the sounds of agony despite ratcheting up the volume to the highest.  Actually  the plug from the amplifier to the speakers is loose, so there is no sound.
              <div>What if one day as you are watching the same movie, then suddenly someone actually plug the cables to the speaker, then suddenly you get very shock by the sudden impact at full force. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>So in future lives with conditions met, karma will ripen.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Wholesome action warranting merits are subtle and harmonious in nature, while unwholesome actions are gross and dissonant. These are patterns of nature. Dissonance adds to confusion.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If one accepts the doctrine from the Tibetan book of the dead, after one passes away, from a certain period before rebirth, one is in the transition stage called the Bardo. If I remember correctly, it can be very short or can be up to 49(?) days. It describes the attraction to different quality of light that one will be attracted to. The earliest are the brighter of lights indicating rebirth in the higher realms, and the longer one remains in the bardo, lower  realms one will be reborn. This is due to our aversion to other realm and attraction towards a certain to realms. There are also visions of different entities (deities or demons) appearing associated with ones' karmic affinity. Anyway, I've only read the book of the dead once and my memory is rather fuzzy.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Finally you left out the victims. They too have karmic imprints. There can be karmic benefactors as there can be karmic debtors. There are just people who likes you for no particular reason, just as there are people just don't like you. These also contribute to your karma ripening.</div>
              <div> The more you create these debtors the more you will encounter them in your countless lives.When merits are acquired one ascend, when exhausted, one descends.  Same way when bad karma is exhausted, affliction lessens.</div>
