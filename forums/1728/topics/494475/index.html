              Merrill Lynch Chairman, the story of Michael Dobbs-Higginson</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">BD Dipananda Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2017-08-04 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Michael
              Dobbs-Higginson, ordained as a lay Buddhist monk in Japan at age 22 and
              erstwhile Merrill Lynch chairman, shares his unique life story in his new
              memoir A Raindrop in the Ocean: The Life of a Global Adventurer. The most
              fundamental period of his life was his stay at a Buddhist monastery on a
              mountain in Japan, where he battled hardship to find untapped reserves of
              resilience that would last him a lifetime.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              personal doctrine, the result of a lifetime of learning, is based on Buddhist
              principles with a sprinkling of Western morality added to the mix. It is his
              way of securing balance—not happiness—and has aided him in maintaining a
              relaxed and confident demeanor thoughout.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              don’t look for happiness; that is a Walt Disney construct,” Dobbs-Higginson
              said in a recent interview. “The search for happiness is a very ephemeral one.
              If you and the world around you are in balance, you are naturally peaceful.
              Peacefulness is one thing, but happiness is trite.” (The Telegraph)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              auto-biography tells the story of how Dobbs-Higginson was raised in colonial
              Rhodesia (a territory that corresponds to modern-day Zimbabwe) and went on to
              roam the world as a teenager. It includes tales of bed-hopping, drug-smuggling,
              and shady business deals, written as if by a master storyteller, while sharing
              a religious philosophy based on Japanese Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dobbs-Higginson
              was ordained as a lay Buddhist monk in 1963, at the age of 22, at Shino-In, the
              headquarters of the Shingon school of Japanese Buddhism on Mount Koya. He was
              the first Westerner to be accepted into the 1,200-year-old Buddhist tradition.
              Now 75, Dobbs-Higginson is calmly facing his greatest challenge yet; the
              downhill battle against a terminal illness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              studying medicine in Dublin, logging in Canada, and teaching surfing in Hawaii,
              Dobbs-Higginson describes how he moved back to Japan, where he set up several
              businesses before being chased out of the country by ruthless Central
              Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives, after refusing to participate in their
              operations. He then realtes how he went on to become the chairman of Merrill
              Lynch Asia-Pacific, and is still involved in various startups developing
              electric vehicles and drones for Asia, and an e-commerce platform for Africa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              asked how he reconciled his career as a banker with his monastic principles, he
              answered: “If I was joining the mafia to smuggle drugs, that would be a moral
              question, but joining investment banking, I was actually doing some good. I
              felt that I was giving opportunity to people who might not otherwise have had
              it, and in those days we were not paid those grotesque sums.” (The Telegraph)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His
              philosophy for life, he explains, is built up out of three parts: minimizing
              the ego, encouraging curiosity, and focusing on substance rather than form.
              This last notion came from his mother: “My mother was a sort of quasi-mystic,
              and very interested in comparative theology,” Dobbs-Higginson recounts. “And
              when I was about six or seven, about to leave for boarding school, she said: ‘I
              want to tell you something.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“She
              said ‘you’ve got to understand that life is about form and substance. Most
              people focus on form, because that’s the easy part, and that’s usually driven
              by the ego. But substance is really what the person is made of; what their
              moral value systems are and who they really are—so focus on substance.’”
              (Citya.M. Newsletters)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              75, he still leads a full life, despite his illness, with three children, six
              grandchildren, and his wife Marie-Thérèse.</span></p>
