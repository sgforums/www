              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the <a id="sakyan" name="sakyan">Sakyans</a> at a Sakyan town named <a id="devadaha" name="devadaha">Devadaha</a>.
               Then a large number of monks headed for outlying districts went to the 
              Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. 
              As they were sitting there they said to the Blessed One, "Lord, we want 
              to go to the countryside of the outlying districts and to take up 
              residence there."</p>
              <p>"Have you informed <a id="sariputta" name="sariputta">Sariputta</a>?"</p>
              <p>"No, lord, we haven't informed Ven. Sariputta."</p>
              <p>"Inform Sariputta, monks. Sariputta is wise, a great help to the monks who are his fellows in the holy life."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks replied.</p>
              <p>At that time Ven. Sariputta was sitting under a certain cassia tree 
              not far from the Blessed One. Then the monks, delighting in &amp; 
              approving of the Blessed One's words, rose from their seats and — bowing
               down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him, keeping him to their 
              right — went to Ven. Sariputta. On arrival, they exchanged courteous 
              greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; 
              courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said 
              to Ven. Sariputta, "Friend Sariputta, we want to go to the countryside 
              of the outlying districts and to take up residence there. We have 
              already informed the Teacher."</p>
              <p>"Friends, in foreign lands there are wise nobles &amp; priests, 
              householders &amp; contemplatives — for the people there are wise &amp; 
              discriminating — who will question a monk: 'What is your teacher's 
              doctrine? What does he teach?' Have you listened well to the teachings —
               grasped them well, attended to them well, considered them well, 
              penetrated them well by means of discernment — so that in answering you 
              will speak in line with what the Blessed One has said, will not 
              misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual, will answer in line
               with the Dhamma, and no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma 
              will have grounds for criticizing you?"</p>
              <p>"We would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these 
              words in Ven. Sariputta's presence. It would be good if Ven. Sariputta 
              himself would enlighten us as to their meaning."</p>
              <p>"Then in that case, friends, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, friend," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>Ven. Sariputta said: "Friends, in foreign lands there are wise nobles
               &amp; priests, householders &amp; contemplatives — for the people there
               are wise &amp; discriminating — who will question a monk: 'What is your
               teacher's doctrine? What does he teach?'</p>
              <p>"Thus asked, you should answer, 'Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion &amp; desire.'</p>
              <p>"Having thus been answered, there may be wise nobles &amp; priests, 
              householders &amp; contemplatives... who will question you further, 'And
               your teacher teaches the subduing of passion &amp; desire for what?'</p>
              <p>"Thus asked, you should answer, 'Our teacher teaches the subduing of 
              passion &amp; desire for form... for feeling... for perception... for 
              fabrications. Our teacher teaches the subduing of passion &amp; desire

              <p>"Thus asked, you should answer, 'When one is not free from passion, 
              desire, love, thirst, fever, &amp; craving for form, then from any 
              change &amp; alteration in that form, there arises sorrow, lamentation,

              <p>"Friends, if one who entered &amp; remained in unskillful mental 
              qualities were to have a pleasant abiding in the here &amp; now — 
              unthreatened, undespairing, unfeverish — and on the break-up of the 
              body, after death, could expect a good destination, then the Blessed One
               would not advocate the abandoning of unskillful mental qualities. But 
              because one who enters &amp; remains in unskillful mental qualities has a
               stressful abiding in the here &amp; now — threatened, despairing, &amp;
               feverish — and on the break-up of the body, after death, can expect a 
              bad destination, that is why the Blessed One advocates the abandoning of
               unskillful mental qualities.</p>

              <p>That is what Ven. Sariputta said. Gratified, the monks delighted in Ven. Sariputta's words.</p>
