              <p>Happy lunar new year to all.</p>
              <p>Have some questions that I need advise</p>
              <p>Basically, I am a person with shizophrenia and I began to hear sounds roughly one year ago.</p>
              <p>I couldn't control my thinking and I had evil thoughts in my mind.</p>
              <p>My friends tell me its "Ye Zhang" and its my karma.</p>
              <p>These evil thoughts include damaging Buddha statues, scolding Buddha, anyhow talking about Buddhism, hurting people They are only thoughts and I have not done any thing as the above.</p>
              <p>I have just recovered and I began reciting the great compassion mantra roughly 6 months ago.</p>
              <p>I found this forum and read that having these thoughts and scolding buddha in my heart will lead me to avinci hell.</p>
              <p>May I know how do I save or do amendments to reduce the amount of karma. I don't wish to go to hell.</p>
              <p>Now I am going to go for spiritual enlightenment. Can anyhow point me to how to practise?</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>Yes in the past, when I "talk" to the voices too much. I get very tired and I will tend to sleep. Nearly lost my job. These voices also said that I am a demon/devil and I am trying to "play"</p>
              <p>Now I am better as I am taking my medication. The great compassion mantra saved me too. It reduced my evil thoughts</p>

              <p>Hi Gump,</p>
              <p>There is nothing to worry about. :)</p>
              <p>Basically, try learning not getting caught up with these thoughts. These thoughts are like a game, samping your energy and confidence through the engagement of them.</p>
              <p>These thoughts are powerless as long as they are regarded as such. Basically, they work on certain beliefs to create fear...</p>
              <p>Also, can i suggest that you learn some energy building exercise to strengthen the 'energy field'.</p>
              <p>Go to go. Talk to you some other time...</p>
              <p>All the best !</p>

              <p>Looking from a medical standpoint, the voices or noise as you say are part and parcel of your mind hallucinating. It sometimes sounds like sibilant whispering and giggling. It is a natural illness not caused by karma or anything else. Do not be fooled by anyone claiming that it can be controlled by willpower or thinking calm thoughts. The only way is to go to a psychiatrist and asked for medication and treatment.</p>

              <p>Hi Gump,</p>
              <p>My opinion is that since you have recovered you should just stop worrying about those sounds.</p>
              <p>Worrying itself is the problem... don't you think so.</p>
              <p>About enlightenment, may be you can find someone who is qualified to guide you. Our perception changes along the spiritual path. So what you understand now and what you may understand years later may be very different. And looking back, you may realise that worrying (at the time) isn't that helpful.</p>

              <p>Hi ,Gump</p>
              <p>based on what you say it is a internal demon in your mind</p>
              <p>you need to start repenting and keep Reciting Om mani padm hum</p>
              <p>Reciting Compassion Mantra is too long for u :)</p>

              <p>I agree you should continue chanting, and practice awareness. Also see <a title="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm</a> regarding 'kuan xin'.</p>
              <p>You may also want to practice sincerely repenting, it also helps in clearing karma. But one should do that consistently and regularly, wld be best if 108 times everyday with reciting and prostration.

              <p><em><strong>Is the Sound Annoying You?<br></strong>If people were trying to meditate and wanted to shut the world out, Ajahn Chah used to give them a very hard time. If he came across a nun or a monk who had barricaded the windows of their heart and was trying to block everything out, he would really put them through it. He drew in one monk of this type as his attendant for a while and he would never let him sit still. As soon as he saw the monk close his eyes to "go into meditation" he would immediately send him off on some errand. Ajahn Chah knew that cutting yourself off was not the place of true inner peace. This was because of his own years of trying to make the world shut up and leave him alone. He had failed miserably. Eventually he was able to see this is not how to find completion and resolution.<br><br>Years ago, when he was a wandering monk, living on his own on a mountainside above a village, he kept a strict meditation schedule. In Thailand they love outdoor, nightlong film shows because the nights are cool compared to the very hot days. Whenever there was a party, it tended to go on all night. About fifty years ago, public address systems were just starting to be used in Thailand and every decent event had to have a PA going. It was blasted as loud as possible all through the night. One time, Ajahn Chah was quietly meditating up on the mountain while there was a festival going on down in the village. All the local folk songs and pop music were amplified throughout the area. Ajahn Chah was sitting there, seething and thinking, "Don't they realize all the bad karma involved in disturbing my meditation? They know I 'm up here. After all, I'm their teacher. Haven't they learned anything? And what about the five precepts? I bet they're boozing and out of control," and so on and so forth.<br><br></em><em><strong>But Ajahn Chah was a pretty smart fellow. As he listened to himself complaining, he quickly realized, "Well, they're just having a good time down there. I'm making myself miserable up here. No matter how upset I get, my anger is just making more noise internally." And then he had this insight: "Oh, the sound is just the sound. It's me who is going out to annoy it. If I leave the sound alone, it won't annoy me. It's just doing what it has to do. That's what sound does. It makes sound. This is its job. So if I don't go out and bother the sound, it's not going to bother me. Aha!"<br><br>As it turned out, this insight had such a profound effect that it became a principle that he espoused from that time on.</strong> If any of the monks displayed an urge to try and get away from people or stimulation—the world of things and responsibilities—he would tend to shove them straight into it. He would put that monk in charge of the cement-mixing crew or take him to do every house blessing that came up on the calendar. He would make sure that the monk had to get involved in things because he was trying to teach him to let go of seeing meditation as needing sterile conditions—to see, in fact, that most wisdom arises from the skillful handling of the world's abrasions.<br><br>Ajahn Chah was passing along an important insight. It's pointless to try to find peace through nullifying or erasing the sense world. Peace only comes through not giving that world more substantiality or more reality than it actually possesses.</em></p>

              <p>It distorts your thinking, distorts your reasoning, use fiction, turn your saying into false saying. Everything is non good.</p>
              <p>But I don't care about them, what I care is that it seems that I have done quite an amount of bad karma in the past/now and I need to make amends.</p>

                      cultivation. Some people think that cultivation means not having an occupation but to be
                      engaged in the daily activities of prayers to the Buddha, meditation or chanting the
                      sutras. The actual purpose of cultivation is to eradicate our undesirable conduct and to
                      maintain our good conduct. In other words, to follow the Bodhisattva path in emulating</span></strong></td>

                      which is to eradicate our self serving and evil habits and thus reduce our negative karma.
                      However, many people do not understand this principle and they misinterpret its meaning.
                      Actually, not only those who have renounced to be Buddhist monks or nuns need to
                      cultivate, lay-Buddhists also need to cultivate, if not more diligently. Even those who do
                      not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for
                      monks or nuns alone.</span></strong></td>

              </table>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation?
                  Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I
                  travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was
                  in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the
                  temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you
                  cultivating? I replied, "That’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha
                  teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down!
                  In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel
                  about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds,
                  I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the
                  Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our
                  activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that
                  cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
                  mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities.
                  Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can
                  afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst
                  of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children,
                  household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their
                  leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they
                  could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they
                  are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our
                  neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all
                  these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our
                  activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may
                  cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
                  neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to
                  temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If
                  she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be
                  acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to
                  turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then
                  cultivating at the same time. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in our society when we understand
                  the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few
                  decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess
                  the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any
                  place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct
                  ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can
                  only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is
                  very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
                  every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and
                  what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it
                  into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know
                  how warm or cold it is.</strong></span></p>

                  Cultivating our mind is better than cultivating our moral conduct. Maintaining

                  examining our conduct and eradicating conduct which are undesirable, for example, those

                      and the next it ceases. Now we need to know when these thoughts are arising and ceasing.
                      "To know" here means "awareness". Let me use my hand to illustrate so

                      When I put my hand down then it is "down". Our mind constantly behaves in the

                      thought is dead, it passes away (hand is down). This continuous process of birth and death
                      is called sentient beings. This process of birth and death brings forth boundless
                      sufferings. Sentient being is boundless and therefore suffering is also boundless. When we
                      learn and practise Buddhism it means we are striving to liberate the inner sentient being

                  creates a good person; one can ascend to the heavens or one can perform a lot of virtuous
                  deeds. What happens if the mind is evil and becomes defiled? It can drag us to become
                  animals, ghosts and deities, or descend to hell. This is because our mind is not pure, and
                  therefore the world becomes a sea of suffering. This suffering world of ours is called the
                  "Saha World". It means having to endure and is also called the "World of

                  mind is polluted, then we cleanse it with the dew of the Buddha. And when our minds have
                  been purified, then they are the same as those of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In this
                  way, we will progress very quickly in our cultivation.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Observing the mind is very simple.
                  It is like watching out for the mouse. Everybody dislike mice because they steal our food
                  or they damage our clothings. An idiom describes this sentiment with the phrase,
                  ‘When the mouse crosses the street everybody goes after it.’ Obviously mice are
                  not welcomed and they have to be dealt with. One method of dealing with it, is the cat. At
                  the sight of a mouse, the cat puts his paws firmly on the ground and fixes its steely eyes
                  on the mouse. On seeing the cat, the mouse trembles with fear, not daring to make even the
                  slightest movement. Treat your mind as if it were a mouse and your awareness as the cat.
                  At every moment observe your mind, in the same way as the cat watching the mouse. The
                  mouse wants to live and hardly has time to think of its own safety, let alone of stealing
                  food. If we can observe our minds, then we will hardly have time enough to treasure our
                  wisdom life, let alone think of committing evil deeds.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>Therefore when we are learning and
                  practising Buddhism, we need to learn to "contemplate the mind". In this way, we
                  will very quickly be able to avoid all evils and do all that are good.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: small;"><strong>"Avoid all evils; do all that

                  avoiding all evils and doing all that are good, we need to purify our thoughts. When our
                  thoughts have been purified, then the mind is pure. The purpose of learning and practising
                  Buddhism is to purify the human mind. If the minds of everyone in the family is pure, then

              <p>Hi Ts,</p>
              <p>Could there be a deep-rooted aversion within you  ?</p>
              <p>Chanting of mantra or sutra is another alternative that can calm mind and purfiy bad karma. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>For one who is prone to angry or aversion, it is good that one practise metta meditation as it helps calm the mind from disturbing thought and purify bad karma..</p>
              <p>The reason why i have said in my previous posting..</p>
              <p>Listen to Dharma talk is because i feel that suffering is caused by our wrong view.</p>

              <p>hmm i was watching discovery channel. they had this documentary and they shows a study where they conducted a test on a series of normal ppl, and a series of ppl with mental illness.</p>
              <p>they discovered that there was a physical wasting away of the brain, which removed some functions those parts were responsible for controlling.</p>
              <p>like they did a brain scan of a normal person. when that person talks, the brain had a slight surge of activity right before the person talks. they deduce that the brain was informing the person that he was about to talk, and the voice belongs to him.</p>
              <p>but for a person with mental illness. this slight surge of activity didn't occur when the person talks. so they deduce that it might be because of this, that's why they keep hearing voices. they didn't know that these thoughts and voices came from their mind.</p>
