            <div class='col-md body'>the practice of dream yoga is unique to Tibetan Buddhism. this is a marvelous way to bring awareness training into our sleeping as well as our waking hours. dream yoga is somewhat similar to what western psychology has recently begun to call lucid dreaming.<br><br>lucid dreaming refers to the ability to "wake up" - make conscious choices within a dream while remaining asleep.<br><br>within the dream we can transform the circumstances and ourselves into anything we can imagine.<br><br>this can be an extraordinary meaningful and profound real-life experince. the dream state is one of the bardos. remember that what we perceive in a dream might be as real as the things we see reflected in a mirror.<br><br>many psychic powers including clairvoyance and <strong>recall of past lives</strong> can be developed through these sorts of esoteric practices on the border between reality and illusion.<br><br>yes just as An Eternal Now mentioned, we should practice with right motivations or, intentions.<br><br>(there's a movie with Tom Cruise acting..... something about lucid dreaming)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in dream yoga, we are "seizing the dream". by seizing our dreams, we can learn to play with and change the outcome of our dreams in ways that helps us realise the insubstantial dreamlike nature of all of our experiences.<br><br>we take hold of the dream, rather than the dream having a hold over us.<br><br>dream yoga excercises can vastly help us to achieve cetain benefits for both self and others. by seizing a dream we can perform spiritual activities, multiply our bodies as well as go to pure realms of existence to receive teachings and blessings from Buddhas and transcendent Bodhisattvas....<br><br>in this way, we train to master altered states and different ways of being, including astral travel and other out-of-body experiences; for in dreams we are less encumbered by our corporeal form, moving through the lighter more subtle "mental body" or "illusory light-body".<br><br></div>

(don't wish to describe anymore).<br><br>now somehow i seemed to have regret somethings i didn't cherish.....<br><br>because of my deep rooted fears, i passed a couple of such somehow similar apportunities (maybe perhaps) in my meditation practice, even when i lay down on bed before i fall asleep... i seemed to have gotton into a meditative state with myself having losing body senses and leaving out of my body experience, still aware that i was breathing only breathing and thinking to let go letting go leaving all i have behind.....  and i wasn't even dreaming nor meditating..... i don't know what i call them. its not easy to face, recognise &amp; acknowledge them at first at a beginner's stage and not easy to regain it back. just have to continue to practice cultivate and it will come back again i believe (as another chance to contemplate and explore again further). it ain't easy....... need a great deal of courage and peacefulness or samadhi, calmness full awareness of the mind to face it and practice.<br><br>(i think i'd not describe them further as i am not an accomplished practitioner, unless until they are vividly clearly revealed to me. but i affirm there were some hidden meanings behind them.)<br><br>but well, like you, i'm keen to learn too.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>I keep seeing 'fears' in your post.
