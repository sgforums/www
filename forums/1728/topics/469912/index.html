                   is not about denying thinking, action, carrying water and chopping

                  from dualistic conceptual understanding. The very notion that "action" 
                  and "intention" implies, or necessitates, an "actor", and therefore for 
                  non-action the intentions and actions must also cease, is precisely

                   never required a self (in fact there never was a self or a doer apart 
                  from action to begin with: only a delusion of one), and action does not 
                  need to perpetuate the myth of a self. The myth of a self is not exactly
                   dependent on action or lack thereof. Sure, action that arises out of 
                  the dualistic sense of actor/act where there is an "I" trying to modify 
                  or achieve "that" is a form of action produced by ignorance. But not all
                   actions necessarily arise out of an underlying sense of duality. If all
                   actions arise out of a sense of duality, then after awakening one will

                   one is operating with a dualistic way of understanding, one thinks that
                   action implies a self that is doing an act, and one thinks that 
                  non-action implies that the self ends with the action. But genuine 
                  insight into non-action is simply the realization that never was there a
                   real actor behind action, so there is always in acting just that action
                   - whole being is only the total exertion of action, and this is always 
                  already the case but not realized. That is true non-action - there is no

                   The myth of a self is not dependent on practice and lack thereof. (Oh 
                  but, 'right practice' and 'contemplation' does a lot to deconstruct that
                   myth!) The myth of a self is however dependent on ignorance, and only 
                  wisdom ends that ignorance, just like turning on the lights lead to the 
                  natural cessation of irrational fear and thinking of monster in the dark

                   is always only action without a doer. No doer does not deny action, it 
                  denies agency, and realization of such leads to the direct, immediate, 
                  experience of total exertion/total action where doer/deed is refined 
                  till none in one whole movement. There is nothing passive about 
                  non-action. Non-action is simply action without self/Self. All actions 
                  performed without sense of self/Self is in fact non-action. Without the 
                  subjective pole (actor), the objective pole in contrast to the subject 
                  (being acted upon) is also automatically negated. Yet clearly, the total

Rather than viewing these truths as pertaining to self or other, he said, one should recognize them simply for what they are, in and of themselves, as they are directly experienced, and then perform the duty appropriate to each. Stress should be comprehended, its cause abandoned, its cessation realized, and the path to its cessation developed. These duties form the context in which the anatta doctrine is best understood. If you develop the path of virtue, concentration, and discernment to a state of calm well-being and use that calm state to look at experience in terms of the Noble Truths, the questions that occur to the mind are not "Is there a self? What is my self?" but rather "Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon? Is it really me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful but not really me or mine, why hold on?" These last questions merit straightforward answers, as they then help you to comprehend stress and to chip away at the attachment and clinging — the residual sense of self-identification — that cause it, until ultimately all traces of self-identification are gone and all that's left is limitless freedom.</span></span></p>

At that point, questions of self, no-self, and not-self fall aside. Once there's the experience of such total freedom, where would there be any concern about what's experiencing it, or whether or not it's a self?//<span>  </span></span></span></p>

              <p>Thanissaro Bhikkhu's article is problematic.<br><br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/anatta-not-self-or-no-self.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/10/anatta-not-self-or-no-self.html</a></p>
              <p>robertk:<br><br>This is an old post from ven. Dhammanando that i liked<br>http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index. ... 3364&amp;st=60<br>Citing
               the relevant suttas is unlikely to be persuasive to those who have 
              fallen for Thanissaro's mystical drivel, for Thanissaro would simply 
              interpret them differently or else would translate them differently so 
              as to make them support his view. A good example of this is the 
              following passage from the AlagaddÅ«pamasutta, which is one of the 
              starkest and most uncompromising assertions of the non-existence of 
              self.... until Thanissaro gets his hands on it:<br><br>attani ca attaniye ca saccato thetato anupalabbhamÄ�ne<br>(MN. 22; also cited in the KathÄ�vatthu's debate on the puggalavÄ�da, Kvu. 68)<br><br>And here are some extracts from an old article of mine discussing this phrase...<br><br>First I cite seven translations of it:<br><br><br>Dhammanando:<br>"...since in truth and reality there obtains neither self nor what belongs to self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi:<br>"...since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established..."<br><br>Thanissaro:<br>"...where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality..."<br><br>B.C. Law:<br>"...But both soul and that which belongs to soul being in truth, and forever, impossible to be known..."<br><br>I.B. Horner:<br>"But if Self and what belongs to Self, although actually existing are incomprehensible..."<br><br>MahÄ�makut Tipiá¹­aka:<br>"...meua attÄ� lae borikhÄ�n neuang duai attÄ� bukkhon theu ao mai dai, doey khwÄ�m pen khong jing, doey khwÄ�m pen khong thae..."<br><br>MahÄ�chulalongkorn Tipiá¹­aka:<br>"...meua thang ton lae khong thii neuang kap ton ja yang hen mai dai, doey khwÄ�m pen khong jing, doey khwÄ�m pen khong thae..."<br><br><br>Then my comments:<br><br>Of
               the seven renderings above, those of Horner and Law are completely off 
              the map, while the remaining five are more or less defensible so far as 
              purely philological considerations go.<br><br>There are two key terms in
               the passage that give rise to disagreement: firstly, the participle 
              "anupalabbhamÄ�ne"; secondly, the phrase "saccato thetato". How one 
              conceives the meaning of these will determine how one interprets the 
              passage; and how one interprets the passage will determine how one goes 
              about translating it. The problem, of course, is that every translator's
               interpretation of the above phrases will be determined - or at least 
              influenced - by his prior assumptions about the Buddha's teaching.<br><br>Let's
               start with anupalabbhamÄ�ne. This is the present participle of the 
              passive form of the verb upalabhati, inflected in the locative case. In 
              front of it is placed the negative particle na ('not'), which changes to
               an- in accordance with the rules of euphonic junction.</p>
              <p>Upalabhati means to obtain, get or find. So in the passive voice it 
              would mean to be obtained, gotten or found. With the addition of the 
              negative particle 'na' the meaning would be "not to be found."<br><br>Here's one familiar example of the verb, to be found in every Indian logic textbook:<br><br>vañjhÄ�ya putto na upalabbhati.<br>"A son of a barren woman is not to be found."<br><br>(Or
               as western philosophers would phrase it, " 'Son of a barren woman' does
               not obtain."). Elsewhere the same will be predicated of "horns of a 
              hare", "flowers in the sky", etc.<br><br>And here arises the first point
               of controversy among translators and interpreters of this sutta: does 
              the phrase "not to be obtained" mean the same as "not exist"? ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli, 
              Bodhi and myself would answer yes. A mystically-inclined monk like 
              Thanissaro would answer no. Unsurprisingly Thanissaro has chosen a 
              rendering ("not pinned down") that stresses the epistemic or cognitive, 
              and would tend to imply that a self does (or at least might) exist, but 
              one that is too inscrutable to say anything about.<br><br>To continue, 
              when the verb na upalabbhati is made into a present participle, the 
              meaning would be "non-obtaining" (or more precisely, a 
              "not-being-obtained-ness"). When this present participle is inflected in
               the locative case, then various meanings are possible, and here arises 
              the second point of controversy. What function does the locative have in
               this context? There are three possibilities:<br><br>Spatial or situational stipulative: "Where there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br>Temporal stipulative: "When there is a non-obtaining of self...."<br>Causative: "Because there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli,
               Bodhi and I of course favour the causative, for the other two would 
              leave a loophole that there might be some time or place where self does 
              obtain. Thanissaro of course favours a reading that will leave his 
              mysticism intact. So here too it's a case of our prior assumptions 
              determining how we translate.<br><br>Now for "saccato thetato". Sacca 
              means true or a truth; theta means sure, firm, or reliable, or something
               that has these features. Adding the suffix -to turns these words into 
              adverbs. Here I'm not really sure about the relative merits of the above
               translations, or even if there is a difference between "X does not 
              obtain as a truth" or "X does not in truth obtain." Not that this 
              matters greatly; the crux of the matter is obviously the word 
              anupalabbhamÄ�ne. The difference between my old rendering and the 
              ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi one is that I had taken saccato thetato to be an 
              adverbial qualification of anupalabbhamÄ�ne, whereas ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli and Bodhi 
              make it more like an adjectival qualification of "self and what belongs 
              to self." I now think that their rendering is more likely to be correct.
               At least it seems to accord better with the á¹¬Ä«kÄ� to this sutta.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Dhammanando Bhikkhu</p>

               should carefully heed the two reasons that the Buddha does not declare,
               ‘’There is no self’’:  not because he recognizes a transcendent self of
               some kind (as some interpreters allege), or because he is concerned 
              only with delineating ‘’a strategy of perception’’ devoid of ontological
               implications (as others hold), but (i) because such a mode of 
              expression was used by the annihilationists, and the Buddha wanted to 
              avoid aligning his teaching with theirs; and (ii) because he wished to 
              avoid causing confusion in those already attached to the idea of self.  
              The Buddha declares that ‘all phenomena are nonself’’ (sabbe dhamma 
              anatta), which means that if one seeks a self anywhere one will not find
               one.  Since ‘’all phenomena’’ includes both the conditioned and the 
              unconditioned, this precludes an utterly transcendent, ineffable self."</span></span></span></span></span><br> <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;"><br>(Part

              ‘blinding spell’ is still strong, the purpose of the practice appears to
               swerve towards dispassion, dis-identification and disassociation.  In 
              fact it is quite fine even if it is understood that way but many can’t 
              stop at dispassion and dis-identification and rest in perfect 
              contentment in groundlessness.  Somehow they will ‘conjure’ out a 
              permanent unchanging state to rest upon.  ‘Not self, not mine’ sounds as
               if there is something ‘Mine or Self’.  I would prefer practitioners to 
              treat ‘anatta’ as ‘there is absolutely nothing that can be said to be 
              mine or self’; even then this realization that ‘there is absolutely 
              nothing that can be said to be mine or self’ should not be misunderstood
               as the experiential insight of anatta (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">see On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection</a>).
                I have placed stronger emphasis on this aspect as in Buddhism, nothing
               is more important than to arise the insight of anatta and dependent 
              origination because it is wisdom (prajna wisdom in particular) that 
              liberates (since the cause of suffering is ignorance).  Do not take it 
              too lightly. :)<br> <br> Nevertheless this progression seems quite inevitable because the mind is
               ruled by ignorance (dualistic and inherent tendency).  More amazingly, 
              the mind can fabricate such a state and think that it is the resting 
              place, nirvana.  This is the danger of all dangers because like what Rob
               said, it is so beautiful and fits so nicely into the ideal model of an 
              inherent and dualistic mind.  When a practitioner gets into it, it is 
              difficult to let go.</p>

Dhammanando that i liked<br>http://www.lioncity.net/buddhism/index. ... 3364&amp;st=60<br>Citing the relevant suttas is unlikely to be persuasive to those who have fallen for Thanissaro's mystical drivel, for Thanissaro would simply interpret them differently or else would translate them differently so as to make them support his view. A good example of this is the following passage from the AlagaddÅ«pamasutta, which is one of the starkest and most uncompromising assertions of the non-existence of self.... until Thanissaro gets his hands on it:<br><br>attani ca attaniye ca saccato thetato anupalabbhamÄ�ne<br>(MN. 22; also cited in the KathÄ�vatthu's debate on the puggalavÄ�da, Kvu. 68)<br><br>And here are some extracts from an old article of mine discussing this phrase...<br><br>First I cite seven translations of it:<br><br><br>Dhammanando:<br>"...since in truth and reality there obtains neither self nor what belongs to self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi:<br>"...since a self and what belongs to a self are not apprehended as true and established..."<br><br>Thanissaro:<br>"...where a self or what belongs to self are not pinned down as a truth or reality..."<br><br>B.C. Law:<br>"...But both soul and that which belongs to soul being in truth, and forever, impossible to be known..."<br><br>I.B. Horner:<br>"But if Self and what belongs to Self, although actually existing are incomprehensible..."<br><br>MahÄ�makut Tipiá¹­aka:<br>"...meua attÄ� lae borikhÄ�n neuang duai attÄ� bukkhon theu ao mai dai, doey khwÄ�m pen khong jing, doey khwÄ�m pen khong thae..."<br><br>MahÄ�chulalongkorn Tipiá¹­aka:<br>"...meua thang ton lae khong thii neuang kap ton ja yang hen mai dai, doey khwÄ�m pen khong jing, doey khwÄ�m pen khong thae..."<br><br><br>Then my comments:<br><br>Of the seven renderings above, those of Horner and Law are completely off the map, while the remaining five are more or less defensible so far as purely philological considerations go.<br><br>There are two key terms in the passage that give rise to disagreement: firstly, the participle "anupalabbhamÄ�ne"; secondly, the phrase "saccato thetato". How one conceives the meaning of these will determine how one interprets the passage; and how one interprets the passage will determine how one goes about translating it. The problem, of course, is that every translator's interpretation of the above phrases will be determined - or at least influenced - by his prior assumptions about the Buddha's teaching.<br><br>Let's start with anupalabbhamÄ�ne. This is the present participle of the passive form of the verb upalabhati, inflected in the locative case. In front of it is placed the negative particle na ('not'), which changes to an- in accordance with the rules of euphonic junction.</p>
              <p>Upalabhati means to obtain, get or find. So in the passive voice it would mean to be obtained, gotten or found. With the addition of the negative particle 'na' the meaning would be "not to be found."<br><br>Here's one familiar example of the verb, to be found in every Indian logic textbook:<br><br>vañjhÄ�ya putto na upalabbhati.<br>"A son of a barren woman is not to be found."<br><br>(Or as western philosophers would phrase it, " 'Son of a barren woman' does not obtain."). Elsewhere the same will be predicated of "horns of a hare", "flowers in the sky", etc.<br><br>And here arises the first point of controversy among translators and interpreters of this sutta: does the phrase "not to be obtained" mean the same as "not exist"? ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli, Bodhi and myself would answer yes. A mystically-inclined monk like Thanissaro would answer no. Unsurprisingly Thanissaro has chosen a rendering ("not pinned down") that stresses the epistemic or cognitive, and would tend to imply that a self does (or at least might) exist, but one that is too inscrutable to say anything about.<br><br>To continue, when the verb na upalabbhati is made into a present participle, the meaning would be "non-obtaining" (or more precisely, a "not-being-obtained-ness"). When this present participle is inflected in the locative case, then various meanings are possible, and here arises the second point of controversy. What function does the locative have in this context? There are three possibilities:<br><br>Spatial or situational stipulative: "Where there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br>Temporal stipulative: "When there is a non-obtaining of self...."<br>Causative: "Because there is a non-obtaining of self..."<br><br>ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli, Bodhi and I of course favour the causative, for the other two would leave a loophole that there might be some time or place where self does obtain. Thanissaro of course favours a reading that will leave his mysticism intact. So here too it's a case of our prior assumptions determining how we translate.<br><br>Now for "saccato thetato". Sacca means true or a truth; theta means sure, firm, or reliable, or something that has these features. Adding the suffix -to turns these words into adverbs. Here I'm not really sure about the relative merits of the above translations, or even if there is a difference between "X does not obtain as a truth" or "X does not in truth obtain." Not that this matters greatly; the crux of the matter is obviously the word anupalabbhamÄ�ne. The difference between my old rendering and the ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli/Bodhi one is that I had taken saccato thetato to be an adverbial qualification of anupalabbhamÄ�ne, whereas ÑÄ�á¹‡amoli and Bodhi make it more like an adjectival qualification of "self and what belongs to self." I now think that their rendering is more likely to be correct. At least it seems to accord better with the á¹¬Ä«kÄ� to this sutta.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Dhammanando Bhikkhu</p>

What is my self?" but rather "Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon? Is it really me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful but not really me or mine, why hold on.

              <p>In my experience, there can be no true letting go of 'self' until insight arises. After insight a large chunk of attachment (maybe not all) does dissolve away.<br><br>Just as Thusness wrote:<br><br><br> "...When one is unable to see the truth of our nature, all letting go is
               nothing more than another from of holding in disguise. Therefore 
              without the 'insight', there is no releasing.... it is a gradual process
               of deeper seeing. when it is seen, the letting go is natural. You 
              cannot force urself into giving up the self... purification to me is 
              always these insights... non-dual and emptiness nature...."<br> <br> ~ Thusness<br><br><br> <br> "...it seems that lots of effort need to be put in -- which is really 
              not the case. The entire practice turns out to an undoing process. It is
               a process of gradually understanding the workings of our nature that is
               from beginning liberated but clouded by this sense of ‘self’ that is 
              always trying to preserve, protect and ever attached. The entire sense 
              of self is a ‘doing’. Whatever we do, positive or negative, is still 
              doing. Ultimately there is not-even a letting go or let be, as there is 
              already continuous dissolving and arising and this ever dissolving and 
              arising turns out to be self-liberating. Without this ‘self’ or ‘Self’, 
              there is no ‘doing’, there is only spontaneous arising. :)"<br> <br> ~ our forummer, Thusness (source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225462">Non-dual and karmic patterns</a>)</p>

Our parents taught us grasping and attachment, giving meaning to things, believing firmly that we exist as a self-entity and that things belong to us. From our birth that's what we are taught. We hear this over and over again, and it penetrates our hearts and stays there as our habitual feeling. We're taught to get things, to accumulate and hold on to them, to see them as important and as ours. This is what our parents know, and this is what they teach us. So it gets into our minds, into our bones.</span></p>

If you recognize it, then you think, "Oh! My whole pile of shit doesn't have the value of a small piece of gold!" and then you will want gold instead; you won't want the dung anymore. If you don't recognize this, you remain the owner of a pile of dung. If you are offered a diamond or a ruby, you won't be interested. </span></p>

              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>I have a question:</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether we realize it or not, there is in reality no doer (ie. no self) anyways.  So what is the difference (where day to day life is concerned) between having realized it and not?  Why the need to get enlightened if life is going to unfold exactly the way it is meant to unfold anyways?</p>
              <p> </p>

The Buddha said ‘Volition, O monks, is what I call actions’. In other words, when there is intention, there is karmic action which results in the consequences of character forming and determines our inclinations and thus our future actions and reaction. Character thus, is the tendency of our will, form from repeated actions. </span></span></p>

It also presume and includes the idea of individuality or individual character, if it is free, it express the particular character of the individual. The difference between a law of nature and free will is that one acts automatically and with universal sameness, while the other is conscious and individual. Free will is a relative term. It is the relationship of a conscious individual towards his surrounding or toward a certain situation. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It also means the freedom to express one’s own will according to one’s own nature and insight. It is not a mechanical reaction, and may or may not follow general laws, but one can modify them and converts them into individual laws. There can be no absolute free will. When necessity from outside coincide with the inner law or nature of the individual, it becomes a truly genuine expression of freedom, of free will itself.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To the Buddhists, Free Will is a freedom inside the limits of Necessity, namely the necessity of retribution based on the Law of Causality. It is the freedom to move within the boundaries of causation, a freedom inside the prison of Dependent Origination. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Life itself is a constant movement towards an issue in final deliverance. It is an evolution of our moral progress. When all good deeds have brought their fruition as in the Law of Karma, final deliverance will be attained in Nirvana. The absolute is reached, causation than become extinct and Free Will, will become an inconsequential factor in one’s life.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddha stigmatized one of his comtemporaries, Gosala Maskariputra as a ‘bad man’. Gosala believes in an extreme form of determinism that denies absolutely freewill and all moral responsibility. To him all things are fixed and nothing can be changed. Everything depends on fate, environment and nature. He denies all moral duty and was unrestraint in his personal behaviour. To the Buddha, he is like a fisherman, catching men only to destroy them eventually, and that is not what Buddhism taught us to believe, act and behaves.</span></span></p>
