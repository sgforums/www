              <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span><span style="color: #003366;">//Yes, according to this line of
              reasoning, even "will" is dependent on conditions... none of which
              is within "our" control. In short, whether we have the will to
              change our course and get out of samsara or not is also not in
              "our" control. Everything just happens accordingly. Is that
              correct?//</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Karma in Buddhism is strictly psychological
              and not metaphysical. The Buddha said ‘Volition, O monks, is what I
              call actions’. In other words, when there is intention, there is
              karmic action which results in the consequences of character
              forming and determines our inclinations and thus our future actions
              and reaction. Character thus, is the tendency of our will, form
              from repeated actions.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Free will is the expression of one’s own
              will, the will that correspond to one’s own nature. It also presume
              and includes the idea of individuality or individual character, if
              it is free, it express the particular character of the individual.
              The difference between a law of nature and free will is that one
              acts automatically and with universal sameness, while the other is
              conscious and individual. Free will is a relative term. It is the
              relationship of a conscious individual towards his surrounding or
              toward a certain situation.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It also means the freedom to express one’s
              own will according to one’s own nature and insight. It is not
              a mechanical reaction, and may or may not follow general laws,
              but one can modify them and converts them into individual laws.
              There can be no absolute free will. When necessity from outside
              coincide with the inner law or nature of the individual, it becomes
              a truly genuine expression of freedom, of free will
              itself.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">To the Buddhists, Free Will is a freedom
              inside the limits of Necessity, namely the necessity of retribution
              based on the Law of Causality. It is the freedom to move within the
              boundaries of causation, a freedom inside the prison of Dependent
              Origination.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Life itself is a constant movement towards
              an issue in final deliverance. It is an evolution of our moral
              progress. When all good deeds have brought their fruition as in the
              Law of Karma, final deliverance will be attained in Nirvana. The
              absolute is reached, causation than become extinct and Free Will,
              will become an inconsequential factor in one’s
              life.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Buddha stigmatized one of his
              comtemporaries, Gosala Maskariputra as a ‘bad man’. Gosala believes
              in an extreme form of determinism that denies absolutely freewill
              and all moral responsibility. To him all things are fixed and
              nothing can be changed. Everything depends on fate, environment and
              nature. He denies all moral duty and was unrestraint in his
              personal behaviour. To the Buddha, he is like a fisherman, catching
              men only to destroy them eventually, and that is not what Buddhism
              taught us to believe, act and behaves.</span></span></p>

              <p>Think about the control aspect in this way: If you're given ingredients only enough to bake a cake, it's impossible that you can construct a drivable volkswagon out of them. But you can perhaps bake a chocolate cake, a black forest cake, banana cake etc. That's the control afforded to "free" will.

              <p>This is a good analogy.  The question I have is: even whether a person ultimately has the "will" to make a cake or not out of all the given ingredients is all but an unfolding of life, if there really is no self to will (or not) it.  Is that correct, if not, where is the loophole in that line of reasoning?</p>

              <p>If everything is an unfolding of life, then there must be some grand set of rules that life follows (which is beyond the human intellect).  So in that sense, everything is predetermined ie. given a set of conditions, there is a certain outcome based on the workings of the set of rules, which then becomes input/conditions for the next outcome and so on, and thus life unfolds itself.  Is that correct?</p>

              <p>Something I wrote in my e-book:<br><br>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</p>
              <p>No-self does not imply determinism.<br>As I wrote to someone:<br>............<br>Yes but not to be mistaken that will has no part in all these. The teaching of anatta or no self does not deny will or the aggregates... The buddha teaches that a sentient being is simply a convention for five aggregates: matter/body, feelings, perception, volition, consciousness. Notice that volition is part of it. This will/volition can be directed towards a wholesome or unwholesome path. However, also remember that the five aggregates are empty of self - and are without agent. Does that mean there is no free will? In a sense yes, but neither does it imply determinism: another dualistic extreme. Free will means subjective controller determines action, determinism means objective world determines subjective experience. In reality there is no subject and object - in thinking just thought, in hearing just sound. But there are requisite conditions for every manifestation. Those conditions can be changed if there is a correct path.<br> <br>A concrete example: if you ask a beginner to run 2.4km in 9 minutes with an unfit body, that is asking for the impossible. No matter how hard willed is he, he is never going to make it. Why? The current requisite conditions of his body is such that the result of running 9 minutes is impossible. Control, agency, doesn't apply when manifestation always arise due to conditions.<br> <br>It however also means that if you exercise regularly for months or years, there is no reason the body (conditions) cannot be improved to the degree that running 9 mins is definitely possible. This is what I mean by working with conditions.<br> <br>So those teachers who say meditation are useless are not understanding latent tendencies and conditions. They mistook no doership with some kind of fatalism. Every proper practice has its place in working with one's conditions.<br> <br>Just because there is no self, no doer, doesn't mean my body is fated to be unfit and I can't reach the 9 min. Just because I exercise regularly doesn't mean I am reinforcing the notion of self or doership. In any case, action is always without self.<br> <br>It also does not mean that "will" has no place at all. "Will" is often misunderstood to be linked to a self or agent that has full control over things, whereas it is simply more manifestation and conditions. Yes, sheer will going against conditions isn't going to work – this is not understanding no-self and dependent origination. But if will is directed properly with correct understanding of no-self and conditionality, at a proper path and practice, it can lead to benefits.<br> <br>That is why the first teaching of Buddha is the four noble truths: the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of suffering, the way to end suffering.

              <p>Something I wrote in my e-book:<br> <br> http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</p>
              <p>No-self does not imply determinism.<br> As I wrote to someone:<br> ............<br> Yes but not to be mistaken that will has no part in all these. The
              teaching of anatta or no self does not deny will or the
              aggregates... The buddha teaches that a sentient being is simply a
              convention for five aggregates: matter/body, feelings, perception,
              volition, consciousness. Notice that volition is part of it. This
              will/volition can be directed towards a wholesome or unwholesome
              path. However, also remember that the five aggregates are empty of
              self - and are without agent. Does that mean there is no free will?
              In a sense yes, but neither does it imply determinism: another
              dualistic extreme. Free will means subjective controller determines
              action, determinism means objective world determines subjective
              experience. In reality there is no subject and object - in thinking
              just thought, in hearing just sound. But there are requisite
              conditions for every manifestation. Those conditions can be changed
              if there is a correct path.<br>  <br> A concrete example: if you ask a beginner to run 2.4km in 9 minutes
              with an unfit body, that is asking for the impossible. No matter
              how hard willed is he, he is never going to make it. Why? The
              current requisite conditions of his body is such that the result of
              running 9 minutes is impossible. Control, agency, doesn't apply
              when manifestation always arise due to conditions.<br>  <br> It however also means that if you exercise regularly for months or
              years, there is no reason the body (conditions) cannot be improved
              to the degree that running 9 mins is definitely possible. This is
              what I mean by working with conditions.<br>  <br> So those teachers who say meditation are useless are not
              understanding latent tendencies and conditions. They mistook no
              doership with some kind of fatalism. Every proper practice has its
              place in working with one's conditions.<br>  <br> Just because there is no self, no doer, doesn't mean my body is
              fated to be unfit and I can't reach the 9 min. Just because I
              exercise regularly doesn't mean I am reinforcing the notion of self
              or doership. In any case, action is always without self.<br>  <br> It also does not mean that "will" has no place at all. "Will" is
              often misunderstood to be linked to a self or agent that has full
              control over things, whereas it is simply more manifestation and
              conditions. Yes, sheer will going against conditions isn't going to
              work – this is not understanding no-self and dependent origination.
              But if will is directed properly with correct understanding of
              no-self and conditionality, at a proper path and practice, it can
              lead to benefits.<br>  <br> That is why the first teaching of Buddha is the four noble truths:
              the truth of suffering, the cause of suffering, the end of
              suffering, the way to end suffering. This path arises as a result
              of his direct insight into no-self and dependent origination.<br>  <br> Like a doctor, you don't tell your patients "you are fated to be
              ill and sick and in pain, because there is no individual
              controller, everything is the will of God". That is nonsense.
              Instead, you diagnose the illness, you seek the cause of illness,
              you give a treatment that eliminates the cause of illness. There is
              no self, there is no controller, but there is conditions and
              manifestation and a way to treat bad conditions. This is the way of
              the four noble truths.</p>

              conditions. Our actions are influenced by our intentions and
              imprints. So there is intentions. And there is imprints -- for
              example something bad happened to you in the past with a
              person, and now every time you see the person you have a bad
              impression of him, and hence affects your behavior. Or certain deep

              <div>Thanks for your email. I have been working a lot so it took a
              little while to get back to you.<br></div>
              <div>

              <p>Hello Daniel,</p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I just read your blook. Your chapter on No-Self vs True Self
              is very good. I feel it is much better than the chapter on the same
              topic in the book Path with Heart by Jack Kornfield. Could you
              allow me to ask you a couple of questions here?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to this chapter, basically you don't agree with
              Advaita's concept of True Self and Oneness. Is this correct?</div>
              </blockquote>
              <div><blockquote>
              <div>Second, all Advaita people basically assert that humans
              have no free will. Here is a sample short article to show what I
              mean:</div>
              <div><a style="color: #2a5db0;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/teachers/freewill_balsekar.htm"> http://www.advaita.org.uk/discourses/teachers/freewill_balsekar.htm</a><br></div>
              <div>I think this view is closely connected to their another
              view which is seeing this world completely as an illusion and
              dream. I think Buddhism's dependent origination is a better
              description for perceived reality. As I read some Buddhism
              books, when they talk about Karma, they all say humans have a
              choice to change the future course. I interpret this as saying that
              humans have free will in Buddism's view. Is this correct? If so,
              how does this reconcile with no-self/ego teaching?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Best regards,</div>
              </blockquote></div>
              </div>
              <div>I am a pragmatist, so I think that concept that help people
              are key.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Tbe Buddha addressed this topic, and I agree with his answer.
              He said that when training in Morality assume free will, as it
              helps. Thus, you presume that you can make healthy choices about
              how to speak and act and think, and so you proceed with the notion
              that you are in control and can make yourself and your world
              better.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>When doing Insight practices, you do the complete opposite as
              much as possible. You assume that sensations arise on their own in
              a causal, natural way and as much as possible you try to see that
              aspect of things. That said, until concentration, mindfulness, and
              continuity of practice are strong, one makes a lot of effort to see
              things as they are and stay with the natural arising and vanishing
              of sensations.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>From an ultimate point of view, and from a strictly Buddhist
              technical point of view, there is no free will. All the sensations
              of effort and will are themselves causal, and thus, while there are
              definitely the impressions of free will, these themselves are made
              of moments that arise and vanish on their own according to the laws
              that govern causality.</div>

              do not happen by chance or randomly (nor is it pre-determined, nor
              is there free will or a separate controller), but according to
              conditions. Our actions are influenced by our intentions and
              imprints. So there is intentions. And there is imprints -- for
              example something bad happened to you in the past with a
              person, and now every time you see the person you have a bad
              impression of him, and hence affects your behavior. Or certain deep

              <div><br></div>
              <div>Thanks for your email. I have been working a lot so it took a
              little while to get back to you.<br></div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div style="color: #500050;">
              <div></div>
              </div>
              <div>I am a pragmatist, so I think that concept that help people
              are key.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Tbe Buddha addressed this topic, and I agree with his answer.
              He said that when training in Morality assume free will, as it
              helps. Thus, you presume that you can make healthy choices about
              how to speak and act and think, and so you proceed with the notion
              that you are in control and can make yourself and your world
              better.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>When doing Insight practices, you do the complete opposite as
              much as possible. You assume that sensations arise on their own in
              a causal, natural way and as much as possible you try to see that
              aspect of things. That said, until concentration, mindfulness, and
              continuity of practice are strong, one makes a lot of effort to see
              things as they are and stay with the natural arising and vanishing
              of sensations.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>From an ultimate point of view, and from a strictly Buddhist
              technical point of view, there is no free will. All the sensations
              of effort and will are themselves causal, and thus, while there are
              definitely the impressions of free will, these themselves are made
              of moments that arise and vanish on their own according to the laws
              that govern causality.</div>
              <div><br></div>

              <p>No, it is uncommon topic in buddhism but more common in the west where the notion of free will or determinism is being expounded or the debate between free will and determinism is common due to the influence of monotheism.</p>

              tot we alr stated:-
              
              Beliefs that are contrary to the law of kamma 
              
              There are three philosophies which are considered by Buddhism to be wrong view and which must be carefully distinguished from the teaching of kamma: 
              
                  1. Pubbekatahetuvada: The belief that all happiness and suffering arise from previous kamma (Past-action determinism). 
              
                  2. Issaranimmanahetuvada: The belief that all happiness and suffering are caused by the directives of a Supreme Being (Theistic determinism). 
              
                  3. Ahetu-apaccayavada: The belief that all happiness and suffering are random, having no cause (Indeterminism or Accidentalism). 
              
                  Concerning this, we have the Buddha's words: 
              
              
              "Bhikkhus, these three sects, on being questioned by the wise, fall back on tradition and stand fast on inaction. They are: 
              
              1. The group of ascetics or Brahmins which teaches and is of the view that all happiness, suffering and neutral feeling are entirely a result of kamma done in a previous time. 
              
              2. The group of ascetics and Brahmins which teaches and is of the view that all happiness, suffering and neutral feeling are entirely a result of the will of a Supreme Being. 
              
              3. The group of ascetics and Brahmins which teaches and is of the view that all happiness, suffering and neutral feeling are entirely without cause. 
              
              "Bhikkhus, of those three groups of ascetics and Brahmins, I approach the first group and ask, 'I hear that you uphold this teaching and view ... Is that so?' If those ascetics and Brahmins, on being thus questioned by me, answer that it is so, then I say to them, 'If that is so, then you have killed living beings as a result of kamma committed in a previous time, have stolen as a result of kamma done at a previous time, have engaged in sexual misconduct ... have uttered false speech ... have held wrong view as a result of kamma done in a previous time.' 
              
              "Bhikkhus, adhering to previously done kamma as the essence, there are neither motivation nor effort with what should be done and what should not be done ... Not upholding ardently what should be done, nor abandoning what should be abandoned, those ascetics and Brahmins are as if deluded, lacking a control, incapable of having any true teaching. This is our legitimate refutation of the first group of ascetics and Brahmins holding these views. 
              
              "Bhikkhus, of those three groups of ascetics and Brahmins, I approach the second group ... and say to them, 'If that is so, then you have killed living beings because of the directives of a Supreme Being ... stolen the goods of others ... engaged in sexual misconduct ... uttered false speech ... have held wrong view because of the directives of a Supreme Being.' 
              
              "Bhikkhus, adhering to the will of a Supreme Being as the essence, there are neither motivation nor effort with what should be done and what should not be done ... 
              
              "Bhikkhus, of those groups of ascetics and Brahmins, I approach the third ... and say to them, 'If that is so, then you have killed living beings for no reason whatsoever ... stolen the goods of others ... engaged in sexual misconduct ... uttered false speech ... have held wrong view for no reason whatsoever.' 
              
              "Bhikkhus, adhering to accidentalism as being the essence, there are neither motivation nor effort with what should be done and what should not be done ..."[42]
              
                  The first of these three schools of thought is that of the Niganthas, about which we can learn some more from the Buddha's words: 
              
              
              "Bhikkhus, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are of this view, 'All happiness and suffering are entirely caused by previous kamma. For this reason, with the exhausting of old kamma through austerities, there will be no influence exerted by kamma-results. When there is no more influence of kamma-results, kamma is ended. With the ending of kamma there is an ending of suffering. With the ending of suffering there is an ending of feeling. With the ending of feeling, all suffering is eventually extinguished.' Bhikkhus, the Niganthas are of this view."[43] 
              
                  The following words from the Buddha clearly illustrate the Buddhist view: 
              
              
              "Listen, Sivaka. Some kinds of feeling arise with bile as condition ... with changes in the weather as condition ... with inconstant behavior as condition ... with danger from an external source as condition ... with kamma-results as condition. Any ascetic or Brahmin who is of the view that, 'All feeling is entirely caused by previous kamma,' I say is mistaken."[44] 
              
                  These words discourage us from going too far with kamma by considering it as entirely a thing of the past. Such a view encourages inactivity; passively waiting for the results of old kamma to ripen and taking things as they come without thinking to correct or improve them. This is a harmful form of wrong view, as can be seen from the Buddha's words above. 
              
                  Significantly, in the above passage, the Buddha asserts effort and motivation as the crucial factors in deciding the ethical value of these various teachings on kamma. 
              
                  The Buddha did not dismiss the importance of previous kamma, because it does play a part in the cause and effect process, and thus has an effect on the present in its capacity as one of the conditioning factors. But it is simply one of those conditions, it is not a supernatural force to be clung to or submitted to passively. An understanding of the Principle of Dependent Origination and the cause and effect process will clarify this. 
              
                  For example, if a man climbs to the third floor of a building, it is undeniably true that his arriving is a result of past action -- namely, walking up the stairs. And having arrived there, it is impossible for him to reach out and touch the ground with his hand, or to drive a car around. Obviously, this is because he has gone up to the third floor. Or, having arrived at the third floor, whether he is too exhausted to continue is also related to having walked up the stairs. His arrival there, the things he is able to do there and the situations he is likely to encounter, are all certainly related to the "old kamma" of having walked up the stairs. But exactly which actions he will perform, his reactions to the situations which he meets there, whether he will take a rest, walk on, or walk back down the stairs and out of that building, are all matters which he can decide for himself in that present moment, for which he will also reap the results. Even though the action of walking up the stairs may still be influencing him (for example, with his strength sapped he may be unable to function efficiently in any given situation), whether he decides to give in to that tiredness or try to overcome it are all matters which he can decide for himself in the present moment. 
              
                  Therefore, old kamma should be understood in its relation to the whole cause and effect process. In terms of ethical practice, to understand the cause and effect process is to be able to learn from old kamma, understanding the situation at hand, and to skillfully make a plan of action for improving on and preparing for the future.
