              <p>Hi there -</p>
              <p>I know this topic has been asked many times but please bear with me.  I have read from many different sources that one's present life is determined by the karma created in one's past lives and that the karma one creates in this life will affect our future lives.  This explains why some people who have done very bad things in this life are enjoying a very good life, and vice versa.</p>
              <p>My problem is that I am not convinced of the existence of past and future lives.  The concept of past/future lives is something very much faith-based (I tend to think that when I die, my physical body and whatever mental energy left will just disintegrate and become part of nature).</p>
              <p>Could someone kindly explain the existence of karma please without having to make the assumption of the existence of past and future lives?</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi allkosong, karma wouldn't make sense without rebirth, as karma spans lifetime, so things you do this life may not ripen (you can be a very evil person and still live good life without being caught as karma can take lifetimes to play out, or you can be a very good person and still get persecuted by others due to past life karma).</p>
              <p>As for rebirth: this should be taken by faith if you are a Buddhist. There are 1) countless practitioners, including those in this forum who have very clear vivid memories of their past lives due to their meditation practice 2) scientific evidence from research done by scientists like Dr Ian Stevensons that supports the existence of rebirth, which are published in well known scientific and medical journals, research into children's past life memories and tracking what they remember to their source like their past life location and house and family members which all turns out to be true. This is fascinating to say the least, and there are other scientists doing the same and you can find some of their videos in youtube.</p>
              <p>If you cannot accept rebirth, at least keep an open mind.</p>

              <p>I think you can think this way. Whether there is past lives or not, there are certain factors prior to your present life that determines how you are born. Eg. the date you are born, your characteristics, your constitution, the amount of suffering or fortune in your life etc. are all unique and different from others. Therefore, there is some unseen factor governing these differences.  And these factors has to come before your birth in terms of time for it to be able to affect you at the beginning of youor life.  If we go by common-sense, the kind of factors that affect one is dependent on the conditions that give rise to them, there is some kind of rule that is abided by.  So you can consider this rule to be karma.</p>
              <p>If you are wise and smart, you will create conditions that will lead to future positive factors, ie. what you do now could affect you further down the road.  It doesn't matter when that is, because the person it will affect is you.  Eg. if you want to have a certificate, you have to study hard for many years before you get it.  You can't get the certificate by quitting school. It is the same logic here. Create the conditions for the outcome you want.</p>

              <p><span>Honorable Venerable Master, I have a doubt that required your enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p><span>As a Buddha's disciple, I have been observing vegetarian and Buddha remembrance practice for many years. According to Buddha/sages teachings, the practitioners would be blessed by Buddhas of the past, present and future, blessed by the spirits of the nether world and those powerful heavenly beings. In addition, past evil karma, would gradually eradicated, even if there are animosity, it will be protected from good will. The aforementioned was firmly in accordance with the teachings stated in Sutra,and is certainly not falsity or false-tell. However, in the month of March 1920, an obituary letter from ShangHai has shaken our understanding on causual effect. It was pertaining to an old lady - Mdm Teo who was cultivating  Buddha remembrance and observed vegetarian for more than 20 years. She was also often present at the Buddhist Lodge attending Dharma Lecture. This old lady was always urging others to practice Buddha remembrance and to observe vegetarian. She was very compassionate in doing good deeds. Unfortunately, one day, while on her walking journey delivering vegetarian meal to a fellow practitioner, she was knocked down by a car and died. Thereafter, her dead body was in the custody of police for three days, before her children and grandchildren knew it and transported it back to perform burying in peace. After reading this unfortunate episode in the context of Buddhism teachings, I personally felt extremely astonished and worried. Up till now, my doubt on causaul effects in this regards has still not been clarified. Even those practitioners in the Buddhism community also had developed similar doubt. Henceforth, I wrote this letter, pleading for Venerable Master's compassionate clarification and guidance, on the rationale behind her unfortunate encounter in her final breath, and whether she was rebirth in Amitabha Pureland,and also to let all practitioners understand and be peace of mind on the path in Buddhism. My utmost respect and thankful for the unsurpassed compassionate enlightenment advice.</span></p>

              <p><span>From your letter, it revealed that you were not really clear about the truth of Buddha Dharma. I personally (Venerable Master Ying Kuang), since neither from the beginning, has conceived evil karmic seeds that are beyond calculator. Elaborated in the Flower Adornment Sutra - if evil karmic seeds have its form,the atmosphere in the 10 directions (north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, top and bottom) and across atmoshperes of all the universes, are not able to accommodate them. You ought to understand that the sincere cultivation of the Absolute one, would be able to transform karma. It would transform heavy karmic into lighter one; future retributions into present retributions. The naked eyes of sentient beings only can experience the truth of good &amp; bad phenomenons at that given moment. They are unable to realize the episodes of past &amp; future karmic development. This old lady has been cultivating good deeds for many years, although she may have experienced this unfortunate accident, it eliminated her bad causual effects of the past lives,  that supposed to be atoned in the 3 bad realms, and rebirth in the 3 good realms. If she has true faith and vow towards Amitabha Land of Ultimate Bliss, she was able to rebirth in the Western Paradise. However, my enlightenment mind were not opened yet (</span><span><span>ä»–å¿ƒé�“çœ¼ </span></span><span>[Psychic </span><em><span>Power with regards to the mind</span></em><span>] is one of the inherent </span>Six Psychic <em>Power</em> == <span>å…­ç¥žé€š </span>(http://fodian.goodweb.cn/dict_read5.asp?ID=332)<span>) Therefore, I cannot firmly state that she has already rebirth or not rebirth in Pureland.</span></p>

              <p><span>Nevertheless, I only can firmly claim that good deeds beget good causual effects, while bad deeds beget bad causual effects. Conducting good deeds resulted in bad effects, is due to past lives of bad karmic retributions, and is not as a result of present good deeds being cultivated. As for you all, experienced this old folk undergoing this bad effect and arose the doubtful on sages teachings that good causes begets bad eventuality, this was due to your lack of kind nature that had given rise to evil perception/view. As a result, astonishment, worried and doubts had taken precedence. This sentience's point of view is no different from those haven't contacted with the teachings of inherent wisdom / Buddha dharma. For practitioners who have deep root and nature faith in sage words, would never develop egoism of doubt and worry. Matter related to causual effects are heaped piled endlessly. The result of this cause is not being retributed, while the result of that effect erupts first. It is liken  to the nature of sowing paddy rice, the earlier one would harvest first; It is also liken to owing of debt, the most powerful would be in force first.</span></p>

              <p><span>Thus, there are those doing good deeds, and met with evil death. In fact, it is the eradication of past evil deeds, while the next rebirth is being retributed with rich &amp; honor, wealth &amp; rank and nobility. For instance, during the Song Dynasty, there was a Venerable who dearly wished to renovate this hall by the name called precious stone hall [</span><span><span>èˆ�åˆ©æ®¿</span></span><span>]. He proceeded to seek for donation from a wealthy and powerful official, the title of this official was known as “brother-in-law king” (( </span><span><span>äº²çŽ‹ </span></span><span>based on transliteration from mandarin) or the  brother of the Emperor whom the title was being conferred by Emperor in the kind of dynasty throne). He was very worked up with the meager sum being donated, and reacted negatively by chopping off his own hand in front of the hall. He was bled to death. On the other hand, the wife of this official had given birth to a son, but this baby has never stopped crying. The nanny cradled him here and there in the hope to pacify him. When she has walked towards the place displaying the picture of this precious stone hall, the baby immediately stopped his crying, as and when she moved away from the picture, the baby started to cry again. The nanny then brought along this picture to accompany the baby to stop his cry and never seen him crying again. When this official came to know about this abnormal occurrence, he sent a man to inquire about this Venerable. He realized that his son birth date and the death of this Venerable matched perfectly. The official then realized something amissed and begun to do and completed the renovation of this precious stone hall. When his son reached 20 years old, the Emperor of that time has no son to take over his throne. He  ordered to past over his throne to this child, and had became the Emperor then, for a period of 41 years, historically known as </span><span><span>å®‹ç�†å®—</span></span><span>.The venerable who died badly rebirth as a crying child. This eventful story was recorded in the magazine called </span><span><span>é˜¿è‚²çŽ‹å±±å¿—</span></span><span>. I read this article while I (referring to Patriarch Yin Kuang) was performing the practice of prostration of the precious stone for tenths of days.</span></p>

              <p>For practitioner who has insight on the nature of enlightenment, in whatsoever the encounters of life that are undergoing, the doubt on causual effects would never arise. Practitioners that lack of insight, and remained strong guarded on rule and custom of practice, and without understanding the complexity of its causual effects, and given rise to delusion of view and doubtful, was generally due to lack of rightful perception. For instance, the saying of blessings accorded to those Buddha remembrance practitioners is in fact, true. However, the complete lack of understanding on sages teachings relating to the transformation of heavy and future karma into present retribution and light effects, would result in the aforementioned doubtful view against sages teachings, and it can never be precluded.</p>

              <p>In the past in India, a highly honorable and great <em>Abhidharma  </em>Master namely Venerable “Precept Virtue” (<span><span>æˆ’è´¤è®ºå¸ˆ</span></span>) –</p>
              <p>(<strong>Tripitaka <span>ä¸‰è—�ï¼ˆç¶“ã€�å¾‹ã€�è«–ï¼‰ï¼š</span></strong>Sanskrit; literally, "the three baskets". It refers to the Buddhist canon, which has three parts: the <em>sutras</em>, the <em>Vinaya</em>, or monastic code, and the <em>Abhidharma – </em>Buddhist philosophical treatise.].. He was a renown venerable across India with high attainment. In view of his past evil deeds, born with diabolical illness, the affliction he undergone was extremely bad that he no longer could endure it. While desire arises for suicide to end this suffering, Manjushri <span><em>æ–‡æ®Š</em>è�©è�¨</span>, Samantabhadra <span><em>æ™®è´¤</em></span><em>, and </em>Avalokitesvara <span><em>è§€ä¸–éŸ³ </em></span><em>appeared to explain the rationale of his suffering, that he has been a ruler for many lifetimes in his past lives, who had conducted harmful acts towards sentience under his ruling, and hence, should rightfully demoted into the hell realm in this lifespan to atone his past evil deeds. Nonetheless, attributing to his dharma propagation, this small human sufferings in this present life was actually the atonement of his lengthy kalpa periods of hellish retribution. The advice was to endure and go through with it.</em></p>

              <p> The aforementioned Bodhisavattas further informed him that there was this venerable Hsuan Chuang (<span><span>çŽ„å¥˜</span></span>) who would be arriving 3 years later to receive the transferring of Buddha dharma. Upon listening the advice, <span><span>æˆ’è´¤è®ºå¸ˆ</span> </span>endured the sufferings and remorse for his past evil deeds done as rulers. Gradually, he recovered and 3 years later,  venerable Hsuan Chuang arrived.  <span><span>æˆ’è´¤è®ºå¸ˆ</span></span>then asked his disciple to tell Venerable Hsuan Chuang about the terrible experience of suffering undergone by his teacher. In the process, this disciple cried badly while conveying the painful experience. In this regard, the tremendous degree of suffering undergone by  <span><span>æˆ’è´¤è®ºå¸ˆ</span> </span>was very palpable. This is some good examples for those practitioners who lack of wisdom in the causual effects and those who failed to understand the karma of past lives and  defame Buddha dharma based on the bad effect experienced by high attainment like that of Venerable <span><span>æˆ’è´¤</span> </span>or doubtful on those great practitioners who have suffered in extremely bad circumstances along the path of Buddhism. For moderate level practitioners who are mildly realized, would certainly arise misleading view and developing doubt. For those who are lack of kindness nature, they would withdraw the faith in pursuing the goal of enlightenment path. There is this incorrect perception arises upon witnessing the living example of those who conducted evil acts but gained prosperity and fame, which in fact, it is the devoid of understanding on the complexity of past deeds and future fruition. The transformation of future and heavy effects into the present and light effects, and further transformation of present and light retributions into future and heavy effects. This is the result of various types of causual effects and its complexity as well as the nature of its disorderliness.</p>

              What is Reborn ?
              
              A very good, classic &amp; somewhat complex question!
              
              In brevity:
              
              Causes &amp; Conditioning is passed on &amp; reborn ...
              
              No being, substance, soul or self is reborn as such assumed constant entity or core substance has never existed or ever been observed in the first place...
              So how can it then ever be 'reborn' !!!
              
              Existence is a chain of discrete mental states (dhammas) all new yet conditioned
              by the prior, both proximate and far.
              
              Just like the pearl in a necklace is in contact with the next &amp; next &amp; next etc.
              
              In that way do the prior mental moment condition the next;
              
              Some Examples:
              
              If angry now in this moment one cannot be happy in the immediate next moment,
              but is conditioned to be either angry also there or indifferent!
              
              If glad now in this moment one cannot be angry in the immediate next moment,
              but is conditioned to be either glad also there or indifferent!
              
              One is 'reborn' in every moment of life!
              Frequency = ~ billions/second!
              
              The conditioning in the terminal life moment is crucial as it determines the next state:
              
              If having killed many beings in life how then to die in a peaceful &amp; calm state ?
              Due to the agitation of remorse &amp; regrets in death moment =&gt; bad state rebirth.
              
              If having given &amp; done much good in life it is easy to die in peaceful state !
              Due to the satisfied serene content in death moment =&gt; good state rebirth.
              
              Mind or consciousness descends &amp; settles at a new level corresponding or fitting
              to its last mixture of characteristics. Very mechanic &amp; not metaphysical at all!
              
              Like a protein molecule sediments in a mixed solution according to its boyancy.
              
              or
              
              Like a comet goes into a orbit around a planet according to its own speed, mass &amp; inclination angle.
              
              No entity or person is found:
              But a Noself state1 arising and ceasing 
              conditioning state2 arising and ceasing
              conditioning state3 arising and ceasing 
              conditioning state4 arising and ceasing
              conditioning state5 arising and ceasing
              etc ... endlessly until Nibbana ...

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>Thank you for taking time to answer.  Just to clarify:  I do not dispel the existence of karma and past/future lives, I am just not sufficiently convinced at this point.</p>
              <p>Let me give an example:</p>
              <p>Even if cause and effect ie. karma does indeed exist, there are so many hundreds and thousands of other factors in life that even if I plant a mango seed, I may not end up with mango fruits, eg. there may not be enough rain or sunshine, the mango seedling may get eaten up by bugs, the mango tree may be uprooted in a storm before it bears fruits, etc etc etc.  With the same logic, it seems that if one does good, one may not necessarily reap good results since so many other influences/factors in life come into play.  (Like wise, when one does evil, one may not necessarily reap bad results.)</p>

              <p><br>Personally i don't think there is anything wrong with it... imagine the "pest", "barren soil" or "drought" u facing are your negative karma taking places.</p>
              <p>What I know is- if the "weight" of the karma can take precedence over the "lighter" ones. Which means to say, heavier good or bad karma can bear fruit 1st then u have to reap what you sow. That's why even good people do good things cannot enjoy good result in this life. They got all the bad things happened to them.</p>
              <p>Karma complicated to explain leh lol. Some actions you do doesn't means you can reap in this very life. It can only grow maybe the next few lifetime lol</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>The definition of merits and how to acquire them are not difficult to find. So, will not write about them.</p>
              <p>Basically, my understanding is that the Dharma Teaching is the mechanism for leading Beings out of suffering and the rebirth cycle. So activities that promotes its right understanding and peoples' contact with the Dharma benefits ones' right understanding and progress along the path.</p>
              <p>Likewise, activities that obstruct or confuse others with regards to the Dharma, will result in obstruction and confusion on the path.</p>
              <p>We don't have to go far to see this effect. Already there are people patronising this forum who are experiencing the effect of confusing others with regards to the teaching, leading to their own confusion.</p>

              <p><br>indeed complicated.</p>
              <p>it's a mental seed. i see the seeds as something indestructible. like a lotus seed, as hard as a rock and can last for thousand years, and yet can still sprout.</p>
              <p>it can also be like a ripple dropped into a pool of water that radiates out and effect others to ripple and interact, in the form of collective karma. as when u are near someone that's angry, u will also not feel good.</p>

              <p>it can also be like a snowball that roll down from a mountain and slowing become bigger and bigger untill it cause a destruction. as at time, anger are builded up slowly in abuse cases.</p>

              <p>No, repent means sincerely knows that he has done wrong and will never do it again. There are many people including Buddhists who don't understand the true meaning of Buddhist repentance, many thought that after chanting a certain sutra, one's sins (ye zhang) will be reduced. That's not true. ä½›æ³•æ˜¯å¿ƒæ³•ï¼Œä»¥å¿ƒä¸ºå®—.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>The definition of merits and how to acquire them are not
              difficult to find. So, will not write about them.</p>
              <p>Basically, my understanding is that the Dharma Teaching is the
              mechanism for leading Beings out of suffering and the rebirth
              cycle. So activities that promotes its right understanding and
              peoples' contact with the Dharma benefits ones' right understanding
              and progress along the path.</p>
              <p>Likewise, activities that obstruct or confuse others with
              regards to the Dharma, will result in obstruction and confusion on
              the path.</p>
              <p>We don't have to go far to see this effect. Already there are
              people patronising this forum who are experiencing the effect of
              confusing others with regards to the teaching, leading to their own
              confusion.</p>

              <p>Can do kind deeds and contribute (financially, physically, etc) to activities that promotes the dharma.</p>
              <p>In my experience, life actually got tougher (with more obstacles) after i practice seriously. But don't get discouraged.... I use the obstacles in life to appreciate Buddha's teaching.</p>

              <p>No, repent means sincerely knows that he has done wrong and will never do it again. There are many people including Buddhists who don't understand the true meaning of Buddhist repentance, many thought that after chanting a certain sutra, one's sins (ye zhang) will be reduced.

              I believe someone once asked the Buddha:
                      
              1) Why someone is born smarter than others?
                  
              2) Why someone can be beautiful, not so beautiful and some born ugly?
                      
              3) Why someone is born in a rich family while someone is born in a poor family?
              
              Why is there such disparity and inequality in the world?
                      
              The world-honored one then gives a sermon on it but i can't find the link where i read it from!!!
                      
              Karma is can be "quite a scientific topic". You need to go deeper to understand it.
                      
                      
                      
              ------
                      
              Looking at your example :
                      
              Let me give an example:
                      
              Even if cause and effect ie. karma does indeed exist, there are so many hundreds and thousands of other factors in life that even if I plant a mango seed, I may not end up with mango fruits, eg. there may not be enough rain or sunshine, the mango seedling may get eaten up by bugs, the mango tree may be uprooted in a storm before it bears fruits, etc etc etc.  With the same logic, it seems that if one does good, one may not necessarily reap good results since so many other influences/factors in life come into play.  (Like wise, when one does evil, one may not necessarily reap bad results.)
                      
              Kindly advise what is wrong with the above line of reasoning.
                      
              -----
                      
              Ans: If one wants mango, what are the cause and condition for having an apple?
                      
              1)mango seed
              The conducive conditions: 
              2) Soil, water, sunlight and right climate
              3) Time
              4) No external conditions to disrupt its growth. 
                      
              You are right. When we plant mango seed, does not mean that we will get mango. We need all the other conditions in order for a mango tree to grow and eventually reap a fruit. However, it does not dispel the fact that, in order to have mango, we need mango seed. We can't use durian seed to grow mango right?
                      
              When one does good, one is planting good cause and also fostering good conditions. The reasons why we have a mixture of good and bad experience is because we have done both good and bad in the past.  
                      
              Don't underestimate the power of doing good deed. A single drop of water (good deeds) can accumulate to an ocean which can dissolve the salt (the bad karma) in the water. I hope you can understand this analogy.

              <p><br>Thank you for your reply.  Yes, I understand that if I want mango fruits, I have to plant a mango seed to begin with.  I guess it is the part where I am not guaranteed mango fruits even when I plant a mango seed due to so many external conditions (which are really beyond my control) which bothers me.  Planting a mango seed only ensures that the probability of getting mango fruits is not zero, but then the probability could be just 1 percent with the other 99 percent dependent on external conditions.  It is a bit like buying a lottery ticket - the ticket gives you a chance to win the lottery, but the probability of winning is 0.000000001 percent, so why bother?</p>
              <p>It just seems to me that with so many external factors in life which are beyond our control, what we reap is really quite randomly determined.  So does it really matter what we do?</p>
              <p>I want to believe in karma but I just haven't come across any explanation/observation/analogy that is sufficiently convincing.</p>
