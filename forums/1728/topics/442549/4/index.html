              <p>People who are ill fated in this life are very interested to know what they had done in their past life to deserve all these in this life. They are also interested to know what can be done to have a better life. Why wait till then to change life which is sometimes too late.</p>
              <p>You can challenge anyone or anything in this world except Karma. It is the most silly thing to challenge karma because you will always be the loser. No God or Buddha can reverse the effect of karma. However, Buddha taught how to lighten our sins and how not to let the conditions arise for karma to materialise. That's the beauty of Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Hi.  For me, I am able to accept the explanation of each moment being self 1, self 2, self 3, etc.  The question that follows is:  if self 1, self 2, self 3 etc are not the same entity/"person", why is it that the this-moment-self (let's call it self 10) can feel and identify with the pain/suffering of self 1, self 2, self 3 etc (ie. past-moment-selves) and has a natural tendency to protect self 15, 16 , 17, etc (ie. future-moment-selves) from suffering?</p>

              <p>I see where you are coming from because I used to think like that when I was younger.  My current situation is that I am 50/50 % with regards to whether karma and past/future lives exist or not.</p>
              <p>IF they indeed exist, then it may just be possible that you are able to feel the sufferings in your next life should there be some kind of continuity of consciousness into the next life.</p>
              <p>This topic is very profound.  We may never be fully convinced one way or the other.  In any case, do keep an open mind.</p>

              <p>In short... the movement or inclination to aleviate suffering, in 'oneself' or 'others' conventionally speaking, is compassion.</p>
              <p>Compassion in ordinary deluded person is tainted with the sense of duality, the sense that there is a 'me' in here, who wants to eliminate suffering in 'other'.</p>
              <p>Compassion not tainted by such delusion is simply a spontaneous action arising according to wisdom to aleviate suffering without much of an emotional based attachment. In Diamond Sutra, it is said that a Bodhisattva should give rise to great compassion and the will to save all sentient beings, and yet he should not think that there is a self, and a sentient being being saved, because such views of a 'self' and 'sentient being' is wrong view.</p>
              <p>It is actually very simple and it is not necessary to make it more complicated.</p>
              <p>As an analogy:</p>
              <p>You see a fire burning in front. Your wisdom spontaneously arise an action to get away from the fire, rather than getting burnt.</p>
              <p>No need for 'I' notion needed. In fact sometimes in such dangerous situation, there is not even time to think about 'I'. Sometimes people make heroic acts, run into the fire and save some children... all the way thoughtless, without any sense of 'I'. What is this? Spontaneous uncalculated action out of compassion, which does not give rise to thought of 'I' and 'others'.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva functions through spontaneous wisdom and compassion, no thoughts required. No sense of 'I' or 'others' required. In fact a Bodhisattva, having realized no-self, will effortlessly experience no-self in everyday life... rather than in special situations like fire burning.</p>

              that which is an expereince always never stays, so, find out what is permanent and being stubborn about wanting to find out what is permanent may  make u move inwards, inwards and .... 
              Truth spoken is a lready the past, turht cannot be found in scriputures, sutras - though the latter may avail u of techniques - use them as devices  but being attached to this devices is the misunderstanding- along the way it has to drop.
              U are already realised and it only needs recognition - nothing to add, nothing to minus - the key is being present to your being  or being present to ur self . 
              
              
              PS : When one is being .... one is absent to the self. Self is what one thinks of onself. Being is what one is being now (here-now) . My talking about love is simple mind-games, My being loving is the real existential happening!

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Rebirth in Buddhism is a belief (the belief is more prominent and important in the teaching of the Mahayanist traditions).

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By the way, one do find Buddhists, especially westerners who do not belief in cosmic rebirths, but interpret rebirth more as a mental becoming, and rebirth as a continuous momentary flow that goes on and on until cessation of suffering is attained. </span></p>

              that which is an expereince always never stays, so, find out what is permanent and being stubborn about wanting to find out what is permanent may make u move inwards, inwards and â€¦.
              Truth spoken is a lready the past, turht cannot be found in scriputures, sutras â€“ though the latter may avail u of techniques â€“ use them as devices but being attached to this devices is the misunderstanding- along the way it has to drop.
              U are already realised and it only needs recognition â€“ nothing to add, nothing to minus â€“ the key is being present to your being or being present to ur self .
              
              PS : When one is being â€¦. one is absent to the self. Self is what one thinks of onself. Being is what one is being now (here-now) . My talking about love is simple mind-games, My being loving is the real existential happening!

There are many Suttas on these two subjects, they go hand in hand. The reason I said it is emphasized more in the Mahayanist tradition, is because of the Bodhisattva Ideals. Without the teaching of rebirth, the doctrine would fall flat. Not so with rebirth in the Theravada tradition. That is why the Western Buddhists can interpret it differently and still called themselves as Buddhist.</span></span></p>

              <p>In short... the movement or inclination to aleviate suffering, in 'oneself' or 'others' conventionally speaking, is compassion.</p>
              <p>Compassion in ordinary deluded person is tainted with the sense of duality, the sense that there is a 'me' in here, who wants to eliminate suffering in 'other'.</p>
              <p>Compassion not tainted by such delusion is simply a spontaneous action arising according to wisdom to aleviate suffering without much of an emotional based attachment. In Diamond Sutra, it is said that a Bodhisattva should give rise to great compassion and the will to save all sentient beings, and yet he should not think that there is a self, and a sentient being being saved, because such views of a 'self' and 'sentient being' is wrong view.</p>
              <p>It is actually very simple and it is not necessary to make it more complicated.</p>
              <p>As an analogy:</p>
              <p>You see a fire burning in front. Your wisdom spontaneously arise an action to get away from the fire, rather than getting burnt.</p>
              <p>No need for 'I' notion needed. In fact sometimes in such dangerous situation, there is not even time to think about 'I'. Sometimes people make heroic acts, run into the fire and save some children... all the way thoughtless, without any sense of 'I'. What is this? Spontaneous uncalculated action out of compassion, which does not give rise to thought of 'I' and 'others'.</p>
              <p>A Bodhisattva functions through spontaneous wisdom and compassion, no thoughts required. No sense of 'I' or 'others' required. In fact a Bodhisattva, having realized no-self, will effortlessly experience no-self in everyday life... rather than in special situations like fire burning.</p>

              <p>My situation has been different from yours.  Even though I can't see my past lives like some other people can, for years, I could not shake the certainty that rebirth and karma are real.  I even persisted in believing in karma and rebirth while immersed in a Abrahamic religion that calls all other faiths/creeds tricks of the devil. </p>

              <p>"Purna, consider space: its substance is not the various phenomena, yet that 
              does not prevent all phenomena from being included within it. How do we know 
              that? Purna, empty space is bright on a sunny day, and dark when the sky is 
              cloudy. It moves when the wind rises, it is fresh when the sky clears. It is 
              turbid and hazy when the weather is foul, it is obscure when a dust storm breaks 
              out. It casts a bright reflection on a pool of clear water. Do you think these 
              conditioned phenomena come into existence at different places? Are they created 
              from these conditions themselves or is their origin in space. If they arise from 
              these conditions, Purna, then on a sunny day, since the sun is bright, all 
              worlds of the ten directions should take on the form of the sun. Then why, on a 
              sunny day do we see the round sun in the sky? If space is bright, space itself 
              should shine. Then why, when there is a covering of clouds and fog, is no light 
              evident? You should know that the brightness is not the sun, nor space nor other 
              than the space or the sun. Contemplate how phenomena are ultimately false and 
              cannot be verified. They are like flowers conjured up in space that cannot bear 
              fruit. Why, then, investigate how such phenomena appear and disappear? 
              Contemplate how the nature is ultimately truth and is solely the wonderful 
              enlightened brightness. That wonderful enlightened bright mind originally was 
              neither water nor fire. Why, then, ask about incompatibility? <br><br>"The truly 
              wonderful enlightened brightness is the same way. You recognize space, and space 
              appears. Recognizing earth, water, fire, and wind, each will appear. If all are 
              recognized, all will appear. How can they all appear? Purna, consider the sun's 
              reflection as it appears in a single body of water. Two people gaze at it, both 
              at the same time. Then one person walks east and the other walks west. Each 
              person, still looking at the water will see a sun go along with him, one to the 
              east, one to the west, while there seems to be no fixed direction for the 
              movement of the sun's reflection. Don't belabor the question and ask, 'If there 
              is one sun, how can it follow both people? Or if the sun is double, why does 
              only one appear in the sky?' This is just revolving in falseness, because such 
              things cannot be proven. <br><br>"Purna, you think that form and emptiness 
              overcome and destroy one another in the Treasury of the Tathagata. Thus the 
              Treasury of the Tathagata appears to you as form and emptiness throughout the 
              Dharma Realm. And so, within it the wind moves, emptiness is still, the sun is 
              bright, and the clouds are dark. The reason for this lies in the delusion of 
              beings who have turned their backs on enlightenment and joined with the defiling 
              dust. Thus, the wearisome defilements come into being and mundane phenomena 
              exist.</p>

              To Aik TC: something unrelated.
                                                                    
              Remember about the discussion about one lives/three lives model of D.O.?

              The consciousness being spoken here obviously is conditioned consciousness, since this is part of the twelve afflictive links of dependent origination.
              
              The consciousness, as explained by buddha, also refers to the linking consciousness or gandhabba, which in mahayana traditions is known as the antarabhava and bardo consciousness.
              
              All these are already known.
              
              But what I find interesting about this sutta is that it puts down the claims that Buddha only had the one life model in mind when he talks about twelve links.
              
              This is clearly not the case as he talks about consciousness here as the gandhabba which when descended into the womb serves as the condition for the maturation of the fetal body. This consciousness is then conditioned by karmic/mental formations, which logically of course has to come from a previous life (it can't possibly appear out of nowhere).

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The soul is considered as a permanent eternal entity that moves on from one body to another as the old one dies. The Buddhist totally opposes such notion of a permanent entity moving from one body to another and said there is no such. No idea how to equate karmic ‘seeds’ cause by our pass karmic actions to be an eternal soul anyway. They are quite different things altogether.</span></p>

              <p><em><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span>Glossary (from <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Yogacara_glossary.html">http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Yogacara_glossary.html</a>):<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 100%;">*Alaya-vijnana</span><span style="font-size: 100%;">,</span> or "store consciousness" -- one of the central technical terms of <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Yogacara.html">Yogacara</a> (Vijnanavada, Vijnaptimatra) philosophy of Mahayana Buddhism. Early 
                              Buddhists taught about existence of six-fold consciousness, that is the 
                              conciousness of five types of perception (visual, audial, etc.) and of 
                              "mind" (</em><em>manovijnana). The <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/Buddhism/Vijnanavada.htm">Yogacarins</a> analysing the source of consciousness added two more kinds of consciousness. They are: </em><em>klistamanovijnana, or </em><em>manas, that is the ego-centre of an empirical personality, and </em><em>alaya-vijnana
                               which is the source of other kinds of consciousness.<strong> Alaya-vijnana is 
                              above subject-object opposition but it is not a kind of absolute mind: 
                              alaya-vijnana is momentary and non-substantial. </strong>Every sentient being 
                              with the corresponding to this being "objective" world can be reduced to
                               its "own" alaya-vijnana. Therefore, classical Yogacara states the 
                              existence of many alayas. </em></p>
              <p><em>The Alaya-vijnana is a receptacle and container of the so-called "seeds" (</em><em>bija), or elementary units of past experiences. These </em><em>bijas
                               project themselves as an illusionary world of empirical subjects and 
                              corresponding objects. All other seven types of consciousness are but 
                              transformations (</em><em>parinama) of alaya-vijnana. In the course of its
                               yogic practice a Yogacarin must empty alaya-vijnana of its contents. 
                              Thus the Yogacarin puts an end to the tendency of external projections 
                              of alaya-vijnana changing it into <a href="http://www.kheper.net/topics/nonduality/index.html">non-dual</a> (</em><em>advaya) wisdom (</em><em>jnana) of Enlightened mind.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Madhyamika followers, the repository consciousness is rejected either ultimately or even conventionally... since karmic seeds are mere potentials and not manifested concrete realities.</p>
              <p>Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche explains:</p>
              <p><em>Specifically, Madhyamika does not accept the Yogachara base because if causes for negative karma are created, then, when secondary circumstances arise, karma will inevitably manifest. That potentiality is not something concrete on the material level that can get lost, change, or lose its capacity to manifest. For example, though a physical body can have a shadow, we cannot see the shadow if no secondary cause exists. When a secondary cause like light or sunshine is present, then the shadow appears immediately. So a repository, the Yogachara concept of the base, is not necessary. In short, in the Madhyamika view, when a karmic seed is produced a consequence always follows, but a consequence that manifests only in the presence of secondary causes.</em></p>
