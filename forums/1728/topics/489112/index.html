              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><br> <span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">NEW DELHI — A top Tibetan monk who is seen as a
              potential successor to the Dalai Lama is to be prosecuted for money-laundering
              after an Indian court overturned a decision to drop charges, police said today.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>At a hearing yesterday at the
              Himachal Pradesh High Court, a judge issued an order for authorities to open
              criminal proceedings against Karmapa Urgyen Trinley over the recovery of around
              US$1 million (RM3.8 million) in foreign currency during a raid on his Buddhist
              monastery four years ago.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Although criminal conspiracy
              charges were filed in the aftermath of the raid, a district court had dismissed
              the case in 2012 in a verdict that was later appealed and the subject of
              yesterday's hearing.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>"The impugned order of May
              21, 2012, passed by the judicial magistrate of Una is quashed and
              dismissed," Judge Sureshwar Thakur said in his judgement, a copy which has
              been obtained by AFP.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Local police Chief Anupam Sharma
              confirmed that the first step in bringing a prosecution had begun.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>"We have already filed a
              chargesheet in the court against him," Sharma told AFP, meaning that
              police have filed an outline of the evidence against the accused with the
              court.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The case dates back to a raid in
              January 2011 on a monastery in the Himalayan town of Dharamshala in which
              investigators say stacks of bank notes from 26 different currencies were
              recovered, including more than US$100,000 worth of Chinese yuan.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The raid came after two people
              were pulled over by police in a car containing large amounts of cash. During
              interrogations, the pair said the money was meant for a land deal involving a
              trust headed by Trinley.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The 30-year-old Trinley has
              denied any wrongdoing, saying the bank notes found in the monastery were
              donations from devotees which had accumulated over the years and that he had no
              involvement in the land deal.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>The monk is revered by followers
              as the 17th incarnation of the head of the Karma Kagyu lineage, one of the four
              major schools of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>He fled Tibet at the turn of the
              century at the age of 14, reaching India after an eight-day journey by foot and
              horseback over the Himalayas.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Since fleeing, he has mainly
              lived at the Gyuto Monastery in Dharamshala, the northern Indian hill station
              that is the seat of the Tibetan government in exile.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>Trinley is recognised by both China
              and the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the Karmapa Lama, head of the Karma
              Kagyu lineage, one of Tibetan Buddhism's four major schools.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";  '>He is seen as having the highest
              profile of a cast of young lamas who could succeed the Dalai Lama who has just turned
              80.</span></p>
