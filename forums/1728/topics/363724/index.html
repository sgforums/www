              <p>Bhante Gunaranta:</p>
              <h3><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: medium;">Chapter 16</span></h3>
              <h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">What's 
                                  In It For You</span></h2>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">You 
                                can expect certain benefits from your meditation. The initial 
                                ones are practical, prosaic things; the later stages are profoundly 
                                transcendent. They run together from the simple to the sublime. 
                                We will set forth some of them here. Your own experience is 
                                all that counts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Those things that we called hindrances or defilements are more 
                                than just unpleasant mental habits. They are the primary manifestations 
                                of the ego process itself. The ego sense itself is essentially 
                                a feeling of separation -- a perception of distance between 
                                that which we call me, and that which we call other. This perception 
                                is held in place only if it is constantly exercised, and the 
                                hindrances constitute that exercise. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Greed and lust are attempts to get 'some of that' for me; hatred 
                                and aversion are attempts to place greater distance between 
                                'me and that'. All the defilements depend upon the perception 
                                of a barrier between self and other, and all of them foster 
                                this perception every time they are exercised. Mindfulness perceives 
                                things deeply and with great clarity. It brings our attention 
                                to the root of the defilements and lays bare their mechanism. 
                                It sees their fruits and their effects upon us. It cannot be 
                                fooled. Once you have clearly seen what greed really is and 
                                what it really does to you and to others, you just naturally 
                                cease to engage in it. When a child burns his hand on a hot 
                                oven, you don't have to tell him to pull it back; he does it 
                                naturally, without conscious thought and without decision. There 
                                is a reflex action built into the nervous system for just that 
                                purpose, and it works faster than thought. By the time the child 
                                perceives the sensation of heat and begins to cry, the hand 
                                has already been jerked back from the source of pain. Mindfulness 
                                works in very much the same way: it is wordless, spontaneous 
                                and utterly efficient. Clear mindfulness inhibits the growth 
                                of hindrances; continuous mindfulness extinguishes them. Thus, 
                                as genuine mindfulness is built up, the walls of the ego itself 
                                are broken down, craving diminishes, defensiveness and rigidity 
                                lessen, you become more open, accepting and flexible. You learn 
                                to share your loving-kindness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Traditionally, Buddhists are reluctant to talk about the ultimate 
                                nature of human beings. But those who are willing to make descriptive 
                                statements at all usually say that our ultimate essence or Buddha 
                                nature is pure, holy and inherently good. The only reason that 
                                human beings appear otherwise is that their experience of that 
                                ultimate essence has been hindered; it has been blocked like 
                                water behind a dam. The hindrances are the bricks of which the 
                                dam is built. As mindfulness dissolves the bricks, holes are 
                                punched in the dam and compassion and sympathetic joy come flooding 
                                forward. As meditative mindfulness develops, your whole experience 
                                of life changes. Your experience of being alive, the very sensation 
                                of being conscious, becomes lucid and precise, no longer just 
                                an unnoticed background for your preoccupations. It becomes 
                                a thing consistently perceived. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Each passing moment stands out as itself; the moments no longer 
                                blend together in an unnoticed blur. Nothing is glossed over 
                                or taken for granted, no experiences labeled as merely 'ordinary'. 
                                Everything looks bright and special. You refrain from categorizing 
                                your experiences into mental pigeonholes. Descriptions and interpretations 
                                are chucked aside and each moment of time is allowed to speak 
                                for itself. You actually listen to what it has to say, and you 
                                listen as if it were being heard for the very first time. When 
                                your meditation becomes really powerful, it also becomes constant. 
                                You consistently observe with bare attention both the breath 
                                and every mental phenomenon. You feel increasingly stable, increasingly 
                                moored in the stark and simple experience of moment-to-moment 
                                existence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Once your mind is free from thought, it becomes clearly wakeful 
                                and at rest in an utterly simple awareness. This awareness cannot 
                                be described adequately. Words are not enough. It can only be 
                                experienced. Breath ceases to be just breath; it is no longer 
                                limited to the static and familiar concept you once held. You 
                                no longer see it as a succession of just inhalations and exhalations; 
                                it is no longer some insignificant monotonous experience. Breath 
                                becomes a living, changing process, something alive and fascinating. 
                                It is no longer something that takes place in time; it is perceived 
                                as the present moment itself. Time is seen as a concept, not 
                                an experienced reality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> This is simplified, rudimentary awareness which is stripped 
                                of all extraneous detail. It is grounded in a living flow of 
                                the present, and it is marked by a pronounced sense of reality. 
                                You know absolutely that this is real, more real than anything 
                                you have ever experienced. Once you have gained this perception 
                                with absolute certainty, you have a fresh vantage point, a new 
                                criterion against which to gauge all of your experience. After 
                                this perception, you see clearly those moments when you are 
                                participating in bare phenomena alone, and those moments when 
                                you are disturbing phenomena with mental attitudes. You watch 
                                yourself twisting reality with mental comments, with stale images 
                                and personal opinions. You know what you are doing, when you 
                                are doing it. You become increasingly sensitive to the ways 
                                in which you miss the true reality, and you gravitate towards 
                                the simple objective perspective which does not add to or subtract 
                                from what is. You become a very perceptive individual. From 
                                this vantage point, all is seen with clarity. The innumerable 
                                activities of mind and body stand out in glaring detail. You 
                                mindfully observe the incessant rise and fall of breath; you 
                                watch an endless stream of bodily sensations and movements; 
                                you scan a rapid succession of thoughts and feelings, and you 
                                sense the rhythm that echoes from the steady march of time. 
                                And in the midst of all this ceaseless movement, there is no 
                                watcher, there is only watching. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> In this state of perception, nothing remains the same for two 
                                consecutive moments. Everything is seen to be in constant transformation. 
                                All things are born, all things grow old and die. There are 
                                no exceptions. You awaken to the unceasing changes of your own 
                                life. You look around and see everything in flux, everything, 
                                everything, everything. It is all rising and falling, intensifying 
                                and diminishing, coming into existence and passing away. All 
                                of life, every bit of it from the infinitesimal to the Indian 
                                Ocean, is in motion constantly. You perceive the universe as 
                                a great flowing river of experience. Your most cherished possessions 
                                are slipping away, and so is your very life. Yet this impermanence 
                                is no reason for grief. You stand there transfixed, staring 
                                at this incessant activity, and your response is wondrous joy. 
                                It's all moving, dancing and full of life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> As you continue to observe these changes and you see how it 
                                all fits together, you become aware of the intimate connectedness 
                                of all mental, sensory and affective phenomena. You watch one 
                                thought leading to another, you see destruction giving rise 
                                to emotional reactions and feelings giving rise to more thoughts. 
                                Actions, thoughts, feelings, desires -- you see all of them 
                                intimately linked together in a delicate fabric of cause and 
                                effect. You watch pleasurable experiences arise and fall and 
                                you see that they never last; you watch pain come uninvited 
                                and you watch yourself anxiously struggling to throw it off; 
                                you see yourself fail. It all happens over and over while you 
                                stand back quietly and just watch it all work. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Out of this living laboratory itself comes an inner and unassailable 
                                conclusion. You see that your life is marked by disappointment 
                                and frustration, and you clearly see the source. These reactions 
                                arise out of your own inability to get what you want, your fear 
                                of losing what you have already gained and your habit of never 
                                being satisfied with what you have. These are no longer theoretical 
                                concepts -- you have seen these things for yourself and you 
                                know that they are real. You perceive your own fear, your own 
                                basic insecurity in the face of life and death. It is a profound 
                                tension that goes all the way down to the root of thought and 
                                makes all of life a struggle. You watch yourself anxiously groping 
                                about, fearfully grasping for something, anything, to hold onto 
                                in the midst of all these shifting sands, and you see that there 
                                is nothing to hold onto, nothing that doesn't change. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> You see the pain of loss and grief, you watch yourself being 
                                forced to adjust to painful developments day after day in your 
                                own ordinary existence. You witness the tensions and conflicts 
                                inherent in the very process of everyday living, and you see 
                                how superficial most of your concerns really are. You watch 
                                the progress of pain, sickness, old age and death. You learn 
                                to marvel that all these horrible things are not fearful at 
                                all. They are simply reality. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Through this intensive study of the negative aspects of your 
                                existence, you become deeply acquainted with dukkha, the unsatisfactory 
                                nature of all existence. You begin to perceive dukkha at all 
                                levels of our human life, from the obvious down to the most 
                                subtle. You see the way suffering inevitably follows in the 
                                wake of clinging, as soon as you grasp anything, pain inevitably 
                                follows. Once you become fully acquainted with the whole dynamic 
                                of desire, you become sensitized to it. You see where it rises, 
                                when it rises and how it affects you. You watch it operate over 
                                and over, manifesting through every sense channel, taking control 
                                of the mind and making consciousness its slave. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> In the midst of every pleasant experience, you watch your own 
                                craving and clinging take place. In the midst of unpleasant 
                                experiences, you watch a very powerful resistance take hold. 
                                You do not block these phenomena, you just watch them, you see 
                                them as the very stuff of human thought. You search for that 
                                thing you call 'me', but what you find is a physical body and 
                                how you have identified your sense of yourself with that bag 
                                of skin and bones. You search further and you find all manner 
                                of mental phenomena, such as emotions, thought patterns and 
                                opinions, and see how you identify the sense of yourself with 
                                each of them. You watch yourself becoming possessive, protective 
                                and defensive over these pitiful things and you see how crazy 
                                that is. You rummage furiously among these various items, constantly 
                                searching for yourself--physical matter, bodily sensations, 
                                feelings and emotions--it all keeps whirling round and round 
                                as you root through it, peering into every nook and cranny, 
                                endlessly hunting for 'me'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> You find nothing. In all that collection of mental hardware 
                                in this endless stream of ever-shifting experience all you can 
                                find is innumerable impersonal processes which have been caused 
                                and conditioned by previous processes. There is no static self 
                                to be found; it is all process. You find thoughts but no thinker, 
                                you find emotions and desires, but nobody doing them. The house 
                                itself is empty. There is nobody home. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;"> Your whole view of self changes at this point. You begin to 
                                look upon yourself as if you were a newspaper photograph. When 
                                viewed with the naked eyes, the photograph you see is a definite 
                                image. When viewed through a magnifying glass, it all breaks 
                                down into an intricate configuration of dots. Similarly, under 
                                the penetrating gaze of mindfulness, the feeling of self, an 
                                'I' or 'being' anything, loses its solidity and dissolves. There 
                                comes a point in insight meditation where the three characteristics 
                                of existence--impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and selflessness-- 
                                come rushing home with concept-searing force. You vividly experience 
                                the impermanence of life, the suffering nature of human existence, 
                                and the truth of no self. You experience these things so graphically 
                                that you suddenly awake to the utter futility of craving, grasping 
                                and resistance. In the clarity and purity of this profound moment, 
                                our consciousness is transformed. The entity of self evaporates. 
                                All that is left is an infinity of interrelated non-personal 
                                phenomena which are conditioned and ever changing. Craving is 
                                extinguished and a great burden is lifted. There remains only 
                                an effortless flow, without a trace of resistance or tension. 
                                There remains only peace, and blessed Nibbana, the uncreated, 
                                is realized. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">So 
                                      we are asking is there a holistic awareness of all the senses, therefore 
                                      there is never asking for the 'more'. I wonder if you follow all this 
                                      ?. Are we together in this even partially? And where there is this 
                                      total - fully aware - of all the senses, awareness of it - not you 
                                      are aware of it.... the awareness of the senses in themselves - then 
                                      there is no centre - in which there is awareness of the wholeness. 
                                      If you consider it, you will see that to suppress the senses... is 
                                      contradictory, conflicting, sorrowful.... To understand the truth 
                                      you must have complete sensitivity. Do you understand Sirs? Reality 
                                      demands your whole being; you must come to it with your body, mind, 
                                      and heart as a total human being..... Insight is complete total attention....<br> When this is a fact not an idea, then dualism and division between 
                                      observer and observed comes to an end. The observer is the observed 
                                      - they are not separate states. The observer and the observed are 
                                      a joint phenomenon and when you experience that directly then you 
                                      will find that the thing which you have dreaded as emptiness which 
                                      makes you seek escape into various forms of sensation including religion 
                                      - ceases and you are able to face it and be it.<br> </span></p>

                                      move your eye-balls, just keep them very, very quiet, because there 
                                      is nothing to see now, you have seen all the things around you, now 
                                      you are seeing what is happening inside your mind, and to see what 
                                      is happening inside your mind, you have to be very quiet inside. And 
                                      when you do this, do you know what happens to you? You become very 
                                      sensitive, you become very alert to things outside and inside. Then 
                                      you find out that the outside is the inside, then you find out that 
                                      the observer is the observed.<br> </span></p>

                                      long as there is the thinker and the thought, there must be duality. 
                                      As long as there is a seeker who is seeking, there must be duality. 
                                      As long as there is an experiencer and the thing to be experienced, 
                                      there must be duality. So duality exists when there is the observer 
                                      and the observed. That is, as long as there is a centre, the censor, 
                                      the observer, the thinker, the seeker, the experiencer as the centre,

                                      not the thinker and his thought an inseparable phenomenon? Why do 
                                      we separate the thought from the thinker? Is it not one of the cunning 
                                      tricks of the mind so that the thinker can change his garb according 
                                      to circumstances, yet remain the same? Outwardly there is the appearance 
                                      of change but inwardly the thinker continues to be as he is. The craving 
                                      for continuity, for permanency, creates this division between the 
                                      thinker and his thoughts. When the thinker and his thought become 
                                      inseparable then only is duality transcended. Only then is there the 
                                      true religious experience. Only when the thinker ceases is there Reality. 
                                      This inseparable unity of the thinker and his thought is to be experienced 
                                      but not to be speculated upon. This experience is liberation; in it 
                                      there is inexpressible joy.<br> </span></p>

              <p><strong>What Keeps Us Focused on Thoughts</strong></p>
              <p><em>Question: Since I composed these questions yesterday, I've been able to briefly see them as just thoughts, but they are definitely strong enough to re-appear as reality to a separate me.</em></p>
              <p>John Wheeler: The key to all this is deeper than seeing that 'everything is just thoughts'. You need to precede that with an understanding of something solid and positive within you. Telling a man with no sense of something greater available that 'everything is just thought' is pretty much useless. Even if he tries to detach from thought there is nothing really to take its place. So he is bound to continue to cling onto some other manifestation of the mind in the attempt to find some kind of peace or stability.</p>
              <p>It is good to have a sense of something clear, steady and positive in the picture. Without this to anchor you and give you something as an alternative to the mind's concepts, there is not much chance of really letting go of the mind. We cling to the mind and thoughts out of a simple desire to find happiness, obtain security, know what is real, and so on. Attachment to the mind arises because we are not clear on the source of joy and happiness.</p>
              <p>Not knowing our true nature, which is peace itself, we have turned to the mind for the answers. The mind has provided all kinds of ideas and concepts about who we are and what is the way to peace. It is through ignorance that the innate desire for happiness keeps us focused on thoughts. In discovering our true nature, there is a profound shift of experience because we tap directly into the source of peace, clarity, and certitude. Then the focus on the mind naturally falls off because we see that it is not delivering the freedom, which is now our direct experience. Without this understanding, trying to get free of the mind is pretty much an exercise in futility.</p>
              <p>So, I would ask: How are you doing with understanding your true nature? I am referring to that sense of your presence, which is steady and clear within you. It is also the awareness which is permeating all thoughts, feelings and sensations. It is inherently peaceful and free. As the recognition of this dawns, your experience shifts from spinning in the clouds of thought to a natural abidance in something light and clear in the middle of all your experiences and activities.</p>

              <p>Based on what Thusness said years ago: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html</a></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">....How can naked awareness lead to the insight of our "Propensities"?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">Space, time, life, death, in and out are all ‘deeply held’ impressions. <span> </span>We
                  are seldom aware of the “deeply held” until we are able to rest
                  adequately in naked awareness. The nakedness creates the big contrast
                  that provides us the condition for the arising of the insight of the
                  'deeply held'. The insight into the full power of our ‘propensities’
                  and resting in naked awareness are both equally crucial in our
                  understanding of our non-dual (no subject-object duality, no separate
                  permanently existing self) and empty (interdependently originated) nature.<span><br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: arial;">To
                  consciousness 'propensities' (deep conditioning or imprints) are all
                  that matters. It is the only 'force' that blinds, bonds and prevents a
                  liberating experience. Once formed it remains latent and only surface
                  when conditions are riped for fruition. We are unable to get rid of it
                  by will. Therefore to know consciousness, it is also to know the impact
                  of deep conditioning, how it is formed and how it subsides. There is
                  really no 'why', it is just how consciousness works.<br><br>If we drop our body, we experience astral body.<br>If we drop our thoughts, we experience “I AM”.<br>If we drop ‘I’, we experience non-duality.<br><br>Every
                  major dropping results in a totally new experiential reality. Perhaps
                  that is why Lao Tze teaches us to eliminate until none to experience
                  Tao.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="font-family: arial;">To drop the bondage/deep
                  conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another way of 'knowing' is
                  possible; an effortless, total sensing and experience of wholeness.
                  Next the experiences of the joy, bliss and clarity of wholeness.
                  Without the insight into the possiblity and the experience of the
                  positive factors, the mind will not release itself from holding.</span></strong></span></span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Even
                  open pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind
                  chatters incessantly. Every what, when, where and why by itself is a
                  distancing from start. Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry aka
                  'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced
                  for the 'willingness' to arise.<br><br>P.S. there are different types of meditative bliss/joy/rapture.<br></span><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Like
                  samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss
                  associated with certain level of concentration; the bliss experienced
                  from insight into our nature differs. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">The
                  happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from
                  that experienced by a practitioner. “I AMness” is a higher form of
                  happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously chatters.
                  It is a level of bliss associated with a state of ‘transcendence’ – a
                  state of bliss resulting from the experience of “formlessness,
                  odorless, colorless, attributeless and thoughtlessness’.<br><br></span></p>
              <div class="msg-body" style="font-family: arial;">No-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct
                  experience of Oneness and no-separation. It is related to the dropping
                  of the ‘I’. When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a
                  form transcendence-oneness.  It is what Thusness called the transparency of non-duality.</div>

              <p><strong>Mindfulness</strong><br> <br>The Buddha spoke a lot about mindfulness. Because it's an important mental factor to develop, we need to understand it in the proper context.<br> <br>In our practice, we are aiming for liberation. We want to be free of all unsatisfactory conditions and their causes. This involves developing wisdom and understanding the nature of our reality. Mindfulness plays a big part in that. It's necessary for developing ethical conduct, concentration, and wisdom as well as for remembering our long-term goal. <br> <br>In terms of ethical conduct, we need to be mindful of what kinds of actions, words, and thoughts we want our body, speech, and mind to be engaged in and to be mindful what actions our body, speech, and mind are actually engaged in. That way we can monitor our behavior, checking to see if we are acting according to our aspirations. <br> <br>We try to be mindful during the day of what we're doing, what we're saying, what we're thinking, and feeling. But simply being aware is not enough. When we notice a corrupted mental state or harmful action or negative words, we need to apply the antidote and to bring our mind and thus our body and speech back in line with our goal. <br> <br>Being aware and directing our body, speech, and mind in a positive direction for the purpose of liberation and enlightenment is a tall call to do daily on a moment-to-moment basis.<br> <br>The body and speech don't move without the mind moving. In other words, the mind is the root of all actions. Nonetheless, it is easier to correct the harmful actions of body and speech first. It's good to start focusing our mindfulness on them, particularly on our speech.<br> <br>Speech is a powerful tool that can bring devastation or benefit, so it's important to be careful with what we say. Let's practice being aware of what we're saying, why we're saying it, how we're saying it, how much we're speaking, and about what topics we speak. Let's remember that our motivation in speaking is to benefit self and others.<br> <br>By practicing in this way, our mindfulness grows and takes us step by step towards our goal of liberation and enlightenment. </p>
