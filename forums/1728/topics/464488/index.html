              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Continuing with the discussion on the 
              limitedness of language - the very sentence 'I see the table' assumes that the 
              table 'I' see is out there somewhere separate from me. And as a corollary which 
              we will deal with later on, this 'I' which sees really existing is in fact the 
              center of the seeing and the table out there, which 'I' see also really 
              exist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Let us take another example. We say the lighting 
              flashed, this is similar in structure to I see. This grammatical structure 
              implies that there is a lighting that flashed. The lighting is the subject (like 
              the 'I which sees), which does the action of flashing (verb). This act is 
              different from the lighting. But, and a big but is that is there really a 
              lighting separate from flashing, or is flashing itself lighting? Can we really 
              separate flashing or take away flashing and say - here is lighting that had 
              flashed, which is separate thing from flashing? Can we really do that? If we 
              removed flashing, would lightening really remain per se? But just a few minute 
              ago we thought and felt and experience (or seem to experience) that there is a 
              lighting that had done the action of flashing, didn't we? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now, let us take this analysis back to 'I see 
              the table'. Some people may say the mind sees the table just to be clever, but 
              really we aren't changing the structure of the language and thus the structure 
              of the experience. We have just substituted the word 'mind' for 'I' and the rest 
              of the implications are still the same. There is a mind which is the subject, 
              which exists independently and it is thus independent and separate mind which 
              does that action of seeing the table, which is the object and which too is 
              independent out there (like the lighting that flashes, the mind or I see). If we 
              look at the seeing out, would there still remain a mind which sees or is the act 
              of seeing itself the ......... </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Thus, language structure is so much a part of 
              our programming samskara that we do not question the situation out there or the 
              real experience or reality/actuality or fact. It has become so much a part of 
              the way we experience things, a program that was downloaded from the time 
              prenatal/pre-conceptual moment onward or even earlier downloaded in the mother's 
              cellular memory itself. Perhaps that it does not occur to us easily that our 
              experience is molded by this grammatical structure itself. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What we tend to forget is that there is a 
              certain experience going on which the sentence 'I see the table' or 'I see the 
              sound' etc, is trying to point at. It is however never questioned whether the 
              implications evoked from the structure of the sentences is really out there or 
              not, or whether this grammatical structure is coloring and distorting the 
              experience, changing the 'pure experience' into a shape that this grammatical 
              structure demands. Even to question this seems so odd that most people would 
              never even think of it and if somebody raises such a question he/she would be 
              ridiculed by saying 'Are you crazy?' Have you gone off the rocks? But didn't 
              Galileo face the same taunts when he questioned whether the sun really went 
              around earth? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Let us go on a little journey for a short while 
              into the world of Alice in Wonderland, for that is now it would look like to the 
              programmed thinking of most people. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Suppose you have a grown up with a different 
              grammatical structure. We have already said that the sentence 'I see the table' 
              is pointing at a certain experiential act. But the grammatical structure here 
              demands thing are there in the experience. We'll continue with this in the next 
              article. </span></p>

              <div class="contentarea"><a id="ctl00_ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_MainContent_Previous"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&lt;&lt; Previous</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">    </span><a id="ctl00_ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_MainContent_Next"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Next &gt;&gt;</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">    </span><a id="ctl00_ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_MainContent_Toc"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Table of Contents</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The grammatical structure demands that there is 
              an 'I' or mind that is the subject or the seer, watcher, knower, that this 'I' 
              sees or goes through the action of seeing, which is an action verb, which is 
              different from the 'I' which is a pronoun and there is a different noun, 
              separate from both the verb (seeing) and the pronoun 'I' which is the table. The 
              'table' is the object, a noun and distinctly separate and independent from the 
              subject and the verb. And this unquestioned programming is so deeply ingrained 
              into our subconscious mind that we can safely say that, that is how everybody 
              experiences the experience of what the sentence 'I see the table' is trying to 
              point at. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now suppose you had grown up in another 
              grammatical structure. Remember that language is meant to point at an 
              experience. So if an Alice in Wonderland language also pointed equally well at 
              that experience it would fulfill the purpose of language. So we all know that an 
              experience is a process and not really a thing - entity per se. So seeing a 
              table is a process, a verb, and not an entity, a noun. So suppose you had grown 
              up with a grammatical structure which says 'tabling is going on' to point at the 
              same experience which the sentence 'I see the table' is also trying to point at. 
              We can certainly say that the sentence 'tabling is going on' can equally well 
              point at the same experience which the sentence 'I am seeing the table' points 
              at.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Infact, since it is actually a process (this 
              experience), tabling is going on is a more accurate finger to point at it. Now, 
              if you had grown up with this grammtical sturcture, would the experience (and 
              the grammatical structure) imply that there is a separate table (noun-object) 
              from the act of seeing the table (verb)? And would the structure impose an 'I' 
              upon the experience like imposing a separate lightning different from the 
              flashing of the light? Is there a lightning separate from the flashing which 
              does the flasing or is the flashing itself the lightning? But flashing is an 
              action a verb, the lightning is a noun, an object. Or is the 'Light' distinct 
              from the flasing created merely by the langauge? Likewise, is there an 'I' that 
              sees or is the act of seeing specified by the Alice in Wonderland language 
              'Tabling' itself the 'I' the seer? But I is a pronoun, seer a noun and 
              seeing/tabling are verbs. When I say 'I see', this is a seeing I. This 'I' is 
              defined by the 'seeing'. Now there are two questions here. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The first questions is: Is not this 'I' that 
              sees dependent upon the seeing of the table? Can we really say that the 
              I/seer/watcher/knower that sees will continue to exist even when the seeing 
              stops? If so, we will have a so-called seer who does not see? Can there be a 
              seer that does not see? Is not the seer-I defined by seeing process. Can we 
              really speak of a seer when it is not seeing/tabling? The word Seer would be 
              meaningless without the seeing, wouldn't it? We cannot call the seer a seer if 
              there is no seeing going. If that is true than when seeing stops the seer also 
              stops or ceases to exist.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The second question is that is there is a seer 
              separate from the act of seeing or is it only an illusion created by the 
              language structure, like the lightning and its flashes? Can there be a seer 
              remaining [a noun] which does not see but was the one that did the seeing? Can 
              we really separate the verb of seeing from the seer the noun or is the seer (and 
              therefore the 'I') merely an illusion imposed up the experience?

              <td>
              <div class="contentarea"><a id="ctl00_ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_MainContent_Previous"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">&lt;&lt; Previous</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">    </span><a id="ctl00_ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_MainContent_Next"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Next &gt;&gt;</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">    </span><a id="ctl00_ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_MainContent_Toc"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Table of Contents</span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">If you had grown up with the sentence structure 
              'Table is going on' to point at the same experience, would you be straddled with 
              an 'I-seer' that sees and a table that is seen? Tabling is a process, and 
              actually there is process going on which the sentence 'I see the table' is 
              trying to point at; however like a pair of coloured glasses it imposes a lot of 
              things on the experience which is not really out there even according to quantum 
              physics. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now we can see that the 'I' is not really such a 
              central figure in our experience, nor is it so stable or permanently unchanging 
              as it seems to be, and secondly, it is more a process, a verb, which is 
              continuously changing than an unchanging noun, which is supposedly the central 
              guy or doll in the experience. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now let us look at the unchanging 'I' from 
              another angle. When we say this 'I' is unchanging, it also implies that it is 
              the same 'I' always. Unchanging as defined in the Hindu-Buddhist systems of the 
              Indian Subcontinent meant 'remaining the same in all the three times'. As 
              Sankaracharya has defined it 'Kala traya tisthatiti', which means that which 
              remains unchanged in the three times - in all the three times - viz - past, 
              present and future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now with this in the background, let us try to 
              see if this 'I', watcher, seer or knower really remains unchanged in the three 
              times. First of all, if we look at the 'I', 'I' continually changes its 
              identity. When I'm in the office I am a manager or an executive at home, I'm a 
              son in front of my father or mother, even if I may be sixty years old. I'm also 
              a brother to my brothers and sisters. Now a wife is not the same as the 
              executive in the office, nor is a son the same as a husband. As we can see this, 
              'I' is continuously changing and becoming something else according to the 
              situation - or more technically according to the causes or conditions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now the question arises which one of them is the 
              real 'I'? We normally have hundreds of 'I' which are normally changing 
              frequently as per the situations, and none of them is the real 'I' in the sense 
              of being the unchanging, permanent 'I'. If this husband 'I' did not change and 
              become a father 'I' in front of his daughter or an executive 'I' in the office, 
              not only would there be trouble (big time trouble to say the least) but we would 
              have to call that person neurotically unbalanced, and normal social or human 
              functions would become tipsy turvy. Yet our experience seems to point at an 'I' 
              that is the same in all three times and therefore real and unchanging. So which 
              of this 'I' is the real one? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Now, let us take this 'I' as the seer, watcher, 
              knower as posited in the Vendantic system and therefore virtually all 
              non-dualist system within Hinduism. They are called watcher (drasta), witness 
              (sakchi), knower (gyata) because this 'I' watches or sees, knows and witnesses. 
              So let us analyze this watcher, seer. It is called a watcher or seer because it 
              sees. If it didn't see or watch something it would not be called a watcher, 
              seer. We cannot have a seer which does not see. If it does not or cannot see 
              anything, it cannot possible be called seer or watcher can we really? We need to 
              distinguish five points we have before we get confused. A seer can see nothing - 
              ie - the absence of things. It still sees the absence (alohara) and that is 
              really not seeing per se. We'll continue this discussion in the next article. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Continuing with the discussion of absence of 
              seeing - for example, if you are in a pitch dark room and I asked you - do you 
              see anything? You would normally say 'I do not see anything'. But this 
              expression is the result of the limitation of language itself, rather than the 
              fact that you do not see. You do continue to see the pitch darkness or the 
              absence of all things or objects. The absence or pitch darkness is also a 
              'thing' to see, so to say. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Once we have understood this, let us go another 
              step further. We have already said that a seer is defined by its seeing 
              something, even if it is an absence. There is still an absence to see and it is 
              the seer of that absence of the pitch darkness, as the case maybe. So let us 
              take this up. When I say 'I see the table' I am the seer of the table. At that 
              moment, this 'I-seer' is the seer of the table and is defined by the 'table'. If 
              there were no table to see I would not be the seer of the table, that is, I 
              would not see the table and in effect I would not and could not say 'I see the 
              table'. And if I did not see the table I would not be the seer of the table. 
              Now, if this seer of the table or the 'I' was really existing (sat in Sanskrit) 
              and therefore the same and unchanging in all three time, I would in effect be 
              eternally be seeing the table as I or the seer would not change. But no one 
              experiences that. We do not eternally continue to see the table unchangingly and 
              in actuality we as the seer see something else immediately, for instance, the 
              blue sky or the green mountain. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Again, if the seer of the table was unchanging 
              and permanent, it could not stop seeing the table and seeing the blue sky would 
              be a change. But in real life the objects seen by the seer is continually 
              changing and thus also the seer of those objects. However, in the language we 
              continuously use the same word 'I' or the same word seer-watcher-knower for the 
              seer of all those various objects. And that gives us the feeling of the same 
              'I-seer-watch-knower' being there while the so called seen objects are changing 
              like a table now, a blue sky after that, a home now, etc. etc. As before, the 
              language structure creates an illusion of something which does not really exist 
              out there. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Here again, our memory of I seeing the table 
              etc. also furthers the illusion with 'I' which is based on the memory of the 'I' 
              which had seen the table. Because of this memory, it looks like the same 'I' is 
              seeing the blue sky which had seen the table a while ago. But actually, it is an 
              illusion created by our memory supported by our language structure, thus 
              creating an experience that is not out there as it appears to be. So in effect 
              there seems to be no seer/knower/watcher which remains unchanging as the Vedanta 
              or for that matter what Sankaracharya says in his texts like Discriminating the 
              Watcher And the Watched (Drig Driksya Viveka). Understanding this is the key 
              point in knowing the difference between Hinduism and Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It is not a matter of just a difference in words 
              but a matter of seeing two diametrically opposed experiences. One is an 
              experience of validating that this 'I' is not related to this ephemeral world 
              but is an unchanging permanent really existing Self called an Atman in all forms 
              of Hinduism. However, it must be said that only the Atman of Vedantic Hinduism 
              and all those related to the non-dual system of Vedanta (directly or indirectly) 
              is a coherent Atman. </span></p>
