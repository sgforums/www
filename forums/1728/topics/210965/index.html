They are not asuras, asuras belong to another realm.<br><br>They want to obstruct people's liberation because they have no control over people who have transcended all desires and ended rebirth. They also wanted to take revenge against Shakyamuni Buddha who had a bad relationship with some of the maras in a previous lifetime, and after Buddha passed away, they promised to continue harrassing his students.<br><br>Whether they will reborn to hell is their own karma and we won't know.<br><br>But what is most important is obliterate the mara in your mind, to close the 6 sense doors that invites maras into you, then you need not fear outer maras.</div>

But they do have some good karma so they do have celestial kind of enjoyment. Demi-god = asura.<br><br>Asura always fight with the 4-heavenly-king heaven but they never win. It is their nature: they love to fight and are always jealous. You can see rebirth of asuras even in the human realm <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It's a neverending cycle, so unless you are a practitioner who recognises such folly and is detached from anger, there is endless cycle of samsaric suffering.<br><br>Now in Chinese we always say 'Yuan1 Qing1', that is not refering only to spirits. It's refering basically to 'love and hate' relationships, 'yuan' means hate, while 'qing' means very close - they fluctuate from one state to another. The one you are closest to is often the one you are most angry with (at times). This is because the ego is functioning very strong. This is the viscious cycle.<br><br>But once that cycle reaches a glimpse of truth (seen the dharma), it stops. You see the truth, you see the way to end all these nonsense and the nightmare ends. When you stop, the opposite party also stops. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
