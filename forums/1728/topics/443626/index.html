              <p>Hi people,</p>
              <p>Are we all born (into suffering) just so that we have a chance to be liberated from suffering?  Is that what life is all about?  If that is the case, nature is cruel indeed and life seems like nothing but a sick joke.</p>
              <p>Enlighten me please.</p>

              <p>Buddha didn't depict a nice and rosy picture of life.</p>
              <p>He said very clearly: ignorance is the cause of karmic formation, which results in the arising consciousness that led to birth, suffering, aging, sickness, sorrow, lamentation, and death.</p>
              <p>In other words, you are born here into suffering due to ignorance, clinging, attachments, craving.</p>
              <p>There is only one exception: if you are born here due to Bodhisattva vows. In that case you are already awakened in a previous life but continue to practice in this life and future lives in order to attain Buddhahood out of great compassion for all sentient beings. You are here to cultivate and help others attain liberation.</p>
              <p>Our life should be lived for the cultivation of virtue, for happiness (not just temporary enjoyments which lead us nowhere, but happiness from virtue, clarity, and meditative attainments and insights), for liberation from suffering and afflictions, and for helping others attain liberation.</p>
              <p>The greatest purpose of living is to live with the aspiration for the attainment of Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>Of course you can also have mundane, short-term purpose of life, like you want to make the world a better place, you want to practice philantropy and help poor people (part of cultivating virtue) and so on which are all good and commendable - but nothing mundane can compare to supramundane attainments, and helping others attain them.</p>
              <p>As an analogy, with money you can only help poor people get maybe a day or a month's food, but with liberation, you can help people end their beginningless cycle of suffering and rebirth (and prevent suffering from arising without an end in sight) - imagine, aeons of suffering and rebirth can be ended in this life.</p>
              <p>This does not mean we should stop mundane purposes and aims, just that apart from our mundane aims that we pursue (as long as they are beneficial and healthy), we should also seek to attain the supramundane.</p>

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a> at Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</a>.</p>
              <p>There he addressed the monks, saying, "Monks."</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "I will teach &amp; analyze for you the Noble 
              Eightfold Path. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, is the Noble Eightfold Path? 
              Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood,
               right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress, 
              knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with 
              regard to the stopping of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of 
              practice leading to the stopping of stress: This, monks, is called right
               view.</p>
              <p>"And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on 
              freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.</p>
              <p>"And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from 
              divisive speech, abstaining from abusive speech, abstaining from idle 
              chatter: This, monks, is called right speech.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right action? Abstaining from taking life, 
              abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity: This, monks, is 
              called right action.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right livelihood? There is the case where a 
              disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps
               his life going with right livelihood: This, monks, is called right 
              livelihood.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right effort? (<strong>i</strong>) There is the case where
               a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds 
              &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, 
              unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. (<strong>ii</strong>) He generates 
              desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his 
              intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil, unskillful qualities 
              that have arisen. (<strong>iii</strong>) He generates desire, endeavors, activates
               persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the 
              arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen. (<strong>iv</strong>) He 
              generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts
               his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, 
              development, &amp; culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen: 
              This, monks, is called right effort.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right mindfulness? (<strong>i</strong>) There is the case 
              where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself — ardent, 
              aware, &amp; mindful — putting away greed &amp; distress with reference 
              to the world. (<strong>ii</strong>) He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of 
              themselves — ardent, aware, &amp; mindful — putting away greed &amp; 
              distress with reference to the world. (<strong>iii</strong>) He remains focused on
               the mind in &amp; of itself — ardent, aware, &amp; mindful — putting 
              away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. (<strong>iv</strong>) He 
              remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves — ardent, 
              aware, &amp; mindful — putting away greed &amp; distress with reference 
              to the world. This, monks, is called right mindfulness.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right concentration? (<strong>i</strong>) There is the 
              case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from 
              unskillful (mental) qualities — enters &amp; remains in the first jhana:
               rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed 
              thought &amp; evaluation. (<strong>ii</strong>) With the stilling of directed 
              thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhana:
               rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness 
              free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal assurance. (<strong>iii</strong>)
               With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; 
              alert, and senses pleasure with the body. He enters &amp; remains in the
               third jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; 
              mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' (<strong>iv</strong>) With the abandoning of 
              pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp;
               distress — he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhana: purity of 
              equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. This, monks, is
               called right concentration."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words.</p>

              <div>Maitreya is a blessed Buddha. At the time when he arrives to be born, the earth will have gone through many changes. Mountains, rivers, cliffs and gorges will have disappeared, and most parts of the Earth will have become flat plains. The seas will be calm and the soil fertile, so there will be many natural recreational parks. Favourable weather conditions will prevail throughout the four seasons. Beautiful flowers will blossom everywhere and everything will be pleasant. Crops and harvests will be plentiful. Fruits will be beautiful and sweet. Grains will grow naturally and without husk. They will be extremely fragrant and tasty. When matured, the grains will be readily edible without the need for cooking. Feeding on them, people will enjoy longevity and will be free from sickness. There will be no natural disasters. Everyone will be kind, good-natured, and free of evil thoughts and behaviour. Greed, anger, ignorance, arrogance, suspicionï¿½. killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, false speech, intoxication ï¿½.etc, unwholesome thoughts and bad conduct all will not exist. Everyone will realise the wonderful practice of cultivating the three pure karmas of body, speech and mind. They will exhibit equality in thinking and will not discriminate. They will distance from disputes and will be amicable and joyous with each another. They will utter good words of encouragement, perform numerous virtuous deeds and refrain from all evil deeds. There will be no need to worry about food and drink. As for clothing, weaving will not be needed, since soft delicate garments of different styles will grow from celestial garment trees on earth. People can help themselves to these for clothing. Palaces and houses will miraculously appear, and the ground filth-free. As for latrines, whenever people need to relieve themselves, the ground will automatically open up to receive their waste and then close up afterward. The ground will produce different kinds of precious gems that can casually be handpicked by anyone. Admiring and playing with these gems, people will say, "I've heard that in past kalpas (possibly referring to our present kalpa) people hurt one another over such gems and precious stones. They were imprisoned and suffered all sorts of distress. Now these gems and precious stones are like tiles and stones which no one needs to guard over. This really is a pure and peaceful world."<br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><br style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">At that time, even though the world will consist of many small countries, only one big country will be the common ruler. On the Earth will be a vast plain, covering four million Li (é‡Œ ), with four great oceans located in each direction. There will exist a big city named Ketumati City (é¸¡ å¤´ åŸŽ ), spanning 500 Li from east to west, and 280 Li from north to south. The land is flat and expansive and well populated with people. The streets are neat and orderly. In the sky above, there will be a dragon king named 'Water Radiance', drizzling fragrant water at night and maintaining breezy sunny weather during the day. In the city, a Yaksa (ç½— æ�€ ä»Ž , Demon) by the name of 'Leaf-Flower', will appear in the middle of the night to serve the people; removing the filth from the city, sweeping and cleaning, and sprinkling the ground with perfumes so that the city will be very clean and fragrant. Dragons, deities and ghosts will work for the benefit of human beings. They neither need offerings to be made to them nor do they need to be worshipped, as such superstitious practices will no longer exist. The climate and environment will be favourable; the citizens gentle and amiable; and ghosts and deities will provide their support and protection. These conditions effect the birth of a 'Turning-Wheel Saint King' (è½¬ è½®åœ£ çŽ‹ ) named Rang-qu. Ketumati is his capital city. The King will apply Buddha-dharma to govern and guide his subjects. He has the Golden Wheel Treasure, Elephant Treasure, Horse Treasure, Pearl Treasure, the Lady of Virtue and Beauty Treasure, the Minister of Soldiers Treasure, and the Minister of Treasure. He will secure the city with these treasures, rather than with conventional swords and batons. The place will be carefree and joyous, and freedom, peace and equality will prevail.</div>

              <p>1) turbidity of kalpa, 2) turbidity of views, 3) turbidity of afflictions, 4) 
                  turbidity of beings, 5) turbidity of lifespan.</p>
              <p>"What are the Five Turbidities? The first is the turbidity of the kalpa. 
                  Kalpa is a Sanskrit word that is interpreted as a 'division of time.' How does 
                  the kalpa become turbid? At the time of the five evil realms, the evil karma of 
                  living beings makes the kalpa turbid.</p>
              <p>"The second turbidity is views. In the past, people saw everything as clean. 
                  But when the turbid kalpa arrives, people see things as unclean. The turbidity 
                  of views is composed of the Five Quick Servants: A view of the body, prejudiced 
                  views, views of prohibitions, views of views, and deviant views.</p>
              <p>"The view of a body: all living beings are attached to having bodies. They 
                  love their bodies. 'I certainly have to take care of myself. I can't let 
                  anything happen to me.' They look upon their own bodies as extremely important. 
                  They want to wear good clothes, eat good food, live in a good place. They always 
                  look upon their bodies as priceless gems. Right, your body is a priceless gem, 
                  but if you misuse it, your priceless gem turns into something not even as good 
                  as excrement. Why? Because you tend only to its superficial aspects, and don't 
                  discover the true gem of you self-nature. All you know is that your body is 
                  yours, and you can't put it down. From morning to night you are busy on behalf 
                  of your body. That's the view of a body.</p>
              <p>"Prejudiced views for one side or the other. If you don't favor emptiness, 
                  then you favor existence. In general, it means not being in accord with the 
                  Middle Way.</p>
              <p>"The third 'quick servant' is the view of prohibitions. Precepts an turn into 
                  something bad when they are based on mistaking for a cause something that is not 
                  a cause. Such a mistake leads to the cultivation of unbeneficial ascetic 
                  practices. I explained earlier how some people imitate the habits of cows or 
                  dogs, or sleep on beds of nails, or undertake other unbeneficial ascetic 
                  practices. People who do this have a view of prohibitions. 'See me,' they think, 
                  'I hold precepts.l None of you can do what I do; you can't compare to me.' They 
                  always have this arrogance in their minds.</p>
              <p>"The fourth is the 'view of views', or 'grasping at views'. This is to 
                  mistake for an effect something that is not an effect. People with this problem 
                  think that they have obtained effects which they have not obtained.</p>
              <p>"The fifth is deviant views. People with deviant knowledge and views are 
                  always thinking about things in an improper way. These are the Five Quick 
                  Servants, which comprise the turbidity of views.</p>
              <p>"The third turbidity is the turbidity of the afflictions, which is composed 
                  of the Five Slow Servants: greed, hatred, stupidity, arrogance, and doubt. 
                  'Greed' refers to an insatiable greed for pleasant experiences. You are greedy 
                  for the things you like. 'Hatred' is the dislike of unpleasant situations. 
                  'Stupidity' means stupid false thoughts. 'Arrogance' refers to pride and 
                  self-satisfaction--the feeling that 'I am the greatest' and 'no one is equal to 
                  me'. Arrogant people have no courtesy towards others.</p>
              <p>"'Doubt' refers to doubt of the genuine Dharma and preference for improper 
                  dharmas instead. Such people doubt the true and rely on the false. They doubt 
                  the proper Dharma and believe deviant dharmas.</p>
              <p>"These are the Five Slow Servants, which comprise the third turbidity, that 
                  of afflictions. The existence of these five dull servants creates a lot of 
                  affliction.</p>
              <p>"The fourth turbidity is that of living beings--let's not even try to express 
                  it. Why? Living beings are just too filthy, too unclean, too impure. You 
                  shouldn't think of yourself as being so terrific. Living beings are murky and 
                  turbid; there's nothing so good about them. But living beings think of 
                  themselves as something really special, despite the fact that hey comprise the 
                  fourth kind of turbidity.</p>
              <p>"The fifth turbidity is the turbidity of a lifespan. Our mundane lives, our 
                  destinies, are impure." (SS III 205-207)</p>
              <p>1) Ch. <em>wu jwo</em> , <em>wu jwo e shr</em> , 2) Skt. <em>panca-kasaya</em>, 3) 
                  Pali <em>panca-kasaya</em>, 4) Alternate Translations: five turbid realms, evil 
                  world of the five turbidities, five periods of turbidity, impurity or chaos of 
                  decay.</p>
