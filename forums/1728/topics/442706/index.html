              <p>At Savatthi. Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on 
              arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting 
              there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, in such and such a dwelling a 
              certain monk — newly ordained, not well known — is diseased, in pain, 
              severely ill. It would be good if the Blessed One would visit the monk, 
              out of sympathy for him."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One, on hearing the word "newly ordained," on 
              hearing the word "diseased," and realizing that the monk was not well 
              known, went to him. The monk saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, 
              on seeing him, stirred in his bed. Then the Blessed One said to him, 
              "Enough, monk. Don't stir in your bed. There are these seats made ready.
               I will sit down there."</p>
              <p>The Blessed One sat down on a seat made ready and said to the monk, 
              "I hope you are getting better, monk. I hope you are comfortable. I hope
               that your pains are lessening and not increasing. I hope that there are
               signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."</p>
              <p>"I am not getting better, lord. I am not comfortable. My extreme 
              pains are increasing, not lessening. There are signs of their 
              increasing, and not of their lessening."</p>
              <p>"Then I hope you have no anxiety, monk. I hope you have no anguish."</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord, I do have not a small amount of anxiety, not a small amount of anguish."</p>
              <p>"I hope you can't fault yourself with regard to your virtue."</p>
              <p>"No, lord, I can't fault myself with regard to my virtue."</p>
              <p>"Then what are you anxious about? What is your anguish?"</p>
              <p>"I understand that the Blessed One has not taught the Dhamma with purity of virtue as its goal."</p>
              <p>"If you understand that I have not taught the Dhamma with purity of 
              virtue as its goal, then for what goal do you understand that I have 
              taught the Dhamma?"</p>
              <p>"I understand that the Blessed One has taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal."</p>
              <p>"Good, good, monk. It's good that you understand that I have taught 
              the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal, 
              for I <em>have</em> taught the Dhamma with total Unbinding through lack of clinging as its goal.</p>
              <p>"What do you think, monk: Is the eye constant or inconstant?</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, lord."</p>
              <p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>
              <p>"Stressful, lord."</p>
              <p>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject 
              to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"No, lord."</p>
              <p>"...Is the ear constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...</p>
              <p>"...Is the nose constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...</p>
              <p>"...Is the tongue constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...</p>
              <p>"...Is the body constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, lord."...</p>
              <p>"What do you think, monk: Is the intellect constant or inconstant?"</p>
              <p>"Inconstant, lord."</p>
              <p>"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>
              <p>"Stressful, lord."</p>
              <p>"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject 
              to change as: 'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"No, lord."</p>
              <p>"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows 
              disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with the ear, disenchanted with 
              the nose, disenchanted with the tongue, disenchanted with the body, 
              disenchanted with the intellect. Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.
               Through dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is 
              the knowledge, 'Fully released.' He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the 
              holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this 
              world.'"</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monk delighted in 
              the Blessed One's words. And while this explanation was being given, the
               mind of that monk, through no clinging,<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.075.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> was fully released from fermentations.</p>

              <p>When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "Here is 
              where I am ill at ease, lord, for I don't discern, as they actually are 
              present, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawback, 
              and the escape from the <a id="spheres6" name="spheres6">six spheres</a> of contact."</p>
              <p>"Then what do you think, monk. Do you regard that 'The eye is not mine. It is not my self. It is not what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p>"Very good, monk. When it is well-seen by you with right discernment 
              that 'The eye is not mine. It is not my self. It is not what I am,' then
               the first sphere of contact will be abandoned by you, for the sake of 
              no further becoming in the future.</p>
              <p>"Do you regard that 'The ear is not mine... The nose is not mine... The tongue is not mine... The body is not mine...</p>
              <p>"Do you regard that 'The intellect is not mine. It is not my self. It is not what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord."</p>
              <p>"Very good, monk. When it is well-seen by you with right discernment 
              that 'The intellect is not mine. It is not my self. It is not what I 
              am,' then the sixth sphere of contact will be abandoned by you, for the 
              sake of no further becoming in the future.}</p>
              <p>"Well then, Punna. Now that I have instructed you with a brief instruction, in which country are you going to live?"</p>
              <p>"Lord, there is a country called <a id="sunaparanta" name="sunaparanta">Sunaparanta</a>. I am going to live there."</p>
              <p>"Punna, the Sunaparanta people are fierce. They are rough. If they insult and ridicule you, what will you think?"</p>
              <p>"If they insult and ridicule me, I will think, 'These Sunaparanta 
              people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with 
              their hands.' That is what I will think, O Blessed One. That is what I 
              will think, O One Well-gone."</p>
              <p>"But if they hit you with their hands, what will you think?"</p>
              <p>"...I will think, 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a clod.'..."</p>
              <p>"But if they hit you with a clod...?"</p>
              <p>"...I will think, 'These Sunaparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a stick.'..."</p>
              <p>"But if they hit you with a stick...?"</p>

              <p>"But if they take your life with a sharp knife...?"</p>
              <p>"If they take my life with a sharp knife, I will think, 'There are 
              disciples of the Blessed One who — horrified, humiliated, and disgusted 
              by the body and by life — have sought for an assassin, but here I have 
              met my assassin without searching for him.' <a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.088.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> That is what I will think, O Blessed One. That is what I will think, O One Well-gone."</p>
              <p>"Good, Punna, very good. Possessing such calm and self-control you 
              are fit to dwell among the Sunaparantans. Now it is time to do as you 
              see fit."</p>
              <p><a id="victory" name="victory">Then Ven</a>. Punna, delighting and 
              rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, rising from his seat, bowed down 
              to the Blessed One and left, keeping him on his right side. Setting his 
              dwelling in order and taking his robe and bowl, he set out for the 
              Sunaparanta country and, after wandering stage by stage, he arrived 
              there. There he lived. During that Rains retreat he established 500 male
               and 500 female lay followers in the practice, while he realized the 
              three knowledges and then attained total (final) Unbinding.</p>
              <p><a id="dies" name="dies">Then a</a> large number of monks went to the
               Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. 
              As they were sitting there, they said to him, "Lord, the clansman named 
              Punna, whom the Blessed One instructed with a brief instruction, has 
              died. What is his destination? What is his future state?"</p>
              <p>"Monks, the clansman Punna was wise. He practiced the Dhamma in 
              accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to 
              the Dhamma. The clansman Punna is totally unbound."</p>

              <h1>Note</h1>
              <dl><dt><a id="fn-1" name="fn-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn35/sn35.088.than.html#fnt-1">1</a>.</dt><dd>In the origin story to <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc1/bmc1.ch04.html#Pr3">Parajika 3</a>,
               a group of monks search for an assassin after becoming disgusted with 
              their bodies when taking the unattractiveness of the body as their 
              meditation theme. The Buddha, on learning of this, convenes the 
              remaining monks and recommends that if they find such unskillful, 
              aversive attitudes arising in their meditation, they should switch to 
              the breath as their theme. Thus — contrary to some interpretations of 
              this discourse — it seems unlikely that Punna is here extolling the act 
              of searching for an assassin as a skillful approach toward death. 
              Instead, the gist of his statement is that if he died under the 
              circumstances described here, death would have found him without his 
              having sought for it through aversion. This would parallel the attitude 
              toward death that the Theragatha frequently attributes to arahants:
              <div class="freeverse">I don't delight in death,
              don't delight in living.
              I await my time
              like a worker his wage.
              I don't delight in death,
              don't delight in living.
              I await my time
              mindful, alert.
              <p class="cite">—<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/thag/thag.14.01.than.html">Thag 14.1</a></p>
              </div>
              <p>This may not be life affirming in the American sense of the word, but
               it does affirm that the arahants have awakened to a release that 
              transcends life and death. And that is the whole point of Dhamma 
              practice. If there were nothing more important than life, then life 
              itself would be pointless.</p>

              <p>At Savatthi. "For a monk practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the
               Dhamma, what accords with the Dhamma is this: that he keep focused on 
              not-self with regard to form, that he keep focused on not-self with 
              regard to feeling, that he keep focused on not-self with regard to 
              perception, that he keep focused on not-self with regard to 
              fabrications, that he keep focused on not-self with regard to 
              consciousness. As he keeps focusing on not-self with regard to form... 
              feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, he comprehends 
              form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness. As he 
              comprehends form... feeling... perception... fabrications... 
              consciousness, he is totally released from form... feeling... 
              perception... fabrications... consciousness. He is totally released from
               sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs. He is totally

                   first impression it may seem like a different set of instructions from 
                  Bahiya Sutta but actually <strong>it is exactly the same as Bahiya Sutta</strong>.
                   Many people think of not-self as meaning "does
                   not assume form to be the self" (which means there could still be a 
                  person or witness dissociating himself from form), yet anatta is not 
                  only that, since 
                  it negates also “the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or
                   the 
                  self as in form” (no possibility of a witness or awareness which 
                  contains or observes form - form is just form without any referent of 
                  self - whether it is a self seen to be inside my body, or my body inside
                   me as if I am a container-like awareness!), in other words, exactly as 
                  per Bahiya 
                  Sutta, “Then, Bahiya, you should train yourself thus: <strong>In 
                  reference to the seen, there will be only the seen.</strong><strong>..</strong> only the cognized in reference to the 
                  cognized, then, Bahiya, <strong>there is no you in terms of that. When there is 
                  no you in terms of that,</strong> there is no you there. When there is no you 
                  there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. <strong style="font-weight: normal;">This,

                  not-self, which is not a form of dissociation or merely a rejection of 
                  'form = self' but a rejection of the view of self pertaining to forms,

              <p>At Savatthi. There Ven. Ananda addressed the monks, "Friend monks!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, friend," the monks responded to him.</p>
              <p><a id="punna" name="punna"></a>Ven. Ananda said, "Friends, Ven. Punna
               Mantaniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained. He 
              exhorted us with this exhortation:</p>
              <p>"'It's with possessiveness, friend Ananda, that there is "I am," not 
              without possessiveness. And through possessiveness of what is there "I 
              am," not without possessiveness? Through possessiveness of form there is
               "I am," not without possessiveness. Through possessiveness of 
              feeling... perception... fabrications... Through possessiveness of 
              consciousness there is "I am," not without possessiveness.</p>
              <p><a id="mirror" name="mirror"></a>"'Just as if a young woman — or a 
              man — youthful, fond of adornment, contemplating the image of her face 
              in a mirror, pure &amp; bright, or in a bowl of clear water, would look 
              with possessiveness, not without possessiveness. In the same way, 
              through possessiveness of form there is "I am," not without 
              possessiveness. Through possessiveness of feeling... perception... 
              fabrications... Through possessiveness of consciousness there is "I am,"
               not without possessiveness.</p>
              <p>"'What do you think, friend Ananda — Is form constant or inconstant?'</p>
              <p>"'Inconstant, friend.'</p>
              <p>"'And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?'</p>
              <p>"'Stressful, friend.'</p>
              <p>"'And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject 
              to change as: "This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am"?'</p>
              <p>"'No, friend.'</p>
              <p>"'... Is feeling constant or inconstant?'</p>
              <p>"'Inconstant, friend.'...</p>
              <p>"'... Is perception constant or inconstant?'</p>
              <p>"'Inconstant, friend.'....</p>
              <p>"'... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?'</p>
              <p>"'Inconstant, friend.'...</p>
              <p>"'What do you think, friend Ananda — Is consciousness constant or inconstant?'</p>
              <p>"'Inconstant, friend.'</p>
              <p>"'And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?'</p>
              <p>"'Stressful, friend.'</p>
              <p>"'And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject 
              to change as: "This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am"?'</p>
              <p>"'No, friend.'</p>
              <p>"'Thus, friend Ananda, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or 
              present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far
               or near: every form is to be seen as it actually is with right 
              discernment as: "This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what
               I am."</p>
              <p>"'Any feeling whatsoever....</p>
              <p>"'Any perception whatsoever....</p>
              <p>"'Any fabrications whatsoever....</p>
              <p>"'Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; 
              internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:
               every consciousness is to be seen as it actually is with right 
              discernment as: "This is not mine. This is not my self. This is not what
               I am."</p>
              <p>"'Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows 
              disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with 
              perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with 
              consciousness. Through disenchantment, he becomes dispassionate. Through
               dispassion, he is fully released. With full release, there is the 
              knowledge, "Fully released." He discerns that "Birth is ended, the holy 
              life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this 
              world."'</p>
              <p>"Friends, Ven. Punna Mantaniputta was very helpful to us when we were
               newly ordained. He exhorted us with this exhortation. And when I had 
              heard this Dhamma-explanation from Ven. Punna Mantaniputta, I broke 
              through to the Dhamma."</p>

              <div class="chapter">
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, at Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</a>. Then <a id="mahapajapati" name="mahapajapati">Mahapajapati Gotami</a>,
               together with about 500 other nuns, went to the Blessed One and, on 
              arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As she was 
              standing there she said to him, "Exhort the nuns, lord. Instruct the 
              nuns, lord. Give the nuns a talk on Dhamma."</p>
              <p>Now at that time the elder monks were taking turns in exhorting the 
              nuns, but Ven. Nandaka didn't want to exhort the nuns when his turn 
              came. So the Blessed One addressed Ven. Ananda: "Ananda, whose turn is 
              it to exhort the nuns today?"</p>
              <p>"Lord, everyone has taken his turn <a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.146.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> in exhorting the nuns, except for Ven. Nandaka, here, who doesn't want to exhort the nuns when his turn comes."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed Ven. Nandaka: "Exhort the nuns, 
              Nandaka. Instruct the nuns, Nandaka. Give the nuns a talk on Dhamma, 
              brahman."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," Ven. Nandaka replied. Then, early in the morning,
               having put on his robes and carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, he went
               into <a id="rajagaha" name="rajagaha">Rajagaha</a> for alms. After his 
              meal, on returning from his alms round, he went with a companion to 
              Rajaka Park. The nuns saw him coming from afar and, on seeing him, 
              arranged a seat and set out water for his feet. Ven. Nandaka sat down on
               the arranged seat and washed his feet. The nuns bowed down to him and 
              sat to one side.</p>
              <p>As they were sitting there, Ven. Nandaka said to them: "This will be a
               question-response talk, sisters. Where you understand, you should say, 
              'We understand.' Where you don't, you should say, 'We don't understand.'
               Where you are doubtful or perplexed, you should question me in 
              response: 'How is this, venerable sir? What is the meaning of this?'"</p>
              <p>"Venerable sir, we are gratified &amp; delighted that you invite us in this way."</p>
              <p>"So then, sisters, what do you think: Is the eye constant or 
              inconstant?" "Inconstant, venerable sir." "And is that which is 
              inconstant easeful or stressful?" "Stressful, venerable sir." "And is it
               fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as: 
              'This is mine. This is my self. This is what I am'?"</p>
              <p>"No, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>"... Is the ear constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, venerable sir." ...</p>
              <p>"... Is the nose constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, venerable sir." ...</p>
              <p>"... Is the tongue constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, venerable sir." ...</p>
              <p>"... Is the body constant or inconstant?" "Inconstant, venerable sir." ...</p>
              <p>"What do you think, sisters: Is the intellect constant or

              <p>"Sisters, there are these seven factors for awakening <a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.146.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> through whose development &amp; pursuit a monk enters &amp; remains in 
              the fermentation-free awareness-release &amp; discernment-release,<a id="fnt-3" class="noteTag" name="fnt-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.146.than.html#fn-3">[3]</a> having directly known &amp; realized them for himself right in the here
               &amp; now. Which seven? There is the case where a monk develops <em>mindfulness</em> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on 
              dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. He 
              develops <em>analysis of qualities</em> as a factor for awakening ... <em>persistence</em> as a factor for awakening ... <em>rapture</em> as a factor for awakening ... <em>serenity</em> as a factor for awakening ... <em>concentration</em> as a factor for awakening ... <em>equanimity</em> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on 
              dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment. These 
              are the seven factors for awakening through whose development &amp; 
              pursuit a monk enters &amp; remains in the fermentation-free 
              awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having directly known &amp;
               realized them for himself right in the here &amp; now."</p>
              <p>Then, having exhorted the nuns with this exhortation, Ven. Nandaka 
              dismissed them, saying, "Go, sisters. The time has come." The nuns, 
              delighting in and approving of Ven. Nandaka's exhortation, got up from 
              their seats, bowed down to him, circumambulated him — keeping him to the
               right — and went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to 
              the Blessed One, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, 
              the Blessed One said to them, "Go, nuns. The time has come." So the 
              nuns, having bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him — 
              keeping him to the right — and departed.</p>
              <p>Then not long after the nuns' departure the Blessed One addressed the
               monks: "Monks, just as on the uposatha day of the fourteenth, people at
               large are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is lacking 
              or full, for it is clearly lacking; <a id="fnt-4" class="noteTag" name="fnt-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.146.than.html#fn-4">[4]</a> in the same way, even though the nuns are gratified with Nandaka's 
              Dhamma-teaching, their resolves have not yet been fulfilled." So he 
              addressed Ven. Nandaka: "In that case, Nandaka, exhort the nuns again 
              tomorrow with the exact same exhortation."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," Ven. Nandaka replied. Then, after the night had 
              passed, early in the morning, having put on his robes and carrying his 
              bowl &amp; outer robe, he went into Rajagaha for alms ... [as before, 
              from "Then the Blessed One addressed Ven. Nandaka" up to:]</p>
              <p>Then not long after the nuns' departure the Blessed One addressed the
               monks: "Monks, just as on the uposatha day of the fifteenth, people at 
              large are not doubtful or perplexed as to whether the moon is lacking or
               full, for it is clearly full; in the same way, the nuns are gratified 
              with Nandaka's Dhamma-teaching, and their resolves have been fulfilled. 
              Of these 500 nuns, the most backward is a stream-winner, not destined 
              for the planes of deprivation, headed to self-awakening for sure."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

              obvious that they have developed the second factor of awakening — 
              analysis of qualities (or dhammas) — which is the factor associated with
               insight and discernment. However, for their resolves to be fulfilled,
