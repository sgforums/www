              <h6 class="caption">The Recognition of Death (Maraá¹‡asaññÄ�)</h6>
              <div class="hr dotted clearfix"> </div>
              <p>The recollection of death is explained in AN 6.20 Dutiyamaraá¹‡assati Sutta:</p>
              <blockquote>Here, monks, as day departs and night sets in, a monk 
              reflects: ‘The [possible] causes of my death are many. A snake, 
              scorpion, or centipede may bite me. My death could occur because of 
              that. That would be an obstacle for me. I may stumble and fall down; the
               food I have eaten may trouble me; my bile may be disturbed; my phlegm 
              may be disturbed; my [internal] winds may be disturbed. My death could 
              occur because of that. That would be an obstacle for me.’<br><br> Then, monks, a monk should reflect: ‘Are there any worthless, unskillful
               qualities that I have not given up that would be an obstacle for me if I
               were to die tonight?’<br><br> If, monks, upon reflecting in this way, the monk knows that ‘There are 
              worthless, unskillful qualities that I have not given up that would be 
              an obstacle for me if I were to die tonight,’ then he should engender 
              extra desire, effort, diligence, energy, zeal, mindfulness, and full 
              awareness for the abandoning of those very same worthless, unskillful 
              qualities.
              <br><br> Just as, monks, if someone’s turban or head was burning, they would 
              engender extra desire, effort, diligence, energy, zeal, mindfulness, and
               full awareness to extinguish the fire; in the same way, the monk should
               engender extra desire, effort, diligence, energy, zeal, mindfulness, 
              and full awareness for the abandoning of those very same worthless, 
              unskillful qualities.<br><br> But if, monks, upon reflecting in this way, the monk knows that ‘There 
              are no worthless, unskillful qualities that I have not given up which 
              would be an obstacle for me if I were to die in the night,’ then he 
              should abide in joy and gladness, training day and night in skillful 
              qualities.</blockquote>
              <p>The benefits of the recognition of death are described in AN 7.49 DutiyasaññÄ� Sutta:</p>
              <blockquote>‘The recognition of death, monks, when developed and 
              cultivated, is of great fruit and benefit; it merges with the 
              death-free, has the death-free as its end.’ Thus it was said. In 
              reference to what was it said?<br><br> Monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with the 
              recognition of death, his mind shrinks away from, recoils, pulls back, 
              and is not drawn toward longing for life, and either equanimity or 
              dislike are established. Monks, just as a cock’s feather or a piece of 
              tendon, when thrown into a fire, shrinks away, recoils, pulls back, and 
              is not drawn in; in the same way, when a monk’s mind frequently remains 
              acquainted with the recognition of death, his mind shrinks away from, 
              recoils, pulls back, and is not drawn toward longing for life, and 
              either equanimity or dislike are established.<br><br> If, monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with the 
              recognition of death, his mind inclines toward longing for life, or if 
              admiration continues, then he should know, ‘I have not developed the 
              recognition of death, there is no stepwise distinction in me, I have not
               obtained the strength of development.’ In that way he is fully aware 
              there. But if, monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted 
              with the recognition of death, his mind shrinks away from, recoils, 
              pulls back, and is not drawn toward longing for life, and either 
              equanimity or dislike are established, then he should know, ‘I have 
              developed the recognition of death, there is stepwise distinction in me,
               I have obtained the strength of development.’ In that way he is fully 
              aware there.<br><br> ‘The recognition of death, monks, when developed and cultivated, is of 
              great fruit and benefit; it merges with the death-free, has the 
              death-free as its end.’ Thus it was said. And in reference to this it 
              was said.</blockquote>

              <h6 class="caption">The Recognition of Death and the Seven Factors of Awakening (Satta Bojjhaá¹…gÄ�)</h6>
              <p>Sustained, dedicated practice of the recognition of death will 
              gradually create the optimal conditions for the arising of all seven 
              factors of awakening. SN 46.68 Maraá¹‡a Sutta (abridged):</p>
              <blockquote>Here monks, a monk develops the awakening factor of 
              mindfulness accompanied by the recognition of death, dependent upon 
              seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He 
              develops the awakening factor of dhamma-investigation accompanied by the
               recognition of death, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and 
              cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of 
              energy accompanied by the recognition of death, dependent upon 
              seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He 
              develops the awakening factor of joy accompanied by the recognition of 
              death, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in
               letting go. He develops the awakening factor of tranquility accompanied
               by the recognition of death, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and 
              cessation, resulting in letting go. He develops the awakening factor of 
              meditative composure accompanied by the recognition of death, dependent 
              upon seclusion, dispassion, and cessation, resulting in letting go. He 
              develops the awakening factor of equanimity accompanied by the 
              recognition of death, dependent upon seclusion, dispassion, and 
              cessation, resulting in letting go.<br><br> It is in this way that the recognition of death is developed and 
              cultivated so that it is of great fruit and benefit. It is in this way 
              that the recognition of death is developed and cultivated so that one of
               two fruits is to be expected: either final gnosis in this very life or,
               if there is a residue of clinging, the state of nonreturning. It is in 
              this way that the recognition of death is developed and cultivated so 
              that it leads to great good. It is in this way that the recognition of 
              death is developed and cultivated so that it leads to great security 
              from bondage. It is in this way that the recognition of death is 
              developed and cultivated so that it leads to a great sense of urgency. 
              It is in this way that the recognition of death is developed and 
              cultivated so that it leads to dwelling in great comfort.</blockquote>
