              <p>First you reduce all multiplicities into a Single Awareness without any subject/object division... all experiences are simply the manifestation of Awareness. This is the non dual stage.</p>
              <p>Then you realise there is no agent, no inherency to Awareness... you see that 'Awareness' is merely a label pointing only to insubstantial but vivid arisings. This is the insight into anatta.</p>

              <p>Not think... if you use your intellect to understand koans, you will never hope to attain what the zen masters attain.</p>
              <p>Koans are designed to induce a non conceptual, direct awakening into the true nature of reality. It cannot be approached by the intellect or conceptual mind. It can only be realized through an intuitive, non-dual, direct, non-conceptual, immediate, mode of perception coupled by a direct form of investigation like contemplating koan.</p>
              <p>Also, I recommend you to start from the koan 'Who am I' because this is what led to my initial Satori/awakening experience, it is the direct path to realization and is also taught by modern masters like Ch'an Master Hsu Yun and others. From there you continue to further insights... As I wrote in detail the method and my insights in <a href="http://www.box.net/shared/3verpiao63">http://www.box.net/shared/3verpiao63</a></p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote before, Zen is very good at pointing to this 'termination of linguistic 
                  description' by way of koan. There are different categories of koan 
                  triggering different level of insights -- From direct realization of the
                   Absolute to the full integration of the Absolute and Relative. The  
                  experience derived from the                         koan “before birth 
                  who are you?” only allows the initial realization of our nature. It is 
                  also not the same as the Hakuin’s  koan of “what is the                 
                          sound of one hand clapping?”, and others. The five categories  
                  of koan in Zen                         ranges from hosshin that give 
                  practitioner the  first glimpse of                         ultimate 
                  reality to five-ranks that aims to  awaken practitioner the             
                              spontaneous unity of relative and absolute.</p>

              <p>It's not difficult to understand...</p>
              <p>It seems difficult because you are approaching it from an intellectual/conceptual viewpoint. But the answer to 'Who am I' can only be realized <strong>in the absence of conceptual thinking</strong>.</p>
              <p>'Who am I', 'Who is dragging this corpse'... is simply a pointer back to the Pure Presence/Beingness. It can be discovered in the gap between two thoughts, where you turn the light inwards and rest in the Source, the Beingness that shines... it is not a void, an inert nothingness, because it is pure awareness by essence. A certainty/undeniability of Being will arise, and you will realize your true essence.</p>
              <p>This is basically what I realized and wrote in the very first post in <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="/forums/1728/topics/390582">Certainty of Being</a> (but edited and made clearer in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.box.net/shared/3verpiao63">http://www.box.net/shared/3verpiao63</a>)</p>
              <p>Keep contemplating on 'Who'... and do not follow your intellectual/conceptual answers which are susceptible to doubts - only the true essence of Being cannot be doubted.</p>

              <p>This is basically what I realized and wrote in the very first post in <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/390582">Certainty of Being</a></p>
              <p>Keep contemplating on 'Who'... and do not follow your intellectual/conceptual answers which are susceptible to doubts - only the true essence of Being cannot be doubted.</p>

              <h1>Only Keep "Don't Know" Mind</h1>
              <h2>Zen Master Wu Bong</h2>
              <hr>
              <p><em>Excerpted from a talk at the Foundations of Zen Retreat on May 2 0, 1990.</em></p>
              <p>One of the most famous kong-ans refers to an incident from the Buddha's own lifetime. Once the Buddha was staying on Vulture Peak mountain. It was time for him to give his usual discourse to the disciples, but the Buddha only sat silently. Everyone started to wonder what was going on. As the assembly was beginning to get restless, the Buddha held up a flower. The entire assembly was baffled; only Mahakashyapa, one of the senior disciples, smiled. Seeing his smile, the Buddha said, 'My true Dharma is transmitted to Mahakashyapa."</p>
              <p>There are three questions that come out of this kong-an:</p>
              <p>1. Buddha picked up a flower. What does this mean?</p>
              <p>2. Mahakashyapa. smiled. Why did he smile?</p>
              <p>3. Buddha's statement, "my true dharma is transmitted to Mahakashyapa," is a big mistake. What could the Buddha have done when Mahakashyapa smiled?</p>
              <p>If you don't understand, or if you have an answer but don't know how to respond, only keep a "don't know" mind. That's kong-an practice. Don't hold the kong-an in your thinking mind. The value of kong-an practice is that a kong-an is impervious to intellectual analysis. You can't attain a kong-an intellectually.</p>
              <p><strong>Keeping a "don't know" mind means cutting off all thinking.</strong> Cutting off all discursive thoughts takes us to the wellspring of our true nature, and brings us to the present moment. What are you doing just now? Paying attention to this moment is what Zen practice is all about. In a kong-an interview situation, the teacher uses kong-ans to understand the student's practice, and to give them "don't know" mind. Kong-ans let the student experience any hindrances they are having.</p>
              <p>Any kind of formal practice is a simple situation in which it is easier to cut off thinking. As we do formal practice, it will start to affect our everyday life. Any moment in our life can be understood as a kong-an. As we are able to penetrate the simple situations of kong-ans without being confused by our discursive minds, our intuition starts to grow. Eventually our intuition can grow so that when confronted with complex situations in our lives, the correct response will automatically appear.</p>

              <p>No, I would not recommend giving up... You have an affinity with pure land, you should keep your practice.</p>
              <p>Yes, I believe it is alright to contemplate koans along with chanting. There should be no contradictions at all.</p>
              <p>The essence of Mind is your birthright... everyone can realize it - it is not confined to Zen school or Pure Land or Tibetan or even Buddhist...</p>

              <p>it's not the smiling, it's Buddha's picking up the flower. smiling acknowledge the understanding. actually everything is ch'an. sitting down, walking, eating etc. in layman term, the goal is to reached no wandering thoughts. u still thinking of an answer is wrong already.</p>

              <div class="entry-content">
              <div class="entry-body">
              <div style="text-align: center;"><a style="display: inline;" href="http://www.oxherding.com/.a/6a00e5537c83be88340133f33b2659970b-popup"><img class="asset asset-image at-xid-6a00e5537c83be88340133f33b2659970b " style="width: 325px;" title="Don't Know" src="http://www.oxherding.com/.a/6a00e5537c83be88340133f33b2659970b-pi" border="0" alt="Don't Know"></a></div>
              <p>This week, <em>Ox Herding</em> will focus on several of the essential teaching phrases used by the Korean Zen Master Seung Sahn (Dae Soen Sa Nim).</p>
              <p>When Dae Soen Sa Nim first came to America, he spoke no English so he quickly learned to encapsulate vast chunks of Buddhist teaching into a few short English phrases. He deployed these with great precision, even after he gained fluency in the language.</p>
              <p>Of all these expressions, none was more central than<em> don't know</em>. He used this phrase repeatedly but never wore it out. Here's a sample:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>Throw away all opinions, all likes and dislikes, and only keep the mind that doesn't know. This is very important. <br></em></p>
              <p><em>Don't know mind is the mind that cuts off all thinking. When all thinking has been cut off, you become empty mind. This is before thinking. <br></em></p>
              <p><em>Your before thinking mind, my before thinking mind, all people's before thinking minds are the same. This is your substance.</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In Zen, this <em>don't know mind</em> traces directly back to Bodhidharma, who famously replied, "<em>Don't know!</em>," to Emperor Wu's question about his identity.<em><br></em></p>
              <p>But the tradition of not-knowing greatly precedes Bodhidharma, appearing even in early Greek philosophy:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>The Greek philosopher Socrates used to teach, "You must understand your true self."<br><br>One time someone asked Socrates, "Teacher, do you understand your true self?"</em> <em><br><br>Socrates replied, "I don't know. But I also understand this don't know."</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And, of course, about the same times as Socrates, the Buddha emphasized the importance of not-knowing, which he called <em>wisdom</em> ("prajna" in Sanskrit). Prajna means "before thinking" (<em>pra</em>=before; <em>jna</em>=thought).</p>
              <p>And what is before thinking?<em> Don't know</em>. The Buddha said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>"The sharp butcher's knife" is a term for noble wisdom - the noble wisdom that cuts, severs, and carves away the inner defilements, fetters, and bonds. (Nandokovada Sutta)</em></p>
              <p><em>Correct wisdom [says]: "This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self." (Dhatuvibhanga Sutta)<br></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>By cutting away everything, the Buddha taught that <em>don't know</em> precedes name and form, including the names and forms of Buddhism. Thus, Zen Master Seung Sahn once said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>I don't teach Korean or Mahayana or Zen. I don't even teach Buddhism. <br></em></p>
              <p><em>I only teach don't know. <br></em></p>
              <p><em>Fifty years here and there teaching only don't know. So only don't know, okay?</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Okay!</p>

              <p>There is no theoretical answer for this...</p>
              <p>I'd say smiling is a natural reaction due to having penetrated the essence of the twirling flower. The twirling flower itself is pure luminosity, your Buddha-Nature shining.</p>
              <p>It can be so intense and blissful that you will smile... this has been my experience. The bliss just arises and you smile. That is what I wrote when the bliss arose months ago - I wrote on the forum that this is why Mahakasyapa smiled.</p>

              <p>There is no absolute answers... only provisional pointers to the moon. The most important thing is that the answer must be a spontaneous answer coming from direct seeing.</p>
              <p>There is no fixed answer... a fixed answer is a remembered answer, not a spontaneous answer from direct seeing, and hence not a true answer. It must come from your heart.</p>
