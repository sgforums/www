McFarlane, 2001.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The parallels between modern physics and Eastern mysticism are no longer mere esoteric musings, and nowhere is that concept shown better than in Thomas McFarlane's Einstein and Buddha: The Parallel Sayings. As in other titles in the Parallel Sayings series, the author cuts and pastes sayings from one thinker or school of thought and matches them to resonant sayings from another wholly different tradition--to astonishing effect. The correspondences between modern physics and Buddhism (and Taoism, which McFarlane also includes) are attested to by the physicists themselves. In his preface, McFarlane, who has degrees in physics as well as philosophy and religion, identifies the major parallels as "the wholeness of all things, the description of reality through paradox, [and] the relationship between the observer and the observed."</span><br><br>More on Einstein and Religion: Albert Einstein on Religion and Science<br><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/aor/einstein/einsci.htm</a><br><br>--<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Interestingly, quantum theory holds that some events are not pre-determined as to their outcome - randomness being a core attribute of reality at the quantum level. Einstein was famous for saying something like "God does not play dice with the universe" - and on that basis, spent 30 years barking up the wrong tree in seeking a unified theory that did not allow for this random behavior of quantum systems. He said toward the end of his life, that this was his greatest scientific blunder. </span><br><br>/\</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's from a buddhist friend.<br><br><blockquote>i do belive that Nirvana not only exists in the 11th dimension, but that it IS the 11th dimension. Dr. M. Kaku<br><a href="http://www.mkaku.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mkaku.org/</a><br>(one of the most brilliant scientists of our time) had a Buddhist upbringing. I have seen many of his documentaries, seminars and have read many of his books.<br><br>He states that a being that exist in the 11th dimension would have the ability to flick in and out of existence at any point, in any time, in any dimension and any universe they would possibly want to go.<br><br><a href="http://www.aacc.rutgers.edu/DrBosacchi.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.aacc.rutgers.edu/DrBosacchi.pdf</a><br>Is an excellent article on M-Theory that is worth the read.<br><br>A bit of that goes as follows:<br><br>QUOTE<br>From the New Science viewpoint, 2,500 years of mystical experience in Eastern tradition, and the corresponding meditation techniques, should be considered as a potential sourse of new data and concepts for developing a more comprehensive neuroscience approach to the study of consciousness.<br><br>And..<br><br>QUOTE<br>As in the NS paradigm, contradictory concepts may lead to a better understanding of the reality.  And as in the construction of a multidimensional representation of the physical rality, a consistent multidimensional picture of the entire "human" reality may emerge, which is more open to transcendent experiences.<br><br>The reintroduction of a sence of meaningfulness and connectedness in the physical reality, fostered by the NS paradigm, may lead to a more human and compassionate society.<br><br>It appears as though science may be advocating the truth in Buddhism now.<br><br>Namo Amitabha ---Myoho</blockquote>as we know there's the 6 samsaric realms and the 4 noble realms adding up to 10. and beyond them is the One True Realm (ÂˆÃªÂ�^Â–@ÂŠE) . West land and the Avatamsaka World IS part of One True Realm (ÂˆÃªÂ�^Â–@ÂŠE). so we have a 11th dimension so to speak.<br>i think i heard MCK mentioned it before.<br><br>/\<br></div>
