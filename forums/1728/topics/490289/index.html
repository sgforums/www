              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Time baffles us. While we can only live in the present
              moment, our brains constantly reflect back and lunge forward. Evolution has
              coded in us important unconscious reasons for this. Yet when we bring time into
              consciousness, being present with this moment now can seem a futile and
              impossible endeavor.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our ability to imagine the future has been a crucial
              component of human, well, domination. Millennia-old Indian writers called this
              force <em>maya</em>: We envision, then create that reality. This skill makes us
              believe that anything forward is progress; anything behind a primitive version
              waiting to unfold into its full potential.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><a href="http://www.ynharari.com/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yuval
              Noah Harari</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> disagrees with this
              assessment. In his eloquent historical survey, <em>Sapiens: A Brief History of
              Humankind</em>, the Israeli history professor writes,</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We moderns have an arsenal of tranquillisers and
              painkillers at our disposal, but our expectations of ease and pleasure, and our
              intolerance of inconvenience and discomfort, have increased to such an extent
              that we may well suffer from pain more than our ancestors ever did.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Harari is no Luddite; technology is no enemy to our
              kind. Rather he takes an ethically minded gaze into the past few tens of
              thousands of years to figure out just how we got <em>here</em>. He argues that
              three major forces — capitalism, religion, and industry — created what we are
              today. But unlike many history books presenting facts and nothing more, Harari
              asks a pivotal question: Are we happy?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Such a seemingly benign query. Of course we’re happy!
              Or: Of course we’re not! Most likely a blend of these two, depending on the
              day. Yet, as he points out, there is a huge difference between individual happiness
              and group happiness, and therein lies one of modernity’s great ails: the loss
              of the tribe. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Before the Industrial Revolution, Harari finds that
              daily life is comprised of "three ancient frames": the nuclear
              family, the extended family, and the local intimate community. The group took
              care of the individual; the well-being of the group depended upon every member
              working together. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In the age of individualism, much of this is lost. The
              elderly are locked away in age-restricted homes, no longer providing input to
              the community; the younger generations spend more time making eye contact with
              their phones than with other eyes. The survival of the fittest is the pleasure
              of <em>my</em> genes. We may have much more now, but at what cost?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The need of one another, the need to be together, is
              an integral part of our species. Babies separated from their mother will suffer
              major distress, a common occurrence among all mammals and many other species. A
              high percentage of Americans today live alone, something new to our species.
              There’s a reason why activists call solitary confinement inhumane. If the goal
              is rehabilitation, don’t subtract the very foundation of their humanity. We
              need one another.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One of the great insights in <em>Sapiens</em> is
              Harari’s distinguishing between basic happiness — an ability to feel content
              regardless of external circumstances — and the search for pleasure. In his
              chapter on religion, he uses Buddhism as the main vehicle to explore this
              riddle.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While Buddhism is sometimes called a religion, it’s
              better understood as a psychological investigation. While complex layers were
              added after the founder Gotama’s time, the discipline itself is quite simple:
              We suffer because we’re ignorant of the true nature of reality. We want things
              to be one way; when reality proves us wrong, we become bewildered. There is a
              way to not suffer, which requires letting go of mental and emotional grasping.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In Buddhist and Hindu terminology, the words nirvana
              and moksha — liberation — imply a sense of ecstasy. This ecstasy is not the
              pleasure of the senses, however; it is a deep awareness of one’s sensations
              while moving from moment to moment, and within that resides <em>santosha</em>,
              contentment. Harari puts it beautifully: </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If you experience sadness without craving that the
              sadness go away, you continue to feel sadness, but you do not suffer from it.
              There can actually be richness in the sadness. If you experience joy without
              craving that the joy linger and intensify, you continue to feel joy without
              losing your peace of mind. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Our day to day often proves the opposite: when we’re
              experiencing pleasure, we want it to be more intense and last forever; when
              we’re sad, we feel as though the world should indefinitely stroke its violin
              for us. And so with the importation of disciplines like Buddhism and yoga —
              Gotama practiced yoga for years, so there is a good deal of crossover — we’ve
              begun to look inside as a means of overcoming suffering.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Harari notes that Buddha did, as modern practitioners
              argue, state that happiness is independent of external conditions. Yet this
              alone cannot defeat suffering, for "happiness is also independent of our
              inner feelings." The higher we place our feelings up a pedestal, the
              more we crave those we want to feel. The vicious circle (<em>samsara</em>)
              continues.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Can we be detached while also engaged? While Harari
              has definite opinions on certain topics (animal welfare being a welcome
              inclusion in this book), he does not blame those three forces above for any
              wicked intent. They are merely part of the ever-evolving narrative that created
              modern societies.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whether or not they provide happiness — not pleasure,
              but a sense of inclusion in our, at times, fractured cultures — is a storyline
              each of us has to write. While there are no clear-cut answers, Harari offers
              plenty of sagely advice that seems so basic yet often forgotten: Strive, but
              don’t cling; value those around you, of every species; find contentment while
              shedding the constant need for <em>more</em>.</span></p>
