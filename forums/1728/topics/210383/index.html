            <div class='col-md body'>there's no actual gongde/virtue, just fu de(merit) or even no merit at all. like in the story of Liang Wu Emperor.<br><br><blockquote>The Emperor started to talk about his building of temples and giving financial support to monastics. He then asked Bodhidharma how much merit he accumulated in the process. Emperor Wu felt that the patriach might not know about of the good deeds that he made, so he pointed them out to Bodhidharma. The patriarch felt that Emperor Wu was providing his own promotion campaign rather than seeking the Dharma to end birth and death; instead, he wanted to boast of his own merit and virtue. Thinking that the emperor might have been drunk on his own ego, Bodhidharma replied, "Actually, you have no merit and virtue. In truth, no merit and virtue at all."<br><br>Perplexed, the Emperor then asked, "Well, what is the fundamental teaching of Buddhism?" The bewildering reply was "vast emptiness."<br><br>"Listen," said the Emperor, now losing all patience, "just who do you think you are?" Bodhidharma replied, "I have no idea."<br><br>Bodhidharma originally went to Emperor Wu with the idea of saving him. However, he was too conceited; he had too high an opinion of himself. Being an emperor was already something, he thought. He had built many temples, enabled people to leave home, given away a lot of money, and made a lot of offerings to the Triple Gem. So, he thought that he had created a tremendous amount of merit and virtue. Bodhidharma, wanting to shatter the emperor's attachment, replied that he had no merit and virtue at all.</blockquote><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/emperor-wu-of-liang" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/emperor-wu-of-liang</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's a blessing &amp; merit that a person is able to take refuge in the tripple gem. given one rare chance is precious enough, when given multiple times its too great a blessing to reject. some may not even have a single chance to take refuge at all. its like those who are poor &amp; starving but on the other side of the world people with plenty food are fuzzing away what to eat &amp; how much to eat.<br></div>
