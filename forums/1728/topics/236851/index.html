I used to stay there during the weekend and mostly alone. There was once, i was dreaming of myself, talking on a fone while lying on my bed.<br><br>Then there was this auntie, appearing @ my door-way... telling me " you took my bed where can i sleep ?" in chinese... I still can remember the flower patterns on her shirt and her short till now.<br><br>Then i actually go after her when she leave to the toilet and grab her hands and talk her to chant with me namo amitufo and keeping telling her that buddha will help u buddha will help u. The funny thing is i actually dreamt of myself as amitufo when releasing that hand mudra- &gt;the palm facing forward and she kind of sucked into my hand in there split seconds.<br><br>There was real physical sharp pain on my palm. I was awoked up it in my semi-awake state but slumbered back to lalaland but i remember dreaming of a dark figure standing near my bed. Then a hand took a brown color seed that dropped off from my palm.<br><br>My dream in there vacant house is always in darkness.<br><br>ok lah this is only a dream so no need to take this seriously ah...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, I think we shouldn't take dreams seriously. They are usually caused by strong imprints in the 8th consciousness.. whether they have any meaning I think it is not necessary for us to seek an answer..<br><br><blockquote>If you want to continue to be a devoted yogi, generally you should never cling to dreams. If you do, you will eventually expose yourself to the influence of the four maras. If your dreams are positive, do not have any expectations. If we are filled with hopes and expectations, even positive things can turn negative. If your dreams are negative, don't take them too seriously. Learn to see negative dreams as illusion, not real. Then, although a dream seems negative, because we realize that it isn't real, it becomes a positive thing that prepares us for further development and realization in the spiritual path. This is the practice of a yogi.<br><br>-- from The Life of Gampopa by Jampa Mackenzie Stewart, just published by Snow Lion Publications.</blockquote></div>

(some become hungry ghost, etc)<br><br>There are also some people who are so attached to their life, relationship, possession and so on, after 49 days (the period where the antarabhava can be reborn) they also turn into ghost. But generally they are not the kind of ghosts that have very bad karma.<br><br>Still, both of them belong to the 'ghost realm' in Buddhism. The three lower realms are: hell, ghost, animal. The three higher realms are: Humans, Asuras, Celestial/heaven beings (devas).</div>
