Great compassion chanting soothe mind of both humans and ghosts. I'm not saying repel ghosts as if we should be discriminative towards them but rather, as a normal human being who are not highly enlightened.. we do not know what to do to really help the ghosts. Come'on , will you be fearful when you saw a malay vampire ? I know some of these ghosts are fierce and vicious.<br><br>I personally don't know what to do that why i will ask the help from Bodhisattvas. And hope the Bodhisattvas will help both of <span style="font-style: italic;">us</span> which i believe the Bodhisattvas will. The best thing is to ask a venerable for advice when such things happen and cannot be solved. We could do our parts in dedicating merits and cultivate the path of Bodhisattvas to help other sentient beings to liberate from suffering. By practising and keeping the precepts will definitely gain some protection from dharma protectors.<br><br>I could put the picture of buddha in my ex-house which is vacant. The purpose is to prevent ghosts from residing in my house. Personal preferences, so it is considered morally wrong?... lol.. moral values are rather subjective. This does not mean, i'm against these ghosts lah.<br><br>And human beings for his ignorance do not understand the becoming of these ghosts or sentients beings whom are suffering in the lower three realms. <span style="font-style: italic;">As a buddhist</span>, we are encouraged to be compassionate and practising loving kindness, sympathetic joy to <span style="font-style: italic;">all sentients beings.</span><br><br>But u did raise a good point.. people commonly erect statue of bodhisattva or buying amulet for protection to ward off evil.. has no ideal the suffering of these beings. As buddha has said, all of us have countless birth cycle. There is a high possibility that we had been a ghost, trapping in the state in our pastlifes.<br><br></div>

These are not aim at 'spirits of deceased human'.<br><br>Most Ven. Jing Kong in one of his teaching session mentioned he encounter various disturbing 'activities' while he was in Korea.<br><br>The logic is, human does not has the ability to break through the Bardo or 中阴身 unless, while alive, this person has some form of practices that makes him aware or having a strong bond with protecting deities (can be of good or bad) that carries him to live in another dimension (for a certain period only).<br><br>Accordingly, whenever after you did chanting (in any tradition), you should dim your room light (not the shrine light) and leave some food offering for any visiting 'friends'. They are drawn by your chanting or the Dharma that is recited. If they found delight, they will actually stay and becomes protecting deities - for the Dharma activities. That is one reason why Vajrayana did not allow non-filled Buddha statues.<br><br>That's why if you have a dedicated chanting room or chanting area, you find it to be most peaceful for reflection and meditation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all<br><br>My personal experience<br><br>My current flat was haunted when I first moved in. That haunting occured for 4-5 years. There are times I feel being watched, followed. I can hear people breathing and sometimes talking. The more significant events includes creeping onto my bed at night and sayang me. Once, my bedroom turned freezingly cold to the point I can hear my teeth chattering (Mind you, no air con in place and not raining). Also my cat start to behave strangely<br><br>All these stopped after I embrace Buddhism. But once in a while, still can feel it coming.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Don't know whether if there is psychological ?<br><br>Prior to this incident, my friend has dedicated merits to the ghost.<br>As a practising buddhist, we should also want the ghost out of its suffering realm soon.<br><br></div>
