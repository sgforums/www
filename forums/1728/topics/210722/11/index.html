Belief can merely be a "thought form". One can merely belief and continue his ways of sinning. There are so many Christians who supposedly accepted Christ but are they enlightened and liberated?

What is spirit, you might say? I can only speak based on my own relationship with God and I tell you that I have no wish to define God for you or anybody because as far as I am concern, GOD is beyond's any man's comprehension and you only communicate and have a relationship / be aware of God in your own life.<br><br>How a man ends up being aware and have a relationship with God is by being "born of the spirit." I certainly know that I was born again. When you are born again, "angels" and "heaven" and your whole being rejoices.<br><br>It is not much different then when a baby is born, except that this is personal. You are the one that rejoices with the "heavenly beings."<br><br>I put them all in " " because you might have a different understanding of those words in " " that I used.<br><br>Many Christians here cannot accept what I say, even though it was Jesus who said, "You must be Born Again" and "You must be born of the Spirit" and insists that it is simply "believe, have faith" and not a "new birth" in you (the other school hope that as long as you believe you then assume you have new birth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) As if you need to hope and not know something so obvious as a new birth in yourself.<br><br>I believe that Enlightenment has the same effect.

But at some point if you are mindful and the mind is free from thoughts, the dualistic bond that creates an impression of separation, 'you' and 'the world' dissolve. Suddenly it doesn't feel like you are here, looking at the world out there. Instead, you feel like you BECOME the looking, you are the universe, you are the tree, you are the seeing and the seen. Another way of putting it.. It is not you who sees, the universe self-sees. Things become vivid and clear, there is clarity in it, and you are that... The mountains and the universe is closer than your skin. When this happened to me, there is also a blissful 'energy' arising, like in meditative jhanas. But anyway that is not enlightenment, because it is not realising our buddha nature, in other words it is an 'experience' of no-self yet the nature of no-self and awareness is not understood. Enlightenment is not an experience that comes and go.</div></blockquote>hey AEN, thanks for explaining that part out.. now i sort of understood what i experienced.. and i also have a long way to go too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>=== JKrishnamurti.org - Daily Quote === This Choiceless Awareness<br><br><strong>This Choiceless Awareness</strong><br><br>Great seers have always told us to acquire experience. They have said that experience gives us understanding. But it is only the innocent mind, the mind unclouded by experience, totally free from the past - it is only such a mind that can perceive what is reality. If you see the truth of that, if you perceive it for a split second, you will know the extraordinary clarity of a mind that is innocent. This means the falling away of all the encrustations of memory, which is the discarding of the past. But to perceive it, there can be no question of 'how'. Your mind must not be distracted by the 'how', by the desire for an answer. Such a mind is not an attentive mind. As I said earlier in this talk, in the beginning is the end. In the beginning is the seed of the ending of that which we call sorrow. The ending of sorrow is realized in sorrow itself, not away from sorrow. To move away from sorrow is merely to find an answer, a conclusion, an escape; but sorrow continues. Whereas, if you give it your complete attention, which is to be attentive with your whole being, then you will see that there is an immediate perception in which no time is involved, in which there is no effort, no conflict; and it is this immediate perception, this choiceless awareness that puts an end to sorrow.<br><br>The Book of Life - October 10</blockquote></div>
