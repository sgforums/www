And you may never know. Even li zhu lao shi don't practise public healing,   she healed her mother but never usually do it to others.

Her complaint was she is not she and she always have different voices in her head. After he expelled them, (cant remember if he expelled all of them, dont think so, he is healer, not exorcist). he fell sick for 3 days and could not get out of bed. I guess someone has to do the job to help others. And he dont turn people away. He said the lady self-invited the spirits to reside in her body.

It is the degree of clarity.  Do not have doubt about these experiences.  The way Presence is unfolding in you is amazingÂ…Perhaps your life experiences has helped in the rapid unfolding.  It is the thoroughness of being nobody.<br><br>For the purpose of discussion, I would like to introduce you one concept, it is the "seed of pre-conscious propensities".  It is a layer of Â‘bondÂ’ that prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ somethingÂ…it is very subtle, very thin, very fineÂ…it goes almost undetected.  What this Â‘bondÂ’ does is it prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ what Â“WITNESSÂ” really is and <strong> makes us constantly fall back to the Witness, to the Source, to the Center </strong>.  Every moment we want to sink back to Witness, to the Center, to this Beingness, this is an illusion.  It is habitual and almost hypnotic.<br><br>But what exactly is this Â“witnessÂ” we are talking about?  It is the <strong>manifestation </strong> itself!  It is the <strong>appearance </strong> itself!  There is no Source to fall back, <strong>the Appearance is the Source! </strong>  Including the moment to moment of thoughts.  The problem is we choose, but all is really it.  There is nothing to choose.<br><strong><br>There is no mirror reflecting<br>Manifestation alone IS.<br></strong><br>There is no invisible witness hiding anywhere.  Whenever we attempt to fall back to this Â“an invisible transparent image Â“, it is again the mind game of thought.  It is the Â‘bondÂ’ at work.  I wonder this make sense to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

But the bondage that binds us - like a hypnotic bond - is subtle and pre-conscious (meaning it is there whether we think or not). In fact in john's stage one experience, the sense of 'i am' is a sense of self that is beyond thoughts. It is very subtle, like i said, 7th consciousness is pre-conscious. The rest of the journey is deepening the realisation, loosening the bond.</div>
