Right effort is the effort leading one to the experience of the Presence before the birth of names and labels.  The way towards imagelessness Reality.  (e.g. Mindfulness).

All the students are your sub-personalities or karmic patterns. These students seems to be untamable... this give you problems. You feel that you cannot control the thoughts and how they behave or feel... and you feel tired and think that this is a problem.<br><br>It may take some time for the karmic patterns to slowly fade away. In the meantime, try not to suppress them... They will go away in due time.<br><br>All the best!<br><br>And this is OK... all of us have karmic patterns, otherwise we would not be reborn!<br><br></div>

A vow also does not determine whether you will succeed in Buddhahood, but very much how you act according to the vow.<br><br>It is true that one will encounter many difficult situations along the way to Buddhahood, but nevertheless the True Bodhisattva remains liberated. He is not even caught up by the notion of 'saving people', if he were, he is not practising the true practise of Bodhisattva but simply remains as a sentient being caught up by notions and concepts of self. It is a spiritual training and is tough, but in the light of Prajna wisdom it is not impossible.<br><br>[b]The Diamond Sutra:</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Subhuti, what do you think about this? Does the Tathagata think: I have saved all Beings? You must not think so, because there is not a single being which is saved by the Tathagata. <strong>If the Tathagata saved a being, that would be seizing by the Tathagata on self - atman, seizing on a being, seizing on soul, seizing on a person.</strong></span><br><br>---<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Do not think that you should save people. There is no one to save. If there were anyone to save, there would be a self.</span><br><br>---<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Subhuti, Bodhisattva is also like this. If he said, 'I should take across immeasurable living beings to Cessation,' then he could not be called a Bodhisattva. Why? Subhuti, there is really no dharma called a Bodhisattva. Therefore the Buddha says that all dharmas are without self, others, living beings or a life.<br><br>"Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva said, 'I should adorn Buddhalands,' he could not be called a Bodhisattva. Why? What the Thus Come One speaks of as adorning Buddhalands is not adorning Buddhalands. Therefore it is called adorning Buddhalands. Subhuti, if a Bodhisattva comprehends the dharma of no self, the Thus Come One calls him a true Bodhisattva."</span><br><br>---<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>The Buddha told Subhuti, "All Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas, should subdue their minds thus: 'I must cause all living beings--those born from eggs, wombs, moisture, by transformation; those with form, those without form, those with thought, those without thought, those not totally endowed with thought, and those not totally without thought--to enter Nirvana without residue and be taken across to Cessation. Yet of the immeasurable, numberless, boundless numbers of living beings thus taken across to Cessation, there is actually no living being taken across to Cessation. ' Why? Subhuti, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if a Bodhisattva has an appearance of self, others, living beings, or a life, he is not a Bodhisattva."</span></strong></span><br><br>---<br><br>Bodhisattvas save people out of true compassion but does not get caught up by any notions. A true Bodhisattva is one that has had a direct perception on Emptiness, thereby entering the 'path of seeing', '1st Bhumi', therefore before that we can only say that we are still learning and practising. It is only at certain point where Prajna wisdom arise can we be said to enter the path of seeing towards Buddhahood.<br><br>The Diamond sutra contains a lot of verses pertaining to true Bodhisattva practise.[/b]</blockquote>---------<br><br>More from Diamond Sutra (<a href="http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/sutras/diamond1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinc.sunysb.edu/clubs/buddhism/sutras/diamond1.html</a>):<br><br><blockquote><br>"What do you think, Subhuti? Does a Stream-Enterer think, 'I have attained the fruit of stream-entry.'?"<br><br>Subhuti replied, "No, World-Honored One. Why? Stream-Enterer means to enter the stream, but in fact there is no stream to enter. One does not enter a stream that is form, nor a stream that is sound, smell, taste, touch, or object of mind. That is what we mean when we say entering a stream."<br><br>"What do you think, Subhuti? Does a Once-Returner think, 'I have attained the fruit of Once-Returning.'?"<br><br>Subhuti replied, "No, World-Honored One. Why? Once-Returner means to go and return once more, but in truth there is no going just as there is no returning. That is what we mean when we say Once-Returner."<br><br>"What do you think, Subhuti? Does a Non-Returner think like this,'l have attained the fruit of No-Return.'?"<br><br>Subhuti replied,"No, World-Honored One. Why? No-Return means not to return to this world, but in fact there cannot be any Non-Returning. That is what we mean when we say Non-Returner."<br><br>"What do you think, Subhuti? Does an Arhat think like this, 'I have attained the fruit of Arhatshipπ?"<br><br>Subhuti replied, "No, World-Honored One. Why? There is no separately existing thing that can be called Arhat. If an Arhat gives rise to the thought that he has attained the fruit of Arhatship, then he is still caught up in the idea of a self, a person, a living being, and a life span. World-Honored One, you have often said that I have attained the concentration of peaceful abiding and that in the community, I am the Arhat who has most transformed need and desire. World-Honored One, if I were to think that I had attained the fruit of Arhatship, you certainly would not have said that I love to dwell in the concentration of peaceful abiding."</blockquote>anyway I've changed my forum signature to a verse which i saw... <span style="font-style: italic;">The past mind cannot be grasped, neither can the present mind nor the future mind. ~ Diamond Sutra</span></div>
