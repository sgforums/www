Do not have doubt about these experiences. The way Presence is unfolding in you is amazingÂ…Perhaps your life experiences has helped in the rapid unfolding. It is the thoroughness of being nobody.<br><br>For the purpose of discussion, I would like to introduce you one concept, it is the "seed of pre-conscious propensities";. It is a layer of Â‘bondÂ’ that prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ somethingÂ…it is very subtle, very thin, very fineÂ…it goes almost undetected. What this Â‘bondÂ’ does is it prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ what Â“WITNESSÂ” really is and makes us constantly fall back to the Witness, to the Source, to the Center . Every moment we want to sink back to Witness, to the Center, to this Beingness, this is an illusion. It is habitual and almost hypnotic.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But what exactly is this Â“witnessÂ” we are talking about? It is the manifestation itself! It is the appearance itself! There is no Source to fall back, the Appearance is the Source! Including the moment to moment of thoughts. The problem is we choose, but all is really it. There is nothing to choose. </span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is no mirror reflecting<br>Manifestation alone IS. </span><br><br>There is no invisible witness hiding anywhere.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just for sharing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>From Â“A Brief History of Everything (Second Edition)Â”, Ken Wilber:<br><br>Page 205-207<br><br><strong>The Nondual</strong><br><br>Q: So this casual unmanifest Â– is that the absolute end point? Is this the end of time, the end of evolution, the end of history? The final Omega point?<br>KW: Well, many traditions take this state of cessation to be the ultimate state, the final end point of all development and evolution, yes. And this end state is equated with full Enlightenment, ultimate release, pure nirvana.<br>But this is not the Â“final story,Â” according to the Nondual traditions. Because at some point, as you inquire into the Witness, and rest in the Witness, the sense of being a Witness Â“in hereÂ” completely vanishes itself, and the Witness turns out to be everything that is witnessed. The causal gives way to the Nondual, and formless mysticism gives way to nondual mysticism. Â“Form is Emptiness and Emptiness is Form.Â”<br>Technically, you have dis-identified with even the Witness, and then integrated it with all manifestation Â– in other words, the second and third phases of fulcrum-9, which leads to fulcrum-10, which is not really a separate fulcrum or level, but the reality or Suchness of all levels, all states, all conditions.<br>And this is the second and most profound meaning of Emptiness - it is not a discrete state, but the reality of all states, the Suchness of all states. You have moved from the causal to the Nondual.<br>Q: Emptiness has two meanings?<br>KW: Yes, which can be very confusing. On one hand, as we just saw, it is a discrete, identifiable state of awareness Â– namely, unmanifest absorption or cessation (nirvikalpa Samadhi, ayn, jnana Samadhi, nirodh, classical nirvana). This is the causal state, a discrete state.<br>The second meaning is that Emptiness is not merely a particular state among other states, but rather the reality or suchness or condition of all states. Not a particular state apart from other states, but the reality or condition of all states, high or low, sacred or profane, ordinary or extraordinary. Recall that on figure 9-1 we had Spirit as both the highest level (Â“causalÂ”) and the ever-present Ground of all levels (Â“nondualÂ”).<br>Q: We already discussed the discrete state; now the Nondual.<br>KW: Yes, the Â“experienceÂ” of this nondual Suchness is similar to the nature unity experience we earlier discussed, except now this unity is experienced not just with gross Form out there, but also with all of the subtle Form in here. In Buddhist terms, this is not just the Nirmanakaya Â– gross or nature mysticismland not just the Sambhogakaya Â– subtle or deity mysticism; and not just the Dharmakaya Â– causal or formless mysticism. It is the Svabhavikakaya Â– the integration of all three of them. It is beyond nature mysticism, beyond deity mysticism, and beyond formless mysticism Â– it is the reality or the Suchness of each, and thus integrates each in its embrace. It embraces the entire spectrum of consciousness Â– transcends all, includes all.<br>Q: Again, rather technical. Perhaps thereÂ’s a more direct way to talk about Nondual mysticism?<br>Kw: <strong>Across the board, the sense of being any sort of Seer or Witness or Self vanishes altogether. You donÂ’t look at the sky, you are the sky. You can taste the sky. ItÂ’s not out there. As Zen would say, you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, you can swallow the Kosmos whole Â– precisely because awareness is no longer split into a seeing subject in here and a seen object out there. There is just pure seeing. Consciousness and its display are not-two.</strong><br>Everything continues to arise moment to moment Â– the entire Kosmos continues to arise moment to moment Â– <strong>but there is nobody watching the display, there is just the display, a spontaneous and luminous gesture of great perfection. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The pure Emptiness of the Witness turns out to be one with every Form that is witnessed, and that is one of the basic meanings of Â“nonduality.Â”</span></strong><br>Q: Again, could you be even more specific?<br>Kw: Well, you might begin by getting into the state of Witness Â– that is, you simply rest in pure observing awareness Â– you are not any object that can be seen Â– not nature, not body, not thoughts Â– just rest in that pure witnessing awareness. And you can get a certain Â“sensationÂ” of that witnessing awareness Â– a sensation of freedom, of release, of great expanse.<br>While you are resting in that state, and Â“sensingÂ” this Witness as a great expanse, <strong>if you then look at, say, a mountain, you might begin to notice that the sensation of the Witness and the sensation of the mountain are the same sensation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When you Â“feelÂ” your pure Self and you Â“feelÂ” the mountain, they are absolutely the same feeling.</span></strong><br>In other words, the real world is not given to you twice Â– one out there, one in here. That Â“twicenessÂ” is exactly the meaning of Â“dualityÂ”. Rather, the real world is given to you once, immediately Â– it is one feeling, it has one taste, it is utterly full in that one taste, it is not severed into seer and seen, subject and object, fragment and fragment. It is a singular, of which the plural is unknown. You can taste the mountain; it is the same taste as your Self; it is not out there being reflected in here Â– that duality is not present in the immediateness of real experience. Real experience, before you slice it up, does not contain that duality- real experience, reality itself, is Â“nondual.Â” You are still you, and the mountain is still the mountain, but you and the mountain are two sides of one and the same experience, which is the one and only reality at that moment.<br>If you relax into present experience in that fashion, the separate-self sense will uncoil; you will stop standing back from life; you will not have experience, you will suddenly become all experience; you will not be Â“in hereÂ” looking Â“out thereÂ” Â– in here and out there are one, so you are no longer trapped Â“in here.Â”<br>And so suddenly, you are not in the bodymind. Suddenly, the bodymind has dropped. Suddenly, the wind doesnÂ’t blow on you, it blows through you, within you. You are not looking at the mountain, you are the mountain Â– the mountain is closer to you than your own skin. You are that, and there is no you Â– just this entire luminous display spontaneously arising moment to moment. The separate self is nowhere to be found.<br>The entire sensation of Â“weightÂ” drops altogether, because you are not in the Kosmos, the Kosmos is in you, and you are purest Emptiness. The entire universe is a transparent shimmering of the Divine, of primordial Purity. But the Divine is not someplace else, it is just all of this shimmering. It is self-seen. It has One Taste. It is nowhere else.<br><br>(More to be found in the book itself)</blockquote></div>
