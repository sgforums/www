Gripping and seeking is the entirety of the mind.  Same manifestation of the one reality.  By reacting we re-enforce the gripping unknowningly.

This reminds me of my experience 20 years back when I first experience Presence.  My experience is that the struggle is unavoidable and necessary.  It is not how people reinforced concepts into us but the depth of clarity of what consciousness really is.  The experience of 'Pure Consciousness', the Eternal Seer, the Ulitmate Witness or the center of all Source, what is fundamentally wrong that causes all these divisions, split, the sufferings that shouldn't exist in the first place?<br><br>Perhaps my deep respect for Buddha is due to his profound insight of no-self and emptiness that helps me to go beyond the bond of the Eternal Witness, the source that causes the split.  Mindfulness to me is truly an ingenius technique of allowing us to experience the One reality in a right way.  In fact (to me) it is the correct medicine for dissolving the division after the experience of the Eternal Witness.  How it dissolves the division between inner/outer reality, subject/object dualism.  How by observing the phenomenon existence in a raw and undefined mode can lead one to the clear insight  of true non-duality.  Not only is there no 'who', there is no 'where' in the realm of pure awareness.  This is my personal opinion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Thusness,<br><br>Thank you so much for responding to my posts.<br><br><blockquote>Yes...living as pure consciousness. This reminds me of my experience 20 years back when I first experience Presence.</blockquote>I can't help it, I must ask!!!  Can you please describe the stages you have gone through in the last 20 years?  What insights have you gained, what mistakes have you made?  Have you wasted time by making mistakes?<br><br><blockquote>My experience is that the struggle is unavoidable and necessary. It is not how people reinforced concepts into us but the depth of clarity of what consciousness really is.</blockquote>Yes, I love that clarity, it is exhilirating.<br><br><blockquote>The experience of 'Pure Consciousness', the Eternal Seer, the Ulitmate Witness or the center of all Source, what is fundamentally wrong that causes all these divisions, split, the sufferings that shouldn't exist in the first place? </blockquote>Why do you think these divisions shouldn't exist.  Did we not want to have a separate existence many centuries ago.  Is the separate sense of self a mistake or is it a grand experiment that is now slowly coming to an end.<br><br><blockquote>Perhaps my deep respect for Buddha is due to his profound insight of no-self and emptiness that helps me to go beyond the bond of the Eternal Witness, the source that causes the split. Mindfulness to me is truly an ingenius technique of allowing us to experience the One reality in a right way. In fact (to me) it is the correct medicine for dissolving the division after the experience of the Eternal Witness. How it dissolves the division between inner/outer reality, subject/object dualism. </blockquote>I must be missing something here because I don't see a problem with the manifested world appearing separate from the witness.  Perhaps that will come later I don't know.<br><br>What do you mean by the bond of the Eternal Witness.  What is It bonded to?<br><br>I must admit that in the past I have found mindfulness tedious.  The idea of watching yourself all the time just didn't work for me. I tried and tried but it just didn't feel natural.<br><br>I think I am still busy watching my mind freak out at what is happening at the moment.<br><br><blockquote>How by observing the phenomenon existence in a raw and undefined mode can lead one to the clear insight of true non-duality. Not only is there no 'who', there is no 'where' in the realm of pure awareness. </blockquote>How does one watch in a raw and undefined mode?<br><br><blockquote>This is my personal opinion.</blockquote>When you say this is my personal opinion, are you saying this is your understanding at this level of awareness that you are at.  Is it an admission of not seeing the "whole picture" yet.</div>

It appears quite random at times.<br><br>For instance this evening I had the insight that I have no idea what the present moment is.
