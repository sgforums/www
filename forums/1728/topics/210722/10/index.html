Why are you asking this? And how would we know? We're not Christians. And I seriously doubt what most Churches teach. Maybe certain traditions like the Trappist of Roman Catholics are closer.<br><br>According to Bernadette Roberts, she couldn't find her experience in Christian literature, and even St. John the Cross is only "halfway there". The Dark Night of the Spirit/transforming union/mystical marriage is often being described as the death of the little egoic self, and then falling into the "Source"/Atman-Brahman and therefore the attachment to the transcendental self is not dissolved, much less the realisation of No-Self as a dharma seal. No-Self as dharma seal, Truth, not as a stage, not merely as non-ego, is not taught in other religions. So the difference between Buddhism and most other religions is that Buddhism understands no-self as a dharma seal, not merely the dissolving of ego. The closest is Meister Eckhart according to her. I discussed about Bernadette Roberts with Thusness more than a year ago... and according to him, even Bernadette Roberts is not really "there" yet.<br><br>Furthermore, the practise of Mindfulness is perculiar to Buddhism, and Thusness says this is an ingenius way to enlightenment. It is not taught in other contemplative path.<br><br>(Update: Thusness told me Bernadette Roberts is at the 'No Witness' stage (i.e Stage 5), but have not realised conditioned arising and impermanence.)<br><br>Bernadette Roberts, a Christian mystic, says:<br><br><a href="http://www.spiritualteachers.org/b_roberts_interview.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiritualteachers.org/b_roberts_interview.htm</a><br><br><blockquote>Bernadette: I think it may be too late for me to ever have a good understanding of how other religions make this passage. If you are not surrendering your whole being, your very consciousness, to a loved and trusted personal God, then what are you surrendering it to? Or why surrender it at all? Loss of ego, loss of self, is just a by-product of this surrender; it is not the true goal, not an end in itself. Perhaps this is also the view of Mahayana Buddhism, where the goal is to save all sentient beings from suffering, and where loss of ego, loss of self, is seen as a means to a greater end. This view is very much in keeping with the Christian desire to save all souls. As I see it, without a personal God, the Buddhist must have a much stronger faith in the "unconditioned and unbegotten" than is required of the Christian contemplative, who experiences the passage as a divine doing, and in no way a self-doing.<br><br>Actually, I met up with Buddhism only at the end of my journey, after the no-self experience. <strong>Since I knew that this experience was <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not articulated in our contemplative literature</span></strong>, I went to the library to see if it could be found in the Eastern Religions. It did not take me long to realize that I would not find it in the Hindu tradition, where, as I see it, the final state is equivalent to the Christian experience of oneness or transforming union. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">If a Hindu had what I call the no-self experience, it would be the sudden, unexpected disappearance of the Atman-Brahman, the divine Self in the "cave of the heart", and the disappearance of the cave as well.</span></strong> It would be the ending of God-consciousness, or transcendental consciousness - that seemingly bottomless experience of "being", "consciousness", and "bliss" that articulates the state of oneness. To regard this ending as the falling away of the ego is a grave error; ego must fall away before the state of oneness can be realized. The no-self experience is the falling away of this previously realized transcendent state.<br><br><strong>Initially, when I looked into Buddhism, I did not find the experience of no-self there either; yet I intuited that it had to be there. The falling away of the ego is common to both Hinduism and Buddhism. Therefore, it would not account for the fact that Buddhism became a separate religion, nor would it account for the Buddhist's insistence on no eternal Self - be it divine, individual or the two in one. I felt that the key difference between these two religions was the no-self experience, the falling away of the true Self, Atman-Brahman.</strong> Unfortunately, what most Buddhist authors define as the no-self experience is actually the no-ego experience. The cessation of clinging, craving, desire, the passions, etc., and the ensuing state of imperturbable peace and joy articulates the egoless state of oneness; it does not, however, articulate the no-self experience or the dimension beyond. Unless we clearly distinguish between these two very different experiences, we only confuse them, with the inevitable result that the true no-self experience becomes lost. If we think the falling away of the ego, with its ensuing transformation and oneness, is the no-self experience, then what shall we call the much further experience when this egoless oneness falls away? In actual experience there is only one thing to call it, the "no-self experience"; it lends itself to no other possible articulation.<br><br>Initially, I gave up looking for this experience in the Buddhist literature. Four years later, however, I came across two lines attributed to Buddha describing his enlightenment experience. Referring to self as a house, he said, "All thy rafters are broken now, the ridgepole is destroyed." And there it was - the disappearance of the center, the ridgepole; without it, there can be no house, no self. When I read these lines, it was as if an arrow launched at the beginning of time had suddenly hit a bulls-eye. It was a remarkable find. These lines are not a piece of philosophy, but an experiential account, and without the experiential account we really have nothing to go on. In the same verse he says, "Again a house thou shall not build," clearly distinguishing this experience from the falling away of the ego-center, after which a new, transformed self is built around a "true center," a sturdy, balanced ridgepole.<br><br>As a Christian, I saw the no-self experience as the true nature of Christ's death, the movement beyond even is oneness with the divine, the movement from God to Godhead. Though not articulated in contemplative literature, Christ dramatized this experience on the cross for all ages to see and ponder. Where Buddha described the experience, Christ manifested it without words; yet they both make the same statement and reveal the same truth - that ultimately, eternal life is beyond self or consciousness. After one has seen it manifested or heard it said, the only thing left is to experience it. </blockquote></div>

But at some point if you are mindful and the mind is free from thoughts, the dualistic bond that creates an impression of separation, 'you' and 'the world' dissolve. Suddenly it doesn't feel like you are here, looking at the world out there. Instead, you feel like you BECOME the looking, you are the universe, you are the tree, you are the seeing and the seen. Another way of putting it.. It is not you who sees, the universe self-sees. Things become vivid and clear, there is clarity in it, and you are that... The mountains and the universe is closer than your skin. When this happened to me, there is also a blissful 'energy' arising, like in meditative jhanas. But anyway that is not enlightenment, because it is not realising our buddha nature, in other words it is an 'experience' of no-self yet the nature of no-self and awareness is not understood. Enlightenment is not an experience that comes and go.</div>

Experiences come and go, has a beginning and an ending. Enlightenment is the realisation of the ever-present, and that there is really nothing to attain.

Why are you asking this? And how would we know? We're not Christians. And I seriously doubt what most Churches teach. Maybe certain traditions like the Trappist of Roman Catholics are closer.<br><br>According to Bernadette Roberts, she couldn't find her experience in Christian literature, and even St. John the Cross is only "halfway there". The Dark Night of the Spirit/transforming union/mystical marriage is often being described as the death of the little egoic self, and then falling into the "Source"/Atman-Brahman and therefore the attachment to the transcendental self is not dissolved, much less the realisation of No-Self as a dharma seal. No-Self as dharma seal, Truth, not as a stage, not merely as non-ego, is not taught in other religions. So the difference between Buddhism and most other religions is that Buddhism understands no-self as a dharma seal, not merely the dissolving of ego. The closest is Meister Eckhart according to her. I discussed about Bernadette Roberts with Thusness more than a year ago... and according to him, even Bernadette Roberts is not really "there" yet.<br><br>Furthermore, the practise of Mindfulness is perculiar to Buddhism, and Thusness says this is an ingenius way to enlightenment. It is not taught in other contemplative path.<br><br>(Update: Thusness told me Bernadette Roberts is at the 'No Witness' stage (i.e Stage 5), but have not realised conditioned arising and impermanence.)<br><br>Bernadette Roberts, a Christian mystic, says:<br><br>http://www.spiritualteachers.org/b_roberts_interview.htm </div></blockquote>then she needs to surrender more to God. mindfulness comes naturally when you have an omniscient and omnipresent God.<br><br>and btw is jon experiencing no self?</div>

You need to phrase properly.<br><br>I'm not saying you don't understand. Mindfulness is like 'experiencing' clarity in all manifestation, yet no 'experiencer'. By surrendering one will eventually experience that clarity, but why not experience it now. Buddha is more clear on the mindfulness aspect.<br><br>'Surrendering' is like surrendering to divine happening, seeings things as happening by divine will, and therefore not becoming attached. One has surrendered to what is. When there is no attachment, then one will also experience clarity. I don't know how much they know about mindfulness so I will not comment further.</div>
