His master was from India. I was attuned in Singapore. Do you still keep in touch with Alan? I would like to find out about the different masters. You can find out about Parag too if you like. He has his own website. Maybe you would have heard of him too. I have nothing but respect for him, for helping me obtain the gift of healing and self healing. Were you attuned in Singapore?<br><br>Some people who practise energy, you can feel them when you are near them. They seem to give it out. I had a friend whose energy field feels like "electricity" where the hands on my arms would salute to. Like static. I thought I felt ghost, but I had no fear at that time, and instinct tells me its all right. But the thing is, this friend of mine have not been doing the energy thing like since two years back, but his energy flowed out when I am near him. Energy flows out, as it is, not from the hands but from the body. No need to call for it. Spontaneous. Like what we have been talking about in these threads. I seldom meet anyone who gives out energy that can be clearly felt, and it also takes to recognize it and realise that it is actually just energy flowing. The energy came out from him, his being. He has a different mentor that teaches on how to use energies.<br><br>What does Alan's energy field feels like?<br>My friend can describe energy as sweet, or heavy, or even sourish. Thay are good and bad ones too. "Sourish" probably from the bad kind of people. I have not have the chance to taste much energy cos I have not met many to recognize it. Im amazed  one can "taste" it. Know anything about it?<br><br>Why waste energy? Conserve it and put it to good use. :p<br>Hope to hear from ya soon.</div></blockquote>Hi Love me or hate me,<br><br>Thanks so much for the reply.<br><br>As for Alan, he has a warm energy field. He is a kindly ex-Buddhist monk. He is also very much in Taoism or many things mystical for that matter. I have not keep in touch with him for quite some times now. In the past, i will meet him for qi-gong during the weekends if i am free. Nowadays life is so busy...<br><br>My wife was also attuned to Reiki 2 by him. My wife said that her initial encounter with him gave her a headache.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think each individual may feel differently depending on the vibrational field.<br><br>So, if i may ask. Do you have any intention of turning 'pro' after the Master attunement?<br><br>Nice talking to you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

No not yet. Not really ready for that. I do healings for people I know personally. Im only in my late 20s. Maybe when im much older. Its like part time for me now. Its been two years since im attuned. Reiki is so simple, yet complicated. But for us, once we know it, its like a switch, on the back of your hands. So easy, and friendly.<br><br>Headache? Never heard of it tho. Maybe, it was energy trying to break through a blockage that caused the headache? Experiencing pain is a sign. If you both are free, can attend Parag's free workshops that he conducts on weekends. In recent emails he talked about discovering something about the symbols that Mikao Usui used through his deep study. Let me know if you would like to be on his mailing list. Can forward u his email address. Who knows when you are ready, and maybe your wife can find a suitable master that she will be comfortable with. He has this quiet calmness aura around him.<br><br>My next atttunment will be 3A. 3B will only be the final master attunement. So it will be sometime yet. With 3B comes responsibilty I feel. To carry on the works  on Dr. Mikao Usui. And never to allow a gift like this to die off. I have commitments now, not right timing yet. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But I will have to do it before my master gets too too old.</div>
