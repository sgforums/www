            <div class='col-md body'>Her experience is truly beautiful.  Thanks...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br><blockquote><br>Less than two weeks after I entered the halfway house, my life changed completely. What follows is a very approximate account.<br><br>One morning I woke up. I had been sleeping on the floor as usual. Nothing special had happened the night before; I just opened my eyes. But I was seeing without concepts, without thoughts or an internal story. There was no me. It was as if something else had woken up. It opened its eyes. It was looking through Katie's eyes. And it was crisp, it was clear, it was new, it had never been here before. Everything was unrecognizable. And it was so delighted! Laughter welled up from the depths and just poured out. It breathed and was ecstasy. It was intoxicated with joy: totally greedy for everything. There was nothing separate, nothing unacceptable to it. Everything was its very own self. For the first time I Â— it Â— experienced the love of its own life. I Â— it Â—was amazed!<br><br>In trying to be as accurate as possible, I am using the word Â“itÂ” for this delighted, loving awareness, in which there was no me or world, and in which everything was included. There just isn't another way to say how completely new and fresh the awareness was. There was no I observing the Â“it.Â” There was nothing but the Â“it.Â” And even the realization of an Â“itÂ” came later.<br><br>Let me say this in a different way. A foot appeared; there was a c0ckroach crawling over it. It opened its eyes, and there was something on the foot; or there was something on the foot, and then it opened its eyes Â— I don't know the sequence, because there was no time in any of this. So, to put it in slow motion: it opened its eyes, looked down at the foot, a c0ckroach was crawling across the ankle, and Â… it was awake! It was born. And from then on, it's been observing. But there wasn't a subject or an object. It was Â— is Â— everything it saw. There's no separation in it, anywhere.<br><br>All my rage, all the thoughts that had been troubling me, my whole world, the whole world, was gone. The only thing that existed was awareness. The foot and the c0ckroach weren't outside me; there was no outside or inside. It was all me. And I felt delight Â— absolute delight! There was nothing, and there was a whole world: walls and floor and ceiling and light and body, everything, in such fullness. But only what it could see: no more, no less.<br><br>Then it stood up, and that was amazing. There was no thinking, no plan. It just stood up and walked to the bathroom. It walked straight to a mirror, and it locked onto the eyes of its own reflection, and it understood. And that was even deeper than the delight it had known before. It fell in love with that being in the mirror. It was as if the woman and the awareness of the woman had permanently merged. There were only the eyes, and a sense of absolute vastness, with no knowledge in it. It was as if I Â— she Â— had been shot through with electricity. It was like God giving itself life through the body of the woman Â— God so loving and bright, so vast Â— and yet she knew that it was herself. It made such a deep connection with her eyes. There was no meaning to it, just a nameless recognition that consumed her.<br><br>Love is the best word I can find for it. It had been split apart, and now it was joined. There was it moving, and then it in the mirror, and then it joined as quickly as it had separated Â— it was all eyes. The eyes in the mirror were the eyes of it. And it gave itself back again , as it met again. And that gave it its identity, which I call love. As it looked in the mirror, the eyes Â— the depth of themÂ— were all that was real, all that existed Â— prior to that, nothing. No eyes, no anything; even standing there, there was nothing. And then the eyes come out to give it what it is. People name things a wall, a ceiling, a foot, a hand. But it had no name for these things, because it's indivisible. And it's invisible. Until the eyes. Until the eyes. I remember tears of gratitude pouring down the cheeks as it looked at its own reflection. It stood there staring for I don't know how long.<br><br>These were the first moments after I was born as it, or it as me. There was nothing left of Katie. There was literally not even a shred of memory of her Â— no past, no future, not even a present. And in that openness, such joy. Â“There's nothing sweeter than this,Â” I felt; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Â“there is nothing but this. If you loved yourself more than anything you could imagine, you would give yourself this. A face. A hand. Breath. But that's not enough. A wall. A ceiling. A window. A bed. Light bulbs. Ooh! And this too! And this too! And this too!Â” </span><br><br>(I love the way she expressed it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> )<br><br>All this took place beyond time. But when I put it into language, I have to backtrack and fill in. While I was lying on the floor, I understood that when I was asleep, prior to c0ckroach or foot, prior to any thoughts, prior to any world, there is nothing. In that instant, the four questions of The Work were born. I understood that no thought is true. The whole of inquiry was already present in that understanding. It was like closing a gate and hearing it click shut. It wasn't I who woke up: inquiry woke up. The two polarities, the left and right of things, the something/nothing of it all, woke up. Both sides were equal. I understood this in that first instant of no-time .<br><br>So to say it again: As I was lying there in the awareness, as the awareness, the thought arose: It's a foot. And immediately I saw that it wasn't true, and that was the delight of it. I saw that it was all backward. It's not a foot; it's not a c0ckroach. It wasn't true, and yet there was a foot, there was a c0ckroach. It opened its eyes and saw a foot, and a c0ckroach crawling over the foot. But there was no name for these things. There were no separate words for foot or c0ckroach or wall or any of it. So it was looking at its entire body, looking at itself, with no name. Nothing was separate from it, nothing was outside it, it was all pulsing with life and delight, and it was all one unbroken experience. To separate that wholeness and see anything as outside itself, wasn't true. The foot existed, yet it wasn't a separate thing, and to call it a Â“foot,Â” or an anything, felt like a lie. It was absurd. And the laughter kept pouring out of me. I saw that c0ckroach and foot are names for joy, that there are no names for what appears as real now. This was the birth of awareness: thought reflecting back as itself, seeing itself as everything, surrounded by the vast ocean of its own laughter.<br><br>When I try to explain how The Work was born in that instant of realization, I can analyze the instant, slow it down, and tell it so that it takes on time. But this is giving time to an instant that wasn't even an instant. In that no-time, everything was known and seen as nothing. It saw a foot, and it knew that it wasn't a foot, and it loved that it was. The first and second of the four questions is like the slow-motion mechanics of the experience. Â“It's a footÂ” Â— is that true? Can I absolutely know that it's true? No. What was it like before the thought of Â“footÂ” appeared, before there was the world of Â“footÂ”? Nothing.<br><br>Then the third question: How do I react when I believe the thought? I was aware that there's always a contraction, that when I believe any thought I create a world separate from myself, an object that is apparently Â“out there,Â” and that the contraction is a form of suffering. And the fourth: Who would I be without that thought? I would be prior to thought, I would be Â— I am Â— peace, absolute joy. Then the turnaround: It's a foot / it's not a foot. Actually, all four questions were present in the first Â— Is it true? Â— and everything was already released in the instant that the first question was asked. The second, third, and fourth questions were embedded in the inquiry that was there in the experience. There were no words for any of the questions Â— they were not explicit, not thought, not experienced in time, but present as possibilities when I looked at my experience later and tried to make it available for people. With the fourth question the circle is complete. And then the turnaround is the grounding, the re-entry. There's nothing / there's something. And in that way people can be held without the terror of being nothing, without identity. The turnaround holds them until it's a comfortable place. And they realize that nowhere to go is really where they already are.<br></blockquote></div>

Pretty thorough on the aspect of non-duality and with all due respect to him, I think he still misses some points.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Thusness,<br><br>I just reread this:<br><br><blockquote><strong>For the purpose of discussion, I would like to introduce you one concept, it is the "seed of pre-conscious propensities";;. It is a layer of Â‘bondÂ’ that prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ somethingÂ…it is very subtle, very thin, very fineÂ…it goes almost undetected. What this Â‘bondÂ’ does is it prevents us from Â‘seeingÂ’ what Â“WITNESSÂ” really is and makes us constantly fall back to the Witness, to the Source, to the Center . Every moment we want to sink back to Witness, to the Center, to this Beingness, this is an illusion. It is habitual and almost hypnotic.<br><br>But what exactly is this Â“witnessÂ” we are talking about? It is the manifestation itself! It is the appearance itself! There is no Source to fall back, the Appearance is the Source! Including the moment to moment of thoughts. The problem is we choose, but all is really it. There is nothing to choose.<br><br>There is no mirror reflecting<br>Manifestation alone IS.<br><br>There is no invisible witness hiding anywhere. Whenever we attempt to fall back to this Â“an invisible transparent image Â“, it is again the mind game of thought. It is the Â‘bondÂ’ at work. I wonder this make sense to you. </strong></blockquote>Now I understand your question! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It is all One.  No separation.  Separation is appearance only!<br><br>And Thusness will explain why this appearance of separation of awareness from everything else occurs.<br><br>That was his question to me.<br><br>Why we fall back into trying to be just the awareness, when in fact we are everything.</div>
