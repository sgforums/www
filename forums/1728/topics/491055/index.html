              Facebook friends to submit questions on the topic of Buddhism and medicine. I
              collated the questions together, and wrote the brief responses below….</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Is there
              such a thing as “Buddhist medicine”? Is medicine really something central to
              Buddhism? How did medicine influence Buddhism? </span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Every Buddhist tradition of
              which I am aware has something to say about illness, health, and healing. An
              interest in the mind-body relationship and its relationship to mental and
              physical suffering goes back to the very origins of Buddhism. The tradition
              developed in India in the last half-millennium BC, at the same time and in the
              same social circles as other ascetic groups. These “shramana” collectively
              developed a variety of mental and physical self-discipline practices that, in
              the long run, developed into what we know today as meditation,
              yogic exercises, pranayama, and so forth. These practices led to increasing
              insights into the relationship between the body, mind, emotions, and breath,
              which is a topic that Buddhists have continued to write about over the
              centuries between the ancient period and today.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">It may have been in these
              same circles of forest practitioners that traditional Indian medicine
              (Ayurveda) also emerged in the last centuries BC. While medicine wasn’t
              necessarily the direct source of Buddhist thought, there are certain
              connections that are traditionally made between Indian medicine and
              Buddhism. One significant example is that the Four Noble Truths — the
              Buddha’s insight that life is dissatisfactory, that craving is the origin of
              this dissatisfaction, that there is a possibility to overcome craving, and that
              the Eightfold Path is that solution — is often said to reflect a medical logic.
              In this view, the Four Noble Truths are thought to be analogous to the
              patient’s disease, the doctor’s discovery of the origin of the disease, the
              doctor’s knowledge of the cure for the disease, and the prescription the
              patient takes in order to become healthy. This is a very common way of
              understanding these basic teachings within the Buddhist tradition.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In addition to the Four Noble
              Truths, anatomical and physiological terminology are frequently invoked in
              Buddhist texts, particularly in descriptions of meditation practices and other
              ascetic discourses. Narratives of the wondrous healing exploits of deities,
              monks, and other heroes have been a feature of the Buddhist hagiographic
              literature of all periods. Rites to dispel disease have been central to the
              ritual repertoires of monastics across Asia. Medical metaphors — such as the
              Buddha being the “Great Physician” and his teachings being the “Great Medicine”
              — are frequently utilized in order to make accessible many of the complex
              philosophical aspects of the Dharma. Many Buddhist authors and texts even
              suggest that fully understanding the body is the very essence of the Buddha’s
              teachings. Taken collectively, such Buddhist perspectives on health, disease,
              healers, patients, therapies, and bodies are often spoken of by scholars and
              devotees as “Buddhist medicine.”</span></p>

              major threads that characterize the practices and theories of Buddhist medicine
              across different regions/countries? What are the cultural influences and
              interactions between Buddhist medicine and Chinese, Indian, and Western
              medicine?</span></em></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">There is a particular set of
              medical ideas and practices that became part of the Buddhist tradition in the
              earliest period in India, and that were spread globally along with the
              transmission of Buddhism. This includes the notion that the body is composed of
              the Four Elements (earth, water, fire, and wind), that karma is at least partly
              responsible for health and illness, that enlightenment brings power over the
              wellbeing of the mind and the body, and that healers should approach patients
              with compassion and selflessness. Also, Buddhist orientations toward healing
              include the idea that the practices of meditation, moderation of diet and
              lifestyle, chanting, and rituals calling upon Buddhist deities all can
              contribute to one’s health.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">If you pressed me to identify
              one value or idea that lies at the core of Buddhist approaches to health, I
              would say it is the notion that mental wellbeing is the principal precondition
              for physical health. Some later texts take this position to an extreme, arguing
              that illness is a purely mental construct. Such is the case in Chapter 5 of the
              Vimalakirti Sutra, where the great bodhisattva teaches that illness arises from
              delusion and attachment to the world, and that enlightened people can choose to
              manifest or overcome illness at will. While not all Buddhists would agree with
              this position, recognizing that the mind plays a major role in maintaining and
              regaining physical health is routine in Buddhist texts from across the
              spectrum.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">All of that being said, even
              though there are some core concepts and practices, it is best not to think of
              “Buddhist medicine” as a cohesive or fixed system. (I have argued in<span> </span></span><a href="http://chinesebuddhiststudies.org/previous_issues/jcbs2802_Salguero(35-66).pdf"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #0066cc;'>a recent
              article</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> that “Buddhist medicine” is a term that seems to have been
              invented in the mid-twentieth century, as part of an effort to make Buddhist
              ideas about illness and health seem modern.) Instead, it’s probably best to
              assume that Buddhism is an ever-changing and transforming tradition that has
              few core ideas and much local variation, and to investigate what people do,
              think, and believe at the local level rather than look to make grand sweeping
              generalizations.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The basic principles of
              Indian medicine, such as the Four Elements, the tridosha, etc., are found in
              many Buddhist texts on healing from across Asia. That these concepts are found
              in Buddhist and Ayurvedic texts alike is not surprising, as both products of
              the same cultural context. In other words, early Indian Buddhism seems to have
              picked up the ways of speaking about illness, health, and the body that
              prevailed in the culture of its origin. As Buddhism spread throughout Asia, its
              approaches to health were not fixed. Often, certain aspects of the Indian medical
              thought were preserved, but just as often they were replaced with
              domestic medical ideas. For example, in East Asia, many Buddhist healers
              were more interested in working with qi and other Chinese medical concepts than
              with the Four Elements or the tridosha (see my publications on this topic<span> </span></span><a href="http://piercesalguero.com/publications"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #0066cc;'>here</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">).
              Similarly, in modern times, the benefits of Buddhist interventions are being
              explained in scientific and biomedical terms.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In addition to Buddhist ideas
              being transformed by contact and exchange with other medical cultures, medical
              traditions in many parts of the world have been transformed to varying degrees
              by exposure to Indian concepts that arrived along with Buddhism. For example, a
              lot of research has been done by Chinese scholars on the interaction between
              Buddhism and native Chinese medical traditions. One can also point to the
              increasing influence that Buddhist (or Buddhist-inspired) meditation has had on
              modern clinical research. (See recent reviews of this research </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/n/cer124/pdf/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #1155cc;'>here</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidmJO465LKAhUB6SYKHcLAD1gQFggdMAA&amp;url=http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/lib/download/1767/deVibe_MBSR_Review+(1).pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNEtaYzDXafRusEM5aZunMZFnakwxw&amp;sig2=rpRmelYS44IRKj_r4R8SGw"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #1155cc;'>here</span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">.)</span></p>

              major catalyst for the spread of certain Indian ideas and approaches throughout
              Asia. In many countries (such as Thailand, Tibet, Burma, Sri Lanka, Mongolia,
              etc.), these became the foundation of local systems of traditional medicine,
              many of which are still widely practiced today. Healing in contemporary
              Thailand, just to give one example, is based on the Four Elements, is
              attributed to legendary Buddhist patriarchs (such as Jivaka, the Buddha’s
              physician), and includes many ritual procedures (such as chanting,
              purification, exorcism, mediation, and blessings) that call upon the power of
              the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha to vanquish illness. Contemporary traditional
              medicine practice in the other cultures mentioned above are also similarly
              indebted to Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Institutions specializing in
              Buddhist or Buddhist-inspired healing exist all over Asia. I will mention only
              a few organizations to give a sense of the wide spectrum that is out there.

              Ministry of Public Health frequently contain references to the health benefits
              of the practice of Buddhism alongside other traditional therapies such as
              massage and herbs (for examples, see </span><a href="http://www.thaimedicinezone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chokevivant-Chuthaputti-2005.pdf"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #0066cc;'>here</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'> and </span><a href="http://www.thaimedicinezone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/articles-Thai-Healthcare.pdf"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #0066cc;'>here</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>). Another
