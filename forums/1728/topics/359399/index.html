              so we are so called descendants of the deva, aka the light sound heaven realm from the 33 heavenly realm.

              animal spirits are ghosts? hmm. you mean animal ghosts? but how can they be transformed into humans?
              
              you need to be reborn as a human to be a human.

              <h2>Eight Kinds of Supernatural Beings</h2>
              <h4>In addition to the geography of the Mt. Sumeru world system and the six worlds which compose it, one should know something about the population. In addition to human beings and animals, there are many kinds of gods, demons, and other supernatural creatures. The major ones are included in the group called the eight kinds of supernatural beings who protect and revere the Dharma. These are:</h4>
              <h4>1. Devas or gods: This category includes all those who live in the heavenly realms, from the celestial courtiers, the apsaras, to the Four Heavenly Kings, Indra, Brahma, and all the other devas, or shining ones. The major devas and groups of devas who inhabit the heavenly realms are:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>Apsaras: These are the attendants, retainers, entertainers, and celestial nymphs who populate the heavenly palaces.</h4>
              <h4><a href="/forums/1728/topics/4kings.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Four Heavenly Kings</span></span></a>: These are the guardians who defend the world and the four sides of Mt. Sumeru from the fighting demons. They are: Vaishravana - Heavenly King of the North; Dhritarashtra - Heavenly King of the East; Virudhaka - Heavenly King of the South; and Virupaksha - Heavenly King of the West. They dwell in the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings, and from there command their armies under the direction of Indra.</h4>
              <h4>The Thirty-three Gods of the Heaven of the Thirty-three: According to the <strong><em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em> (cited in <em>The Myths and Gods of India</em> by Alain Danielou) there are thirty-three gods and these consist of their ruler, </strong><a href="/forums/1728/topics/devas.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Indra</span></span></a>; the lord of creation, Prajapati; the eight spheres-of-existence, the Vasus; the eleven divinities-of-life, the Rudras; and the twelve sovereign-principles, the Adityas.</h4>
              <h4>The Vasus rule the elements of the earthly realm. Their name means "dwellings" because they rule the dwelling places of all that exists. Danielou lists them as follows:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>"The eight Vasus include the earthly-sphere (<strong><em>prthiva</em>) and the fiery energy which dwells in it, Agni; the sphere-of-space (<em>antariksa</em>) and the fiery energy which dwells in it, Vayu, the Wind; the heavenly-sphere (<em>dyaus</em>) and the fiery energy which dwells in it, the Sun (</strong><a href="/forums/1728/topics/devas.html"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Surya</strong></span></span></em></a>); then comes the sphere-of-constellations (<strong><em>naksatra</em>) and the gentle energy which dwells in it, the </strong><a href="/forums/1728/topics/devas.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Moon</span></span></a> or Offering (<strong><em>Soma</em>). " (<em>The Myths and Gods of India</em></strong>, pp. 85-86)</h4>
              </blockquote>
              <h4>The Rudras rule the life-forces and their dynamism keeps the world in motion and change. Their name means "howlers" and they are called this because of the suffering that is caused when the life forces withdraw upon death. They are fearsome warlike deities and are aspects of the god Shiva. According to the <strong><em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em>, there are ten Rudras corresponding to the ten life-forces of human beings and an eleventh corresponding to the self or atman. Danielou states: "Eight of the Rudras are equivalents to eight of the auspicious manifestations of Siva (<em>asta-murti</em></strong>); the others represent the fearful forms of fire. The first can be propitiated through worship; man should keep aloof from the others." (Ibid, p.103). The eleven could also possibly be the five deities who are the components of Siva, the five deities who are the five faces of Siva, and the self.</h4>
              <h4>The Adityas rule the intellect and the celestial sphere. They are the sons of Aditi, the Primordial-Vastness. Danielou lists them as: "The twelve-sovereign principles are generally given as Mitra (solidarity), Varuna (fate), Aryaman (chivalry), Daksa (ritual skill), Bhaga (the inherited share), Amsa (the god's given share), Tvastr (craftsmanship), Savitr (the magic power of words), Pusan (prosperity), Sakra (courage), Vivasvat (social laws), and Visnu (cosmic law)." (Ibid, p. 115)</h4>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <h4>Yama: The first human being to have passed away was Yama, and he then became the first ancestor and eventually the ruler and judge of the dead. Though he presides over the worlds of the hells and hungry ghosts, his palace is in the Heaven of Time.</h4>

The Great Brahma believes himself to be the omnipotent creator of the world.</h4>
              <h4>Ishvara: The Freedom God who dwells in the Highest Heaven. Sometimes he is called Maheshvara, the Great Freedom God. He is the highest and most sublime of the devas.</h4>

              <h4>4. Gandharvas: These are the court musicians of the heavenly realms. They are classified as supernatural animals.</h4>
              <h4>5. Kimnaras: These are court singers and dancers. The men are said to have horse heads and sing, while the women are fully human in form and dance. Kimnaras are also portrayed as birds with human heads and torsos. They are classified as supernatural animals.</h4>
              <h4>6. Garudas: These are either giant birds who hunt and eat the nagas, or they are humanoids with wings and the heads of birds. They often serve as mounts for the devas. They are classified as supernatural animals.</h4>
              <h4>7. Mahoragas: These are also celestial musicians. They are either giant snakes or humanoids with the heads of snakes. They are classified as supernatural animals.</h4>

              <p>so perhaps they or ''å¦–ç²¾'' are part of human realm who practice some unknown ways. and i think immortal does not mean live forever, maybe live very very long time but still can 'die' by accident.</p>

              <p>there are other supernatural creatures as well. sometimes, u

              <h4>The Rudras rule the life-forces and their dynamism keeps the
              world in motion and change. Their name means "howlers" and they are
              called this because of the suffering that is caused when the life
              forces withdraw upon death. They are fearsome warlike deities and
              are aspects of the god Shiva. According to the
              <strong><em>Brihadaranyaka Upanishad</em>, there are ten Rudras
              corresponding to the ten life-forces of human beings and an
              eleventh corresponding to the self or atman. Danielou states:
              "Eight of the Rudras are equivalents to eight of the auspicious
              manifestations of Siva (<em>asta-murti</em></strong>); the others
              represent the fearful forms of fire. The first can be propitiated
              through worship; man should keep aloof from the others." (Ibid,
              p.103). The eleven could also possibly be the five deities who are
              the components of Siva, the five deities who are the five faces of
              Siva, and the self.</h4>
              <h4>The Adityas rule the intellect and the celestial sphere. They
              are the sons of Aditi, the Primordial-Vastness. Danielou lists them
              as: "The twelve-sovereign principles are generally given as Mitra
              (solidarity), Varuna (fate), Aryaman (chivalry), Daksa (ritual
              skill), Bhaga (the inherited share), Amsa (the god's given share),
              Tvastr (craftsmanship), Savitr (the magic power of words), Pusan
              (prosperity), Sakra (courage), Vivasvat (social laws), and Visnu
              (cosmic law)." (Ibid, p. 115)</h4>

              <p><em>In the mythology of Tibetan Buddhism, Mount Meru is a place which simultaneously represents the center of the universe and the single-pointedness of mind sought by adepts. Thousands of miles in height, Meru is located somewhere beyond the physical plane of reality, in a realm of perfection and transcendence. Symbolic representations of Mount Meru are commonly found in Tibetan mandalas, contemplative diagrams designed to aid meditators in focusing. </em></p>
              <p><em>It is said that Meru has its roots in hell, and its summit in heaven. Meru is surrounded by seven rings of golden mountains, each separated from the other by one of seven circular oceans. It is crowned by a golden palace wherein Indra, king of Hindu gods, resides. This entire superstructure rises from an outer ocean, and is flanked by four main continents, each with two subcontinents. </em></p>
              <p><em>The southern continent, Jambudvipa, corresponds to the physical earth. Each of the other continents represents a nearby planet upon which transmigrating souls following the yellow light-path may be reborn. However, it is said that all of these worlds are undesirable, for they are non-human worlds inhabited by sheep, cattle, or horses. The teachings of Buddhism clearly state that existence as a human being is the only way to achieve Buddhahood, so rebirth in any other form (including that of a deva or demigod) is a distraction from the path to enlightenment. </em></p>
