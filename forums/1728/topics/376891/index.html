              <div class="quotemain">(41)
                      Ananda, you should know that the good person has thoroughly seen the
                      formations skandha as empty, and he must return consciousness to the
                      source. He has already ended production and destruction, but he has not
                      yet perfected the subtle wonder of ultimate serenity.<br><br>He can
                      cause the individual sense faculties of his body to unite and open. He
                      also has a pervasive awareness of all the categories of beings in the
                      ten directions. Since his awareness is pervasive, he can enter the
                      perfect source. But if he regards what he is returning to as the cause
                      of true permanence and interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall
                      into the error of holding to that cause. <strong>Kapila the Sankhyan</strong>,
                      with his theory of returning to the Truth of the Unmanifest, will
                      become his companion. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will
                      lose his knowledge and understanding.<br><br>This is the first state,
                      in which he creates a place to which to return, based on the idea that
                      there is something to attain. He strays far from perfect penetration
                      and turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of
                      externalism.<br><br>(42) Further, Ananda, the good person has
                      thoroughly seen the formations skandha as empty. He has already ended
                      production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle
                      wonder of ultimate serenity.<br><br>He may regard that to which he is
                      returning as his own body and see all living beings in the twelve
                      categories throughout space as flowing forth from his body. If he
                      interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall into the error of
                      maintaining that he has an ability which he does not really have. <strong>Maheshvara</strong>,
                      who manifests his boundless body, will become his companion. Confused
                      about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and
                      understanding.<br><br>This is the second state, in which he creates a
                      specific ability based on the idea that he has such an ability. He
                      strays far from perfect penetration and turns his back on the City of
                      Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds for being born in the Heaven of Great
                      Pride where the self is considered all-pervading and perfect.<br><br>(43)
                      Further, the good person has thoroughly seen the formations skandha as
                      empty. He has already ended production and destruction, but he has not
                      yet perfected the subtle wonder of ultimate serenity.<br><br>If he
                      regards what he is returning to as a refuge, he will suspect that his
                      body and mind come forth from there, and that all things in the ten
                      directions of space arise from there as well. He will explain that that
                      place from which all things issue forth is the truly permanent body,
                      which is not subject to production and destruction. While still within
                      production and destruction, he prematurely reckons that he abides in
                      permanence. Since he is deluded about non-production, he is also
                      confused about production and destruction. He is sunk in confusion. If
                      he interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall into the error of
                      taking what is not permanent to be permanent. He will speculate that
                      the <strong>God of Sovereignty (Ishvaradeva)</strong> is his companion. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his knowledge and understanding.<br><br>This
                      is the third state, in which he makes a false speculation based on the
                      idea that there is a refuge. He strays far from perfect penetration and
                      turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of an
                      distorted view of perfection.<br><br>(44) Further, the good person has
                      thoroughly seen the formations skandha as empty. He has already ended
                      production and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle
                      wonder of ultimate serenity.<br><br>Based on his idea that there is
                      universal awareness, he formulates a theory that all the plants and
                      trees in the ten directions are sentient, not different from human
                      beings. He claims that plants and trees can become people, and that
                      when people die they again become plants and trees in the ten
                      directions. If he considers this idea of unrestricted, universal
                      awareness to be supreme, he will fall into the error of maintaining
                      that what is not aware has awareness. <strong>Vasishtha and Sainika</strong>,
                      who maintained the idea of comprehensive awareness, will become his
                      companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his
                      knowledge and understanding.<br><br>This is the fourth state, in which
                      he creates an erroneous interpretation based on the idea that there is
                      a universal awareness. He strays far from perfect penetration and turns
                      his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of a distorted
                      view of awareness.<br><br>(45) Further, the good person has thoroughly
                      seen the formations skandha as empty. He has already ended production
                      and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle wonder of
                      ultimate serenity.<br><br>If he has attained versatility in the perfect
                      fusion and interchangeable functioning of the sense faculties, he may
                      speculate that all things arise from these perfect transformations. He
                      then seeks the light of fire, delights in the purity of water, loves
                      the wind's circuitous flow, and contemplates the accomplishments of the
                      earth. He reveres and serves them all. He takes these mundane elements
                      to be a fundamental cause and considers them to be everlasting. He will
                      then fall into the error of taking what is not production to be
                      production. Kashyapa and the Brahmans who seek to transcend birth and
                      death by diligently serving fire and worshipping water will become his
                      companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his
                      knowledge and understanding.<br><br>This is the fifth state, in which
                      he confusedly pursues the elements, creating a false cause that leads
                      to false aspirations based on speculations about his attachment to
                      worship. He strays far from perfect penetration and turns his back on
                      the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of a distorted view of
                      transformation.<br><br>(46) Further, the good person has thoroughly
                      seen the formations skandha as empty. He has ended production and
                      destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle wonder of ultimate
                      serenity.<br><br>He may speculate that there is an emptiness within the
                      perfect brightness, and based on that he denies the myriad
                      transformations, taking their eternal cessation as his refuge. If he
                      interprets this as a supreme state, he will fall into the error of
                      taking what is not a refuge to be a refuge. Those abiding in Shunyata
                      in the Heaven of [Neither Thought nor] Non-Thought will become his
                      companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his
                      knowledge and understanding.<br><br>This is the sixth state, in which
                      he realizes a state of voidness based on the idea of emptiness within
                      the perfect brightness. He strays far from perfect penetration and
                      turns his back on the City of Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds of
                      annihilationism.<br><br>(47) Further, the good person has thoroughly
                      seen the formations skandha as empty. He has already ended production
                      and destruction, but he has not yet perfected the subtle wonder of
                      ultimate serenity.<br><br>In the state of perfect permanence, he may
                      bolster his body, hoping to live for a long time in that subtle and
                      perfect condition without dying. If he interprets this as a supreme
                      state, he will fall into the error of being greedy for something
                      unattainable. Asita and those who seek long life will become his
                      companions. Confused about the Bodhi of the Buddhas, he will lose his
                      knowledge and understanding.<br><br>This is the seventh state, in which
                      he creates the false cause of bolstering and aspires to permanent
                      worldly existence, based on his attachment to the life-source. He
                      strays far from perfect penetration and turns his back on the City of
                      Nirvana, thus sowing the seeds for false thoughts of lengthening life.</div>

              <p>Buddha warned (in Shurangama Sutra) against taking Consciousness as a permanent Spiritual Self:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <div class="quotemain">(33)
                      Further, in his practice of samadhi, such a good person's mind is firm,
                      unmoving, and proper and can no longer be disturbed by demons. He can
                      thoroughly investigate the origin of all categories of beings and
                      contemplate the source of the subtle, fleeting, and constant
                      fluctuation. But if he begins to speculate about self and others, he
                      could fall into error with theories of partial impermanence and partial
                      permanence based on four distorted views.<br><br>First, as this person
                      contemplates the wonderfully bright mind pervading the ten directions,
                      he concludes that this state of profound stillness is the ultimate
                      spiritual self. Then he speculates, "My spiritual self, which is
                      settled, bright, and unmoving, pervades the ten directions. All living
                      beings are within my mind, and there they are born and die by
                      themselves. Therefore, my mind is permanent, while those who undergo
                      birth and death there are truly impermanent."<br><br>......<br><br>Because
                      of these speculations of impermanence and permanence, he will fall into
                      externalism and become confused about the Bodhi nature. This is the
                      third externalist teaching, in which one postulates partial permanence.<br><br>......<br><br>Finally,
                      if your pure, bright, clear, and unmoving state is permanent, then
                      there should be no seeing, hearing, awareness or knowing in your body.
                      If it is genuinely pure and true, it should not contain habits and
                      falseness.<br><br>How does it happen, then, that having seen some
                      unusual thing in the past, you eventually forget it over time, until
                      neither memory nor forgetfulness of it remain; but then later, upon
                      suddenly seeing that unusual thing again, you remember it clearly from
                      before without one detail omitted? How can you reckon the permeation
                      which goes on in thought after thought in this pure, clear, and
                      unmoving consciousness?<br><br>Ananda, you should know that this state
                      of clarity is not real. It is like rapidly flowing water that appears
                      to be still on the surface. Because of its rapid speed, you cannot
                      perceive the flow, but that does not mean it is not flowing. If this
                      were not the source of thinking, then how could one be subject to false
                      habits?<br><br>If you do not open and unite your six sense faculties so
                      that they function interchangeably, this false thinking will never
                      cease.<br><br>That's why your seeing, hearing, awareness, and knowing
                      are presently strung together by subtle habits, such that within the
                      profound clarity, existence and non-existence are both illusory. This
                      is the fifth kind of upside-down, minutely subtle thinking.</div>

              <p>Rob Burbea in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/07/realizing-nature-of-mind.html">Realizing the Nature of Mind</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>One
                      time the Buddha to a group of monks and he basically told them not to
                      see Awareness as The Source of all things. So this sense of there being
                      a vast awareness and everything just appears out of that and disappears
                      back into it, beautiful as that is, he told them that’s actually not a
                      skillful way of viewing reality. And that is a very interesting sutta,
                      because it’s one of the only suttas where at the end it doesn’t say the
                      monks rejoiced in his words.<br><br>This group of monks didn’t want to
                      hear that. They were quite happy with that level of insight, lovely as
                      it was, and it said the monks did not rejoice in the Buddha’s words.
                      (laughter) And similarly, one runs into this as a teacher, I have to
                      say. This level is so attractive, it has so much of the flavor of
                      something ultimate, that often times people are unbudgeable there.</blockquote>
              <p>Thanissaro Bhikkhu:</p>
              <blockquote>The
                      Buddha taught that clinging to views is one of the four forms of
                      clinging that tie the mind to the processes of suffering. He thus
                      recommended that his followers relinquish their clinging, not only to
                      views in their full-blown form as specific positions, but also in their
                      rudimentary form as the categories &amp; relationships that the mind
                      reads into experience. This is a point he makes in the following
                      discourse, which is apparently his response to a particular school of
                      Brahmanical thought that was developing in his time — the Samkhya, or
                      classification school.<br><br>This school had its beginnings in the
                      thought of Uddalaka, a ninth-century B.C. philosopher who posited a
                      "root": an abstract principle out of which all things emanated and
                      which was immanent in all things. Philosophers who carried on this line
                      of thinking offered a variety of theories, based on logic and
                      meditative experience, about the nature of the ultimate root and about
                      the hierarchy of the emanation. Many of their theories were recorded in
                      the Upanishads and eventually developed into the classical Samkhya
                      system around the time of the Buddha.<br><br>Although the present
                      discourse says nothing about the background of the monks listening to
                      it, the Commentary states that before their ordination they were
                      brahmans, and that even after their ordination they continued to
                      interpret the Buddha's teachings in light of their previous training,
                      which may well have been proto-Samkhya. If this is so, then the
                      Buddha's opening lines — "I will teach you the sequence of the root of
                      all phenomena" — would have them prepared to hear his contribution to
                      their line of thinking. And, in fact, the list of topics he covers
                      reads like a Buddhist Samkhya. Paralleling the classical Samkhya, it
                      contains 24 items, begins with the physical world (here, the four
                      physical properties), and leads back through ever more refined &amp;
                      inclusive levels of being &amp; experience, culminating with the
                      ultimate Buddhist concept: Unbinding (nibbana). In the pattern of
                      Samkhya thought, Unbinding would thus be the ultimate "root" or ground
                      of being immanent in all things and out of which they all emanate.<br><br>However,
                      instead of following this pattern of thinking, the Buddha attacks it at
                      its very root: the notion of a principle in the abstract, the "in"
                      (immanence) &amp; "out of" (emanation) superimposed on experience. Only
                      an uninstructed, run of the mill person, he says, would read experience
                      in this way. In contrast, a person in training should look for a
                      different kind of "root" — the root of suffering experienced in the
                      present — and find it in the act of delight. Developing dispassion for
                      that delight, the trainee can then comprehend the process of
                      coming-into-being for what it is, drop all participation in it, and
                      thus achieve true Awakening.<br><br>If the listeners present at this
                      discourse were indeed interested in fitting Buddhist teachings into a
                      Samkhyan mold, then it's small wonder that they were displeased — one
                      of the few places where we read of a negative reaction to the Buddha's
                      words. They had hoped to hear his contribution to their project, but
                      instead they hear their whole pattern of thinking &amp; theorizing
                      attacked as ignorant &amp; ill-informed. The Commentary tells us,
                      though, they were later able to overcome their displeasure and
                      eventually attain Awakening on listening to the discourse reported in
                      AN 3.123.<br><br>Although at present we rarely think in the same terms
                      as the Samkhya philosophers, there has long been — and still is — a
                      common tendency to create a "Buddhist" metaphysics in which the
                      experience of emptiness, the Unconditioned, the Dharma-body,
                      Buddha-nature, rigpa, etc., is said to function as the ground of being
                      from which the "All" — the entirety of our sensory &amp; mental
                      experience — is said to spring and to which we return when we meditate.
                      Some people think that these theories are the inventions of scholars
                      without any direct meditative experience, but actually they have most
                      often originated among meditators, who label (or in the words of the
                      discourse, "perceive") a particular meditative experience as the
                      ultimate goal, identify with it in a subtle way (as when we are told
                      that "we are the knowing"), and then view that level of experience as
                      the ground of being out of which all other experience comes.<br><br>Any
                      teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same
                      criticism that the Buddha directed against the monks who first heard
                      this discourse.</blockquote>

                      Bhikkhu who is a venerable from the Theravadin tradition of Buddhism,
                      his comments on "the Dharma-body, Buddha-nature, rigpa" is not in
                      accord with what is taught in the Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhist
                      traditions, since in these traditions the Dharmakaya (dharma
                      body)/Buddha Nature/Rigpa is explained as empty as well. It is however
                      a common misunderstanding even among Buddhists.<br><br>Also see: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/09/rigpa-and-aggregates.html">Rigpa and Aggregates</a><br><br>As my friend Vajrahridaya said:</p>
              <blockquote><span>Ah,
                      but this is not at all what Rigpa or Dharmakaya means. Rigpa is
                      basically the consciousness of emptiness of dependent origination, so
                      also originates dependently and is not some self supporting universal
                      awareness. But since all aspects of the so called "universe" are
                      inherently empty always, so Rigpa is always, only in as much as it is
                      recognized.</span><br><br><span>p.s. Namdrol could clear this up, as he
                      has access to untranslated Tibetan texts and could talk about what
                      Rigpa means. He has said that it is not established as well. Rigpa is
                      only inherent in the sense that all compounded things are inherently
                      empty always. Just like the Buddhas first statement. "Mind and it's
                      phenomena are luminous, uncompounded and free since beginningless
                      time." Or something to that effect in maybe not that order. If someone
                      has the quote?</span></blockquote>

              <h3>Preface</h3>
              <h4>This essay is devoted to comparing and contrasting the teaching of Interdependent
                  Transformation (<em>Pratityasamutpada</em>) with other views of ultimate
                  nature that are widespread at this time. This is done in the hope that
                  such comparing and contrasting will clarify the Dharma, the teaching of
                  the Buddha, which leads to the cessation of sorrow and full awakening to
                  the deathless and unborn.</h4>
              <h3>1. Comparing Interdependent Transformation With Other Views Of Ultimate
                  Nature</h3>
              <h4>One way of comprehending Interdependent Transformation, and of deepening
                  my awareness of this view, is to contrast Interdependent Transformation
                  with other views of ultimacy. The purpose of engaging in this kind of contrast
                  is to remove ignorance. It is primarily ignorance which keeps us in bondage.
                  It is primarily ignorance which functions as the source for the generation
                  of suffering in all its forms of greed, anger, hatred, clinging, craving
                  and delusion. There exists an intimate connection between the ideas we
                  hold, the views we have, and our interaction with the world. From this
                  perspective, examining our core understandings, is a completely practical,
                  and necessary part of our practice, for without the clarity of right view,
                  we will continue to generate suffering for ourselves and for others. As
                  Bhikkhu Bodhi puts it:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>Ignorance is the non-understanding of realities, a spiritual blindness
                  ... preventing us from seeing things as they are. Its antidote is wisdom,
                  a way of understanding things free from the distortions and perversions
                  of subjective predispositions, clearly, correctly, precisely. As the opposite
                  to ignorance, wisdom is the primary instrument in the quest for enlightenment
                  and the attainment of deliverance. In classical Buddhist iconography, it
                  is the flaming sword whose light dispels the darkness of delusion and whose
                  blade severs the fetters of the passions.</h4>
              <h4>At its highest level of development, wisdom takes the form of a transcendental
                  act of understanding which crosses the bounds of mundane experience to
                  realize <em>nirvana</em>, the supramundane reality</h4>
              <h4>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/955240052X/dharmajssutra-20"> The Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views</a>, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, 1978, pg. 2.)</h4>
              </blockquote>
              <h4>This process of contrasting the Buddha’s understanding with other views
                  is rooted in the discourses themselves, particularly the <em>Brahmajaala
                  Discourse</em>, or “The All Embracing Net Of Views”. In this discourse the
                  Buddha examines 62 speculative views as to the nature of ultimacy, finding
                  all of them wanting. The examination is very thorough. I will not repeat
                  what this wonderful discourse has to offer. Instead, inspired by this discourse,
                  I will attempt to examine what I have observed as widely held views as
                  to the nature of ultimacy current in the world today. I will then contrast
                  these views with the view of Interdependent Transformation, as I understand
                  it. In this way, the view of the Buddha will become clearer, its meaning
                  more precise, and the ability to function from that understanding will
                  increase.</h4>
              <h3>2. The Meaning Of Ultimate Nature</h3>
              <h4>The realization of Interdependent Transformation is a realization as to
                  the ultimate nature of all existing things and of existence as such. Furthermore,
                  this view of ultimate nature has liberative capacity and potential. This
                  view of ultimate nature differs from the view of ultimate nature that others
                  hold.</h4>
              <h4>What do I mean by the term “ultimate”? By ultimate nature I mean the nature
                  that all existing things have. An ultimate analysis, therefore, is an analysis
                  which reveals, or uncovers, that aspect of existing things which all existing
                  things have in common.</h4>
              <h4>Traditionally, Buddhism divides human experience into six spheres; eye,
                  ear, nose, tongue, body and mind. These six spheres have different objects
                  of experience. The eye experiences shapes and colors, the ear experiences
                  sounds, the nose experiences smells, the tongue experiences taste, the
                  body experiences touch, and the mind experiences thoughts and emotions.
                  An ultimate analysis means an analysis which reveals what all of these
                  objects of experience have in common, what all of these objects of experience
                  share. Looked at in this way, it becomes clearer why an ultimate analysis
                  presents us with serious difficulties for it is not at all obvious what
                  the smell of pine incense, the touch of sand, the shape of a leaf, the
                  sound of a melody, and a mathematical function all have in common.</h4>
              <h4>Perhaps they have nothing in common. However, all of these things exist,
                  so they at least have in common that they exist. But what, then, does it
                  mean to exist? Put in this way, an ultimate analysis responds to the question
                  of what it means to exist at all. What is the manner in which things, all
                  things, exist?</h4>
              <h4>Responding to this cluster of questions, different traditions offer different
                  understandings. For some traditions, things have in common their source.
                  For some traditions, things have in common an underlying substance, or
                  primal material or energy, and things are simply modifications or modes
                  of this underlying substance. There exist many different approaches and
                  possibilities.</h4>
              <h3>2.1 Animism</h3>
              <h4>The first contrast I wish to point to is that between the world view of
                  animism and that of Interdependent Transformation. In the animistic understanding
                  of existince everything has a hidden animating spirit or soul, which is
                  that thing’s true nature. In the animistic world existence is thick with
                  spirit presence, everything lives, rocks and rivers and clouds and mountains
                  all have a spirit dimension. All of these apparent things also have a spirit
                  aspect to them which is their true nature. The tendency is to regard this
                  spirit or soul dimension as separately existing and in some sense immortal.
                  For this reason, in answer to the question of what constitutes ultimate
                  nature, animism tends to regard the whole realm of the spirits as more
                  real than the world of appearances in which we live. The world of appearances
                  is in some way derivative and less substantial than the realm(s) in which
                  the spirits of things have their presence. The two traditions that I think
                  have carried this view to its most sophisticated level are Jainism and
                  Shinto.</h4>
              <h4>The view of Interdependent Transformation might not deny the existence
                  of spirits, but it would deny that the spirits, or souls, are more real
                  than the apparent phenomena. For example, it is common in the Buddhist
                  Discourses for deities of various kinds, from various realms, to visit
                  the Buddha and request teachings. The Buddha himself seemed to have taken
                  for granted the existence of numerous nature spirits as well as higher
                  kinds of deities.</h4>
              <h4>However, from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation, these manifestations
                  are just another manifestation of existence and the Buddha did not teach
                  that they represent a higher or more advanced form of existence. The mountain
                  and the spirit of the mountain are both dependently arising phenomena and
                  as such have equal ontological status. The mountain and the spirit of the
                  mountain are transforming and as such have equal ontological status. The
                  mountain and the spirit of the mountain function as causal bases for other
                  phenomena and in that sense have equal ontological status. In addition,
                  the spirit of the mountain does not exist independently, for as a dependently
                  arising phenomenon, by definition does not exist separately from the causal
                  matrix of existence as such. Finally, the view of Interdependent Transformation
                  would not regard the spirit presence as immortal; perhaps very long-lived,
                  but not immortal. In the unfolding causal matrix, impermanence would overcome
                  even the most exalted deity.</h4>
              <h3>2.2 Pantheism</h3>
              <h4>A widely held view of ultimate nature is often referred to as pantheism.
                  This view comprehends ultimate nature as some kind of primal substance
                  out of which all things emerge. The most common metaphor for this view
                  is waves and water. The phenomena that we perceive are the wvaes, but their
                  true nature is water, which all phenomena share. From this perspective,
                  the appearances of this world are considered to exist as modifications
                  of this primal substance. The transcendent substance unites all existing
                  things, constitutes what all existing things have in common, and is in
                  a profound sense more real than appearances because appearances seem to
                  exist in a way that things have differentiating natures whereas in reality,
                  from the perspective of pantheism, the ultimate nature of things is this
                  primal substance. The two great elucidations of this view are the <em>Upanishads</em> of Indian philosophy and Spinoza in the west.</h4>
              <h4>Interdependent Transformation, in contrast, is a non-substantial view of
                  ultimate nature. The metaphor for Interdependent Transformation most widely
                  used within the Buddhist tradition is Indra’s Net. In this metaphor the
                  places where the threads of the net cross are occupied by jewels. The facets
                  of the jewels reflect all the other jewels in the net. Now, drop the threads.
                  Now drop the jewels: or rather the jewels are nothing more than the endless
                  reflections and refractions off of all the other jewels.</h4>
              <h4>The common nature, from the point of view of Interdependent Transformation,
                  that nature which all things share, is their dependency, their reliance
                  upon conditions for their existence, not their substance. The dependent
                  nature of all existing things manifests as a quality of those things, but
                  does not imply an underlying substance or essential nature. Just as a green
                  chair and a green table share the color green without implying that they
                  have a common substance, so the qualities that emerge from Interdependent
                  Transformation, such as dependence, interdependence, process, contingency,
                  etc., mark all existing things, but do not imply a substantial presence
                  or essential nature. This, in part, is what Buddhism means when it says
                  that things are “empty”; they are empty of substance, empty of essence,
                  but they are full of the causal matrix which is their true nature.</h4>
              <h3>2.3 Emanationism</h3>
              <h4>Another understanding of ultimate nature is referred to as “emanationism”.
                  The great elucidator of this view in the west was Plotinus and through
                  his considerable influence all subsequent neo-platonism and much of early
                  Christian theology. There are also modern manifestations of this kind of
                  view, particularly among Theosophists and related groups. The basic view
                  here is that there is a constantly present source from which all things
                  emerge. Spirituality is comprehended as a task of ascending higher and
                  higher, closer and closer, to this ultimate source of all things.</h4>
              <h4>A model for the emanationist view of existence is a series of concentric
                  rings. In the center is the source (God, The One, The Light, The Nameless).
                  The closer one is to this source the more spiritual and ethereal one becomes.
                  In a monotheistic context, for example, angels are closer to the source
                  than humans, and therefore angels are more spiritual than humans. Humans
                  do have the opportunity, however, to ascend to the divine through contemplation
                  and prayer.</h4>
              <h4>The teaching of Interdependent Transformation differs from emanationism
                  because there is no specific source from which the ultimate nature, as
                  illuminated in this view, of all things arises. As Prashastrasena, an ancient
                  Indian commentator, put it, Nirvana is unlocated, or has no location. A
                  model often used for Interdependent Transformation is referred to as “Indra’s
                  Net” which depicts a network, a fabric, of interconnectedness. The point
                  here is that nirvana, or ultimate reality, has no locus/location, either
                  in time or in space. Rather, Interdependent Transformation exists spread
                  out over all of existence. One way of comprehending this is to think of
                  Interdependent Transformation as a quality, or group of qualities, which
                  qualify all existing things. Therefore, as a transcendental quality, Interdependent
                  Transformation is present in all existing things, but does not negate any
                  existing thing. As present in all existing things, it is present everywhere
                  equally, but simultaneously has no particular location from which this
                  ultimate nature springs.</h4>
              <h4>From the perspective of Interdependent Transformation the metaphor of ascent
                  into a spiritual domain is inappropriate. Instead, spirituality is comprehended
                  as awakening to, or understanding, or realizing, the primal interconnectedness
                  of all things. This interconnectedness, these qualities of interdependence,
                  of dependence, of transformation, of creativity, manifest equally everywhere,
                  or, as I like to say, everywhere in particular.</h4>
              <h3>2.4 Essentialism</h3>
              <h4>Another view of ultimate nature comprehends that things possess a specific
                  essence, which is their nature, and which distinguishes that thing, or
                  group of things, from other things. This was Aristotle’s great contribution
                  to western thought. The view of essence supports the idea that definitions
                  not only have importance for clear thinking, but they have metaphysical
                  import. To define something correctly means to uncover that thing’s essential,
                  and therefore eternal, nature.</h4>
              <h4>The view of Interdependent Transformation contrasts with essentialism.
                  While essentialism seeks to find out what distinguishes one thing, or group
                  of things, from other things, Interdependent Transformation comprehends
                  all things as having a common nature and asks what it is that all things
                  have in common. In response to that question, the view of Interdependent
                  Transformation comprehends things as having the nature of depending for
                  their existence upon other things, and for this reason they have no essence
                  because essence implies that which distinguishes, meaning separates, one
                  thing from another thing. This is what is meant, or part of what is meant,
                  when Buddhism says that things are empty of self-nature; it means that
                  they lack essence and that their true nature is not what distinguishes
                  one thing from another, but rather that which makes all things equal.</h4>
              <h3>2.5 Pythagoreanism</h3>
              <h4>Another approach to ultimate nature comprehends the eternal as consisting
                  in number. I refer to this view as Pythagoreanism, after the philosopher
                  Pythagorus, who first developed and presented this point of view. This
                  view has had a profound influence in the west; in some ways this view of
                  number as ultimate distinguishes western culture from other cultures in
                  the world.</h4>
              <h4>I don’t think it is difficult to comprehend the appeal of this point of
                  view for some people. Numbers and their relationships seem to have an eternal
              
                  validity to them. The Pythagorean Theorem seems to be always true. From
                  the point of view of Pythagoreanism, humans discover the relationships
                  between numbers and numbers exist in a realm which is more real, more actual,
                  than the realm of sensory appearances. From this perspective all things
                  can be reduced to numbers and their relationships, and in a sense, it is
                  those numbers and their relationships which allows things to exist at all.</h4>
              <h4>Though this view may seem very abstract, it has profoundly influenced western
                  thought. For example, the drive in science and technology to transform
                  observation into numerical data is rooted in this point of view. The idea
                  is that by transforming observations into numbers and their relationships,
                  we gain access to something deeper and more real than mere empirical observation.
                  Thus a formula that describes events is comprehended as providing a deeper
                  understanding of those events than a simple description of those events.</h4>
              <h4>I believe this is a source for the enduring appeal of mathematics for many
                  mathematicians. Numbers and their relationships seem to provide access
                  to the eternal; in a sense their is something luminous about numbers. In
                  a world where everything shifts and changes, it seems that numbers offer
                  access to a region of stability, of surety, and of logical coherence. This
                  is very appealing to a certain kind of person.</h4>
              <h4>The Buddhist view, based on Interdependent Transformation, differs from
                  Pythagoreanism. From the Buddhist perspective, numbers also exist dependently,
                  numbers also arise due to causes and conditions, numbers also transform
                  and are subject to change. This is not, however, obvious and requires some
                  investigation in order to comprehend how this fits in with the overall
                  view of Interdependent Transformation.</h4>
              <h4>First, numbers depend upon a particular kind of consciousness in order
                  for them to appear in the world. Dogs do not have the kind of consciousness
                  which gives rise to numbers. Angels do not seem to use numbers and I suspect
                  it is because angles do not have the kind of consciousness which views
                  existence from a number basis. Human consciousness is structured in such
                  a way that yeilds a numerical sense. If this seems like a puzzling way
                  to put it, I am not saying that numbers are subjective, I am saying they
                  are dependent upon a particular kind of consciousness, a particular structure
                  of awareness. For example, it is the particular human structure which allows
                  humans to have a three-dimensional awareness. Similarly, the human structure
                  construes things in a numerical manner.</h4>
              <h4>Alfred North Whitehead, a superb mathematician of the 20th century, pointed
                  out that numbers depend upon very specific conditions in order for them
                  to apply. He used the example of adding two drops of water to two drops
                  of water into a bowl. You don’t get four drops of water. You get one large
                  drop of water. Whitehead’s point is not that numbers lack profundity or
                  have great explantaory power. I understand Whitehead as saying that the
                  range of applicability is limited and dependent upon certain conditions.
                  The primary condition that numbers depend upon is that we perceive things
                  discretely. The perception of things as discrete, though, depends upon
                  our perceptual apparatus. For example, dogs perceive many discrete olfactory
                  objects that humans completely miss. More broadly, the perception of things
                  as discrete is, at some level, a misunderstanding. If analyzed, things
                  do not exist discretely. Rather they exist in terms of tendencies of merging
                  and inclinations for transforming.</h4>
              <h4>From the Buddhist perspective of Interdependent Transformation, numbers
                  also exist embedded in the web of existence. For this reason numbers are
                  not exempt from the ultimate nature of all existing things; that of arising
                  due to causes and condition, that of constantly transforming, etc.. Ontologically,
                  numbers have no priority.</h4>
              <h3>2.6 Platonism</h3>
              <h4>Platonism in western thought means that ideas are more real than the things
                  of this world. Furthermore, Platonism is the view that the things of this
                  world are, in some sense, bad copies, or instantiations, of ideas.</h4>
              <h4>Plato believed that truth could not change. But all the things of this
                  world change. However Plato, impressed with mathematics and an emerging
                  logic, comprehended that certain things remained eternally true and valid;
                  namely, the pure ideas which inhabit a realm which never changes and remains
                  immutable. For Plato it was the existence of this realm of unchanging ideas
                  which made truth possible, for these unchanging ideas were reflected, in
                  a distorted way, in the things of this world.</h4>
              <h4>Plato had an enormous influence on western culture. He still does. The
                  core belief that truth does not change, that mutability is a sign of a
                  lesser ontological status, remains very widespread. These core ideas were
                  transferred to Christianity through the writings of Augustine, who had
                  been a committed Platonist prior to his conversion to Christianity. Augustine
                  remained a great admirer of Plato and in a sense, Augustine’s theology
                  is a synthesis of Platonism and Bible-based views.</h4>
              <h4>Like Plato, Augustine regards mutability as a sign of a lesser ontological
                  status. For both of these philosophers, there is something repulsive about
                  change and mutability. They don’t quite put it that way, but it seems to
                  me that their writings are permeated by vague feelings of disgust with
                  the changing, and therefore, from their perspective, unreliability of things.
                  For both of them, this leads to a strongly world-negating view. The ultimate
                  does not reside in the world of changing things, it lies somewhere else,
                  in that which does not change. Plato and Augustine would disagree about
                  the nature of that which does not change, but they would agree that the
                  ultimate can not change.</h4>
              <h4>Many schools of Buddhism would agree with this fundamental view. The logic
                  of these schools of Buddhism runs something like this: All things are impermanent.
                  Impermanence causes suffering. Therefore, to reach nirvana means to abandon
                  all that is impermanent, which means everything that we perceive and interact
                  with. From this perspective, such schools of Buddhism derive a sense of
                  existence as systematically repulsive and as inherently a source of suffering.</h4>
              <h4>There is a great deal of support for this view in the Discourses. Many
                  of the Discourses speak of existence as repulsive, something to be overcome,
                  and of all existing things as impermanent and therefore unlovely and a
                  source of suffering. The logic alluded to in the above paragraph is often
                  explicitly formulated.</h4>
              <h4>Against this there is the Third Noble Truth, the truth of cessation. I
                  regard the Third Noble Truth as the great message of the Buddhadharma.
                  It is the message that has attracted countless millions of people down
                  through the centuries, from widely divergent cultures, to the Buddhadharma.
                  That it is possible to bring an end to suffering, grief, sorrow, lamentation
                  and despair is such a profound, such a positive and liberating message,
                  that immediately upon hearing this Third Noble Truth many people find themselves
                  attracted to its source.</h4>
              <h4>However, and this is the point I want to emphasize, the Third Noble Truth
                  of cessation is a process. Cessation means to change, to bring about a
                  particular kind of change. If change itself constituted suffering, then
                  the cessation of suffering would generate suffering. If impermanence itself
                  constituted suffering, then the ending and impermanence of those things
                  which cause suffering would themselves generate suffering. All of us would,
                  therefore, be ontologically trapped in the condition of despair. This is
                  existentialism, not Buddhism.</h4>
              <h4>I believe, given the nature of the Third Noble Truth as a process, that
                  it is necessary to look more deeply at those passages in the Discourses
                  which equate impermanence and/or change with suffering. By looking more
                  deeply I mean upon encountering such passages we need to ask ourselves
                  what is the logic here, why is the equation being made? In other words,
                  why do the Discourses assert that impermanence means suffering?</h4>
              <h4>I think the resolution to this is found in those Discourses that equate
                  realization/nirvana with non-clinging. The human gesture to cling to that
                  which changes, flows, and transforms, produces a sense of futility, and
                  this sense of futility gives rise to suffering, a sense of existence as
                  unsatisfactory. But this sense of existence as unsatisfactory has as its
                  basis the mind which thinks that things should remain static. It is this
                  projection onto existence of this preference for the static which gives
                  rise to clinging which gives rise to suffering.</h4>
              <h4>This leads to the conclusion that it is not impermanence and change itself
                  which causes suffering and despair, but the mind which clings to that which
                  changes. The transformation of that gesture of clinging is what leads to
                  enlightenment. One moment of non-clinging is a moment of nirvana, a moment
                  of realization.</h4>
              <h4>From this perspective, existence is not repulsive; existence only seems
                  repulsive when we attempt to make existence conform to our desire that
                  something not change. That simply is not going to happen. In other words,
                  it is not mutability, change, and process which need to be abandoned; rather
                  it is the desire for the static, the non-changing, which needs to be abandoned.
                  When those are abandoned, then the ultimately real emerges as change and
                  transformation itself. That is how the Discourses can say that “nirvana
                  is samsara.”</h4>
              <h4>I will have more to say regarding this topic in the Discussion on the marks
                  of existence. But to return to Platonism, the view of Interdependent Transformation
                  comprehends ideas as just another aspect of existence and does not privilege
                  ideas over other domains. This is why in Buddhist psychology there are
                  six senses: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The mind sense means
                  that sense which perceives thoughts and feelings, just as the eye sense
                  perceives colors and shapes. From the perspective of Interdependent Transformation,
                  visual objects arise due to causes and conditions, and mental objects such
                  as thoughts and feelings also arise due to causes and conditions. In addition,
                  thoughts arise due to non-thought causes, just as sounds may arise due
                  to non-sonic events. From this perspective thoughts completely participate
                  in the world in a network of interdependent relationships; thoughts and
                  ideas have no privileged or independent existence. Thoughts are simply
                  another realm, and thoughts arise, change, and transform, just like all
                  the other things of the world.</h4>
              <h3>2.7 Theism</h3>
              <h4>The view of theism is the view that there exists a deity, or deities, that
                  are more real than the world in which we dwell. Typically, the deities
                  and the realm in which they dwell are considered in some sense immortal,
                  and therefore desirable. The purpose of religious practice in such a context
                  is to somehow gain access to this realm of the gods.</h4>
              <h4>I have already discussed this view in my comments on Animism and in the
                  section on “The Twilight of the Gods” from the essay <a href="http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/dharmajim/udumbara.html">Udumbara</a>.
                  The difference in the view of theism to that of Animism and Pantheism is
                  that Theism regards the realm of the God(s) as in some manner separate
                  from the realm in which we dwell. Animism tends to regard each existing
                  thing as having a soul, and so the spiritual realm is deeply intertwined
                  with the physical realm. Pantheism regards all existing things as modifications
                  of a primal nature. Theism comprehends the God(s) and their realm(s) as
                  existing apart from the world in which we humans live. Heaven is somewhere
                  else.</h4>
              <h4>Though this is a somewhat subtle distinction, the same analysis that applied
                  to Animism also applies here. Namely, that the view of Interdependent Transformation
                  regards the Gods themselves as dependent upon causes and conditions for
                  their existence. The Gods do not exist separately, unchangingly, or in
                  a manner that basically differs from that of any other existing thing.
                  For this reason the Buddha would state that liberation is not a matter
                  of gaining access to another dimension. Liberation is a matter of awakening
                  to, or realizing, the nature of all existing things.</h4>
              <h3>2.8 Monotheism</h3>
              <h4>This is the big one, the view that concerns most westerners. There is a
                  long and venerable history of discussion between the monotheistic tradition
                  and Buddhism. This dialogue between the two traditions often centers on
                  whether or not at core these two traditions have a common understanding.
                  The need for this dialogue appears because at a certain obvious level Buddhism
                  simply does not have a supreme being, what the monotheistic tradition generally
                  means by God.</h4>
              <h4>I distinguish two components of ultimacy that are unique to the monotheistic
                  tradition. Given that the monotheistic tradition believes in the existence
                  of only one God, the monotheistic tradition conceives of God as the ultimate;
                  furthermore God in this tradition is the creator of all existence and also
                  bears moral responsibility for the activities which occur in this existence.</h4>
              <h4>Both of these components are absent from the Buddhist tradition. The Buddhist
                  tradition lacks a being who has created existence. Instead, from the perspective
                  of Interdependent Transformation, Buddhism conceives of existence as always
                  existing, without beginning and without end. Furthermore, from the perspective
                  of Interdependent Transformation, there is no specific locus of creation,
                  no specific being is responsible for bringing existence into existence.
                  Rather, creativity is an aspect of all existing things and therefore the
                  source of existence is the things of existence, spread out over all of
                  existence, throughout all space, throughout all time.</h4>
              <h4>John Reynolds, among western scholars I am familiar with, has written with
                  clarity on this issue:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>As for the existence of God, of the Creator of heaven and earth, this is
                  the concept central to religion as we know it in the West. Was the Buddha
                  an atheist or an agnostic in relation to the existence of a Supreme Being
                  or God? ...</h4>
              <h4>In the Suutras there is found a Buddhist account of Genesis. [This account
                  appears in several sources both in the Mahayana and the Theravada Canons.]
                  In reply to questions from His disciples, the Buddha explained that the
                  humanity found on this planet earth once inhabited another planetary system.
                  Ages ago when the sun of that world went nova and the planet was destroyed
                  in the ensuing solar eruptions, the bulk of its inhabitants, as the result
                  of their arduously practicing the Dharma for ten thousand years, were reborn
                  on one of the higher planes of the Form World or <em>Ruupedhaatu</em>, a
                  plane of existence known as <em>Aabhaasvara</em> or “clear light.” Here they
                  enjoyed inconceivable bliss and felicity for countless aeons. Then, when
                  their great store of past karma came onto maturity, our own solar system
                  and planet earth began to evolve and some among their numbers were reborn
                  on the lower planes of the <em>Ruupadhaatu</em> in the vicinity of the nascent
                  earth. This plane of existence where they found themselves reborn is known
                  as <em>Brahmaaloka</em>. The first of these beings to reawaken and be reborn,
                  upon seeing the solar system evolving below him, exclaimed in his delight,
                  “I am the Creator!” In this way, he came to believe that he was the actual
                  creator of the universe which he saw about him, for he did not remember
                  from whence he came and was born without any parents. But in actuality
                  the manifestation of this universe was due to the collective karma of all
                  in that company and his own individual manifestation, which was a case
                  of apparitional birth, was due to his own great stock of meritorious karma
                  coming into maturation at that time because the requisite secondary conditions
                  were present.</h4>

              <h4>The principle here, derived from the core insight of Interdependent Transformation,
                  is that all things appear from a causal base. This understanding is extended
                  to the existence of entire universes or world systems. The Dalai Lama makes
                  this same point in his commentary on Shantideva’s <em>Guide to the Bodhisattva’s
                  Way of Life</em>, the Ninth Chapter on Wisdom. Verse 124 speaks directly
                  to this discussion:</h4>

                  to <em>Yahweh</em>.] If the complete conditions were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create; and if they were absent, there would

                  were assembled, <em>Ishvara</em> would be powerless not to create the resultant
                  phenomena; and if they were not assembled, those phenomena would not be

                  he has created this world system because, due to his karma, he was the
                  first conscious being in this world system. Unaware of his past karma which
                  created the conditions for his rebirth in this world system, and not observing
                  any other conscious beings in this world system, God then concludes that
                  he is the creator of this world system. Unaware that there are other world
                  systems, incalculably numerous, God/Ishvara concludes that he is the creator
                  of all of existence.</h4>
              <h4>It takes some time to take in all the implications of such a world view.
                  It is breathtaking in scope and rich in implications. One of the implications
                  is that being reborn as God is not, from a Buddhist perspective, a fortunate
                  rebirth. It is not a rebirth that will lead to liberation, to <em>nirvana</em>,
                  and the cessation of all sorrow because such a rebirth re-enforces the
                  idea that there is something that exists independently, and it is this
                  very idea/belief/feeling that is the source of sorrow.</h4>
              <h4>It might seem that this is the end of the story; Buddhism doesn’t believe
                  in a creator Deity that bears moral responsibility for existence while
                  the monotheistic tradition has this view at its core. The two traditions,
                  therefore, diverge.</h4>
              <h4>However, God has many names and many meanings and Interdependent Transformation
                  has many facets. Though the view of Interdependent Transformation does
                  lead to a view of existence that in some respects differs from that of
                  the monotheistic tradition, we should not stop at this conclusion. I have
                  previously mentioned in the discussion on the basic implications of Intedependent
                  Transformation that this core view of the Buddha means that all things
                  exist dependently. Because the monotheistic tradition regards God as the
                  creator of all existing things and of existence itself, the monotheistic
                  tradition views all things as existing dependently, as in a totally dependent
                  state. From this perspective, the perspective of dependence, the Buddhist
                  and Monotheistic tradition share a common insight into the transcendent
                  nature of all existing things.</h4>
              <h4>Or take the view that God is love. It is out of God’s love that existence
                  emerges. Existence is an expression of the generosity and benign nature
                  of God. In the Buddhist tradition it is the realization that all things
                  exist interdependently that gives rise to the blossoming of the compassionate
                  heart. Love and Compassion are always present, but they are covered over
                  by ignorance, self-concern, and distraction. I think that these two insights
                  are very close for they both proclaim that in some sense love and compassion
                  are the true nature of existence, that love and compassion blossom when
                  we comprehend the transcendental.</h4>
              <h4>What I am suggesting is that even if I put aside the idea of a Creator
                  Being, even if I put aside the idea of a Being who bears moral responsibility
                  for existence, there are still significant, broad areas for dialogue between
                  the two traditions because there is more to the idea of God than the idea
                  of a Creator. From a Buddhist perspective, the most important aspects might
                  lie outside of the Creator view.</h4>
              <h4>How do we access this broader understanding that lies at the core of the
                  monotheistic tradition? I would suggest using those traditions centered
                  on positive theology. Positive theology is that theology which explores
                  the Divine Names and Attributes of God. For example, Dionysius the Areopagite
                  wrote a theological work called <em>The Divine Names</em>. I think it would
                  be an excellent place to start making such a comparison. For example, Dionysius
                  writes:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>... Since it is the underpinning of goodness, and by merely being there
                  is the cause of everything, to praise this divinely beneficent Providence
                  you must turn to all of creation. It is there at the center of everything
                  and everything has it for a destiny. It is therefore ‘before all things
                  and in it all things hold together.’ Because it is there the world has
                  come to be and exists. All things long for it. The intelligent and rational
                  long for it by the way of knowledge ...</h4>
              <h4>Realizing all this, the theologians praise it by every name ... they give
                  it many names, such as “I am being,” “life,” “God,” the “truth.” These
                  same wise writers, when praising the Cause of everything that is, use names
                  drawn from all the things caused: good, beautiful, wise, beloved, God of
                  gods, Lord of Lord, Holy of Holies, eternal, existent, Cause of the ages.
                  They call him source of life, wisdom, mind, word, knower, possessor beforehand
                  of all the treasures of knowledge, power, powerful, and king of Kings,
                  ancient of days, the unaging and unchanging, salvation, righteousness and
                  sanctification, redemption, greatest of all and yet the one in the still
                  breeze. They say he is in our minds, in our soul, and in our bodies, in
                  heaven and on earth, that while remaining ever within himself he is also
                  in and around and above the world, that he is above heaven and above all
                  being, that he is sun, star, and fire, water, wind, and dew, cloud, archetypal
                  stone, and rock, that he is all, that he is no thing.</h4>

              <h4>Now, turn to the Buddhist tradition and uncover the names that the Buddha
              in the Discourses uses for <em>nirvana</em>. He uses such terms as the “cessation
              of suffering”, “the non-clinging”, “peace”, “serenity”, “the lovely”, “the
              unconditioned”, “love”, “the unborn”, “the deathless”, etc.. Just as the
              core view of the monotheistic tradition is multi-faceted, so also the ultimate
              goal and core notion of the Buddhist tradition has many facets and many
              names. Once I move away from a fixation on the idea of God as a creator
              of existence, I am actually able to find a lot of similarity between these
              core views, many overlaps. It is useful to compare these two because how
              they arrive at these core understandings, such as dependence, differs,
              but often the core understandings themselves are amazingly similar. Thus,
              both traditions are mutually enriched by broadening their understanding.</h4>
              <h4>This is not the place to go into a systematic treatment of these two core
              views. It would require a book in and of itself. I believe what would be
              required is to compare and contrast the facets of ultimacy that each tradition
              has lived with down through the centuries. In addition to comparing and
              contrasting, I would also suggest comprehending how each tradition arrives
              at this understanding.</h4>
              <h4>I believe the result of such a project would produce a mosaic of overlapping
              and divergent understandings. From the perspective of a particular facet
              X, the two traditions have a shared view. From the perspective of facet
              Y, the two traditions diverge. From the persective of how they arrive at
              the same view X, there will also appear similarities and contrasts. When
              engaging in this project it is also important to keep in mind that monotheism
              is not a uniform tradition; it is actually more accurate to say “monotheisms”,
              and the same applies to Buddhism. The personalism of Christianity, for
              example, is something not shared by Judaism or Islam. Similarly, the view
              of the ontological status of suffering is quite different in different
              Buddhist traditions. Though this complicates the task, I do not consider
              it an insurmountable obstacle as long as one maintains a broad focus.</h4>
              <h4>This may seem like a lot of work, but I believe the results of such a project
              would be an ability to speak clearly to each other, from the views that
              each tradition holds, and come to a genuine and deep mutual understanding
              and appreciation. A good way to start such a project would be to compare
              two specific core texts, such as <em>The Divine Names</em> with something
              like the <em>Udana</em> in the Buddhist tradition. This may seem to narrow
              the focus from the broad focus I just suggested. However, the virtue of
              taking two specific works and comparing them is that it grounds the investigation
              in a specific work and tradition so that it reduces mere speculation.</h4>
              <h4>The dialogue between monotheism and Buddhism has been going on for a long
              time. I believe such an exchange can prove fruitful for both traditions.
              I would hope that such an exchange of views could be expanded to include
              other traditions as well, such as the western philosophical tradition,
              the secular humanist tradition, and the many spiritual traditions in the
              world today. With a good heart, mutual respect, and the capacity to perceive
              all people as equal, such an endeavor will help all concerned.</h4>
              <h3>2.9 The Ontological Grid</h3>
              <h4>One way that I have found helpful in clarifying the differences between
              understandings of ultimacy is an approach I refer to as the ontological
              grid. I derive it from the writings of John the Scot Eriugena, a philosopher/theologian
              who lived in the 800’s. His central work is called <em>Periphyseon, On The
              Division Of Nature</em>. This work, in dialog form, opens with a basic categorical
              scheme:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>The division of nature seems to me to admit of four species through four
              differentiae. The first is the division into what creates and is not created;
              the second into what is created and creates; the third, into what is created
              and does not create; the four, into what neither creates nor is created.
              Of these four, two pairs consist of opposites. The third is the opposite
              of the first, the fourth of the second. But the fourth is among the things
              which are impossible, and its differentia is its inability to be.</h4>
              <h4>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672603772/dharmajssutra-20">Periphyseon, On The Division Of Nature</a>, by John the Scot Eriugena, translated by Myra L. Uhlfelder, Bobbs-Merrill, Indianapolis, 1976, page 2.)</h4>

              <h4>According to the traditional interpretation of monotheism, only one thing
              falls into Category 1, namely God. God creates all existing things, and
              existence itself, but God is not created. Continuing with the traditional
              interpretation, Category 2 consists of things such as humans and other
              conscious entities such as angels and animals. Humans are created, by God,
              and they create other things. Category 3, according to the traditional
              interpretation, designates the material world, consisting of things like
              rocks and sand and wind and waves. These things are created but do not
              create anything else, at least in an intentional and conscious way. Category
              4 consists of nothingness, and according to the traditional interpretation
              nothingness can not exist and is therefore of no concern. John the Scot
              considers Category 4 a logical impossibility (which, incidentally, the
              Madhyamika’s of Buddhism would completely agree with).</h4>
              <h4>From the Buddhist perspective of Interdependent Transformation, only Category
              2 exists. All things exist in such a manner that they are both created
              and create, or to put it more accurately, creating. And all things are
              doing this simultaneously.</h4>
              <h4>But what about those passages in the Buddhist Discourses which speak of
              the unconditioned? Isn’t the unconditioned, a name for nirvana, the same
              as Category 1? It would seem to be the case that the unconditioned means
              the uncreated.</h4>
              <h4>I will have more to say about this in an essay on nirvana, but for now
              I want to offer the following consideration; that it is precisely the nature
              of things as Interdependent Transformation which is in itself the unconditioned.
              In this sense the conditioned as such is the unconditioned. It is not the
              case that specific things are the unconditioned, but the quality of being
              conditioned, which marks all existing things, is the unconditioned. The
              conditioned is the unconditioned because the conditioned has no beginning.
              The conditioned is the unconditioned because it has no ending. The conditioned
              is the unconditioned because it is unborn and deathless. The conditioned
              is the unconditioned because it exists everywhere, everywhen and as a quality
              qualifying all existing things. Conditionality is never not present and
              is therefore unconditioned. It is for this reason that Buddhism can say
              that <em>nirvana</em> is <em>samsara</em> and <em>samsara</em> is <em>nirvana</em>.</h4>
              <h4>So from another perspective, one could say that the Buddhdharma, from the
              perspective of nirvana and realization, merges Categories 1 and 2 into
              a unity and it is the realization that both Category 1 and Category 2 exist
              simultaneously in all existing things that constitutes awakening.</h4>
              <h4>To continue with the ontological grid: I have found it helpful to place
              the various spiritual traditions on the grid. This tool helps me to comprehend
              where various views are similar and where they diverge. For example, my
              understanding of Brahmanism and Pantheism is that they consider only Category
              1 as real. Whereas John the Scot views only Category 4 as unreal, Brahmanism
              and Pantheism consider Categories 2, 3, and 4 as illusory; for them only
              Category 1 has any genuine ontological status.</h4>
              <h4>This ontological grid scheme doesn’t work in all cases. But even in those
              cases where it doesn’t work in a neat way, I find that it helps me to clarify
              for myself the view under consideration. Perhaps the reader will also find
              it useful.</h4>
              <h3>2.10 Apophaticism and Mysticism</h3>
              <h4>By apophaticism I mean that doctrine which views ultimacy as completely
              non-conceptual. The apophatic view is that concepts and ultimacy dwell
              in two different dimensions and that therefore in order to access ultimacy
              I must completely negate all conceptuality. When conceptuality is completely
              negated, ultimacy can be accessed.</h4>
              <h4>Prominent elucidators of this view are Dionysius the Areopagite, Lao Tzu,
              and Chuang Tzu. Apophaticism usually leads to various forms of mysticism,
              the belief that ultimacy can be accessed only through a direct experience
              lacking in conceptual content. In some traditions this experience can only
              happen through grace; this is prominent in, for example, Christian mysticism,
              though it is possible to prepare for the moment of grace through various
              disciplines. In other traditions conceptuality is systematically set aside
              through various meditative practices in order to enter into the experience
              of the ultimate.</h4>
              <h4>Against this view are those who regard conceptual activity as not only
              not a hindrance to comprehending ultimacy, but also a necessary component
              for experiencing ultimacy. Prominent elucidators of this view are Spinoza
              and the great Sages of the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism such as Tsong
              Khapa, and many others. This view comprehends the primary obstacle to ultimacy
              as ignorance. The purpose, then, of conceptual activity, in a spiritual
              context, is to overcome ignorance through applying my capacities for reason
              and analysis. When so applied in a rigorous manner, the actual nature of
              existence, the ultimate nature of existence, appears and ignorance vanishes.
              From this perspective conceptual activity is a gate to realization and
              enlightenment.</h4>
              <h4>From the perspective of interdependent transformation I do not think it
              is possible to reject conceptual activity as an efficacious means for experiencing
              ultimacy. My primary reason for saying this is that interdependent transformation
              is a view that all things have, or are marked by, a dependent and interdependent
              nature. Words are things in existence. From the perspective of interdependent
              transformation, words do not differ from rocks and clouds and cars and
              birds. From the perspective of interdependent transformation, all existing
              things, including words have this dependent and interedependent nature.
              Because words have this nature, it is possible to access ultimacy through
              words and conceptuality.</h4>
              <h4>The words of the Dharma are particularly well suited for accessing ultimacy,
              the realm of Interdependent Transformation. They are particularly well
              suited because they are self-referentially consistent. By self-referentially
              consistent I mean that when the Dharma speaks of ultimate nature, the words
              themselves exemplify, exhibit, instantiate the meaning to which they refer.
              For example, if I say that all things appear in this world dependent upon
              causes and conditions, those very words, “dependent upon causes and conditions”
              appear in this world due to, dependent upon, causes and conditions. The
              words themselves thoroughly exhibit this ultimate nature and I do not need
              to go anywhere else in order to access and experience this ultimate nature.</h4>
              <h4>This leads to what I refer to as “the <em>kensho</em> of reading”. It is
              that experience I have when reading the Discourses, and everything in existence,
              not just the reading, not just the words, not just the concepts, but everything
              in existence falls into place, everything is in balance, perfect and complete.
              Because all things possess, rely on, and dwell in this ultimate nature,
              it is possible to access ultimacy through any and every thing which exists;
              provided that our attention is tuned and focussed on that ultimate nature.
              Ultimate nature is not, therefore, confined to words and concepts, but
              ultimate nature does not in any respect shy away from words and concepts.
              Ultimate nature, from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation,
              is not non-conceptual, but also ultimate nature is not conceptually specific
              or limited only to the conceptual realm. However, having said this, it
              is nevertheless the case, that the Dharma simultaneously speaks of ultimate
              nature, points to ultimate nature, and displays ultimate nature. The simultaneous
              speaking and displaying makes Dharma Discourse, the study, reading, and
              contemplating of Dharma Discourse, the smoothest path to realization.</h4>
              <h4>Apophaticism rests on the idea that ultimate nature is somewhere else,
              than the realm in which we live. Utterly removed from, and different from,
              the realm of experience, ultimacy can then only be accessed through a step
              by step process which disengages me from this realm in which I dwell. In
              other words, apophaticism and mysticism are dualistic, creating a division
              in existence, minimally between the conceptual and ultimacy, and in extreme
              cases between ultimacy and everything which I experience.</h4>
              <h4>My understanding of the Dharma does not regard the realm in which I dwell
              as removed from the ultimate nature of Interdependent Transformation. Ultimacy
              does not exist somewhere else. It is not a matter of contacting some other
              domain in order to access ultimacy. Rather it is a matter of shifting our
              attention so that I can perceive and comprehend the actuality of things.
              From this perspective, my understanding of existence is misconstrued and
              my perception of things is askew. The purpose of Dharma study and practice
              is to correct these misunderstandings, both conceptually and perceptually,
              to overcome ignorance and the habits that give rise to this ignorance.
              When that is done, the ultimate nature of all existing things and existence
              itself, stands forth as the Interdependent Transformation nature which
              permeates all of existence, unlocated, ever present, never far.</h4>
              <h4>I realize that this way of comprehending the Dharma sets me at odds with
              those traditions which regard the ultimate nature of existence, Buddha
              Nature, Nirvana, as something which can not be accessed through study and
              thinking. I can only say that at one time I agreed with this view, but
              that my undersanding has now moved to a view which encompasses thought,
              conceptuality, study, and thinking within the domain of ultimacy without
              ejecting anything else from that domain. To set thought aside, from the
              perspective of Interdependent Transformation, makes no more sense than
              asking someone to set aside hearing, or to set aside seeing. Just as all
              visual phenomena have the nature of Interdependent Transformation, just
              as all sonic phenomena have the nature of Interdependent Transformation,
              so also all thoughts, all concepts, also have the nature of Interdependent
              Transformation. For this reason rejecting thoughts and concepts means limiting
              the extent of the play of ultimate nature. But Buddha Nautre as Interdependent
              Transformation marks all existing things. Marking all existing things,
              this nature marks all thoughts. Marking all thoughts and concepts, thoughts
              and concepts, when comprehended in their totality, and as Interdependent
              Transformations, graciously display the true nature of all existing things.
              Words also have a luminously clear nature. Thoughts also sparkle with elemental
              transformative energy. Concepts also shimmer with the ever flowing and
              present energy of all things. Rejecting nothing, the words of the Dharma
              compassionately guide me to ultimate realization.</h4>
              <h3>2.11 Materialism</h3>
              <h4>Materialism is the view that existence consists solely of matter. Anciently,
              this meant that the ultimate constituents of existence consisted of irreducible
              atoms, the word “atom” means something like unbreakable, or basic. This
              view has fallen on difficult times and one would be hard put to find someone
              among scientists and philosophers who holds this view in its pure and naive
              form today. Nevertheless, there are implications of the materialistic view
              which are held fairly widely. For example, the idea that everything that
              truly exists must be quantifiable often has a materialistic basis. Also,
              the idea that “you only live once, make the best of it,” arises out of
              materialistic assumptions. Finally, the idea that the meaning of life lies
              primarily, or even entirely, in the acquisition of material goods and possessions
              is an expression of a materialistic world view.</h4>
              <h4>In constrast to the materialistic view, the Buddha taught the primacy of
              relationship and process. By primacy of relationship and process I mean
              that from the perspective of Interdependent Transformation the term “things”
              designates, first, relationships, and second, becomings and begonings,
              appearings and disappearings, that all things are coming-togethers and
              passing-aways. In a sense, the Buddha considered matter illusory, a result
              of the grossness of our senses and the inability to generally infer universal
              truths such as impermanence and change. This inability to infer impermanence,
              change, and transformation to all things arises because our experience
              of things does not immediately display to us their transient and process
              nature. Some things do; such as melodies, storms, and shifting sand. But
              many things do not display this nature, though if we think about it, contemplate
              it, we can infer these qualities to all things. This is one of the primary
              reasons why spiritual practice is necessary: We need to remind ourselves
              of the central truths of impermanence, change and transformation. When
              we remind ourselves of these truths, we take a step in overcoming the materialistic
              world view, which in many ways is so prominent in our culture at this time.
              Step by step, little by little, our understanding grows, deepens, and the
              rivering realm of reality opens to our understanding and our perception.</h4>
              <h3>2.12 Nihilism</h3>
              <h4>In traditional Buddhist sources, such as the Discourses, nihilism means
              one of two things: 1) that our actions have no moral consequences, and
              2) that nothing actually exists. Modern nihilism fairly well maps onto
              this usage and generally expresses itself as the view that life is meaningless.</h4>
              <h4>The view that nothing really exists is, however, not widely held in an
              explicit sense in materialistic culture such as ours. However, there is
              a sense in which materialism is also a form of nihilism even at this basic
              level. In scientific materialism it is often viewed that the real constituents
              of nature are atomic and/or sub-atomic realities. Some forms of scientific
              materialism, under the influence of pythagoreanism, assert that the mathematical
              expressions of scientific laws are the actual constituents of existence.
              This leads to a view of existence that more or less dismisses appearances
              as less real than what the particular view comprehends as the actual constituents
              of existence. Although this usually does not dismiss altogether the reality
              of appearing forms, the really real lies somewhere other than the realm
              in which human beings normally live and interact. This removes meaning
              from our daily lives, and from this perspective I consider it a form of
              nihilism.</h4>
              <h4>Within a religious context nihilism means that view which holds that existence
              is fundamentally unreal. This is an extreme view, but one that has some
              currency within some traditions. The Buddha would have encountered that
              view in his wanderings when he encountered other teachers. It is the view
              that all appearances are an illusion and that nothing except God/Brahman/Being
              exists. The Buddha considered this view a form of nihilism because it undermined
              the efficacy of ethical activity. If all appearances are ultimately illusory,
              then activities do not have any real or genuine consequences. If activities
              do not have any real or genuine consequences, then the attempt to cultivate
              awareness, compassion, and wisdom through spiritual practice and discipline
              is ultimately futile.</h4>
              <h4>It is in the arena of moral consequences, or <em>karma</em>, that the Buddha
              most strongly diverges from the nihilistic view. The Buddha advocated an
              ethically based life as foundational for all forms of spiritual practice,
              including meditation and study. This is because he regarded ethical activity
              as consequential in nature.</h4>
              <h4>This view of ethical activity as having consequences arises from the Buddha’s
              primal realization of Interdependent Transformation. All activities are
              also things, within the context of Interdependent Transformation. Just
              as a brick thrown against a window produces consequences, so also the activity
              of my life has consequences, both for myself and for other people. The
              realm of these consequences is the realm of ethics. From the perspective
              of Interdependent Transformation, it is no more puzzling to say that my
              actions have ethical consequences than it is to say that material objects
              as they move through the world produce consequences. Just as the nature
              of material consequences may be difficult to comprehend, the nature of
              ethical consequences in the world may be difficult to comprehend, but that
              does not mean that they do not exist.</h4>
              <h4>Because the Buddha considered ethical consequences, or <em>karma</em>, as
              a subset of the overall causal matrix of Interdependent Transformation,
              the Buddha did not draw on an outside agency to impose ethical rules on
              a recalcitrant humanity. Rather, when the Buddha speaks about ethical consequences,
              he points out that certain activities produce certain results, that my
              interaction with others engenders certain results, just as planting a seed
              will produce a certain kind of plant depending upon the seed.</h4>
              <h4>I think that we can all comprehend what the Buddha meant on an ordinary
              level, though most of the time I fail to follow through on the implications
              of such experiences and observations. For example, I have known cynics
              who view all human motivation with suspicion. Sure enough, such people
              soon loose the friendship of people who are sincere and not duplicitous.
              The consequences of cynical activity in the world are to engender interactions
              which themselves are consistent with that world view. Or take someone who
              is chronically angry. Soon such a person becomes isolated, and often sinks
              into a kind of despair as a consequence of their chronic anger. There are
              many such examples that come to mind.</h4>
              <h4>Because of the Buddha’s insight into Interdependent Transformation the
              Buddha was able to generalize from these observations and develop a theory
              of karma which consistently uncovers the efficacy of ethical causality.
              Furthermore, the Buddha would apply these insights to spiritual disciples,
              pointing out their karmic consequences, both in this life and in future
              lives. Once again, this is the reason for the ethical basis in the precepts
              for all Buddhist practice. But beyond this basis, spiritual practice itself,
              such as meditation and study, have ethical implications. This is why in
              the Zen tradition they say that the practice of meditation is itself an
              expression of the ethical precepts of the Buddhadharma. The same understanding
              applies to other forms of Buddhist practice. They are all embedded in the
              context of Interdependent Transformation and applied to human interaction
              as ethically expressed.</h4>
              <h4>Nihilism, in terms of the idea that nothing actually exists, is overcome
              by Interdependent Transformation through understanding that though things
              do not exist separately, or in isolation, that does not imply that things
              do not exist at all. The idea that things do not exist is an extreme view
              and one that is explicitly rejected by the Buddha. The tendency that first
              appears when considering the Buddha’s view is to fall into nihilism. This
              is because the Buddha rejects the view of substantiality, which in a Buddhist
              context means the existence of things as separately existing essential
              natures. Because we have a strong psychological investment in the idea
              of separately existing things, and particularly in the idea of a separately
              existing self, we tend to interpret what the Buddha says as meaning that
              things do not exist at all. That is, however, a misunderstanding. The Buddha
              does not say that things do not exist. Rather, the Buddha says that things
              exist dependently and interdependently. Or to put it another way, to exist
              means to exist as a dependent and interdependent existant. Furthermore,
              from the perspective of the Buddha, no other mode of existing exists.</h4>
              <h4>The key to this understanding is that Interdependent Transformation rejects
              both substantiality and non-existence. Interdependent Transformation is
              an understanding and realization of the manner in which all things exist.
              From this perspective, Interdependent Transformation affirms existence,
              overcomes nihilism (both ethically and ontologically), and clarifies the
              ultimate nature of all existing things.</h4>
              <h3>2.13 Being</h3>
              <h4>The view that being constitutes the ultimate nature of all existing things
              is a very powerful and widely held view, which has been touched upon in
              several of the categories above already. Briefly, the view of being states
              that there exists an unchanging nature which all things have by virtue
              of the fact that they exist. Furthermore, being is that aspect of existence
              which is self-sufficient, not dependent, existing independently. This view
              is elaborted with great elegance by such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle,
              Aquinas, and many others. It is a view which asserts the supremacy of Category
              1 on the ontological grid.</h4>
              <h4>Against this view, the Buddha asserts that to exist means to exist dependently/interdependently
              and that there is no such thing as an independently existing, self sufficient
              entity or nature. This has been covered above. What I want to mention here,
              is that there is a great deal of confusion among Buddhist scholars regarding
              the use of the term being. I think it is necessary to understand that the
              term being has two meanings. The first meaning is something like, “the
              core nature of existence”, meaning that nature which designates what it
              means to exist. The second meaning is “an unchanging separately existing
              and self-sufficient nature.” It is the second meaning which is problematic.</h4>
              <h4>The western philosophical and theological traditions have consistently
              used the second meaning as the criteria for the term “being.” However,
              there exist other views as to the core nature of existence, such as the
              view of Interdependent Transformation. It often happens that translators
              of Buddhism into western language use the term “being” to designate the
              core nature of the Buddhist view. I regard this as a deeply misleading
              mistake. It arises from a failure to distinguish the two meanings of the
              term being. This makes sense if one has adopted the view of being as ultimate.
              Western culture has, by and large, done exactly that. So there is a cultural
              habit of mind, that whenever we run across a theory of ultimate nature,
              that we then designate that theory by the term being. However, this distorts
              the presentation of that theory by implying that the theory designates
              something that exists in an unchanging and separately existing manner,
              when that might not be the case.</h4>
              <h4>The solution is to use the term being to designate what philosphers and
              theologians have designated by that term for many centuries. And then to
              use alternate terms to designate what a non-being based view of ultimacy
              comprehends as ultimate nature. One term I suggest for consideration is
              the term “ultimacy”. When I use that term I mean that which all things
              have in common, what it means to exist as such. From a being-based view,
              to exist ultimately means to exist in an unchanging and separately existing
              manner. From the perspective of Interdependent Transformation, to exist
              ultimately means to exist dependently and interdependently. For this reason,
              I think of Interdependent Transformation as the transcending of essence
              and the abandoning of being, into the modality of interdependence as ultimate
              reality.</h4>

              <h3>2.14 Personalism</h3>
              <h4>The view of personalism in a narrow sense is the idea that ultimate nature
              resides in a particular person. The greatest tradition that rests on this
              view is Christianity. Christianity regards ultimate nature as embodied
              in the person of Jesus. This is what distinguishes Christianity from Judaism
              and Islam (in a way, the rise of Islam can be understood as a revolt against
              the personalistic aspects of Christianity).</h4>
              <h4>Interestingly, personalism as a view combines with many other ontological
              stances. Thus one can have a monotheistic personalism and a monotheistic
              impersonalism. Hinduism also has this kind of division with an impersonal
              form in Advaita Vedanta and a personal form in the traditions which regard
              Krishna as the ultimate nature of existence. One can have a polytheistic
              impersonalism, as in Plotinus and Proclus, and one can have a polytheistic
              personalism as in Celsus. In the Buddhist tradition, the Pure Land School
              comes close to a personalist form in its central focus on the Buddha Amitabha.</h4>
              <h4>The personalism/impersonalism axis of understanding ultimate nature, in
              other words, appears to transcend specific cultures and traditions and,
              I think, tells us something central about the human psyche and how humanity
              accesses the transcendent. Karen Armstrong writes:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>Judaism, Christianity and -- to a lesser extent -- Islam have all developed
              the idea of a personal God, so we tend to think that this ideal represents
              religion at its best. The personal God has helped monotheists to value
              the sacred and inalienable rights of the individual and to cultivate an
              appreciation of human personality. The Judeo-Christian tradition has thus
              helped the West to acquire the liberal humanism it values so highly. These
              values were originally enshrined in a personal God who does everything
              that a human being does: he loves, judges, punishes, sees, hears, creates
              and destroys as we do. <em>Yahweh</em> began as a highly personalized deity
              with passionate human likes and dislikes. Later he became a symbol of transcendence,
              whose thoughts were not our thoughts and whose ways soared above our own
              as the heavens tower above the earth. The personal God reflects an important
              religious insight: that no supreme value can be less than human. Thus personalism
              has been an important and -- for many -- an indispensable stage of religious
              and moral development. The prophets of Israel attributed their own emotions
              and passions to God; Buddhists and Hindus had to include a personal devotion
              to avatars of the supreme reality. Christianity made a human person the
              center of the religious life in a way that was unique in the history of
              religion: it took the personalism inherent in Judaism to an extreme. It
              may be that without some degree of this kind of identification and empathy,
              religion cannot take root.</h4>
              <h4>Yet a personal God can become a grave liability. He can be a mere idol
              carved in our own image, a projection of our limited needs, fears and desires.
              We can assume that he loves what we love and hates what we hate, endorsing
              our prejudices instead of compelling us to transcend them. When he seems
              to fail to prevent a catastrophe or seems even to desire a tragedy, he
              can seem callous and cruel. A facile belief that a disaster is the will
              of God can make us accept things that are fundamentally unacceptable. The
              very fact that, as a person, God has a gender is also limiting: it means
              that the sexuality of half the human race is sacralized at the expense
              of the female and can lead to a neurotic and inadequate imbalanace in human
              sexual mores. A personal God can be dangerous, therefore. Instead of pulling
              us beyond our limitations, “he” can encourage us to remain complacently
              within them; “he” can make us as cruel, callous, self-satisfied and partial
              as “he” seems to be. Instead of inspiring the compassion that should characterize
              all advanced religion, “he” can encourage us to judge, condemn and marginalize.
              It seems, therefore, that the idea of a personal God can only be a stage
              in our religious development. The world religions all seem to have recognized
              this danger and have sought to transcend the personal conception of supreme
              reality.</h4>

              <h4>A personal view of God is necessarily limited, whereas the ultimate nature
              of existence has no limits. This limitedness of view embodied in personalism
              breeds contention and strife between religions. For example, in a dispute
              between those who regard Krishna as ultimate, and those who regard Jesus
              as ultimate, and those who regard Isis as ultimate, how could anyone decide?,
              by what criteria would one of these persons displace the others?</h4>
              <h4>I believe that one of the appeals of Buddhism in the west at this time
              is that the personalistic stance of Christianity has become more and more
              difficult to maintain, and that the failure of personalism has left an
              opening in western culture for different forms of religious expression,
              such as Buddhism, to enter. Keiji Nishitani, in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0520049462/dharmajssutra-20"> Religion and Nothingness</a>, in a chapter titled “The Personal and the Impersonal”
              argues that in western culture the comprehension of God was united with
              a particular cosmological doctrine. Because God was seen as expressed in
              this cosmological arrangement, it was theologically argued that one could
              approach God through nature as expressed in this cosmological design. When
              science undermined this cosmology, at every level, this cut off the traditional
              route to God that had functioned effectively in the west for many centuries.
              This is the source of the resistance to scientific development and thought
              among orthodox and fundamentalist religions in the west. Furthermore, when
              science undermined this cosmology and explained nature in terms not requiring
              a personal God, it left many feeling that existence now lacked a sacred
              dimension.</h4>
              <h4>However, others (I am thinking of people like Spinoza) responded to this
              developing situation by concluding that the ultimate nature of things might
              not be inherently tied to a particular cosmological view; and this is where
              Buddhism has found a niche among some westerners. Because Buddhism does
              not have a strong cosmological commitment, Buddhism was seen to offer a
              resolution, in some sense, to the displacement of the sacred dimension
              which had occurred with the blossoming of scientific understanding.</h4>
              <h4>It is my understanding that the Buddha taught a rigorously impersonal view
              of ultimate nature. I have yet to run across a designation of nirvana that
              includes any kind of personalism. Nirvana is peace, nirvana is bliss, nirvana
              is unborn, nirvana is deathless; all of these elucidations of ultimacy
              as nirvana do not entail any specific personal form. I think that this
              impersonalism arises from the Buddha’s insight into impermanence. As indicated
              previously, the Buddha exteneded this insight into the celestial domains,
              regarding deities also as impermanent. This applied to even those great
              deities, such as Brahma and Vishnu, who create entire world systems. They
              too will pass away, though they live incredibly long lives from the human
              perspective. From the Buddhist perspective, the God of monotheism is also
              impermanent, not unborn, and not deathless.</h4>
              <h4>For those allied with a particular form, and a personalistic stance, this
              rigorous impersonalism can seem cold and remote. The plus side of this
              impersonalism, however, is that an impersonalistic view allows that ultimate
              nature, Buddha Nature, Nirvana, is accessible to anyone, no matter what
              their form. This blossomed in Great Vehicle Buddhism into the idea that
              all sentient beings, no matter what their form, have Buddha Nature. In
              this context Buddha Nature is that capacity that all sentients have to
              realize the ultimate and transcendent, to enter into the deathless element
              of existence. From this perspective, impersonalism is an optimistic view.</h4>
              <h4>In a larger context, I think of personalism as any view which argues that
              ultimate nature has a specific form. For example, materialistic atomism
              I would regard as a form of personalism. I realize this may strike readers
              as an odd way of using the term personalism. In defense, I comprehend the
              core of personalism as an insistence on a specific, graspable, form for
              ultimacy. Thus I would regard anthropomorphic forms of personalism, such
              as those centered on Jesus or Krishna, as a sub-set of this tendency.</h4>
              <h4>In the history of Buddhism this tendency manifests as <em>Abhidharma</em>,
              which is founded on “dharma theory.” As Bhikkhu Bodhi writes:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>The <em>Abhidhamma</em> may be described as a philosophy because it proposes
              an ontology, a perspective on the nature of the real. This perspective
              has been designated the “dhamma theory” (<em>dhammavaada</em>). Briefly,
              the dhamma theory maitains that ultimate reality consists of a multiplicity
              of elementary constituents called <em>dhammas</em>. The <em>dhammas</em> are
              not noumena hidden behind phenomena, not “things in themselves” as opposed
              to “mere appearances,” but the fundamental components of actuality... The
              familiar world of substantial objects and enduring persons is, according
              to the <em>dhamma</em> theory, a conceptual construct fashioned by the mind
              out of the raw data provided by the <em>dhammas</em>. The entities of our
              everyday frame of reference possess merely a consensual reality derivative
              upon the foundational stratum of the <em>dhammas</em>. It is the <em>dhammas</em> alone that possess ultimate reality: determinate existence “from their
              own side” (<em>saruupato</em>) independent of the mind’s conceptual processing
              of the data.</h4>
              <h4>(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1928706029/dharmajssutra-20">A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, a translation of the <em>Abhidhammattha Sangaha</em></a>, translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, Buddhist Publication Society, Pariyati Editions, Seattle, 1993, page 3.)</h4>
              </blockquote>
              <h4>I think of Abhidhamma as a form of atomism, only a psychological form of
              atomism, rather than the materialistic form of atomism that western thought
              is familiar with. I sense in the development of Abhidhamma the same tendency
              as the more blatant forms of personalism; the attempt to fix ultimate reality
              onto a specific form and/or formal structure.</h4>
              <h4>If I return to the core understanding of Interdependent Transformation,
              I view the Buddha’s teaching as that which comprehends ultimate existence
              as interdependence itself, without any kind of substance or essence, either
              material or formal. This explains why, in criticisms of Abhidharma within
              Buddhism, the criticism has centered on the idea that Abhidharma reifies
              a thought construction, and in that very reification, subverts the core
              teaching of the Buddha. In the <em>Heart Sutra</em>, when it says, “All dharmas
              are marked with emptiness”, it is this point that the Sutra is making.</h4>
              <h4>If we extend the rigorous impersonalism of the Buddha’s teaching to encompass
              all types of fixed doctrine, and all attempts to reify a form into ultimacy,
              then that impersonalism of the Buddha would also systematically reject
              the attempts of Abhidharma to find ultimacy in dharma/dhamma theory. From
              the perspective of Interdependent Transformation, nothing exists independently,
              nothing exists from its own side. It is precisely that inability for anything
              to exist independently, on its own terms, or from its own side, that is
              undermined by this core realization.</h4>
              <h4>When I refer to the Buddha’s rigorous impersonalism, I mean that it is
              precisely Interdependent Transformation which constitutes ultimate reality
              in the teaching of the Buddha. Interdependent Transformation has no form,
              but functions to give rise to all forms. Interdependent Transformation
              has no color, no taste, no texture, no sound, no emotion, no thought, etc..
              But without Interdependent Transformation, none of these things would exist.
              It is awakening to the reality of Interdependent Transformation which constitues
              Nirvana and allows for the blossoming of the unrestricted heart of compassion.</h4>
              <h3>3. On Having A View</h3>
              <h4>In a number of discourses the Buddha states that clinging to a view constitues
              a hindrance to realization. At other times, the Buddha emphasizes the importance
              of having a right view in order to progress on the path to realization.
              And, of course, right view is the first aspect of the Eightfold Path. I
              have found integrating both of these understandings a significant challenge.
              Here are a few of my own thoughts on this.</h4>
              <h4>First, I think that everyone has a view of ultimate nature. In most cases
              this view is not consciously held. But it is implied as a basis for many
              disparate understandings that an individual has. One of the great gifts
              that philosophy presents to humanity is to bring to conscious awareness
              just what constitutes these core understandings. By bringing these views
              to the surface, it is possible to gain clarity regarding these basic views,
              and if necessary, to change and adapt them.</h4>
              <h4>By “view” I mean here a metaphysical view regarding the ultimate nature
              of existence. Some would deny that they have such a view. There are famous
              examples of philosophers and scientists who deny that they hold any kind
              of metaphysical position. Examples include Sextus Empiricus, Newton, some
              pragmatists, and some modern deconstructionists and post-modernists.</h4>
              <h4>By “view” I mean here what Aristotle referred to as “first principles”.
              Aristotle argued that it is not possible for people to have any kind of
              discussion, about any topic, without there being some agreement on first
              principles. First principles are kind of like starting points. Since, for
              the most part, we agree on basics, it is not often that first principles
              come up for discussion, which is one of the reasons why many people who
              have a view, or first principles, are unaware of the content of these views
              that they hold. For example, in any kind of discussion, there is the assumption
              that there exist inferential connections between statements, and these
              inferences are usually not explicitly stated, but their validity is assumed.
              Aristotle would argue that these basic inferential understandings constitute
              first principles. Aristotle placed discussion of these in his metaphysics,
              not in his logic. Why? Because Aristotle regarded these first principles
              as starting points which made any discussion possible; they were basic
              to all forms of inquiry.</h4>
              <h4>Both the sceptic and the modern deconstructionist offer arguments for their
              point of view; even if their point of view consists of nothing but a critique
              of views they disagree with. The validity of the critique, however, depends
              upon assumptions as to the validity of inference and these assumptions,
              in turn, are metaphysical, and/or ontological, in nature. In other words,
              I consider Aristotle correct on this central point; it is one of the great
              contributions Aristotle made to show how views, or first principles, function
              as a basis for inquiry.</h4>
              <h4>In contrast, have you ever had a discussion with someone that just went
              nowhere because you could not agree on even the basics? Most of us have
              had this kind of experience. It is very frustrating. Before one even starts,
              one feels kind of defeated. Not defeated in the sense of refuted, but defeated
              in the sense of not being able to communicate. This happens because, within
              the confines of the subject being considered, the two parties can not form
              a common view, or a shared sense of first principles. Political discussions
              often seem to manifest in this way.</h4>
              <h4>Scientists, such as Newton and Skinner, who argue that they do not have
              first principles, or a metaphysical view, also ignore that they make claims
              for the validity of their inferences. This implies that there exists a
              connection between their statements and the world to which those statements
              refer. What is the nature of that connection? It is not obvious. What is
              the nature of the inferences that they make and why should we consider
              such inferences valid? Once again, that is not obvious. In the case of
              Newton, with the passage of time it has become clear that he did hold metaphysical
              assumptions, and I would suggest that this also applies to all scientists
              without exception, as well as all sceptics, agnostics, and post-modern
              chronocentric deconstructionists. The point is that any kind of inference
              assumes the validity of logical structures, and these logical structures
              are based on metaphysical views, summed up in first principles.</h4>
              <h4>Likewise, any kind of refutation assumes that there exists standards by
              which to judge the validity of reasons and arguments. Ultimately, these
              kinds of standards rest upon a metaphysical view, once again articulated
              by first principles. Therefore, even the radical sceptic has a view, or
              the sceptic would not find it possible to even disagree with others who
              hold contrary views.</h4>
              <h4>There are a few fields of human endeavor in which first principles are
              clearly stated. These can serve to help us understand how they function,
              and, perhaps, how we can simultaneously have a view without clinging to
              that view. The clearest example of this is mathematics, and especially
              geometry. The axioms which form the basis for geometrical systems function
              as first principles for the articulation of space which that system offers.
              These axioms are starting points, stipulations. In order to engage in that
              system of geometry, one must simply acquiesce to their function as starting
              points. If I do not agree with an axiom, I might still be doing geometry,
              but I would be doing a different form of geometry. This is how there exist
              numerous kinds of geometry, because of varying axiomatic starting points.</h4>
              <h4>Similarly, in the realm of music, I can think of scales as musical axioms,
              or starting points. Major, minor, etc., represents basic structures which,
              once chosen, influence every aspect of the musical composition. Whether
              a piece is in major or minor is stipulated by the composer. To argue about
              this is to argue that the composer should not have written the piece at
              all.</h4>
              <h4>Having a metaphysical view, or first principle, means having an understanding
              of what it means to ultimately exist, what is the nature of existence as
              such. There are many possible views on this subject, just as there are
              many possible forms of geometry and many possible musical scales.</h4>
              <h4>It is worthwhile mentioning that first principles, or views, are not obvious.
              I bring this up because western philosophy, probably under the influence
              of Descartes, has sometimes adopted the idea that first principles should
              be self-evident, clear, and not subject to challenge. In contrast, Greek
              philosophy did not regard first principles as obvious. For example, it
              is not obvious that parallel lines never connect; but it is stipulated
              as a principle of Euclidean Geometry. Similarly, the law of the excluded
              middle is not obvious; but it is stipulated as a first principle by Aristotle,
              a starting point in all of his discourse.</h4>
              <h4>I consider Interdependent Transformation as the first principle of Buddhism.
              It is not obvious. It is precisely the fact that this first principle is
              not obvious, and in many ways even counterintuitive, that creates the necessity
              for a path to understanding this view. If Interdependent Transformation
              were obvious and self-evident, there would be no need for study and practice;
              the truth of Interdependent Transformation would simply present itself.</h4>
              <h4>I regard having first principles, or views, as part of what it means to
              exist as a human being. I think having such views come with living a life
              as a human and that all humans have such a view. Just as humans have organs
              such as a liver and a pancrease, all humans have a metaphysical view. And
              just as humans are not normally aware of their internal organs, so also
              most humans are not aware of their view. From this perspective, when the
              Buddha speaks of having Right View, I think he means, first, to raise to
              conscious awareness the view that one has of ultimate nature, of what it
              means to exist. And second, to examine that view and see if it really holds
              up to experience. Right View as Interdependent Transformation means that
              the Buddha finds the view of Interdependent Transformation as a view that
              is consistent with existence and simultaneously leads to liberation, to
              nirvana, and the cessation of all sorrow.</h4>
              <h4>But how do we arrive at this view of Interdependent Transformation without
              clinging to that view, and thereby engendering suffering, since clinging
              is the cause of suffering? I believe this can be accomplished by applying
              the view of Interdependent Transformation to itself. Just as all things
              arise dependently, so also the view of Interdependent Transformation arises
              dependently. Just as all things are in transformation, so also the view
              of Interdependent Transformation is also constantly in transformation.
              The tendency is to try and find a view that exists outside of causation
              and change; but the view of Interdependent Transformation comprehends causation
              and change as ultimacy itself. Therefore, when comprehended fully, the
              view itself negates the tendency to cling to view. I believe that is one
              of the reasons why the Buddhist tradition regards comprehending Interdependent
              Transformation as in and of itself having liberative potential.</h4>
              <h4>Let me illustrate how this can work with an example. If I discursively
              raise the thought that all things appear dependent upon causes and conditions,
              the appearance of that very thought arises due to causes and condition.
              If I then contemplate the thought that the thought that all things arise
              due to causes and conditions arises due to causes and conditions, I then,
              once again, generate the insight that this thought also arises due to causes
              and conditions. Schemtically, it works like this:</h4>
              <blockquote>
              <h4>1. All things appear due to causes and conditions.<br> 2. The idea (1), “all things appear due to causes and conditions”, appears
              due to causes and conditions.<br> 3. The idea (2), also appears due to causes and conditions.<br> 4. The idea (3), also appears due to causes and conditions.<br> 5. The idea (4), also appears due to causes and conditions.<br> 6. Etcetera.</h4>
              </blockquote>
              <h4>This gives me the experience of the dependent nature of things, since ideas
              constitute things, so that the contemplation of the idea simultaneously
              provides the means for the direct experience to which the idea refers.
              The idea of dependence is luminously permeated by the transcendent reality
              of dependence itself.</h4>
              <h4>This contemplation also gives me the experience of vastness because the
              infinite regress which this contemplation engenders has no end. Having
              no end, I directly experience the vast context out of which, and dependent
              upon which, ideas appear.</h4>
              <h4>This contemplation also gives me the experience of non-clinging, and therefore
              the experience of nirvana itself. The nirvana I experience in this contemplation
              is probably not as thorough or as deep, or as enduring, as that of a fully
              realized Buddha, but it is of the same quality, of the same kind, differing
              only in degree. I experience non-clinging in this contemplation of Interdependent
              Transformation, as the dependent nature of the idea I am contemplating,
              because with each step in this process I must let go of the appearing idea
              in order to observe how that idea arises due to causes and conditions,
              which gives rise to the next level of contemplation. This experience of
              non-clinging helps me to understand how, in this instance, Right View does
              not, in this case, generate fixation, suffering and clinging. For the experience
              of releasing each level of understanding into the next level allows me
              to experience the meaning of cessation as the end of suffering in a clear
              and direct manner.</h4>
              <h4>Finally, this kind of contemplation, allows me to directly experience the
              ocean of awareness of which conceptualization forms only a small part.
              With each step in this contemplation, as I follow through on the infinite
              regress that this contemplation generates, I perceive a vaster context
              of conscious awareness out of which ideas arise. Soon, as this process
              unfolds, the ocean of awareness becomes directly accessible and perceivable.
              It resembles shifting my awareness from a small island on which I dwell
              to the ocean which surrounds this island. It resembles becoming aware of
              the galactic context in which the earth, and the solar system, live out
              there existence. This broadening of awareness is in itself profoundly liberating.</h4>
              <h3>4. The Buddha’s Unique Teaching</h3>
              <h4>The Buddha has offered humanity a unique teaching centered on the understanding
              and realization of Interdependent Transformation. From that primal insight
              grows the entire Buddhadharma and all the schools and interpretations which
              collectively we refer to as Buddhism. Because of the unfortunate history
              of religion which has often erupted into violent sectarian disputes, the
              claim that the Buddha’s teaching is unique may provoke a negative reaction
              in some people. The fear is that by claiming that the Buddha offered a
              unique teaching I am also making a claim for unique worthiness and therefore
              disparaging other forms of spirituality. Such a conclusion, however, does
              not follow.</h4>
              <h4>For example, I would also claim that Mozart has offered humanity a unique
              interpretation of the sonic domain. This does not mean that other forms
              of music do not have value. Or, I would also claim that Euclid has offered
              humanity a unique interpretation of space. This does not mean that other
              interpretations of space do not have value.</h4>
              <h4>However, to understand Mozart, I have to listen to Mozart. To understand
              Euclid, I have to accept his axioms. To understand the Buddhadharma, I
              have to begin where the Buddha began; specifically, the primal insight
              of Interdependent Transformation.</h4>
              <h3>5. The Garden Of The Spirit</h3>
              <h4>I have mentioned this before, but I consider it important enough to repeat
              here. To say that the Buddha has offered us a unique teaching does not
              imply that other teachings have no value. Because of the history of religion,
              people tend to think that that is what someone means when they make an
              assertion of this kind. However, I look at it differently.</h4>
              <h4>Mozart has offered us unique music, but that does not mean that other music
              is not valuable. Millay has offered us unique sonnets, but that does not
              mean other sonnets are not valuable. It is in this spirit that I understand
              what it means to say that the Buddha has a unique teaching, a teaching
              that differs from other spiritual traditions. Once again, this does not
              meant that other spiritual traditions do not have value, do not have something
              to offer. It simply means that the song of the Dharma is not the same song
              as the song of monotheism, or the song of platonism, etc..</h4>
              <h4>I like to think of spirituality as a garden with many blossoms. It is the
              variety which makes the garden beautiful. Monotheism is the Sunflower,
              turned toward the one source. Buddhism is the Lotus, with its roots woven
              deep into the web of existence. May all the blossoms of the spirit bear
              fruit.</h4>
              <h3>6. A Pluralistic Multiverse</h3>
              <h4>The difficulty in writing an extended philosophical analysis is that people
              will tend to think that I mean this analysis to be the only possible analysis.
              This is due to the history of philosophy, and religion, and how they have
              viewed their self-appointed tasks as metaphysicians and theologians. To
              clarify this, contrast how mathematicians view their own works. A mathematician
              might spend a great deal of time and effort formulating a systematic presentation
              of set theory. However, in the field of mathematics, it is unlikely that
              the mathematician would view their work as final, or as the only possible
              presentation of set theory. This is particularly true since the creation
              of alternate inferential systems, beginning in the 19th century, which
              have made mathematical thought much more fluid.</h4>
              <h4>Theoretical constructs and philosophical investigations have their value,
              but their value does not reside in their completeness or their finality.
              The value of philosophical investigation lies in its capacity for clarification.
              Philosophical investigation has the great virtue of bringing into conscious
              awareness ideas and views that for the most part have remained hidden,
              yet have strongly effected how we interact with the world and how we comprehend
              the world. By comprehend the world I mean how we conceptually organize
              our experience, and how we tend to expect experience to manifest.</h4>
              <h4>Everyone has an overall view, which I think of as metaphysical presuppositions
              or stipulations. I say that everyone has such views because any time a
              person makes an inference, there is implied by that inference metaphysical
              assumptions about the nature of causality, the relationships between concepts,
              and the relationship between concepts and sensory existence, and the relationship
              between words and words. However, most people do not have a conscious awareness
              of their own metaphysical views. Just as most people can sing a tune, yet
              do not have knowledge as to how music is constructed and written, so also
              people make inferences all the time without having an awareness as to the
              foundations out of which these inferences spring. Because people in general
              lack this awareness, if their metaphysical view is flawed, or dysfunctional
              in some way, it remains very difficult to correct, alter, or modify the
              view. This is one reason why I consider philosophical investigation such
              a great gift to humanity; because it allows humanity to perceive such flaws,
              or misplaced inferences, or tenuous assumptions and then, after perceiving
              these, to attain the clarity with which to modify, alter, and expand one’s
              understanding. As Alfred North Whitehead put it, “... [A]ll constructive
              thought, on the various special topics of scientific interest, is dominated
              by some such scheme, unacknowledged, but not less influential in guiding
              the imagination. The importance of philosophy lies in its sustained effort
              to make such schemes explicit, and thereby capable of criticism and improvement.”
              (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0029345707/dharmajssutra-20">Process and Reality</a>, by Alfred North Whitehead, Free Press, Corrected
              Edition, New York, 1978, page XIV.)</h4>
              <h4>However, to clarify metaphysical views and assumptions does not infer that
              one view is innately superior to another. I am encouraged in this view
              of philosophical investigation as always open, as always tentative, by
              Alfred North Whitehead’s comments in his preface to his great work, <em>Process
              and Reality</em>. There he says, after laying a foundation for his view
              of the nature of philosophical investigation, “There remains the final
              reflection, how shallow, how puny, and imperfect are efforts to sound the
              depths in the nature of things. In philosophical discussion, the merest
              hint of dogmatic certainty as to finality of statement is an exhibition
              of folly.” (Ibid.)</h4>
              <h4>On the other hand, I think it would be a mistake to assert that all metaphysical
              views are equal, that none are better than any others. That also would
              be going to an extreme. Clealry some metaphysical systems are dysfunctional.
              In terms of the Dharma, most views, or metaphysical assumptions, do not
              lead to the cessation of suffering. Using this standard, one can say that
              the Buddhadharma is supreme.</h4>
              <h4>In other words, I am attempting in this work to bring to the foreground
              the overal view of the Buddhadharma, which I refer to as Interdependent
              Transformation. The purpose of bringing this view to the foreground is
              to make it possible for both myself and others to comprehend and perceive
              how this core understanding weaves its way throughout the Buddhadharma,
              and to become consciously aware of this weave. By becoming consciously
              aware of this weave of Interdependent Transformation it becomes possible
              to enlarge our understanding, help others to understand, and to transform
              our understanding so that it becomes an effective means for teaching others
              the way to liberation.</h4>
              <h4>My purpose is not to produce a final or definitive statement about Interdependent
              Transformation. Nor is my purpose to produce a final and definitive statement
              about ultimate reality. Rather, my purpose lies in illuminating, to the
              best of my ability, a way of comprehending existence which many have found
              conducive to their own happiness and the happiness of others. I fully expect
              that others will also, in the future, compose illuminations on Interdependent
              Transformation which others will also find useful, which may in significant
              respects supercede and surpass what is done herein.</h4>
              <h4>However, it is my view that, in a sense, no illumination of ultimate nature
              is ever completely surpassed or rendered in some way useless. Here my view
              somewhat diverges from that of Whitehead and others in the western philosophical
              tradition. As I understand it, the western philosophical tradition regards
              ultimate reality as in some sense unitary. The elucidations of that ulimate
              nature sort of hover around, or spotlight portions of this ultimate nature.
              In that sense all such illuminations are useful. But there remains an assumption
              that there exists a universe, a singular ultimate presence.</h4>
              <h4>I tend to think of existence as more fluid and more diverse. For this reason,
              I tend to use the term multiverse rather than universe. There are many
              ultimate natures all of which have many aspects. In other words, the situation
              in which we find ourselves is more complex, and more beautiful, than we
              can imagine. I don’t think that it is reducible to a singular nature.</h4>
              <h4>For this reason, I regard illuminating the nature of Interdependent Transformation
              as illuminating one aspect of a complex multiversal presence. I don’t consider
              this project as in some sense an explanation for everything. Nevertheless,
              such a project, the illumination of ultimate nature, has value because
              it grants us clarity, and it forms the ground upon which true happiness
              and contentment can be built, and ultimately the cessation of all sorrow.</h4>
              <h4>My attitude towards Interdependent Transformation is similar to Aristotle’s
              attitude towards what Aristotle refers to as “first principles.” By first
              principles Aristotle means accepted, or stipulated, starting points that
              make further discussion possible.</h4>
              <h4>Aristotle’s first principles consist of three views: 1) the law of identity
              or A is A; 2) the law of contradiction, or nothing can be X </h4>
