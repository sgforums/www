              <p>a self introduction:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im a early 20s male uni student in sg, i was born into a buddhist/taoist family here. since i was young, the taoist/buddhist rites were just 'rituals' to me and never carried any meaning to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>over years, my logic-seeking mind made me doubtful of the nature of all religions, and i eventually lost all traces of buddhism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have read with interest on zen buddhism lately, and im very touched by their philosophy. to see a blue door is a blue door, to hear the birds chirping is simply to her them. this nothingness, this austerity, this deep meditation to re-understand oneself is a good call to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i will be happy to be a born-again buddhist, and i would like to understand more about zen. i am scheduled for a trip with some friends to japan in feb next year, and i would like to spend a day in a zen temple or too, can fellow users here recommend me how i can start off my zen journey to re-understand myself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>peace be upon you.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>It's great you're finding interested in finding out the gem in Buddhism beyond all those rituals and stuff. Perhaps you can tell us what started your interest in Zen? Was it certain books you came across?</p>
              <p>There are books by Zen teachers you may want to check out, such as by Thich Nhat Hanh, Steve Hagen, Charlotte Joko Beck, Shunryu Suzuki, etc are usually recommendable. I also like books by Toni Packer, former successor of Zen Master Kapleau Roshi but later chose to teach in a non-traditional and non-sectarian style.</p>
              <p>As for visiting temples at Japan you may want to find a person who has been there, knows the place and is able to converse with them in Japanese, perhaps.</p>
              <p>Since you're interested in Zen, there are a couple of Zen centers in Singapore you can check out. At some point you may want to start formal Zen practices. Having a teacher and joining a community is pretty important:</p>

              <p>dear an eternal now,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank you for your reply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the reason why i chose zen out of the many branches of buddhism is because during my soul searching, i have actually participated in some non-organized catholic events, but i did not find peace. catholicism while wholesome in general, and certaintly good, did not suit me. i decided to look for another way of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i did some research online and i was astonished that actually what i have been looking for - an austere phiolosphy with "ideally" little emotional attachment - lies in the religion i was born into - buddhism. of my scant research, i found out that zen as a branch suits me the most.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thank you for the links provided, i will definitely check out the links and participate in this forum.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the sharing :)</p>
              <p>Those three are actually Zen centers. I am not aware of any other zen centers in Singapore.</p>
              <p>I personally attend my own dharma center "Jen Chen Buddhist Blissful Culture Centre" which is at Geylang. We aren't exactly Zen, but our Master's lineage is from the Rinzai Zen lineage. Perhaps you can come down next Saturday (19th Sept) from 7.30 to 10 p.m. and visit our dharma center. Our dharma teacher will be giving a talk on precepts on that day. You can take home dharma CDs and books you find from the shelves, almost all of them are free for distribution. Our dharma center website is down, here's another one (english website): <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg">www.jenchen.org.sg</a></p>
