Much to his chagrin the monks maintained stony silence. Their refusal to speak despite his persistence made him leave the place in a huff. It later turned out that the card predicted that he would live for 83 years and his rule as a leader of the party would last 41 years.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;  ">Mao was born in 1893 and died in 1976 on the 83rd year of his life. He took over the leadership of the ruling Communist Party of China, (CPC) and the Red Army in 1935 during the Long March and remained its leader till his death, which makes it a leadership of 41 years. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; ">True or false, this legend of Mao's destiny is on the lips of scores of official tourist guides here on this picturesque mountain. It is interesting to note how much China has moved away from Mao's era and has aggressively marketed the spiritual importance of the Buddhist shrine using his own legend.</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;  "></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

The atmosphere in the shrines easily reminds one of any Indian temple, with hundreds of devotees seen going around it chanting prayers, while others lighting fragrant sticks before the giant bronze statues of Lord Buddha. This mountain is regarded as one of the four holy Buddhist Mountains in China, with 360 temples built on it dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) after Buddhism came to China from India.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Broadly imbibing the Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions is a massive white pagoda which can be seen from several miles. The pagoda, in Nepalese style, has a base circumference of 83.3 meters and is 75.3 meters high. It reportedly contained a small India-made iron stupa, where some remains of Sakyamuni (One of the names of Lord Buddha) are kept. Mt Wutai lies in Wutai County in Xinzhou Region of China's flourishing Shanxi Province which has taken a prominent spot on China's burgeoning tourist map.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

The city dating back to 557 BC-532 BC is regarded as the "outstanding city model" of Han nationality styled during Ming and Qing dynasties. Hans constitute over 95 per cent of Chinese population.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

The place which has emerged on top of China's tourist map with modern hotel facilities designed to give the experience of living in the ancient houses is attracting lakhs of tourists every year. Places such as this helped China emerge as one of the top three tourist destinations in the world last year raking up billions of dollars in tourist inflows. With 56 million tourist arrivals last year, China edged out Spain, to become the world's third most visited country, behind France (79 million) and the United States (61 million).</span></span></p>

              <p>Such cards usually contain a pronouncement that has no connection with its serial number.</p>
              <p>Also it is not taboo to tell Mao he would live till 83yo and rule for 41 years, if the monks intrepret the serial number as such.</p>
              <p>Could be he really picked card No. 8341, and it says that he would be happily married and have many children, and be wealthy and prosperous. The monks dare not say that to him.</p>

He often called for greater unity among the different Chinese dialect groups, and took the lead in rallying the Chinese in Southeast Asia to support China’s war effort against the Japanese.<br><br><img src="http://www.thelegacy.nl.sg/images/exh3_qtkk1_p01a.jpg" alt="Left: Tan Kah Kee with Chinese leaders(1949); Right: Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and other Chinese organisations welcome Tan back from China (1950).

Even though his Hokkien community outnumbered the others and enjoyed more influence in the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, he felt that all Chamber members should be treated equally. He said, “The Chamber of Commerce is an organisation to rally all Singapore businessmen, and there seems to be no necessity to draw a line between their bang affiliation.”</p>
              <p class="maintxt" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #4a3d2a; text-align: justify;">Tan could not convince the Chamber to adopt a more democratic approach during his lifetime, but his ability to rally others to his causes helped him to build the Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan into a body that solidly supported education and promoted social development. Similarly, he encouraged Chinese towkays from other dialect groups to join the Ee Hoe Hean Club, a businessmen’s social club dominated by the Hokkien. With Tan as its chairman from 1923, the Club became a platform for raising political awareness of the Japanese invasion of China and the headquarters for Tan’s various Relief Fund efforts. <br><br><br>[ <a href="http://www.thelegacy.nl.sg/exh_community.html">Close</a> ]</p>

In 1938, Tan was elected to chair the South Seas China Relief Fund Union, which gathered not only financial resources but also sent volunteer drivers and mechanics to transport military and medical supplies on the Burma Road to China.</span></span></strong></p>

Believing that the Overseas Chinese had a responsibility to support their homeland when it was under threat, Tan led the Shandong Relief effort, which raised $1 million (Chinese currency) within a month.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;">The year was 1940, and China’s luck was at its lowest point. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Much of the eastern states were occupied by the Japanese, and the Nationalist Party under Chiang Kai-shek, still fighting a rear-guard action from the safe haven of wartime capital Chongqing, was hopelessly corrupt.  </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;">As a de facto leader of the overseas Chinese, Tan Kah Kee has just embarked on an 8-month trip to China, dubbed the Comfort Mission, to bring aid and moral support to those suffering from the onslaught of the invaders. After being feted by Chiang, he visited Mao Zedong, then living in the caves of Yenan with a few thousand of his forces. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;">Tan Kah Kee had heard of how the Communist Party – which was considered an enemy of the Nationalists, had conducted their affairs with much fairness and high principles of governance, earning the admiration and respect of those they came into contact with. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">At the end of his 8-day visit to this humble abode, Tan Kah Kee observed that Mao and his men ruled this region of a few thousand followers and the surrounding peasants with a firm hand tempered with fairness, frugality and much egalitarianism, implementing a system of thrift and reward matched with hard work, a viable education system for the children, and had somehow made his people economically self-supporting with what little they had. </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tan Kah Kee  -  who had up to then despaired over the lack of a viable leadership to pull the country up from its ruinous depths -  was suddenly filled with a glowing sense of  hope.  </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;">Here was a group of high-principled and incorruptible people, widely read in socialist theories, leaders who didn’t stand on ceremonies and practised what they preach – here is the light at the end of the tunnel, and that the path towards salvation would be clear. Upon his return to Singapore, TKK wasted no time in announcing to his huaqiao compatriots that they should from then on change their allegiance to the Communist Party. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Bitstream Charter', serif; font-size: 14px;">The record 6-hour speech – which eventually gave rise to one of the most famous sayings in modern China – ‘The future of China lies in Yenan’ — not only angered Chiang but gave the Communist Party the seal of approval to continue their battle against the ruling faction, and confidence in their final march towards Beijing after the Japanese were finally driven from China’s shores. </span></p>

              <p>Unfortunately, the Chinese Communist Party (being officially anti-religion and atheist) still place a strict control on religious activities in China. If you read PRC texts, the official communist branded all religious beliefs as "superstitious".</p>
              <p>The reason why Chinese Communist Party support Buddhism at the moment is because Buddhism is a very peaceful religion. But apart from that, they still have problems with Tibetan Buddhism, particularly Dalai Lama, particularly due to his political leadership. They still don't allow the exile Tibetan government to return to Tibet.</p>
              <p>Religious control remains strict in China. "Religious freedom" is only a name in China. Foreign religious organizations who want to set up branch centers in China will find it hard to be approved by PRC. If you read some news ago, they had problems with Catholic Bishops.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="color: black; font-size: 14pt;">Mao was born in 1893 and died in
                          1976 on the 83rd year of his life. He took over the leadership of
                          the ruling Communist Party of China, (CPC) and the Red Army in 1935
                          during the Long March and remained its leader till his death, which
                          makes it a leadership of 41 years.</span> <span style="font-size: 14pt;">True or false, this legend of Mao's destiny is
                          on the lips of scores of official tourist guides here on this
                          picturesque mountain. It is interesting to note how much China has
                          moved away from Mao's era and has aggressively marketed the
                          spiritual importance of the Buddhist shrine using his own
                          legend.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For over 1200 years, Wutai Mountain has
                          been China's most sacred Buddhist place because it was where the
                          highly revered "Manjusri, the Bodhisattva of wisdom", one of
                          prominent disciples of Lord Buddha, once lived and taught Buddhism.
                          The atmosphere in the shrines easily reminds one of any Indian
                          temple, with hundreds of devotees seen going around it chanting
                          prayers, while others lighting fragrant sticks before the giant
                          bronze statues of Lord Buddha. This mountain is regarded as one of
                          the four holy Buddhist Mountains in China, with 360 temples built
                          on it dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907) after Buddhism came
                          to China from India.</span></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Currently only 47 temples exist here.
                          Broadly imbibing the Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions is a
                          massive white pagoda which can be seen from several miles. The
                          pagoda, in Nepalese style, has a base circumference of 83.3 meters
                          and is 75.3 meters high. It reportedly contained a small India-made
                          iron stupa, where some remains of Sakyamuni (One of the names of
                          Lord Buddha) are kept. Mt Wutai lies in Wutai County in Xinzhou
                          Region of China's flourishing Shanxi Province which has taken a
                          prominent spot on China's burgeoning tourist map.</span></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Besides the temple, the province which has
                          emerged as the power house of China catering power supply to top
                          cities like Beijing, also houses the famous 'Pingyao' -- the
                          ancient city which is a UNESCO world heritage site. The city dating
                          back to 557 BC-532 BC is regarded as the "outstanding city model"
                          of Han nationality styled during Ming and Qing dynasties. Hans
                          constitute over 95 per cent of Chinese
                          population.</span></span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Plush with houses and places built with
                          ancient Chinese style architecture, the walled city has age-old
                          Buddhist temples, China's first Bank as well as an old prison,
                          depicting torture kits extensively used by the rulers to keep the
                          population under check. The place which has emerged on top of
                          China's tourist map with modern hotel facilities designed to give
                          the experience of living in the ancient houses is attracting lakhs
                          of tourists every year. Places such as this helped China emerge as
                          one of the top three tourist destinations in the world last year
                          raking up billions of dollars in tourist inflows. With 56 million
                          tourist arrivals last year, China edged out Spain, to become the
                          world's third most visited country, behind France (79 million) and
                          the United States (61 million).</span></span></p>

              <p>So, this is how the Chinese communist party is trying to "justify" their claim on the supposedly Mao's support for Buddhism?

              <p>So what's the point of building many frivolous shrines and buddhist temples now in the name of making money for tourism? They don't allow large gathering of buddhist dharma services. They don't allow buddhist TV stations and foreign dharma centers. I've been to some "buddhist temples" in China set up by businessman and corrupt officials out to make money. They even employed "faked monks" to come and tell you about fortune sticks. What a shameless Chinese communist party!! The funniest thing is that you have to pay for joss-sticks (and they even ask you for credit card).</p>
              <p>It reminds me of the story of æ¢�æ­¦å¸�  Liang Wudi who is a fervent supporter of buddhism, which some scholars labelled him as a "Bodhisattva Emperor", but when Bodhidharma went to visit Liang, Liang asked him how much merits he had gained from building shrines, temples, and Bodhidharma says "none". Buddhism is more about spiritual cultivation and practices. Merely relying on building shrines without the practice of spiritual comes to no merits at all.</p>

              <p>The "victor" always have something to justify their claims on the "unification of China".</p>
              <p>China is not unified yet. In fact, it was splitted into mainland China (under PRC) and Taiwan (under ROC) in 1949, as a result of Mao. Is that unification or splitting of China?</p>
              <p>Another issue is that what is Mao doing when he's taking directive order from Soviet in the 1930s when he established the Chinese Soviet Republic (puppet state of soviet)? Isn't that splitting up China into bits and pieces further? Is he really unifying China or splitting up China.</p>
              <p>The CCP tries to justify their claim on "unification" of China taking advantage of the chaotic situation of China during wartime period. If Chinese civil war (from 1945-1949) did not take place, do you think China will split up into mainland China and Taiwan? Had Mao have no ambition on the "communist revolution", will China be splitted up like today?</p>
              <p>The answer is no: today China will be a unified country under ROC which will include Mainland China and Taiwan. But today, we see PRC and then Taiwan splitted up...Mao is the culprit.</p>
