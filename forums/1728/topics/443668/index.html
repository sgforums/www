              <p><span class="dropcap">Z</span>en’s <em>hua-tou</em> practice recently 
                  seems to be enjoying a renaissance among the normal contingent of Zen 
                  Buddhists speckling the globe.  In part, this may be due to the growing 
                  awareness that this was Hsu Yun’s personal favorite Zen practice that he
                   spent much of his life advocating.  One of the best contemporary 
                  descriptions of <em>hua-tou</em> practice has recently come from Stuart 
                  Lachs who offers his personal experience with it and suggestions for 
                  anyone wanting to try it.<sup>[<a href="http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html#note-1">Note 1</a>]</sup> </p>
              <p>In the Buddhist world, other techniques are far more popular than the <em>hua-tou</em>:  <em>gong-an</em> (koan) study, sutra study, Pure Land (e.g., reciting the name of the Buddha), <em>Vipassana</em>, mind-blanking or void meditation, <em>pranayama</em>,
                   sound meditation, etc.  While these are all fine practices, and all 
                  give the same results if they are done correctly, each is unique in that
                   it “fits”, to a lesser or greater degree, with each individual’s 
                  personality and mental framework.  Some will find it more expedient to 
                  practice Pure Land, for example, than to practice Zen, and some who 
                  practice Zen will find it more expedient to practice sound-meditation 
                  than the <em>hua-tou</em> method.<sup>[<a href="http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html#note-2">Note 2</a>]</sup>  What makes <em>hua-tou</em> practice distinct as a practice is that it engages us to look directly into the nature of Being.  </p>
              <p>While I would like to try to make this practice as simple as possible
                   to encourage everyone to give it a try, I feel it necessary to list a 
                  few pre-requisites for, as simple as the practice is, it requires that 
                  we bring to it a few essential ingredients: great motivation, great 
                  concentration, and great desire.  Our motivation must be such that we 
                  are willing and eager to change the priorities in our lives to take up 
                  this practice which will engage us throughout the day for weeks or 
                  months.  Our concentration must be such that we can hold onto a topic 
                  and concentrate on it for an extended period of time without being 
                  easily distracted by other thoughts, sounds, sensations, etc., and our 
                  desire to understand who we are as living, sentient, beings must be 
                  strong and unwavering.  If these conditions aren’t in place when we 
                  start the practice, we are better suited to cultivate them first through
                   beginning Zen training exercises: to learn to concentrate, for example,
                   we might do breathe counting exercises, yoga, the Healing Breath or 
                  other pranayama exercises (for those with academic aspirations, study 
                  math, the sciences, philosophy, arts, etc.).  As for having strong 
                  motivation and desire, that is something that we either have or don’t, 
                  and only we can know.  Most often these qualities are generated from a 
                  deep sense of dissatisfaction with our life and a strong urge to want to
                   change it (i.e., suffering and desire to escape from suffering).  
                  Without these pre-requisites in place, attempting the <em>hua-tou</em> will likely be, at best, an intellectual exercise and, at worst, make us
                   frustrated to the point that we give up before we gain its fruit.</p>
              <p>I should also mention that Hsu Yun stressed the importance of having 
                  great faith in the method.  This will be necessary for some who might 
                  otherwise dismiss the practice as being too difficult for a perceived 
                  questionable outcome, but for others who bring sufficient desire it will
                   be irrelevant.  In my case, I found the practice itself to be immensely
                   compelling and that was what spurned me to start it and to continue 
                  with it.</p>
              <p><em>Huà-tÏŒu</em> { è©±é ­ } is literally translated as “word head” but is 
                  also translated as “critical phrase”.  Before the term was appropriated 
                  by Zen teachers it was used to refer to the main idea of a literary 
                  passage.  In Zen, it refers to the nature of the origin or source of a 
                  thought, word, or phrase that arises in one’s mind, or, more poetically,
                   to “the mind before it is stirred”.<sup>[<a href="http://www.hsuyun.org/chan/essays/bychuanzhi/759-huatoupractice.html#note-1">Note 3</a>]</sup></p>
              <p>All <em>hua-tous</em> have one thing in common.  See if you can figure out what it is from these six common ones:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Who is it who now repeats the Buddha's name?</li>
              <li>Who is dragging this corpse about?</li>
              <li>What is this?</li>
              <li>What is it?</li>
              <li>What was the original face before my father and mother were born?</li>
              <li>Who am I?</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Obviously, they are all questions:  what they all have in common is a “?” … which is, of itself, also a <em>hua-tou</em>.  <em>Hua-tou</em> practice is about looking deeply into the nature of being by asking 
                  ourselves an open-ended question which we lock into our brains and 
                  return to again and again.  The objective is not to answer it, but to 
                  play with it, letting it taunt, tease, and torment us.</p>
              <p>If you think you’re ready to begin the practice, here are the rules:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><strong>Select a <em>hua-tou</em>.</strong>  If you like Pure Land practices, 
                  choose the first one, if one of the others seems to hit a meaningful 
                  target, choose that one. Once you choose your <em>hua-tou</em>, stick with
                   it and don’t switch to another one.  If you are concerned that you may 
                  have chosen the wrong one, that’s the ego interfering with things. Don’t
                   let it manipulate you!  Once you get going with the practice you’ll 
                  come to see that they are all the same and you can use any of them and 
                  even come up with your own, but when starting out, it’s essential to 
                  work with only one.</li>
              <li><strong>“Lock in” your <em>hua-tou</em>.</strong>  If you have a regular sitting meditation schedule (always a good idea!), use this <em>hua-tou</em> for your entire sitting period.  Focus your entire being on it.  Don’t 
                  give in and give yourself some artificial answer to the question like “I
                   am just sitting here trying to figure out this <em>hua-tou</em>.”  Open 
                  your mind, allow great doubt to overwhelm you.  Perform this “lock in” 
                  session daily for three weeks.  After that time the <em>hua-tou</em> will 
                  be firmly implanted in your mind and will be with you all the time, to 
                  greater or lesser degrees depending on what you are doing.</li>
              <li><strong>Let the <em>hua-tou</em> consume you</strong> day and night but push it 
                  back when you have to do things that take concentration in other areas –
                   caring for a child, driving a car, typing an email, etc.  Just because 
                  it’s not at the center focus of attention doesn’t mean it’s not still 
                  working on you.  I liken this to an experience we’ve probably all had – 
                  we lose a key or something else of importance and spend a long time 
                  looking for it without success.  In frustration, we finally give up and 
                  do something else, but a few hours or days later we have a <em>eureka</em> <em>moment</em> and suddenly know where to find it, and there it is.  The question of 
                  where it was had lingered in the back of our minds even though it wasn’t
                   dominant in our attention.  The <em>hua-tou</em> does this too.  Work the <em>hua-tou</em> intensely whenever you are doing something that doesn’t take a great 
                  deal of attention, like washing dishes, walking down the street or along
                   a mountain path, getting dressed, etc. Apply it to whatever you are 
                  doing.  If you find yourself forgetting to attend to it, just bring your
                   mind back to it non-judgmentally.  The amount of effort it takes to 
                  force yourself to do it will lessen as you continue the practice. In a 
                  short time the practice will happen automatically.</li>
              <li><strong>Be merciless!</strong> If you feel the <em>hua-tou</em> practice is not working for you, ask yourself “Who is it who thinks the <em>hua-tou</em> practice is not working?”  Your mind can be your worst enemy with this 
                  practice and can sabotage even the best of intentions.  When it fights 
                  you, turn the <em>hua-tou</em> back onto it.  Be merciless!</li>
              <li><strong>Observe the results of practice. </strong>Notice as you do the 
                  practice how your mind becomes stronger, your attention more keen, your 
                  awareness more expansive.  You will also find that the practice itself 
                  changes, first in subtle ways, and later in more dramatic ways. </li>
              <li><strong>Take the practice seriously, but lightly.</strong>  It should not be a chore or a burden but something to enjoy doing (although perhaps in a somewhat perverse way!) . </li>
              <li><strong>Avoid preconceptions.</strong> Everyone has his or her own experiences
                   to tell about this practice.  Don’t develop expectations of what will 
                  happen for you based on accounts from others.</li>
