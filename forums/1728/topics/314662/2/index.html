              <p>Yes, so those from tantras often need initiations. Tantras are from the å¯†å®— you mentioned.</p>
              <p>Sutras however are not specific to å¯†å®—, they are found in Chinese Mahayana as well. Mantras like Da Bei Zhou and many others are not peculiar to tantras but are found commonly in Chinese Mahayana as well. There are many such sutric mantras. Heart Sutra also has its own mantra.</p>

              <p><br>There are two main schools of Buddhism which are known as Theravada and Mahayana. Thailand, Burma, Laos and Sri Lanka are examples of countries that practise mainly Theravada tradition. While China, Korea, Japan and the tibetan practise the Mahayana tradition. Under the Mahayana tradition, there is a great variety of school. Vajrayana is one of them and It is closely associated with Tibetan Buddhism.</p>
              <p>You can read about the history here: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/schools2.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/buddhistworld/schools2.htm</a></p>
              <p>Mantra, "Man" stands for the mind and "tra" stands for protection. Mantra is a form of mind protection from the afflictive emotion. In Tibetan Buddhism, Chenrezig is used to refer to Avalokitesvara. </p>
              <p>There are differents mantra.There are the six syllable mantra known as Om mani Padme Hung.The Great compassion Mantra is an 82 syllable mantra spoken by Avalokitesvara to the assembly of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, and extolling the merits of chanting mantra.</p>

              <p class="blue_heading">The Meaning of the Mantra <em class="bold_paragraph">Excerpted from <strong>Chenrezig Lord of Love by Bokar Rinpoche</strong> (Chapter One, The Nature of the Deity)</em></p>
              <p class="paragraph">Mantras are a sound manifestation coming from emptiness. They are the authentic sound of emptiness.<br>From the point of view of the absolute truth and of emptiness itself, the mantra does not have any existence. There is neither sound nor mantra. Sounds and mantras, as with all other forms of manifestation, are located in the relative realm that arises from emptiness. In the relative realm, sounds, although devoid of their own entity, have the power to designate, name, and act on the mind. When, for instance, someone tells us "You are a fine person" or "You are very disagreeable," the words "fine" or "disagreeable" are not "things." They are only sounds that are not either "fine" or "disagreeable" in themselves, but simply evoke the thoughts of "fine" and "disagreeable" and produce an effect on the mind. Similarly, in the relative domain mantras are endowed with an infallible power of action.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Mantras are very often the names of Buddhas, bodhisattvas, or deities. For instance, OM MANI PADME HUNG is a way of naming Chenrezig. From an absolute point of view, Chenrezig does not have a name, but he is designated by names in the domain of the relative or literal meaning. These names are the vector of his compassion, grace, and the strength of the wishes he makes for the benefit of beings. In this way the recitation of his name transmits these qualities of his mind. Herein lies the explanation for the beneficial power of his mantra, which is also his name. As we assimilate ourselves to our own name and are at one with it, in the same way, on the relative level, the mantra is identical with the deity. They form a single reality. When one recites the mantra, one receives the grace of the deity; by visualizing the deity, one receives the same grace without any difference.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">The mantra OM MANI PADME HUNG sometimes gives rise to fanciful or mysterious translations. As we have just said, however, this is simply one name of Chenrezig placed between two sacred and traditional syllables, OM and HUNG.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">-OM represents the body of all Buddhas; it is also the beginning of all mantras;<br>-MANI means 'jewel' in Sanskrit;<br>-PADME, the Sanskrit pronunciation, or PEME in Tibetan, means "lotus";<br>-HUNG represents the mind of all Buddhas and often ends mantras;<br>-MANI refers to the jewel that Chenrezig holds in his two central hands and PADME to the lotus he holds in his second left hand. Saying MANI PADME names Chenrezig through his attributes: "the one who holds the jewel and the lotus." "Chenrezig" or "Jewel Lotus" are two names for the same deity.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">When we recite this mantra we are in fact continually repeating the name of Chenrezig. In itself this exercise may look strange. Let us suppose there is a person named Sonam Tsering and that we ceaselessly repeat his name in the manner of a mantra. Sonam Tsering, Sonam Tsering, Sonam Tsering, and so on. This will seem very odd and will certainly be useless. If, on the other hand, the recitation of the mantra OM MANI PADME HUNG has a meaning, it is because this mantra is invested by the grace and power of the mind of Chenrezig who himself gathers the grace and compassion of all the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. In this view, the mantra is endowed with the capacity to purify our mind from the veils that obscure it. The mantra opens the mind to love and compassion and leads it toward awakening.</p>

              <p>It becomes very easy, effortless and sustainable once we realise a different mode of knowing emptied of self and all attachments. That is, one has dropped everything, and experience the immense bliss of complete letting go of 'self'. There are also many varying levels of bliss correlated to various levels of states and insights derived from practice.</p>
              <p>Our moderator Thusness:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">To
              drop the bondage/deep conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another
              way of 'knowing' is possible; an effortless, total sensing and
              experience of wholeness. Next the experiences of the joy, bliss and
              clarity of wholeness. Without the insight into the possiblity and the
              experience of the positive factors, the mind will not release itself
              from holding.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Even open
              pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind
              chatters incessantly. Every what, when, where and why by itself is a
              distancing from start. Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry aka
              'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced
              for the 'willingness' to arise. :)</span></p>

              <p>BTW, we all let go of everything everyday. Even if you are extremely sad or angry, you all have the capability to completely let go everything. So it is not true that it is difficult to let go, it just appears to be so because we do not know a different mode of knowing.</p>
              <p>We do that every night when we sleep. When we sleep, we let go everything gradually until the mind completely shuts off and enters into the dream and dreamless state.</p>
              <p>No insight has been derived because this letting go comes with the loss of awareness. To develope insights there must be both awareness and letting go.</p>

                      sutras. The actual purpose of cultivation is to eradicate our undesirable conduct and to

                      However, many people do not understand this principle and they misinterpret its meaning.
                      Actually, not only those who have renounced to be Buddhist monks or nuns need to
                      cultivate, lay-Buddhists also need to cultivate, if not more diligently. Even those who do
                      not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for
                      monks or nuns alone.</span></strong></td>

              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation?
                  Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I
                  travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was
                  in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the
                  temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you
                  cultivating? I replied, "That’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha
                  teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down!
                  In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel
                  about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds,
                  I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the
                  Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our
                  activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that
                  cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a
                  mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities.
                  Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can
                  afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst
                  of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children,
                  household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their
                  leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they
                  could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they
                  are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our
                  neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all
                  these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our
                  activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may
                  cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife
                  neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to
                  temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If
                  she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be
                  acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to
                  turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then
                  cultivating at the same time. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>There will be progress in our society when we understand
                  the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few
                  decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess
                  the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any
                  place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct
                  ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can
                  only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is
                  very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha
                  every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000a0;"><strong>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and
                  what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it
                  into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know
                  how warm or cold it is.</strong></span></p>

                  physically, but mentally, their minds are not free or empty. As such, does learning and
                  practising Buddhism really pose a problem to our heavy schedules? This is definitely not

                  Cultivating our mind is better than cultivating our moral conduct. Maintaining

                  examining our conduct and eradicating conduct which are undesirable, for example, those

                      and the next it ceases. Now we need to know when these thoughts are arising and ceasing.
                      "To know" here means "awareness". Let me use my hand to illustrate so

                      When I put my hand down then it is "down". Our mind constantly behaves in the

                      thought is dead, it passes away (hand is down). This continuous process of birth and death
                      is called sentient beings. This process of birth and death brings forth boundless
                      sufferings. Sentient being is boundless and therefore suffering is also boundless. When we
                      learn and practise Buddhism it means we are striving to liberate the inner sentient being

                  ever realizing it! If the mind is good, then of course, it is all very well. Such a mind
                  creates a good person; one can ascend to the heavens or one can perform a lot of virtuous
                  deeds. What happens if the mind is evil and becomes defiled? It can drag us to become
                  animals, ghosts and deities, or descend to hell. This is because our mind is not pure, and
                  therefore the world becomes a sea of suffering. This suffering world of ours is called the
                  "Saha World". It means having to endure and is also called the "World of

                  mind is polluted, then we cleanse it with the dew of the Buddha. And when our minds have
                  been purified, then they are the same as those of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In this
                  way, we will progress very quickly in our cultivation.</strong></span></p>

                  It is like watching out for the mouse. Everybody dislike mice because they steal our food
                  or they damage our clothings. An idiom describes this sentiment with the phrase,
                  ‘When the mouse crosses the street everybody goes after it.’ Obviously mice are
                  not welcomed and they have to be dealt with. One method of dealing with it, is the cat. At
                  the sight of a mouse, the cat puts his paws firmly on the ground and fixes its steely eyes
                  on the mouse. On seeing the cat, the mouse trembles with fear, not daring to make even the
                  slightest movement. Treat your mind as if it were a mouse and your awareness as the cat.
                  At every moment observe your mind, in the same way as the cat watching the mouse. The
                  mouse wants to live and hardly has time to think of its own safety, let alone of stealing
                  food. If we can observe our minds, then we will hardly have time enough to treasure our
                  wisdom life, let alone think of committing evil deeds.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>Therefore when we are learning and
                  practising Buddhism, we need to learn to "contemplate the mind". In this way, we
                  will very quickly be able to avoid all evils and do all that are good.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;"><strong>"Avoid all evils; do all that
                  are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". Besides
                  avoiding all evils and doing all that are good, we need to purify our thoughts. When our
                  thoughts have been purified, then the mind is pure. The purpose of learning and practising
                  Buddhism is to purify the human mind. If the minds of everyone in the family is pure, then
                  our home is pure; if the minds of everyone in this society is pure, then our society is
                  pure; if the minds of everyone in the country is pure, then our land is pure; if the
