It follows that not only is there no conflict between genetics and religion (Islam) but in fact religion (Islam) may guide science by adding revelation to some of the traditional scientific approaches... There exist statements in the Qur'an shown centuries later to be valid which support knowledge in the Qur'an having been derived from God."</span></p>

Like many others, Professor Simpson was taken by surprise when he discovered that the Qur'an and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">H</span>adith contain verses related to his specialised field of study. When he met with Sheikh Abdul-Majeed A.Zindani, he insisted on verifying the text presented to him from the Qur'an and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">H</span>adith.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thinking where Mu<span style="text-decoration: underline;">h</span>ammad came from...

And that many of the statements made in there at that time could not be proven, but that modern scientific methods are now in a position to prove what Mu<span style="text-decoration: underline;">h</span>ammad said 1400 years ago."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Professor Kroner is one of the world's most famous geologists, becoming well known among his colleague scientists for his criticisms against the theories of some of the major scientists in his field.

These usernames may even belongs to the same person, appearing in different identities.
              <div>Amitayus48 is just a muslim  under the guise of a buddhist with a specific MOTIVES.</div>
              </div>
              <div>I have been placing these usernames under surveillance for some times.</div>

              <p>I would expect some to wonder how is it possible that a muslim can post write and understand Chinese.</p>
              <p>Don't forget that we have people like Ridhuan Tee, who abandons one's superior Chinese non-muslim identity and culture to adopt an inferior lowly culture  of another racial and religious group.</p>
              <p>Furthermore it it no longer a rarity to see a non-Chinese who can understand Chinese.</p>
              <p>So, it it no surprise at all to me.</p>

              <p>It is also not surprising at all to see a muslim who is familar with the buddhist sutras. I have come a cross a number of muslim / sufis who have "good knowlege" of Buddhism, though their understanding of it is a distorted one by ways of superimposition of Islam / sufism on the Dharma, and manipulation of verses in the buddhist sutra that cannot be superimposed.</p>
              <p>It is part of their enterprise to subsume buddhism under the fold of Islam  under guise of the ecumenical scheme:</p>
              <p>One GOD</p>
              <p>ONE True Religion ( which is Islam), with multiple version</p>
              <p>One Humanity</p>
              <p>Why do these so called moderate muslim sufis want to do this?????</p>
              <p>The answer is THEY KNOW VERY CLEARLY DEEP IN THEIR HEART THAT THERE IS NO WAY ISLAM, EVEN WITH THE HELP OF SUFISM (their so called inner dimension) CAN POSE ANY SERIOUS THREAT TO THE BUDDHA'S DHARMA. TO  CHALLENGE BUDDHISM FROM THE POSITION OF ISLAM (WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM BUDDHISM IN ITS ORIGINALITY) WILL BE AN UPHILL TASK.</p>
              <p>THEREFORE , UNLIKE THE STUPID CHRISTIAN WHO KEEP CHALLENGING BUDDHISM FROM A DIFFERENT POSITION UNSUCESSFULLY, THE MUSLIMS TRY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BUDDHIST TEACHINGS BY SUPERIMPOSING ISLAMIC SUFISM ON BUDDHISM PLUS MANIPULATION  TO DECEIVE THE OTHERS THAT BUDDHA  WAS ACTUALLY A PROPHET WHO BELIEVED IN ALLAH.</p>
              <p>In this way, not only they could make Islam as the final undistorted revelation of buddhism, they can achieve this under the guise of ecumenism, the "peace-loving" people.</p>
              <p>Their One GOD, ONE True Religion ( which is Islam), with multiple version and One Humanity is an indispenable strategic scheme in accomplishing their objective, "a missing pieces in their puzzle" so to speak.</p>

              <p>I wonder if these muslim / sufis are feeling too inferior and ashamed to identify themselves as muslim / sufis in the face of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>In this respect, I actually respect these die-hard people like Almond Cookies, than these hypocrites resorting to dirty lowly tactics.</p>

              <p>If a person need to subscribe to the view that all religions are the same (different versions of one true religion), I don't think he is truely an ecumenical and peace-loving person.</p>
              <p>It is because this means that he is not able to co-exist peacefully with other religions if they are fundamentally DISTINCT.</p>
              <p>I called this extremism, subtle bigotry.</p>
              <p>In this perspective, this so-called "moderate" muslims are no more different from their extreme counterparts who choose to use terror and violence to achieve their mean. the only difference between these two groups is their methods, with tyhe former choose to use the "peaceful" but dirty deceptive tactics.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, the "moderate" extremists are more dangerous. The are like SILENCE-KILLER.</p>

              <p>Does anyone of you remember sometimes ago a forumer by the name of "Chenrezig" mention about the two books written by the Bahai Jamshed Fozdar???</p>
              <p>1) God of Buddha</p>
              <p>2) Buddha Maitreya Amitabha has appeared</p>
              <p>Perhaps, for those who still scratching their heads on my earlier posts, you can read these two books to appreciate to some extent what I had said.</p>

              Because most muslims I know do not share islam with other people.
              
              Was very shocked to see Amitayus48 sharing.
