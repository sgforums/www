              Actually, from the different understandings they express, I am sure Amitayus48, Fugazzi and Realisation are different persons.
              
              First of all realisation (unless you are talking about a different person which I doubt so) does not suscribe to the idea that all religions are one.
              
              Secondly, amitayus is more of a pure land person, but he suscribes to the idea that all religions are one. Perhaps being influenced by Master Chin Kung (though I am not sure to what extend does mck preach the unity of religions, mck is well versed in other religion texts like koran, bhagavad gita and other texts but I am not exactly familiar with his teachings).  Amitayus is certainly not a sufi. If you didn't know, there was a huge debate in our forum in the past on whether mck's preaching of the unity of religions have steered away from the dharma, which I shall digress now because as I said, I am not very familiar with mck's views and whether some of his statements are mere skillful means.
              
              Fugazzi is a non religionist but his understanding is closer to anatta, emphasizes a lot on going beyond conceptual knowledge, reminds me of j krishnamurti. His understanding does not sound close to sufi at all.
              
              I have not read true repuzzan posts so cannot comment on him.

              not have been obtained on the basis of the scientific knowledge
              that was available at the time of the 'writer'... It follows that
              not only is there no conflict between genetics and religion (Islam)
              but in fact religion (Islam) may guide science by adding revelation
              to some of the traditional scientific approaches... There exist
              statements in the Qur'an shown centuries later to be valid which

              basically say that statements made there in many ways are true,
              they can now be confirmed by scientific methods, and in a way, you
              can say that the Qur'an is a simple science text book for the
              simple man. And that many of the statements made in there at that
              time could not be proven, but that modern scientific methods are

According to the Center's analysis of the Koran, the Sira, and the Hadith, only 17% of the Islamic trilogy deals with the words of Allah. The remaining 83% refers to the words and deeds of Mohammed. Of all of the references to "hell" in the trilogy, 6% are for moral failings, while 94% are for the transgression of disagreeing with Mohammed. Statistical analysis of the trilogy revealed that 97% of references to "jihad" relate to war and a mere 3% to the concept of "inner struggle." <br><br>About 67% of the Koran of Mecca deals with punishing unbelievers for merely disagreeing with Mohammed. Over 50% of the Koran of Medina deals with hypocrites and jihad against unbelievers. Nearly 75% of the Sira deals with jihad. About 20% of the Hadith by Bukhari is about jihad. The majority of the doctrine is political and it is all violent.<br><br>In 4% of the cases, women were superior, in 91% of the cases they were inferior and in 5% they were equal. But there is a big catch. The only way that women are equal is after death on Judgment day, when men and women will be judged on how well they followed the Koran and the Sunna. And guess what? The only way to follow the Koran and the Sunna is to obey men. Equality means obeying men</span></p>

              <hr>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">The Surahs divide the Qur’an (Koran), the Islamic Holy scripture, into “chapters”. The Surahs are collections of the different sayings spoken by<a style="color: #a9501b; background-color: transparent;" href="http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/bios/b1muhammadca.htm">Mohammed</a>, believed by Muslims to have been channeled him from Allah who made the original Arabic Qur’an in heaven. Mohammed uttered these sayings over a period of 22 years from the time of his first revelation in a cave on Mt. Hira in 610 A.D. until his death (632 A.D.). Mohammed himself did not write them down, being illiterate,<sup>1</sup> but those that heard him wrote down the sayings on anything available or memorized the sayings. Later, under the Caliphs <a style="color: #a9501b; background-color: transparent;" href="http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/bios/b1bakr_abu.htm">Abu</a> and Ali, copies of the documents were compiled and written down together. Estimates suggest that two-thirds of the Surahs in the Qur’an Mohammed spoke or repeated while living in Mecca and the other one third while living in Medina (after the flight from Mecca)<sup>2</sup>. During these 22 years, Mohammed faced some major changes and these were reflected in the Surahs. Other than a general change of length, the Medinan Surahs being more prolonged and extensive than the Meccan ones, the character of the Surahs also changed. To understand this difference it is vital to understand the situation in his life both in Mecca and then in Medina.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Mohammed, member of the wealthy ruling Quarish tribe, grew up in and around Mecca. During this time, Mecca was a center of pagan worship, with the activity revolving around the Kaaba, the main pagan temple, which the Quarish tribe protected. Mohammed started receiving visions and though at first he told nobody outside his immediate family, after his family urged him, he started telling everyone the “Word of the Lord”. The first Meccan Surahs Mohammed "received" told him to tell others of Allah’s message. In these Surahs, he viewed himself as one who should warn the people with a goal similar to that of the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah<sup>3</sup>. He warned the Meccan citizens to leave their idols and wickedness behind and to follow the one God. During this time in Arabia, there proved a great deal of Jewish and Nestorian Christian influence and though Mohammed never read the Bible, he heard much about the prophets, Jesus and the history of the Jews. He showed respect to “the people of the Book” and to the Bible in the Meccan Surahs. It is interesting to observe that the most dramatic change between the Meccan and Medinan Surahs is concerning the Muslim relationship to Jews and Christians.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">During the years when Mohammed preached in Mecca, he wanted to attract the Jews and Christians of the area to the message he was preaching. He did this by showing the similarities of the other prophets and himself, and praising and showing that the God of Abraham was the God of the Jews, Christians and Muslims. This helped him because, compared to negative reaction of most of the pagan citizens of Mecca when they were told to destroy their sacred idols, the Jews and Christians welcomed the Muslims and some of the so-called “Christians” even converted to Islam and became Mohammed’s closest companions and followers. However, by the time of his flight to Medina, his approach differed and the Medinan Surahs show a different face concerning the Jews and Christians. Predominantly, the Jews and Christians quietly yet firmly rejected his claim of being a prophet<sup>4</sup>. Additionally the change might have been influenced by a tribe of Jews that refused to help Mohammed when an army from Mecca besieged Medina in an attempt to kill “The Prophet”.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">The Medinan Surahs show that though, Mohammed still believed they served the same God, he started pointing out the fundamental differences of the Christian and Jewish beliefs to the God of Allah. For example, read and compare the following three verses:<br>Surah 29:46 (Meccan) And dispute ye not with the People of the Book… but say, "We believe in the Revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; our God and your God is One; and it is to Him we bow." <br>Surah 9.30 (Medinan) The Christians say that the Messiah is the Son of God. That is but a saying with their mouth. They only imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. God's curse be upon them! How they are deluded away from the truth!" <br>Surah 5:73 (Medinan) They are unbelievers who say, "God is the Third of Three...No god is there but One God."</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Most of the Medinan Surahs, when speaking of the Jews, speak negatively about them and how they abandoned “The Book” and the ways of the Lord. Numerous passages warn Muslims to avoid them or not associate with them. Though it claims that Allah had chosen Israel<sup>5</sup>, the Qur’an says that God left them because of their disobedience and now blesses and cares for the Muslims. Even though that was the opinion of Mohammed towards the Jews and Christians, he sanctioned special better treatment towards them than towards other pagan people.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Other than the attitude change towards the “People of the Book”, Mohammed’s visions also altered concerning himself. He starts receiving visions more similar to one like in Surah 33:56 “Allah and His Angels send blessings on the Prophet: O ye who believe! Send ye blessings on him, And salute him With all respect.” Mohammed seems to take on a role of more than just a humble prophet announcing the revelations of Allah to the people. This probably had its origin in his change of position in Medina compared to Mecca. While in Mecca, though part of the ruling tribe, Mohammed was one of the poorest of the tribe and so not considered very special. The Meccan Surahs spoken over that time period reflect him as merely a speaker, prophet and servant of Allah and his Word. When he fled to Medina, he was welcomed by new Muslims living there and many of his followers also came from Mecca. Because it was not a major center of paganism like Mecca, Islamic teaching found a better reception and soon Medina became somewhat Muslim. This elevated Mohammed and he became a prince and ruler in Medina as well as a spokesman for God. Around this time the Surahs contain many more references to him as a more important person, “The Prophet of God”. Also, the number of Muslims started to grow and so most of the Medinan Surahs begin or contain the phrase similar to one of these: Hear ye all true followers of Allah! or Oh ye who believe!</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Another very interesting change is that the only title given to Jesus (every prophet was given special titles) in the Koran is Messiah. No reason is given to this title but it only appears in the Medinan Surahs. “The most plausible explanation is that Muhammad was unaware of the title until he moved to Medina and, as his contacts with Christians and Jews increased, so he came to learn of the unique appellation given to Jesus and, being unaware of its meaning but seeing no reason to reject it, simply adopted it himself and included it in the quran QurŸan [Quran] without any further ado.”<sup>6</sup> “It was very well known that the Christians worshipped al masih al-Masæø[Messiah]. This name is attested in Arabia before Mohammed's time…”<sup>7</sup></p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Because he now is the leader of the Muslim people instead of just the prophet of Allah, his Surahs become much more detailed in how to conduct oneself and laws to control what the Muslims can and cannot do instead of merely asking them to return to righteousness. As already mentioned, he now considers himself the ruler and leader of Islam. By revelation, Allah now gives permission to Mohammed to take as many wives as he wants and special rules apply to associating with him or his possessions.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Though these differences within Koran cause much debate and Muslims use these different sides to support their own views, for example about Christian-Muslim relations, Mohammed made it very clear that contradictions can occur because God sends down newer revelations which improve or replace the older revelations. Surah 2:106 says: “We do not abrogate a verse or let it be forgotten without bringing a better or similar one. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things?” This is very vital to understand, that even though you can clearly find the differences in the Muslim Holy Book, Mohammed predicted and talked of such possibilities and in the opinion of many Muslims this does not change the sanctity or meaning of the Koran.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">Another very vital point to consider is that this essay shows the GENERAL change over time of the Surahs but not all the Surahs follow this pattern. It is noticed that among some of the long Surahs (Medinan), a topic may be mentioned from a Meccan viewpoint and visa versa. For example, one of the Meccan verse speaks of Allah not begetting (a son) (112:3) and a Medinan verse, (Surah 2:62) speaks well of Jews and Christians.</p>
              <p style="font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 1em;">However, though this essay compares the Qur'an and its changes, the Bible very clearly shows that it is the Word of God to man for all generations. Neither God nor His plan for man changes with time. The Holy Book of Islam specifically contridict each other reguarding the nature of Jesus Christ. In the Qur’an, Surah 7:75, it proclaims “Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger…”. Conversely, in John 10:30 Jesus says, “I and my Father [God] are One.” And though the Qur’an agrees with the Injil (New Testament) about Jesus being the Word of God<sup>7</sup>, it doesn’t tell that Jesus is the only way to heaven.<sup>8</sup> John 6:47 says “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has everlasting life.” That is a guarantee spoken by the Almighty God.</p>

              <p>Secondly, amitayus is more of a pure land person, but he suscribes to the idea that all religions are one. Perhaps being influenced by Master Chin Kung (though I am not sure to what extend does mck preach the unity of religions, mck is well versed in other religion texts like koran, bhagavad gita and other texts but I am not exactly familiar with his teachings). Amitayus is certainly not a sufi. If you didn’t know, there was a huge debate in our forum in the past on whether mck’s preaching of the unity of religions have steered away from the dharma, which I shall digress now because as I said, I am not very familiar with mck’s views and whether some of his statements are mere skillful means.</p>
              <p>Fugazzi is a non religionist but his understanding is closer to anatta, emphasizes a lot on going beyond conceptual knowledge, reminds me of j krishnamurti. His understanding does not sound close to sufi at all.</p>

According to the Center's analysis of the Koran, the Sira, and the Hadith, only 17% of the Islamic trilogy deals with the words of Allah. The remaining 83% refers to the words and deeds of Mohammed. Of all of the references to "hell" in the trilogy, 6% are for moral failings, while 94% are for the transgression of disagreeing with Mohammed. Statistical analysis of the trilogy revealed that 97% of references to "jihad" relate to war and a mere 3% to the concept of "inner struggle." <br><br>About 67% of the Koran of Mecca deals with punishing unbelievers for merely disagreeing with Mohammed. Over 50% of the Koran of Medina deals with hypocrites and jihad against unbelievers. Nearly 75% of the Sira deals with jihad. About 20% of the Hadith by Bukhari is about jihad. The majority of the doctrine is political and it is all violent.<br><br>In 4% of the cases, women were superior, in 91% of the cases they were inferior and in 5% they were equal. But there is a big catch. The only way that women are equal is after death on Judgment day, when men and women will be judged on how well they followed the Koran and the Sunna. And guess what? The only way to follow the Koran and the Sunna is to obey men. Equality means obeying men</span></p>

              <p>WWII, I know what you are trying to imply here.</p>
              <p>Rather than defending Buddhism by say that the Japanese
                      buddhists had distorted, corrupted and perverted the original
                      meanings of Buddha's Dharma, in the same way as the muslim
                      distanced Islam (irresponsibly) from the bloodshed and atrocities
                      committed by its followers, <strong>I shall look at the founders of
                      the 3 religions instead.</strong></p>
              <p>Both the Buddha and Jesus had never committed any atrocity in
                      their lives. On this account, we can say that Buddhism and
                      Christianity are Religions of Peace. But, the same cannot be said
                      of Islam. WHY?????</p>
              <p>As we all know, Prophet Muhammad was not just a messenger
                      of allah, he was also deeply involved in the military and politics,
                      so much so that innocent bloods were shed in the conquest of muslim
                      lands. On this account, can Islam still be considered as a Religion
                      of Peace, <strong>given that neither its founder nor its followers
                      had a clean record.</strong></p>

              <p>I am a Muslim. It is unfortunate many of you here lack understanding of Islam and spread misinterpreted thoughts without doing your homework first. You guys simply copy and paste links/articles blindly from the internet but how are you sure they are 100% reliable? Therefore, you are not in the the position to judge Muslims based on your "findings".</p>
              <p>I am a 17 year old Muslim. Probably way younger than all the posters in this forum. However, I respect everyone here regardless of your age/race/religion. And I feel that "respect" is something most of you here lack. Even though I was born a Muslim, I did not simply perform Islamic rituals without asking myself "Why am I doing this and this etc...". Unfortunately, this is not the case for all the Muslims here as they merely perform the religious rituals because their parents ask them to do so. They do not know why they are doing it thus their faith will gradually weaken and do not know much about their own faith. Thus, let me begin by explaining to you guys what is Islam.</p>

              <p>I am a 17 year old Muslim. Probably way younger than all the
                  posters in this forum. However, I respect everyone here regardless
                  of your age/race/religion. And I feel that "respect" is something
                  most of you here lack. Even though I was born a Muslim, I did not
                  simply perform Islamic rituals without asking myself "Why am I
                  doing this and this etc...". Unfortunately, this is not the case
                  for all the Muslims here as they merely perform the religious
                  rituals because their parents ask them to do so. They do not know
                  why they are doing it thus their faith will gradually weaken and do
                  not know much about their own faith. Thus, let me begin by
                  explaining to you guys what is Islam.</p>

              <p>The graciousness of adherents of any religion is also the non imposition, especially violent ones, of one's own belief onto others, especially non believers, unfortunately, this has not been enforced and even abused in the name of religion. It is most unfortunate that peoples and nations of monetheistic beliefs have done that.</p>
              <p>This posting has been made in regard to the different aspects of a religion, original thread starter. on one hand, one aspect of a religion, and I counter balanced the interpretation by some, violent acts committed by some in the name of religion. The different facets of a belief practised by many.Also the  the acceptance  of a belief, lock, stock and barrel.</p>
              <p>I do not understand the intentions of the thread starter as the person disappeared after the first post.</p>
              <p>If a non violability of challenging of basic tenets,aspects, indoctrination and  personal conduct and practice, then a meaningful discussion will not take place.  You should also understand that others do not hold or are obliged to hold the same views.Calling non believers names does'nt help, does it? You could constructively rebut point but point if there are indeed any misrepresentations or falsehoods wrongly  percieved  by others. Please put us to shame our ignorance. </p>
              <p>A good religion will have lofty aspirations of love and compassion even to those not of the same creed or belief. It is therefore very important for everybody to have these two important values, also something I feel everybody should capable of. We always make excuses for not being so, being selfish, unkind, and cruel but religion should never be used to explain away bad acts.</p>
              <p>I highly value compassion and loving as aspirations, because it is also a vehicle of practice.I hope to aim to end my suffering,  also hope the same for others. Personally, I judge this an effective measure of a good practitioner of any good religion, a good person. </p>
              <p>I have seen gracious and dignified Islam practised here, and this is to be much applauded. There also seems to be confusion in communal and religious  identity  perception held by others of different faiths  . However, there seemed to be a lot of angry "Muslims" elsewhere, this is where tolerance and peace are seen not to be practised. But again,there are a lot unhappy people around.  .</p>
