              years ago there was a NY Times Magazine article, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/magazine/26zen-t.html?_r=0"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Enlightenment Therapy</span></a>.”
              It created a bit of a stir in my circles. I wrote about it at the time, and as
              the subject of enlightenment or awakening in Zen has popped up in my circles
              recently, I thought I’d revisit what I wrote about it at the time, very
              slightly tweaked.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 150%;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%;">The article was pretty interesting, you might
              want to read it. The author Chip Brown seems to have had a long time interest
              in matters of the mind. It is telling, I find, that his undergraduate studies
              included both literature and biochemistry and one of his books explores
              “medicine and the metaphysics of healing.” Through a story about the personal
              spiritual psychological crisis of a Western Zen Buddhist priest, Lou Nordstrom,
              Brown explores the complexities brought forward by the conversation between
              Western psychotherapy and Zen Buddhism, attempting to illuminate the
              differences and commonalities.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">At the listserv one writer thought the text
              verbose, and perhaps the essay is a tad on the flowery side. I have to say I
              liked it. Perhaps because I like to think I write in a similar manner. At the
              same time there were points he reported I felt less than helpful. For instance
              Brown seems to think the metaphor of light is a Zen Buddhist thing, which is
              not particularly so in the circles in which I move, and certainly not as a
              significant part of the literature. I consider this important as I felt Brown
              implies this is an indicator of something not completely whole in the Zen way.
              I don’t think Zen is completely whole, but not for that reason…</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Rather more importantly there are deeper issues
              that I think Brown accurately describes. However these are in fact errors on
              the Zen way, not, in my opinion, errors of the Zen way. Many of the
              commentators at the Zen teacher’s chat thought the alleged Zen teacher advice
              to ignore emotions was a misunderstanding. Perhaps. But I know it happens, as
              well.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Robert Buswell wrote a beautiful book about
              modern Zen in Korea. He recounts chilling examples of people who leave their
              families to become monks, and in quest of “not being attached,” when they hear
              family members are coming to the monastery to which they belong, they flee to
              another. In my own experience, I’ve encountered over the years any number of
              people who use the peculiar disciplines of Zen, its commitments to long periods
              of meditation as convenient ways to avoid dealing with issues at home.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Brown cites the psychoanalyst in the story,
              Jeffrey Rubin, as having studied Buddhism (there is an extensive and constantly
              growing literature of the Buddhist and psychoanalytic encounter. My favorite
              writer on this subject especially as it touches upon Zen is Barry Magid, to
              whom I point any curious reader), and becoming aware somewhere along the line
              that the idea enlightenment is “complete freedom from self-deception” was an
              error. No shit. If one truly throws herself into the great way she becomes
              uncomfortably aware that the complex that may be described as self-deception,
              or let’s not guild the lilly as self-deception is simply a long way of saying
              self, but: this self is itself the manifestation of awakening. This self is
              awakening.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Missing this is missing the Zen enterprise. The
              practice is indeed often described as crushing ego, but when one does that one
              has missed the boat. The ego is not false, but rather is a construct with no
              abiding substance. The enterprise is seeing through ego not getting rid of it.
              And those Zen teachers who instead of guiding their students to see through
              instead do what they can to step on the ego are, all too common, and to my
              understanding, all too wrong.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And people who walk this way end up in Lou
              Nordstrom’s situation. Actually even if they don’t they end up with the issues.
              We are completely subject to the vicissitudes of our lives. Zen is not an
              escape hatch from this. This is the field of enlightenment. There is no escape
              from it. It is liberation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Now the psychoanalytic enterprise has enormous
              value. I really believe that. The gift it brings to the spiritual disciplines
              is paying attention to the ordinary messiness, and addressing the specific
              hurts of our lives. Now I also think it too often spends too much time on this
              part of the project, perhaps too easily caught up in the minutia of personal
              history, spinning for too long in the eddies of mind. And, so, it too, needs
              correctives. (Not to mention speaking of psychotherapy as if it were one thing
              is itself a mistake… Some therapeutic systems are very intriguing to me as a
              Zen practitioner. And truthfully, some are extreme foolishness, whether
              speaking as a Zen practitioner, or just as someone who hopes for healing for
              folk in this world of hurt…)</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And the gift much of Zen discipline brings to
              the table is paying attention to the moment itself. Without judgment. Just
              presence itself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Many people in my experience need both
              disciplines on their way to wholeness. Maybe most. So, Lou Nordstrom’s dilemma
              is most people’s, at least here in the West, at least as I’ve observed it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">There are minor errors in the essay, the fiancée
              was not orthodox Jewish, just Jewish. And she went on to not become the first
              woman to receive Dharma transmission, but the first woman in America to receive
              Dharma transmission in an ‘orthodox” Japanese Rinzai lineage. There are many
              women with many different teaching credentials in other lineages. In fact it
              appears to me about half of Western Zen teachers are women.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But back to the principal point, at least as I
              see it. Lou Nordstrom reports that he was taught by one of his teachers, and he
              quoted exactly, “What you need to do, Lou, is put aside all human feelings.”
              Now at the teacher’s list several objected, suggesting maybe he had been so
              emotionally overwrought at the time the teacher was suggesting a corrective. I
              hope I’ve adequately pointed out how this need not be so, it could easily have
              been said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And so I have no problem accepting it was said.
              The problem is that it isn’t what I learned in Zen. And it isn’t, by God, what
              I teach in Zen. And most to the point, it isn’t true and it isn’t helpful.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We who wish to walk a path of authenticity need
              to see the world and ourselves clearly. The substance of this clear seeing is
              that on the one hand the world of separation is quite real. You and I are
              indeed different, and each of us is different from the stars and rocks and
              fleas and viruses. Although this diferentness is part of a flow of events. We
              are for all practical matters, simply moments, bubbles in a flow of events.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">And, at the very same time, we are one. Or, the
              generally preferred metaphor in my circles is that we are empty, that is we
              lack any special substance in that differentiation. It is just differentiation.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">We are, as we are, boundless, open, free. We
              need to see both things.<br> We get both and we get something of that joy and liberation that has been
              promised. Although it is a liberation that includes hurt, fully. All the wounds
              of our history do not go away. They are the stuff of our liberation. They are
              it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The deal is found in the dynamic. Now this. Now
              that. Not this. Not that. Sometimes we lead. Sometimes we follow.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">But we cannot avoid the dance.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Georgia, serif;">No sitting it out. That’s the deal.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 150%;">That’s Zen. And that’s Zen’s enlightenment.</span></p>
