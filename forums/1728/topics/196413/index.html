In other words have the 'confidence'. A great read on this will be <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=99865" rel="nofollow">Angulimala</a> (I love especially the 5th and 6th paragraph), who killed 999 persons and after meeting the Buddha, he entered the Sangha and attained enlightenment; Arhantship.</div>

However by cultivating Buddhism and repenting one's past deeds one can in fact lighten it. (in chinese its called Zhong4 Bao4 Qing1 Shou4) Just like even in court the sentence can be lightened due to situations. Same for the case of Angulimala. He suffered some karmic consequences but that is nothing compared to if he didn't met the Buddha. Then he would really be in great trouble karmically.</div>
