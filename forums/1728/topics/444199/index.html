              <h3 style="font-size: 11.5pt; color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc;">Tape Recorded and Transcribed by Upasaka Jyh Ching How,<br>Revised by Dr. Lin<br>Based on the above Chinese Transcript, Written in English by Dr. Lin</h3>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">The topic is "Aspects of Impermanence"; that means we are going to investigate the various aspects of the concept of Impermanence as taught in Buddhism. Impermanence is a fundamental concept in Buddhist teachings. There was a Tibetan patriarch by the name of Milarepa, and he used to say that Impermanence is the gate through which to enter Dharma. His meaning in saying so should have been that, in order to understand Buddhist teachings thoroughly, one needs to have, first of all, a profound appreciation of the significance of Impermanence, and only then could one significantly engage in the practice of Dharma. We will discuss this topic in the sequential order of "Views, Practices, Activities, and then Fruits." First, let's consider Impermanence as views. When we talk about this concept of Impermanence I want to bring up first another even more fundamental concept, namely, Dharma basically is teaching us to see what the real situations are. Basically, Dharma is teaching us that, in order to solve problems, one needs to first recognize what the real situations are. This point is essentially different from authoritarian teachings that demand submissive conformity. In cases of authoritarian doctrines, when the theories are invalid or submission is forced upon, all sorts of problems would ensue. The truthful nature of Dharma is such that, it emphasizes that, for something to be correct, we need to let all examine what the real situations are. Therefore, in Buddhism, even though on the one hand we emphasize following the footsteps of Buddha, and yet on the other hand it also teaches that one should rely on the universal teachings instead of relying on persons. In other words, it is a matter of truth. When people have different views what do we rely on? We rely on recognizing the real situation, and this is the goal for us to follow.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Once the above principle is understood, then when we talk about Impermanence the basic meaning is not to urge you that you always need to look at things from the point of view of Impermanence. For example, right now things are fine in your life but Buddhism purposely wants you to think ahead of the sufferings of birth, senility, illness and death. Basically it is not like this at all. The real significance is only to point out to all what the reality of life and world is. In this sense, when we talk about Impermanence, we are just reminding people that all things will change, sooner or later. What then would be the significance of pointing this out? It is to remind people that, whatever you thought of or your views are, could at any moment become not in conformity with the real situations. Hence, it is only to remind one that one needs to remain constantly alert in realizing that reality could possibly not stay the same as one thinks it to be. Therefore, one needs to think of more possibilities to adjust to the possible changes. Basically the significance of pointing out Impermanence should be only like this.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Nevertheless, when we talk about Impermanence in Buddhist discourses we tend to lean toward presenting it as an antidotal concept. For example, when someone is sick, then medications or treatments are given to help cure the illness. When someone is in poor health, then he or she is urged to do exercises or go on special diet so as to remedy the situation. Similarly, in Buddhism when we talk about Impermanence we tend to offer it as a remedial concept to help cure our problems. This is because each and every one of us has more or less sorrows, worries, prejudices, attachments, insistence, and in addition, among people there are many kinds of conflicts. How to solve all such problems? According to Buddhist teachings the root of the problems lies in each one's grasping to his or her views, and the individual views vary and are mostly based on self-centered interests. Such variations are due to different perspectives or selfish greed. Consequently, there are many problems. Aiming at curing such unhealthy states of human affairs and intending to free people from such prejudicial states, Impermanence is taught as a remedy. People are reminded that such prejudicial and selfish practices would not prevail, nor would they bring about lasting peace and prosperity. The reasons being, if you act like that and others do the same, then conflict and fighting are inevitable. As a result, whenever something comes up, people just fight but could not solve the problems. Instead, people should open their minds to realize that the problems may be resolved in many possible ways, and the solution does not lie in how any particular one could have the lion's share, but in joint and impartial sharing of interests. People should share the common understanding that we all have similar needs, and only when we endeavor toward a harmonious solution will the result be good for all of us in the long run. Nevertheless, people are usually under the fixation of current interests to the extent that any lessening of their grasping would seem impossible. Therefore, the teachings need to point out that, whatever you thought to be graspable is in reality ungraspable. Even your dear life could not be grasped for sure. One would not even know when anything would happen! Furthermore, the important point here is that, Impermanence is taught not as a scare tactic but a matter of fact. In daily news we noticed that some events happened here and some incidents occurred there; even at the very instant right before those occurrences how could we know that things are going to turn out like that? When such matters would fall upon us, we had no ideas. Among our friends and relatives, now and then this one encountered this kind of problem and that one encountered that sort of difficulty. Indeed, the real situation is that, no matter how much you hoped or prayed for, there is no guarantee at all; at any minute things could go wrong!</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">The only thing that would guarantee that we all would have peace and happiness is the clear understanding that only when all are living in relationships that are mutually supportive and considerate can benefits be assured. Nevertheless, this is something in theory. In daily life changes are always slow to take place, and one would return to one's old patterns of haggling and fighting. What should we do under such circumstances? What we had discussed so far are only theoretical views. We had learned that when Dharma teaches us about Impermanence the point is for us to look at real situations, instead of to remain circling within the sphere of our wishful planning. Simply look back three years and you would realize that many forethoughts then were completely mistaken. Once we had learned the concept of Impermanence, we could use it as an antidote to release our habitual and variegated grasping. Each one of us has certain prejudices and partialities that are results of grasping, and knowing Impermanence could help free us from prejudices and partialities. As I talked about all this in theory, it might sound easy. Later as soon as you step out this hall, you would probably forget about all this talk because in your daily life you have your interests and views that you would not relinquish. So, how could one manage for the notion of Impermanence to gradually imbue one's mind to the extent that when some things come up one would really handle it from the point of view of Impermanence? In other words, you would then be capable of handling matters in a more realistic manner. How could one cultivate this? Some would say that one need to think often about how much sentient beings are suffering, and how ephemeral human lives are, etc. Such thoughts are indeed helpful; nevertheless, people are forgetful. Even matters that caused much suffering, as soon as they are over, people would soon forget much about them. Therefore, one needs to adopt some practices to cultivate one's sense and appreciation of Impermanence.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Many years ago I designed a very good practice that I have been doing since then. It is to keep a " Record of Impermanence. " Whenever we talked about Impermanence it was just a very abstract concept. Even though daily on television and in newspapers there are reports of many incidents and many sudden deaths, since we had no acquaintance with those people, to us they are merely words or images, and hence the impressions could not be profound. Now in keeping a "Record of Impermanence" I began to put down the names or descriptions of all deceased persons that I had actually met, even though it was just a brief encounter. That night, after I began to do this, as I was lying down to sleep suddenly I felt that death would come to my turn. When I did not feel that death was so real, it used to be felt like it was only others' matter and no thought ever occurred to me that death would also come my way. And then another thought arose, that all would have to be given up upon death. If one is not used to this reality, how difficult would it be for one to face it upon death, especially considering the fact that it will not be up to the dying one to decide. There was an inspirational occurrence related to this practice. That night, after I had put down as many names of deceased ones as I could remember, I placed the notebook in front of the statue of Green Tara, a transformation of Guan Yin, on my altar, and then I lit an incense stick to pray for the deceased. The next morning I found the whole incense stick burned but unbroken, and furthermore, it wound toward the right hand of Green Tara that is in the gesture of giving salvation to sentient beings. The burned incense stick remained so for days. I wrote a report on this practice and the inspirational event with a photo attached there to show it to people, with the hope that people would realize that this is a helpful and effective practice that could enable one to realize that Impermanence is as close to one as the breathing in and out. A few years later, a Buddhist of Chinese descent in Indonesia downloaded this report from our website, www.yogichen.org, and read it on his computer screen. Right then he suddenly smelled sandalwood incense even though none was burned nearby. He was moved by this inspirational experience to have translated the report into Indonesian. This Indonesian version is also posted at our website now. I hope that this inspirational incident would also help you realize that this practice is really a significant one.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Besides the method mentioned above another way to realize Impermanence is to become acquainted with death. Strictly speaking, Impermanence does not apply only to death, but to us humans life and death is the matter of greatest concern, hence realizing death could imbue the alertness of Impermanence into our daily life. Since I live near a cemetery I used to take a walk there while chanting the holy name of Amitabha Buddha. In America cemeteries are as beautiful as parks. While strolling there I would go from tomb to tomb to take a closer look at the tombstones. What would be the benefit of so doing? Usually when I came out from the cemetery after about forty-minute stroll, I would feel much lighter inside. Why was it like this? Because usually we are constantly preoccupied with personal worries, just as the Chinese proverb goes, "Every family has a Sutra that is difficult to recite," and it is also seemingly endless. Nevertheless, when you read the tombstones, "Born on such and such a day, month and year, Died on such and such a day, month and year," you realize that so many matters in life that seemed so important, in the end would just vanish into void, and only these two lines would remain for some indefinite time. Sometimes you would see only one date on a tombstone, it could signify a stillbirth or a life lasted no more than a day. Even though there were only two lines, many stories could be inferred from them. After I strolled there daily for over four months, I wrote my reflections and sentiments into poems and entitled them "Learning from the Dead." These poems are all related to Impermanence, and I hope that you would read them. They are also posted at our website.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Whenever you have the opportunity to visit a cemetery, on the one hand you should recite the holy name of Amitabha Buddha or Guan Yin so as to establish Dharma connection for the deceased there, and on the other hand you should read some tombstones there, and it would be helpful to you. You would realize that so many things that you used to deem as of great importance are indeed of no consequences. As one looks back at life from the juncture of life and death it would be easier to attain certain awakening; otherwise, one would tend to haggle all the time over minor matters. If all your life is spent over minor matters, what would be the significance of such a life? It does not make much sense. If you could reflect on life as if from the juncture of life and death, then it would become possible for you to try not to waste this life; how much time is still left, no one knows. The tiny bit of remaining time, if you could use it to accomplish a few things that is beneficial to others and yourself, then this life could become meaningful. Otherwise, it will be just eating and sleeping, and there would be no peace and happiness inside.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Some people would seem to be having no problems on the surface but are actually suffering from chronic depression because they could not find meaning for life and a goal for sincere efforts. If we could realize that all of us are about the same in that we all have many worries and much suffering, and then look at things with such understanding and attempt to find solutions, then the subsequent lives would be meaningful and not wasted. The greatness of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas lies in their teaching us a road to liberation from sufferings and worries. Following such a path we would be able to help sentient beings to some extent, attain peace and happiness of mind, and help others to attain the same.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Between practicing Buddhist teachings and engaging in usual charitable services there is a fundamental and distant difference. Cultivating oneself to become a good person through charitable services is of course superb; nevertheless, there is no end to such services because new problems would keep arising. Even if one could provide for and meet all worldly needs of others, that would still be no guarantee for their happiness. No matter how hard you have tried, what could be attained would remain very limited. And yet, if you comprehended the Buddhist teachings and practiced accordingly, then you would gradually attain peace of mind, and feel the spiritual strength that naturally arises from an open mind. Furthermore, then you could teach others about the Dharma and its practices, and thereby gradually help others to find peace and spiritual strength. Even more important than these is that, after long-term devotion and sincere practice one would then realize the reality of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; it is not just a system of theories or teachings based on memorized theories. Gradually one would comprehend that Impermanence is a fundamental concept that does not mean that, since nothing can be grasped so we can act in whatever way that we like. The correct meaning is that, as one realized there is nothing that is graspable, and hence ceased grasping, then one would be liberated from the preoccupation with one's self. Ordinarily we are constantly grasping on many tiny things; when one could stop grasping one would gradually experience the purity of mind. Just as a while back before this talk started the assembly were chanting Amitabha in a state of purity, when such purity grows deep and strong it would be possible to return to limitless oneness. In other words, in our ordinary experiences what we understand through our sensual organs are full of distinctions, and so we make and are used to distinctions of countries, families and individuals. Nevertheless, when one's mind has been thoroughly purified through Dharma practices one would then realize that all such distinctions were consequences of grasping and attachment. When grasping had ceased one would experience a state that is indescribable and limitless. Such a limitless state is not a void. How do we know this? For advanced practitioners now and then it is possible to know about matters that happened in distant past or will happen in the future. This shows transcendence over Time, as we usually understood it. Sometimes when people encountered difficulties of all sorts they would ask advanced practitioners to help through prayers, granting of blessings, and other Dharma activities to generate merits. Such blessings would work even though the recipients were total strangers in distant places. This shows transcendence over Space, as we usually understood it. In life there are many matters that have no satisfactory solutions. Illness in the hands of physicians need not be cured, and could turn worse. When one is at the juncture of, as a Chinese proverb goes, "Calling Heaven without response and calling Earth without effects" prayers could help. For example, when people encounter the presence of ghosts, how could one solve such a problem? The fundamental solution to such problems is to deliver such beings from Samsara to Buddha's Pureland through Dharma practices. Then the problem would be no more. Ghosts are also in suffering, and as long as such suffering found no relief they tried to get human beings to help; that is why they bother people. Why is it that such problems will be resolved only when merits are accumulated on their behalves? That is because only what Dharma taught can ultimately solve such fundamental problems that we had no idea of how to handle. Do not think that what Dharma could help is only limited to problems of ghosts. Some people were in intensive care units, and their friends or relatives who knew me would contact me and asked me to pray for them. Even though they were total strangers to me, all I needed were their names and a brief description of their problems, and then the prayers would yield immediate help that they could sense on their side, even though they were on another continent. Thus, they would spread the information to their friends and relatives, and then when they had other problems, they would call me for help through prayers again. This demonstrated that when Dharma practice is well done the limitless oneness realized is not an ineffectual void, but instead a state of complete freedom from artificial concepts such that the strength of prayer would render help, beyond spatial and temporal limits, to others. Such help is not due to the power of any individual human being but expressions of transcendental powers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. When praying for the benefit of others with a pure mind such a function would arise. Any one could do this; Dharma is truth, and hence no one could have monopoly over it. One just needs to engage in Dharma practices for long time with pure mind, free from any considerations and regardless of human relationships, but just pray for all equally, then gradually the effects will become obvious.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Next we will talk about Activities, i.e., after we had trained ourselves in the practices mentioned above how to apply Impermanence in daily life activities so that the actions and inaction are in congruence with the teachings on Impermanence. For example, before I came to give this talk, I did not prepare a transcript. A few months earlier they asked me to offer a few topics for my coming talks in Malaysia, so I thought about it and offered a few. Do you think that I could still remember what I wanted to say then? But then, for such an important matter, why didn't I prepare a lecture in writing? This is because I am practicing Impermanence in all my activities. Any moment I am ready to go and face the situation as I am, without carrying a backpack. To let go of grasping, one need to let go of theories as well. I just tell you what is in my mind, no need to arrange some kind of sayings. This is how I live. The words you are listening to are pouring out naturally from my mind; besides these there is no other thoughts or planning. The framework of "Views, Practices, Activities, and then Fruits" for this talk came to my mind after dinner tonight while I was in the restroom of the restaurant. For one who is really living in accordance with Dharma a Dharma talk is just an outpouring of what one really knows and actually does. This is applying Impermanence in daily life. Of course, it is not true that everyone can do like this at once. Nevertheless, you could dwell on this and consider how to apply Impermanence in your daily life. For example, before you left home you were thinking about bring this and bring that with you, but once you were outside you then realized that you had forgotten to bring this or that. Similarly, when you die it could very well like this. Hence, you need to be ready to be without anything. When nothing could indeed be brought along, what are you preparing?</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">To prepare for the juncture of life and death the only things that are helpful are Dharma practices such as chanting Buddha's name and Dharma services done in our daily life now. When you had done these things in your life then at the time of death you would feel much relaxed. Key to Dharma practices is purity of mind. Bodhicitta is most important. Bodhicitta, in a few words, is to wish all sentient beings to attain full enlightenment sooner. To advance on the path to enlightenment one's intentions should stem from Bodhicitta at all times. One should not constantly limit one's intentions around a small circle of matters such as, I wish my son to be so and so, I wish my daughter to be such and such, etc. When you think of all sentient beings, all these relatives or friends are naturally included, and even you yourself is included. You should realize that all sentient beings include those you dislike, or harmed by you, or imperceptible to your senses, and are of all varieties. You regard them with the understanding that all are basically the same, as sentient beings with sorrows and in suffering, and that all wish to escape suffering and attain lasting happiness. From such a perspective you wish them full enlightenment and ultimate liberation from suffering. Such a wish goes beyond worldly wishes that might aim at the resolution of certain problems but could not prevent them from recurring or other problems from forthcoming. Furthermore, we wish all to attain full enlightenment sooner. "Sooner" is where our efforts in Dharma practices and services apply to. We do not stop at merely wishing full enlightenment to all beings; instead we make all efforts with the hope that thereby sentient beings would reach full enlightenment sooner. Therefore, whatever helps sentient beings need in making progress in Dharma we would try to provide at our best. Consequently, with Bodhicitta we have a goal in life to live for. If you can persevere in Dharma practices and services with a pure mind and solid activities, gradually you will experience the benefits. You would no longer be bothered by trivial matters and unable to escape from sorrowful worries. You would gradually realize that, as life goes on, sooner or later each and every one would run into some difficulties. When someone encounters problems, the only ones that could really help out are those that did not in the first place contribute to those entanglements in worldly haggling. Only those that had transcended worldly entanglements could give guidance and inspire the suffering ones, and render substantial help through prayers. Therefore, when you devote yourself to Dharma practices and services you are on the path of true love for all beings that would have the opportunity to run into contact with you.</p>
              <p style="color: #993300; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; background-color: #ffffcc;">Finally, what would be the Fruits of Impermanence? Phenomena indeed are constantly evolving and could not be grasped as absolutely substantial. Seeing this, there are no real problems. Comprehending Impermanence thoroughly, life and death are also very natural. Just as a river is constantly flowing, which drop are you going to grasp? Each one of us is like a drip or a grain of sand in the river flow, what do you want to grasp? It is just a flowing; where are the problems? Conforming to Impermanence thoroughly in mind and action, the fruit attained is liberation. Right now you are grasping to this, grasping to that, grasping to something in all matters, and hence you encounter problems in all matters. This is unsatisfactory, that is also unsatisfactory; this I dislike, that I could not be satisfied. But if you could enlarge your views and open your mind, then you would feel that this is fine and that is also fine. To others there are all sorts of problems, but to one that finds them not objectionable, there are simply no problems.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">The topic is "Aspects of Impermanence"; that means we are going to investigate the various aspects of the concept of Impermanence as taught in Buddhism. Impermanence is a fundamental concept in Buddhist teachings. There was a Tibetan patriarch by the name of Milarepa, and he used to say that Impermanence is the gate through which to enter Dharma. His meaning in saying so should have been that, in order to understand Buddhist teachings thoroughly, one needs to have, first of all, a profound appreciation of the significance of Impermanence, and only then could one significantly engage in the practice of Dharma. We will discuss this topic in the sequential order of "Views, Practices, Activities, and then Fruits." First, let's consider Impermanence as views. When we talk about this concept of Impermanence I want to bring up first another even more fundamental concept, namely, Dharma basically is teaching us to see what the real situations are. Basically, Dharma is teaching us that, in order to solve problems, one needs to first recognize what the real situations are. This point is essentially different from authoritarian teachings that demand submissive conformity. In cases of authoritarian doctrines, when the theories are invalid or submission is forced upon, all sorts of problems would ensue. The truthful nature of Dharma is such that, it emphasizes that, for something to be correct, we need to let all examine what the real situations are. Therefore, in Buddhism, even though on the one hand we emphasize following the footsteps of Buddha, and yet on the other hand it also teaches that one should rely on the universal teachings instead of relying on persons. In other words, it is a matter of truth. When people have different views what do we rely on? We rely on recognizing the real situation, and this is the goal for us to follow.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Once the above principle is understood, then when we talk about Impermanence the basic meaning is not to urge you that you always need to look at things from the point of view of Impermanence. For example, right now things are fine in your life but Buddhism purposely wants you to think ahead of the sufferings of birth, senility, illness and death. Basically it is not like this at all. The real significance is only to point out to all what the reality of life and world is. In this sense, when we talk about Impermanence, we are just reminding people that all things will change, sooner or later. What then would be the significance of pointing this out? It is to remind people that, whatever you thought of or your views are, could at any moment become not in conformity with the real situations. Hence, it is only to remind one that one needs to remain constantly alert in realizing that reality could possibly not stay the same as one thinks it to be. Therefore, one needs to think of more possibilities to adjust to the possible changes. Basically the significance of pointing out Impermanence should be only like this.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Nevertheless, when we talk about Impermanence in Buddhist discourses we tend to lean toward presenting it as an antidotal concept. For example, when someone is sick, then medications or treatments are given to help cure the illness. When someone is in poor health, then he or she is urged to do exercises or go on special diet so as to remedy the situation. Similarly, in Buddhism when we talk about Impermanence we tend to offer it as a remedial concept to help cure our problems. This is because each and every one of us has more or less sorrows, worries, prejudices, attachments, insistence, and in addition, among people there are many kinds of conflicts. How to solve all such problems? According to Buddhist teachings the root of the problems lies in each one's grasping to his or her views, and the individual views vary and are mostly based on self-centered interests. Such variations are due to different perspectives or selfish greed. Consequently, there are many problems. Aiming at curing such unhealthy states of human affairs and intending to free people from such prejudicial states, Impermanence is taught as a remedy. People are reminded that such prejudicial and selfish practices would not prevail, nor would they bring about lasting peace and prosperity. The reasons being, if you act like that and others do the same, then conflict and fighting are inevitable. As a result, whenever something comes up, people just fight but could not solve the problems. Instead, people should open their minds to realize that the problems may be resolved in many possible ways, and the solution does not lie in how any particular one could have the lion's share, but in joint and impartial sharing of interests. People should share the common understanding that we all have similar needs, and only when we endeavor toward a harmonious solution will the result be good for all of us in the long run. Nevertheless, people are usually under the fixation of current interests to the extent that any lessening of their grasping would seem impossible. Therefore, the teachings need to point out that, whatever you thought to be graspable is in reality ungraspable. Even your dear life could not be grasped for sure. One would not even know when anything would happen! Furthermore, the important point here is that, Impermanence is taught not as a scare tactic but a matter of fact. In daily news we noticed that some events happened here and some incidents occurred there; even at the very instant right before those occurrences how could we know that things are going to turn out like that? When such matters would fall upon us, we had no ideas. Among our friends and relatives, now and then this one encountered this kind of problem and that one encountered that sort of difficulty. Indeed, the real situation is that, no matter how much you hoped or prayed for, there is no guarantee at all; at any minute things could go wrong!</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">The only thing that would guarantee that we all would have peace and happiness is the clear understanding that only when all are living in relationships that are mutually supportive and considerate can benefits be assured. Nevertheless, this is something in theory. In daily life changes are always slow to take place, and one would return to one's old patterns of haggling and fighting. What should we do under such circumstances? What we had discussed so far are only theoretical views. We had learned that when Dharma teaches us about Impermanence the point is for us to look at real situations, instead of to remain circling within the sphere of our wishful planning. Simply look back three years and you would realize that many forethoughts then were completely mistaken. Once we had learned the concept of Impermanence, we could use it as an antidote to release our habitual and variegated grasping. Each one of us has certain prejudices and partialities that are results of grasping, and knowing Impermanence could help free us from prejudices and partialities. As I talked about all this in theory, it might sound easy. Later as soon as you step out this hall, you would probably forget about all this talk because in your daily life you have your interests and views that you would not relinquish. So, how could one manage for the notion of Impermanence to gradually imbue one's mind to the extent that when some things come up one would really handle it from the point of view of Impermanence? In other words, you would then be capable of handling matters in a more realistic manner. How could one cultivate this? Some would say that one need to think often about how much sentient beings are suffering, and how ephemeral human lives are, etc. Such thoughts are indeed helpful; nevertheless, people are forgetful. Even matters that caused much suffering, as soon as they are over, people would soon forget much about them. Therefore, one needs to adopt some practices to cultivate one's sense and appreciation of Impermanence.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Many years ago I designed a very good practice that I have been doing since then. It is to keep a " Record of Impermanence. " Whenever we talked about Impermanence it was just a very abstract concept. Even though daily on television and in newspapers there are reports of many incidents and many sudden deaths, since we had no acquaintance with those people, to us they are merely words or images, and hence the impressions could not be profound. Now in keeping a "Record of Impermanence" I began to put down the names or descriptions of all deceased persons that I had actually met, even though it was just a brief encounter. That night, after I began to do this, as I was lying down to sleep suddenly I felt that death would come to my turn. When I did not feel that death was so real, it used to be felt like it was only others' matter and no thought ever occurred to me that death would also come my way. And then another thought arose, that all would have to be given up upon death. If one is not used to this reality, how difficult would it be for one to face it upon death, especially considering the fact that it will not be up to the dying one to decide. There was an inspirational occurrence related to this practice. That night, after I had put down as many names of deceased ones as I could remember, I placed the notebook in front of the statue of Green Tara, a transformation of Guan Yin, on my altar, and then I lit an incense stick to pray for the deceased. The next morning I found the whole incense stick burned but unbroken, and furthermore, it wound toward the right hand of Green Tara that is in the gesture of giving salvation to sentient beings. The burned incense stick remained so for days. I wrote a report on this practice and the inspirational event with a photo attached there to show it to people, with the hope that people would realize that this is a helpful and effective practice that could enable one to realize that Impermanence is as close to one as the breathing in and out. A few years later, a Buddhist of Chinese descent in Indonesia downloaded this report from our website, www.yogichen.org, and read it on his computer screen. Right then he suddenly smelled sandalwood incense even though none was burned nearby. He was moved by this inspirational experience to have translated the report into Indonesian. This Indonesian version is also posted at our website now. I hope that this inspirational incident would also help you realize that this practice is really a significant one.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Besides the method mentioned above another way to realize Impermanence is to become acquainted with death. Strictly speaking, Impermanence does not apply only to death, but to us humans life and death is the matter of greatest concern, hence realizing death could imbue the alertness of Impermanence into our daily life. Since I live near a cemetery I used to take a walk there while chanting the holy name of Amitabha Buddha. In America cemeteries are as beautiful as parks. While strolling there I would go from tomb to tomb to take a closer look at the tombstones. What would be the benefit of so doing? Usually when I came out from the cemetery after about forty-minute stroll, I would feel much lighter inside. Why was it like this? Because usually we are constantly preoccupied with personal worries, just as the Chinese proverb goes, "Every family has a Sutra that is difficult to recite," and it is also seemingly endless. Nevertheless, when you read the tombstones, "Born on such and such a day, month and year, Died on such and such a day, month and year," you realize that so many matters in life that seemed so important, in the end would just vanish into void, and only these two lines would remain for some indefinite time. Sometimes you would see only one date on a tombstone, it could signify a stillbirth or a life lasted no more than a day. Even though there were only two lines, many stories could be inferred from them. After I strolled there daily for over four months, I wrote my reflections and sentiments into poems and entitled them "Learning from the Dead." These poems are all related to Impermanence, and I hope that you would read them. They are also posted at our website.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Whenever you have the opportunity to visit a cemetery, on the one hand you should recite the holy name of Amitabha Buddha or Guan Yin so as to establish Dharma connection for the deceased there, and on the other hand you should read some tombstones there, and it would be helpful to you. You would realize that so many things that you used to deem as of great importance are indeed of no consequences. As one looks back at life from the juncture of life and death it would be easier to attain certain awakening; otherwise, one would tend to haggle all the time over minor matters. If all your life is spent over minor matters, what would be the significance of such a life? It does not make much sense. If you could reflect on life as if from the juncture of life and death, then it would become possible for you to try not to waste this life; how much time is still left, no one knows. The tiny bit of remaining time, if you could use it to accomplish a few things that is beneficial to others and yourself, then this life could become meaningful. Otherwise, it will be just eating and sleeping, and there would be no peace and happiness inside.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Some people would seem to be having no problems on the surface but are actually suffering from chronic depression because they could not find meaning for life and a goal for sincere efforts. If we could realize that all of us are about the same in that we all have many worries and much suffering, and then look at things with such understanding and attempt to find solutions, then the subsequent lives would be meaningful and not wasted. The greatness of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas lies in their teaching us a road to liberation from sufferings and worries. Following such a path we would be able to help sentient beings to some extent, attain peace and happiness of mind, and help others to attain the same.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Between practicing Buddhist teachings and engaging in usual charitable services there is a fundamental and distant difference. Cultivating oneself to become a good person through charitable services is of course superb; nevertheless, there is no end to such services because new problems would keep arising. Even if one could provide for and meet all worldly needs of others, that would still be no guarantee for their happiness. No matter how hard you have tried, what could be attained would remain very limited. And yet, if you comprehended the Buddhist teachings and practiced accordingly, then you would gradually attain peace of mind, and feel the spiritual strength that naturally arises from an open mind. Furthermore, then you could teach others about the Dharma and its practices, and thereby gradually help others to find peace and spiritual strength. Even more important than these is that, after long-term devotion and sincere practice one would then realize the reality of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; it is not just a system of theories or teachings based on memorized theories. Gradually one would comprehend that Impermanence is a fundamental concept that does not mean that, since nothing can be grasped so we can act in whatever way that we like. The correct meaning is that, as one realized there is nothing that is graspable, and hence ceased grasping, then one would be liberated from the preoccupation with one's self. Ordinarily we are constantly grasping on many tiny things; when one could stop grasping one would gradually experience the purity of mind. Just as a while back before this talk started the assembly were chanting Amitabha in a state of purity, when such purity grows deep and strong it would be possible to return to limitless oneness. In other words, in our ordinary experiences what we understand through our sensual organs are full of distinctions, and so we make and are used to distinctions of countries, families and individuals. Nevertheless, when one's mind has been thoroughly purified through Dharma practices one would then realize that all such distinctions were consequences of grasping and attachment. When grasping had ceased one would experience a state that is indescribable and limitless. Such a limitless state is not a void. How do we know this? For advanced practitioners now and then it is possible to know about matters that happened in distant past or will happen in the future. This shows transcendence over Time, as we usually understood it. Sometimes when people encountered difficulties of all sorts they would ask advanced practitioners to help through prayers, granting of blessings, and other Dharma activities to generate merits. Such blessings would work even though the recipients were total strangers in distant places. This shows transcendence over Space, as we usually understood it. In life there are many matters that have no satisfactory solutions. Illness in the hands of physicians need not be cured, and could turn worse. When one is at the juncture of, as a Chinese proverb goes, "Calling Heaven without response and calling Earth without effects" prayers could help. For example, when people encounter the presence of ghosts, how could one solve such a problem? The fundamental solution to such problems is to deliver such beings from Samsara to Buddha's Pureland through Dharma practices. Then the problem would be no more. Ghosts are also in suffering, and as long as such suffering found no relief they tried to get human beings to help; that is why they bother people. Why is it that such problems will be resolved only when merits are accumulated on their behalves? That is because only what Dharma taught can ultimately solve such fundamental problems that we had no idea of how to handle. Do not think that what Dharma could help is only limited to problems of ghosts. Some people were in intensive care units, and their friends or relatives who knew me would contact me and asked me to pray for them. Even though they were total strangers to me, all I needed were their names and a brief description of their problems, and then the prayers would yield immediate help that they could sense on their side, even though they were on another continent. Thus, they would spread the information to their friends and relatives, and then when they had other problems, they would call me for help through prayers again. This demonstrated that when Dharma practice is well done the limitless oneness realized is not an ineffectual void, but instead a state of complete freedom from artificial concepts such that the strength of prayer would render help, beyond spatial and temporal limits, to others. Such help is not due to the power of any individual human being but expressions of transcendental powers of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. When praying for the benefit of others with a pure mind such a function would arise. Any one could do this; Dharma is truth, and hence no one could have monopoly over it. One just needs to engage in Dharma practices for long time with pure mind, free from any considerations and regardless of human relationships, but just pray for all equally, then gradually the effects will become obvious.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Next we will talk about Activities, i.e., after we had trained ourselves in the practices mentioned above how to apply Impermanence in daily life activities so that the actions and inaction are in congruence with the teachings on Impermanence. For example, before I came to give this talk, I did not prepare a transcript. A few months earlier they asked me to offer a few topics for my coming talks in Malaysia, so I thought about it and offered a few. Do you think that I could still remember what I wanted to say then? But then, for such an important matter, why didn't I prepare a lecture in writing? This is because I am practicing Impermanence in all my activities. Any moment I am ready to go and face the situation as I am, without carrying a backpack. To let go of grasping, one need to let go of theories as well. I just tell you what is in my mind, no need to arrange some kind of sayings. This is how I live. The words you are listening to are pouring out naturally from my mind; besides these there is no other thoughts or planning. The framework of "Views, Practices, Activities, and then Fruits" for this talk came to my mind after dinner tonight while I was in the restroom of the restaurant. For one who is really living in accordance with Dharma a Dharma talk is just an outpouring of what one really knows and actually does. This is applying Impermanence in daily life. Of course, it is not true that everyone can do like this at once. Nevertheless, you could dwell on this and consider how to apply Impermanence in your daily life. For example, before you left home you were thinking about bring this and bring that with you, but once you were outside you then realized that you had forgotten to bring this or that. Similarly, when you die it could very well like this. Hence, you need to be ready to be without anything. When nothing could indeed be brought along, what are you preparing?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">To prepare for the juncture of life and death the only things that are helpful are Dharma practices such as chanting Buddha's name and Dharma services done in our daily life now. When you had done these things in your life then at the time of death you would feel much relaxed. Key to Dharma practices is purity of mind. Bodhicitta is most important. Bodhicitta, in a few words, is to wish all sentient beings to attain full enlightenment sooner. To advance on the path to enlightenment one's intentions should stem from Bodhicitta at all times. One should not constantly limit one's intentions around a small circle of matters such as, I wish my son to be so and so, I wish my daughter to be such and such, etc. When you think of all sentient beings, all these relatives or friends are naturally included, and even you yourself is included. You should realize that all sentient beings include those you dislike, or harmed by you, or imperceptible to your senses, and are of all varieties. You regard them with the understanding that all are basically the same, as sentient beings with sorrows and in suffering, and that all wish to escape suffering and attain lasting happiness. From such a perspective you wish them full enlightenment and ultimate liberation from suffering. Such a wish goes beyond worldly wishes that might aim at the resolution of certain problems but could not prevent them from recurring or other problems from forthcoming. Furthermore, we wish all to attain full enlightenment sooner. "Sooner" is where our efforts in Dharma practices and services apply to. We do not stop at merely wishing full enlightenment to all beings; instead we make all efforts with the hope that thereby sentient beings would reach full enlightenment sooner. Therefore, whatever helps sentient beings need in making progress in Dharma we would try to provide at our best. Consequently, with Bodhicitta we have a goal in life to live for. If you can persevere in Dharma practices and services with a pure mind and solid activities, gradually you will experience the benefits. You would no longer be bothered by trivial matters and unable to escape from sorrowful worries. You would gradually realize that, as life goes on, sooner or later each and every one would run into some difficulties. When someone encounters problems, the only ones that could really help out are those that did not in the first place contribute to those entanglements in worldly haggling. Only those that had transcended worldly entanglements could give guidance and inspire the suffering ones, and render substantial help through prayers. Therefore, when you devote yourself to Dharma practices and services you are on the path of true love for all beings that would have the opportunity to run into contact with you.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffcc; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: #993300; font-size: 15px;">Finally, what would be the Fruits of Impermanence? Phenomena indeed are constantly evolving and could not be grasped as absolutely substantial. Seeing this, there are no real problems. Comprehending Impermanence thoroughly, life and death are also very natural. Just as a river is constantly flowing, which drop are you going to grasp? Each one of us is like a drip or a grain of sand in the river flow, what do you want to grasp? It is just a flowing; where are the problems? Conforming to Impermanence thoroughly in mind and action, the fruit attained is liberation. Right now you are grasping to this, grasping to that, grasping to something in all matters, and hence you encounter problems in all matters. This is unsatisfactory, that is also unsatisfactory; this I dislike, that I could not be satisfied. But if you could enlarge your views and open your mind, then you would feel that this is fine and that is also fine. To others there are all sorts of problems, but to one that finds them not objectionable, there are simply no problems.</p>

              <p>Yes. Impermanence is the main thing, i think,  that caused me to go into the spiritual path.  Everything in the end is quite meaningless.  No matter how clever, wealthy, famous, anything. No matter how loving your family, your friends, your partners. No matter anything, we all got to leave it behind one day. And there is nothing to hold on to.</p>

              <p class="smallprint" style="font-size: 12px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">[The paraphrase of the text is flush with the margin. Geshe Dhargyey’s comments are indented.]</p>
              <p class="smallprint" style="font-size: 12px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">These teachings on suffering are from <em>Advice of an Experienced Old Man </em>by the precious master Gungtang Rinpoche (Gung-thang-bzang dKon- mchog bstan-pa’i sgron- me) (1762–1823). Containing many parables, they flow as a story in verse form, based on scripture. The main point of the teaching is to help us to develop renunciation and the determination to be free, and in general to lay the ground for bodhichitta to attain enlightenment for everyone’s benefit.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Homage to the untainted Buddha who has abandoned the seeds of rebirth uncontrollably recurring from the force of karma and disturbing emotions and who, consequently, does not experience the sufferings of old age, sickness, and death.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">In the middle of the vast, lonely, wild plain of samsara lives an old man visited by a young lad, proud of his youth and health. They have this discussion.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"Hey old man, why do you act, look, and speak differently from others?"</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">To that, the old man replies, "If you say I act, walk, move, and speak differently, do not feel you are flying in the sky above. Land back down on the same earth as me and listen to my words."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Some youth feel that old age is only for the aged and that it will never come to them. They are very arrogant and have no patience to have anything to do with old people.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man continues, "A few years ago, I was much stronger, more handsome, and more vigorous than you. I was not born the way I am now. If I ran, I could even catch up with flying horses."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Most old people speak like this. The present is never as good as the old days were.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"If I caught something, I could even catch bare- handedly yaks of the nomad lands. My body was so flexible, I could move like a bird in the sky. My body was so fit, I looked like a youthful god. I wore the brightest colored clothes and loads of ornaments of gold and silver, ate tons of delicious food and sweets, and rode mighty steeds. I hardly ever sat alone without playing, laughing, and enjoying myself. Hardly any happiness exis ts that I have not experienced.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"At that time, I never thought of the impermanence of my life or about my death. Nor did I expect to go through the suffering of old age as I am now."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Once there was a young person the region where I lived, who led a luxurious life and always indulged in pleasures. Slowly he became old, his body bent, his income decreased. He said to his friends, "I never thought old age would come so suddenly."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"Living with the distraction of involvement with friends, parties, and having a good time, old age sneaks up and overcomes you in the midst of the sound of your laughter."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Geshe Kamapa said, "We should be grateful that old age comes slowly. If it came all at once, it would be unbearable. If at thirty years old we went to sleep and woke up looking eighty, we could not bear seeing ourselves. We do not comprehend our own old age. How we grew old is a total mystery to us. When all of a sudden we realize our old age, it takes a while to accept it. Then it is too late. Altho ugh it is said that the practice of Dharma for a few hours before death is helpful, to engage in tantra we need a physically fit body. Therefore, it is important to start tantric practice while still young.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"When we become very old, we dislike our own selves when we look in a mirror. At that time, our bodies and minds become weak. Our bodies begin to degenerate from head to toe. Our heads are bent as if always receiving a vase initiation.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"The white hair on my head, with no black left, it is not a sign of purification. It is the arrow of frost from the mouth of the Lord of Death, which has landed on my head. The lines on my forehead are not the creases on a pudgy infant drinking milk from his mother. It is the count by messengers of the Lord of Death of how many years I have already lived. When I squint, it is not because smoke is in my eyes. It is a sign of being helpless with the degeneration of my sensory powers. When I try to make a big effort to hear with my hand by my ear, it is not because I am making a secret communication. It is a sign of the degeneration of my hearing.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"When I dribble and snot comes from my nose, it is not a pearl adornment on my face. It is a sign of the thawing of the ice of youthful vigor by the sunshine of old age. Loosing my teeth is not a sign of cutting a new set like a young child. It is a sign of the wearing out of the tools of eating which the Lord of Death is putting away. When much saliva comes out and I spit when I talk, it is not like sprinkling water on the earth to clean it. It is a sign of an end of all the words I shall say. When I speak incoherently and stumble over words, it is not that I am speaking a strange foreign language. It is a sign of my tongue being tired with a lifetime of idle chatter.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"When my appearance becomes ugly, it is not that I am trying to hide behind the mask of a monkey. It is a sign of the total degeneration of the body that I have borrowed. When my head shakes a lot, it is not that I am disagreeing with you. It is a sign of the overwhelming power of the stick of the Lord of Death that has hit my head. When I walk bent over, it is not that I am trying to find a needle I have lost. It is a clear indication of the degeneration of the element of earth in my body.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"When I get up rising on my hands and knees, I am not imitating a four- legged animal. It is because the support of my feet is no longer sufficient. When I sit down, it is like dropping a bag of something. It is not that I am angry with my friends. It is the loss of control of my body.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">When I walk slowly, I am not trying to walk like a great statesman. It is because I have lost the complete sense of balance in my body. When my hands shake, it is not that I am waving my hands out of greed to get something. It is a sign of the fear of everything being taken away from me by the Lord of Death. When I can eat and drink only a little, it is not because I am miserly or stingy. It is a sign of the degeneration of the digestive heat at my navel. When I wear light clothes, it is not an attempt to imitate athletes. It is because the weakness of my body makes any clothes a burden to wear.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"When breathing is difficult and I get out of breath, it is not that I am healing someone by blowing a mantra. It is a sign of weakness and exhaustion of the energies in my body. When I do very little and have few activities, it is not from intentionally controlling my activities. It is because of the limit of what an old man can do. When I am very forgetful, it is not because I think others unimportant and look down on them. It is a sign of the degeneration of the consciousness of my memory.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"O young man, do not tease and make fun of me. What I experience now is not exclusive to me. Everyone experiences this. You wait and see; in three years, the first few messengers of old age will come to you. You will not believe or like what I say, but you will learn from experience. In this time of the five degenerations, you will be lucky to live to be as old as I am. Even if you live as long as I have, you will not be able to speak as much as I can."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The young man replies, "Instead of being able to live as long as you and become as ugly and ignored as you are and put in the ranks of dogs, it is better to die."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man laughs. "Young man, you are very ignorant and stupid to wish to live long and be happy, but not to have old age. Death may sound simple, but it is not that easy. To be able to die peacefully and happily, you need to be someone who has not accepted wrongly obtained offerings or broken the morality of the ten positive actions, and who has accumulated much listening to the Dharma, contemplation, and meditation. Then death is simple.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"I do not feel this way, however. I have no confidence of my having done anything constructive. I am afraid of death and am grateful for each day I can stay alive. My strong wish is to stay alive each day."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The young man changes his mind and says, "Old man, everything you say is true. What others have told me about the suffering of old age agrees with what I have seen in you. Your demonstration of old age to me has been very beneficial to my mind. I am amazed at the suffering of old age. O wise old man, if you have heard of any methods to escape old age, do not keep them a secret; share them with me and tell me the truth."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man pleasingly says, "There definitely is a method. If you know it, it is easy to follow. With little effort, we can quickly be liberated from this suffering. Although everyone who is born dies, very few die after growing old. Many die young without having the opportunity to reach old age. The methods are in Buddha’s teachings. They contain many methods to gain liberation and enlightenment, in other words not to be reborn, get old, sicken, or die; but we have not practiced them."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Once in a monastery house there was a self- made lama. He was a junior member in the monastery, and most of the monks did not pay attention to him. They had a meeting to discuss the future of the house. He said to prepare ropes and sheets to bind corpses. Everyone said this was a bad omen and got angry with him. They then discussed what everyone should do to help the monastery. He said to meditate on impermanence. In saying this, he gave them a great teaching. Many later Dalai Lamas have praised him. To prepare for the future, one needs to prepare for death.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"Everyone wants immortality and the methods to attain it. But to be born and not to die is impossible. Even thousands of Fully Enlightened Beings, including Sakyamuni Buddha, have passed away. And as for the bodhisattvas and great gurus of the past, only their names remain. The same is evident in the history of the world. All great historical figures have died and only ruins are left. Thus, we must not forget the reality of our impending deaths. Even the great gurus of the present will pass away. Babies born today will all be dead in a hundred years. So how can you, young man, expect that you alone will live forever? Therefore, it is advisable to prepare yourself spiritually for death.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"A long lifespan cannot be bought with money or gained through physical comfort. If you have spiritual confidence and know what you want out of life, then the older you grow physically, the more happiness and youth of mind you will have. If you enjoy great physical comfort but have led an empty life, then the older you grow, the unhappier you become. You have to travel as a tourist to distract your mind from worrying about death. On the other hand, even if you have just a little spiritual confidence, the closer you approach death, the more you feel like a son returning to a happy home. You are not repelled by death, but look forward to continuing lives of happiness."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Once a great spiritual master said, "Because I have complete confidence in my future births; I have no worry. Death can come at any time, and I welcome it."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"Since the suffering of death is inevitable, we must do something about it. We cannot just sit and be depressed. As humans we have the wisdom to try many methods. Even Buddha cannot give you more explicit teachings, young man. I have spoken from my heart. Although this is my true heartfelt advice, do not rely only on my words alone; analyze them for yourself. Do practices concerning impermanence on your own. There is a proverb, ‘Ask for the opinions of others, but make the decision yourself.’ If you let many make decisions for you, many will give you different advice."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The young man says, "All you say is very true and beneficial. But, for the next few years I cannott do these things. I have other work to do. I have a large estate, wealth, and so on. I must do much business and tend to my property. After a few years I must meet you again, and then I shall do the practices."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man becomes very unhappy and says, "Everything you have told me now turns out to be empty words and meaningless. I have had the same thing, the wish to do something meaningful after a few years; but I never did anything and now have grown old. I know how vain what you say is. Things to do in a few years time will never end. You will always put them off. Things to do in a few years time are like an old man’s beard; if you shave today, you will grow more tomorrow. After procrastinating until tomorrow and tomorrow, soon you will find your life is over. This procrastination of Dharma practice has fooled everyone. I have no confidence in you that you will ever practice Dharma. Therefore, it is a total waste for us to talk. Go back to your home and do whatever yo u want, and let me say some mani’s (mantras)."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The young man becomes very surprised and feels a bit hurt. He says, "How can you even think of saying such things to me? Tell me, how quickly can material things be accomplished in this life?"</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man laughs, "You ask me these questions, so I guess I have to answer how long it takes to accomplish anything. In the southern direction lives the Lord of Death who cares not at all whether you have finished your work or not. He does whatever he wants. If you can have friendly relations with him and get his permission to accomplish something in life, then you can relax. Otherwise, you can never relax. People die in the middle of a cup of tea, while food is on the table, while walking, before they can finish taking a whiff of snuff.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"This happens to everyone, even great masters. Many of their teachings are incomplete, because they died before they finished writing them. So when the Lord of Death comes, you cannot say, ‘I have a big estate and much work to do.’ You cannot boast of anything to him; you have to leave everything. In this respect we are completely powerless. We cannot determine out lifespan. Therefore, if you are able to do anything, start practicing now. That will be meaningful; otherwise, your estates alone are meaningless. But nowadays there are few people who tell the truth about what will benefit you. What is even more rare is someone who will listen to sincere advice."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The youth is deeply moved and, having built up great respect for the old man, takes a few steps back and prostrates to him. He says, "No other lamas surrounded by golden banners, Geshes, or yogis have more profound teachings that what you have said. You have the appearance of an ordinary old man, but you are actually a great spiritual friend. I give my word of honor to practice all you have said, to the best of my ability, and in the future, please give me more teachings."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man agrees and accepts. He says, "I do not know much, but I have experienced a great deal. I can teach you from that. The most difficult thing is to make a beginning and establish yourself in the Dharma. To begin practicing Dharma after you are already old is more difficult. Therefore, it is important to start at a young age.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"When young, your memory is fresh; you have dynamic intelligence and the physical strength to build up positive force by prostrations. In terms of tantra, the strength and vigor of your energy channels are very good when young. If at a young age, you can break through the barrier of greed and attachment to material possessions and involve yourself in spiritual activities, it is very valuable. Once you have accepted the Dharma, understood its essential points, and gotten into its spirit, then everything you do, say, and think will be Dharma."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Milarepa and Ra Lotsawa said the same, "When I eat, walk, sit, or sleep – it is Dharma practice."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"There are no rigid rules in Dharma. So, try not to have too many thoughts or a fickle mind. Start now and keep up your interest in Dharma. Do not change your mind every minute. From this moment on, dedicate your life – body, speech, and mind – to Dharma practice."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Now the old man tells the youth what Dharma entails, "First, find a well-qualified spiritual mentor and devote yourself properly to him with your thoughts and actions. How much you can benefit others depends on finding a proper spiritual mentor and on your wholehearted committed relationship with him."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">Atisha emphasized this point. He often related that he had an equally wholehearted commitment to all 155 of his gurus.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"Then, you need to observe your words of honor and vows to practice the ten constructive actions. Safeguard them as you would your eyes. Cut off your attachment to this life, like a wild elephant breaking a chain. Then accumulate listening, contemplation, and meditation, and do the three together. Support this all with the seven- limbed practice. This is way to build up positive force, to accumulate merit. Having done this, Buddhahood is at your fingertips."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The Fifth Dalai Lama said that if a qualified mentor guides a qualified disciple, Buddhahood can be shaped in one’s own hands. Milarepa also said that if you have a qualified mentor and a qualified disciple practicing his qualified teachings, then Buddhahood is not outside you; it is within. One must always stress, however, that the guru must be properly qualified.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">"This is happiness; this is joy. O dear son, if you practice in this way all your wishes will be fulfilled."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">These teachings are very beneficial for taming the mind. They soften a tough mind. A proverb says, "Do not be like a leather bag for containing butter. Do not be like a pebble in a stream." A leather bag does not become soft no matter how much butter is inside. No matter how long a stone stays in a stream, it too does not become soft.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">From that day on, the young man practiced pure Dharma unmixed with the eight worldly, childish feelings.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">We need to try to do the same. The more teachings we have heard, the more we need to practice and cultivate ourselves through them, and not be like pebbles in a stream that never get soft.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The old man says, "I have heard these teachings from my spiritual mentors and they are also based on my own experience. May this benefit limitless sentient beings for the sake of their happiness."</p>
              <p style="font-size: 15px; color: #330000; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">The author ends: Although I have practiced little and lack Dharma experience, yet because of the diversity of sentient beings’ dispositions, maybe these teachings will be of benefit to some. With the hope of benefiting the minds of limited beings, I have written this with sincerity and pure motivation. These teachings on impermanence are not just an interesting story I thought up to tell, but are based on <em>The Four Hundred Stanzas </em>by Aryadeva.</p>

              on Impermanence and Death, by Lama Zopa Rinpoche, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; ">from
              The Door to Satisfaction</span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Meditate: Look at everything-
              self, action, object; friend, enemy, stranger; those who are the objects of
              your attachment, anger, and ignorance- with the awareness of the reality: all
              these are transitory, and can cease at any time.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Not only do these phenomena change within
              each second due to causes and conditions, but they can cease at any time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Death can happen at any
              moment, even to you.  Death can happen at
              any moment to the friend, enemy, or stranger. Your possessions also
              deteriorate, and not only do they change within each second, but they can also
              be separated from you at any time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Therefore, there is no reason
              at all to allow discriminating thoughts of attachment, anger, or ignorance to
              arise in relation to these objects.  Be
              aware that these things are transitory in nature and not permanent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The main remedy to the
              thought of the eight worldly dharmas is meditation on impermanence and
              death.  If one does not remember death,
              one does not remember Dharma.  And even
              if one remembers Dharma, if one does not remember impermanence and death, one
              does not practice Dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Even though you may accept
              that you can die at any time, in your daily life you tend to think that you are
              not going to die soon- not this year, not this week, not today, not now.  Because of this, you postpone your practice
              of Dharma.  And even if you practice Dharma,
              if you don't think about impermanence and death, it does not become pure Dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">If you don't think about
              impermanence and death, you don't practice Dharma, which means protecting karma
              by abandoning non-virtue and practicing virtue; you constantly create negative
              karma instead.  But if you remember
              impermanence and death, you lead a highly meaningful life.  You are able to practice the paths of three
              levels of capability and achieve the </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">three great purposes: always
              increasing happiness, liberation, and enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Remembering impermanence and
              death is also a very easy way to control delusions.  You can overpower your delusions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Remembering impermanence and
              death is very meaningful.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">It is very important at the
              beginning of Dharma practice, as it helps you to actually begin your practice,
              and then again to continue it so that you succeed in your attempt to achieve
              enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Milarepa said:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Being afraid of death, I
              escaped to the mountains</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Now, having realized the
              ultimate nature of mind,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">even if death comes, I am not
              worried</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">(79, 80)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Closer and closer to death -
              death comes to all</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Death is definite.  No medicine can stop death, and there is no
              place where we don't experience death. 
              No matter how powerful our body is, our life shortens without any break.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Each time we recite the
              mantra om mani padme hung and move a bead on our mala, our life is closer to
              death with each mantra we finish.  When
              we leave here to go home, each step we take brings us closer to death.  When we arrive home, that much of our life is
              finished.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When we drink a cup of tea,
              with each sip we take, our life is closer to death.  When we finish the cup of tea, that much of
              our life has gone; we are that much nearer to death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Each time we breathe in and
              out, our life is nearer and nearer to death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Meditate while looking at a
              clock or a watch; as each second passes, in reality our life is closer to
              death- but not because we're wearing a watch! 
              Looking at a watch is a very powerful way to meditate on impermanence
              and death.  With each second you are
              coming closer to death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When we eat a plate of rice,
              each time the spoon goes to our mouth, our life is finishing.  When we finish that plate of rice, that much
              of our life has gone, and we are that much closer to the time of our death.  When we read a newspaper, as we finish each
              page, we are that much nearer to death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When we talk to people, as we
              finish each word, we are closer to death. 
              When we complete each sentence, that much of our life has already
              gone.  When we gossip for hours, that much
              of our life is finished; when we stand up and walk away, our life is that much
              closer to death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And once a part of our life
              is over, we can't bring it back or change it. 
              When a boxer or racing car driver injures his body, it can usually be
              fixed, and this can happen many times. 
              But once our life has passed, whether it has been meaningful or wasted,
              it has gone forever.  You can't fix up
              any part of your life that has passed; all you can do is work on the present
              and the future.  By making your present
              life more meaningful, you can fix up the future; you can make a better future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The Graduated Path teachings
              mention that a life of one hundred years can be divided into two parts: one
              half is spent sleeping- and this is without daytime sleeping!- and much of the
              other fifty years of waking time passes in quarreling, sickness, and many other
              meaningless activities. If we add up all the time spent on what we call
              practicing Dharma, it is very little.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">And then you have to
              die.  Even though you have a perfect
              human body, even though you haven't found time to practice Dharma during your
              lifetime, you still have to die.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">(80, 81)</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The time of death is
              uncertain</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Right now there are people
              dying in hospitals: people with AIDS or cancer whose cases the doctors regard
              as hopeless, with only one day, a few hours, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">a few minutes to live.  They are regarded as dying because they are
              close to death, but they still have a short time left to live.  They are not dead yet.  Think, 'It is the same with me- I am also
              dying.'  It is not that if you have AIDS
              or cancer, you die, and if you don't have AIDS or cancer, you don't die or
              don't die soon.  It is not like
              that.  Meditate this way when you get up
              in the morning.  Remember that you are
              dying also, just like the people in the hospital who are regarded as
              dying.  Using the same reasoning, you do
              not have much time to live.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You may even die before those
              people with cancer who are regarded as dying. 
              You may reason that because they have a certain disease, they will die
              soon.  But this doesn't necessarily
              follow; it is not logical.  Many healthy
              people who did not have AIDS or cancer have died today.  The questions of death does not depend on
              having disease; even dying soon does not depend on having disease.  Even for the healthy, it is the same: death
              can happen at any time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You are dying.  Second by second you are getting nearer to
              death- there is not much time left.  Life
              is very short.  The people with serious
              diseases are regarded as dying; those who come to visit them are regarded as
              not dying but as living.  But in reality
              there is no difference.  Both are the
              same, in getting constantly nearer to death, and in not having much time left.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">On top of all this, death can
              happen to you at any moment. The actual time of death isn't definite.  Generally, in the world, nothing is definite,
              and during degenerate times such as these, life is even more indefinite.  There are few conditions for living and many
              conditions for death, and even the conditions we need for survival can become
              causes of death.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Life is full of conditions
              for death.  All the delusions within our
              minds- such as the thought of the worldly dharmas, which induces other negative
              minds that bring heavy obstacles and heavy karma- are conditions for death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Until now you may not have
              had any obstacles to your life. Suddenly, today, because of not practicing
              Dharma and not controlling our mind, you may create heavy negative karma by
              breaking your vows or in relation to sentient beings or holy objects.  Suddenly there may be life obstacles, with
              signs of death in your dreams or other things happening.  Even though you may have the karma to live,
              suddenly there is danger of death.  There
              are many </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">conditions for death inside
              your own mind, and in external conditions, which are also created by your own
              mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Also, this body is very
              fragile, like a water bubble.  Negative
              ways of thinking disturb the winds within your body, which then disturb the
              four elements.  Disturbance of the
              elements causes disease and brings the danger of death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">As explained in a commentary
              on Kalachakra, the inner and outer elements are related.  If the four inner elements are disturbed, the
              outside elements are also disturbed. 
              These can threaten your health and your life, even becoming the
              conditions for your death.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Remember the many people we
              have known, who have been close to us, that have died.  Think of our kind friend: during the time we
              spent with him, he was very real to us, laughing and making jokes.  We enjoyed so much being with him, he seemed
              somehow permanent, truly existent, real. 
              But they have gone now.  We have
              just the memories.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Even famous people have
              died.  Even Mao Zedong, though he had a
              large army and frightened many people, he doesn't exist not.  Indra Ghandi was well known to the world,
              with her pictures everywhere.  Despite
              her popularity and military power, she is gone; she doesn't exist now.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">By this time next year it is
              possible that like those who have already died, only your name will be
              left.  Of those who have died, there are
              now left only their names written in letters, their pictures, and people still
              mentioning them.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">By this time next year, this
              could have happened to you.  Nothing to
              be seen- only your name to talk about and pictures to look at.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">As you do in tantric
              practice, bring into the present what is going to happen in the future.  Meditate on your death now.  Think of your body in a coffin being taken
              from your home to the cemetery, being buried there under the ground.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Or meditate on your body in a
              coffin about to be cremated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Only your possessions are
              left.  Think about this.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">When death happens, even
              though the body completely disintegrates, the consciousness continues.  When the butter in a butter lamp finishes,
              the flame stops, but the consciousness is not like this.  Consciousness continues from life to
              life.  (82, 83, 84)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Think about karma and
              rebirth.  Whether you will have a good or
              a bad rebirth depends on whether your karma is good or bad.  Remember that your death can happen suddenly.  You may be active, working, when suddenly
              your eyes roll up and you die.  Suddenly,
              in the middle of doing something, your body becomes a corpse, with no
              breathing, no movement.  This can happen
              to you at any time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">People have died while
              drinking tea; just before the cup reaches their lips, they die in the
              chair.  People die before finishing the
              food on their plate.  Everyday people are
              dying in the middle of doing something. 
              This happens every day.  (85, 86)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Making this life meaningful</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">The best thing to do is to
              recite every morning, 'I am going to die today.'  This cuts off all problems.  Once you have this thought, there are no more
              problems.  Problems come from your wrong
              ideas, your wrong conceptions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Thinking that you are going
              to die today cuts off these conceptions and problems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">You are going to die today-
              so what are you going to do with your life? 
              Just thinking that you are going to die today is not sufficient; the
              thought should persuade you to practice Dharma and not waste your life.  What are you going to do?   Whether you live another hour or another
              hundred years, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">what are you going to do with
              your life?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">At this time, when you have
              this question, it is very good to remember the verse from Lama Chopa:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">      Cherishing myself is the source of all
              sufferings,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">      while cherishing others is the basis of
              all qualities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">      Please grant me blessings to do the heart
              practice,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">      the yoga of exchanging myself for others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Here you have the answer: the
              heart practice is contained in the above verse. 
              Whether or not you are able to recite many prayers, study extensively,
              or sit in meditation, this is the essential, most meaningful practice.  Simply by thinking of the words of this
              verse- that cherishing the self is the basis of all obstacles and sufferings,
              and cherishing others the basis of all qualities- you are able to change the
              object of your concern.  Before, your
              concern was only for yourself, but just by saying these words, you change the
              object of your concern from the self to other sentient beings suffering in the
              six realms.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt;">Constantly keep the thought
              of other sentinet beings in place of the I. 
              Change from cherishing the I to cherishing others.  Always hold this thought in your heart and do
              all your actions on the basis of this attitude. 
              From morning to night, do everything- meditation, prayers, study,
              eating, talking- on the basis of this attitude. 
              In your heart, do everything for all sentient beings.</span></p>
