              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Sep 18 2015. </span><a href="http://www.livemint.com/Search/Link/Author/Devdutt%20Pattanaik"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: windowtext;">Devdutt Pattanaik</span></a><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; "> live mint</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="intro-box" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik visits a little-known theme park and
              learns about the difference between the Indian and Chinese concepts of eternal
              punishment</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #575757;'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In Singapore, the best way to go to hell
              is after a bowl of congee, the traditional Chinese rice porridge dish. I had
              arrived in the middle of the Hungry Ghost Festival, a time when local Chinese
              families burn paper money and paper shoes and paper cosmetics and paper
              furniture in roadside bonfires to “feed hungry ghosts who visit the living”.
              The ghosts come during the seventh month of the Chinese calendar, when “the
              gates of hell open for a month”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As a mythologist, I was curious about the
              idea of a “Chinese Hell” and I wondered how it compared with our own idea of <em>naraka</em>.
              When I mentioned this to my friends in Singapore, they simply said, “Sure,
              let’s go and check it out.” And so, after a fortifying bowl of congee, which is
              pure heaven, we headed to hell—located conveniently inside a theme park called
              the Haw Par Villa (rumoured, suitably, to be haunted).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Thanks to the Cultural Revolution
              (1966-76) and the rise of Communism, practically every traditional Chinese
              custom—“old superstitious practices”—has been wiped out from mainland China.
              These now survive only among the Chinese diaspora in places such as Singapore,
              Taiwan and Hong Kong. Haw Par Villa was built almost 80 years ago by an
              expatriate Chinese business tycoon as a way to preserve Chinese culture and as
              a branding exercise for their Tiger Balm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Haw means tiger and Par, leopard, and
              these are the names of two brothers, sons of the Burmese-Chinese herbalist who
              invented the very famous Tiger Balm. The brothers moved their business from
              Rangoon (now Yangon) to Singapore before World War II and built the Tiger Balm
              Villa, atop a hill with a panoramic view, with a theme park around it. During
              the war, Haw had to abandon the villa and move to Hong Kong while Par returned
              to Burma, as Myanmar was known. The Japanese claimed the villa, which offered a
              strategic overview of ships in the harbour. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">After the Japanese defeat, Haw returned
              and found the villa abandoned, damaged by neighbours who hated the Japanese. He
              tore it down and restored the theme park in memory of his beloved brother, Par,
              who had died in Burma during the war. Haw’s nephew took over operations and
              added many more attractions from various Chinese epics, folklore and mythology,
              the prominent theme being filial piety. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">But while visitors packed the park on
              weekends and holidays, especially parents eager to teach Chinese culture to
              their children, this was not a very profitable enterprise, probably because of
              the high entry-ticket price. The government took it over in the 1980s, but
              attempts to revive it—including waiving the entry fee altogether—have not been
              very successful, as was evident when I reached the hill on the southwestern
              side of Singapore, and found the park rather empty for a late Sunday morning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The park is rather tacky, marked by
              kitsch. It reminded me of the many Hindu mythological theme parks I have seen
              at pilgrim spots, with garish colours and chipped paint. When it was built, it
              might have been considered monumental, but for eyes that are now conditioned by
              movie special effects and video games, this can be a bit of a let-down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Along the entire approach path are images
              of tigers and leopards, reminders of the two brothers and the Tiger Balm that
              created the family fortune. But the main attraction is the Ten Courts of Hell.
              Forty years ago, the corridor was encased as a Chinese dragon (incidentally,
              Haw and Par’s elder brother was named Leng, or “dragon”) and was flooded with
              water, so you had to take a boat ride into the dragon’s mouth to see what
              gruesome torment awaited sinners in the underworld. Now there is no dragon and
              no river, just a simple walk through a faux stone cave.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The gates of hell are guarded by two
              guardians, one with the head of a horse and another with the head of a bull. I
              immediately thought of the Hindu characters Hayagriva and Nandi, only these
              images are more fierce and demonic. Each of the Ten Hells, we are told, has a
              ruler called Yama, who looks like an ancient Chinese bureaucrat and reminds us
              of the Hindu Chitragupta. The Hindu <em>Garuda Purana</em>, written around 1,500
              years ago, also has a vast description of numerous hells, different for
              different crimes. The overlap of mythologies is undeniable, indicating that the
              trade routes between the two countries also allowed for an exchange of ideas
              and stories.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In the first court, the virtuous make
              their way to paradise. The rest are segregated into nine courts, which are
              essentially different torture chambers for different crimes: People are drawn,
              quartered, roasted, pulped, grounded, beaten and frozen for crimes ranging from
              lying, cheating, adultery, insolence and disobedience to not repaying debts and
              disrespecting elders. Unlike Disney theme parks in the US, there are no
              animatronics, videos or sound effects. But the images are scary, full of blood
              and gore and misery, and one can imagine in the dim light little Chinese
              children looking petrified. After the last court, there is the pavilion of
              forgetfulness, where those who have endured the punishment are given magical
              tea to forget their suffering and then put on one of the six paths of
              reincarnation: as nobility, commoner, quadruped, fowl, fish or insect. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This was interesting: You are punished for
              the bad deeds of a previous life and are still made to suffer by being located
              in a hierarchy in the next life. This reveals a messy attempt to integrate the
              old pre-Buddhist mythology of China, based on ancestor worship and a single
              life, with the rebirth-based Buddhist mythology that came to China later.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Outside the corridor are the less famous
              dioramas of scenes from <em>Journey To The West</em>, which tells the story of
              the monk who travelled from China to India in search of original Buddhist
              texts, accompanied by a Hanuman-like monkey, a horse and a pig. Then there are
              scenes from the <em>Romance Of The Three Kingdoms</em>, a classical Chinese
              novel, as popular in China as the Mahabharat is in India. I remember watching
              John Woo’s film <em>Red Cliff</em>, a blockbuster across East Asia. The theatre
              in Mumbai was empty! My favourite diorama was the <em>Legend Of The White Snake</em>.
              The story is the reverse of the Ramayan, with the wife saving the husband who
              has been abducted by a monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">What distinguishes Chinese mythology from
              Greek, Abrahamic and Hindu mythologies is that it is highly pragmatic and far
              more literal, more concerned with order in this world than salvation in the
              next. The only reason hell matters to the Chinese is because it is a tool to
              civilize people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">It is rumoured that real human beings were
              covered with wax to make the images in the park, and that many prisoners of war
              during World War II were buried in mass graves near the hill, and that the Gate
              of Chinese Hell actually does open nearby. Many security guards swear that they
              have seen ghosts wandering around at night. As you walk around the theme park,
              you find food and offerings of cigarettes near a few statues, to appease the
              ghosts. The mainland Chinese may scoff at such irrational ideas, but what is a
              culture that does not believe in a little bit of magic, and what is life
              without a bit of supernatural garnish? Congee itself has no taste till you add
              a few flakes of fried shallot, some slices of century eggs, a splash of soya
              sauce and a sprinkle of diced red chillies.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 14.05pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 19.2pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The future seems bleak for this old
              Singaporean landmark. The ghosts are perhaps more petrified of modernity, as
              high-rise steel-and-glass structures look down upon them menacingly. Greed will
              surely conquer fear. And if the park is not reinvented soon, it may be torn
              down like the old neighbourhoods of Singapore, to make way for yet another
              mall.</span></p>
