              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Mindfulness Meets Maria, A
              Modern Blend Of Buddhism And Christianity</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Martín Reynoso WORLDCRUNCH
              2017-07-25</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Like
              many in Argentina, psychiatrist Martín Reynoso was raised Catholic. But as time
              went on, his approach to the modern world began to involve meditation and
              mindfulness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">BUENOS
              AIRES — I am a Buddho-Christian — thoroughly, and literally. I've kept my
              family's basic Christian casing, but found I needed more than that in this
              contemporary world. Thus, like so many people today, I embraced certain
              Buddhist principles. And I must say, I find them enormously helpful and
              enriching. This is why I say I have a Buddho-Christian mind. It has a powerful
              Christian base, but with certain secular principles of Buddhism that I
              embraced, little by little, in an effort to simply feel better.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              basic Christian framework is fairly robust. My father was a seminarian who
              nearly became a priest (and luckily did not), had three nun sisters and a very
              devout dad who practiced the Catholic rites. Though both my father and mother,
              who was also very Catholic, I assimilated the Roman Apostolic religion in all
              its purity but without the rigidity or severity I noticed in some families in
              our neighborhood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              progression toward the Catholic sacraments and rituals were a leitmotiv of my
              childhood and youth, though I was fortunate not to be trapped in a hermetic or
              self-sufficient system that distanced me from friends and neighbors. Our
              neighborhood was a space where strict or dogmatic beliefs regularly lost ground
              to drinking, free speech and youthful irreverence in all its manifestations.
              Life gushed forth in so many forms and colors beyond anything the scriptures
              would stipulate as right or commendable. At times I even found this a little
              disturbing.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              learned a lot from my friends, neighbors and immediate environment as I wound my
              way through the streets without strict hours or parental discipline. All this
              constituted the first blow to the structure of my Christian foundations. I had
              to negotiate between ethical values and the malleable rules of adaptation;
              between spotless good deeds for others and fierce competition between the
              generations; and between repressing the sexual impulse and seducing even more
              brazenly on the street. I understood that I must, slowly, soften my hard
              religious nucleus to be happy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              began saying as a young man what I had criticized in others as a teenager,
              namely that, "I believe in God but do not practice regularly." Mass
              on Sunday and habitual celebrations began to fade as I became a more rational,
              scientific man. That was the second step.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Science and secularization</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Gradually
              science came to permeate all my life. As I took my distance from the Catholic
              religion (in the general context of secularization), I moved closer — and with
              some fervor — to the principles of the scientific vision of the world. Objectivity,
              and the need to explain and duly contrast everything, became a central
              component of my thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              grew more skeptical, not to mention more rigid. People can adopt certain airs
              of superiority when they begin expressing the scientific vision as nothing
              short of reality, without realizing that it is just one way of seeing and
              explaining. Causality was the main rule of my life at the time, and everything
              had to be explained on the basis of the most direct and rational vision of
              phenomena.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> It helped me begin a fuller life. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              our psychology department, the dilemma was between physics, the scientific
              model, and psychological science. We spent much time trying to establish a more
              flexible conceptual framework with new methods and approximations in studying
              the complex "human creature." But then, a health problem led me to
              the next phase.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mindfulness and its principles</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              came to know mindfulness when I fell ill. While their use in science is
              detached from their ideological and religious origins, the principles of
              Buddhism shine through like a background that clarifies the vision we gradually
              build.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Practicing
              meditation helped me start connecting with my body and fully live through it,
              cleanse it of tensions, and recognize those rigid thoughts of mine (some of
              Christian origin) and the dualist morality that generated guilt and sometimes
              pain in me. It helped me begin a fuller life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Concepts
              like impermanence, the illusions of the mind (which work like filters we do not
              perceive), the source of suffering and the compassionate way to work with that,
              and especially reeducating our mind with a simple but impeccable system, came
              to profoundly affect me, and I continue to try and integrate these with my
              original conception of the world and its events.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              feel happy with this choice, though I still feel I have a long way to go before
              I adjust my life to these principles. Which is why I say I have a
              Buddho-Christian mind, like so many other people seeking their own wellbeing
              today. I do not so much see this as hybridization as an overriding integration
              of principles to attain the main objective of any human being: to be happy.</span></p>
