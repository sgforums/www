              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A seemingly inescapable fact
                  of my life is that I am a poet, or, at least, that I keep writing poems. Why
                  would I feel the need to do this? I am fascinated by language. But language is
                  fascinating to everyone. It is through language that we describe and therefore
                  create the world we live in, and it is through language that we describe and
                  therefore create ourselves. If the world is difficult and life is difficult, it
                  may not be that there is something wrong with life or the world—it may be that
                  there is something wrong with our descriptions.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">We usually think that there
                  is something and then there is talking about something, and that the something
                  is substantial and real and the talking about it is secondary. But for the
                  human mind there is no way to separate something from talking about something.
                  Even perception is, to some extent, a process of talking about something.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">I suppose you could say that
                  language is humanity, because human consciousness is language-making
                  consciousness. Language is so close to us we cannot understand what it is. We
                  are “in” language the way a fish is in water: for the fish, water is just the
                  way things are.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">I have been wondering about
                  language almost all my life, and after all these years of exploration, I am no
                  closer to understanding it than I have ever been. Still, in my poetry I am
                  always writing about this effort to understand language. It seems to be my
                  chief topic: Can we know what language is? Can we know what we are? The poet
                  Paul Celan writes, “Whenever we speak with things in this way (in poetry) we
                  dwell on the question of their where-from and where-to, an open question
                  without resolution.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">So language is, on the one
                  hand, a prison: we are literally locked inside language, created by, defined by
                  language, and can only see as far as we can say. On the other hand, language
                  can also free us: it can open our imagination and allow us to reach out to the
                  world—and fly beyond it. This is what poets try to do.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">They always fail, but the
                  point is not to succeed but to make the attempt.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In Zen practice we are always
                  trying to stand within language in a fresh way, to open up the hand of thought,
                  and play with language and let language play with us. This means we come to
                  understand and dwell within language in many ways. Each word means something
                  and not something else. But also each word is gone even as we speak it, and so
                  it isn’t anything. When we speak about something we might think we are
                  understanding it or controlling it, but that is not so. When we are speaking
                  about something we are also—and mainly—speaking about nothing. Speaking is just
                  being ourselves, expressing ourselves. When we get tangled up in the something
                  we think we are speaking about, we suffer.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">All language is singing.
                  Music doesn’t have any describable meaning, yet it is vital to our lives. But
                  we don’t know this. We hold onto objects we have created with our language,
                  objects that don’t exist as we imagine that they do, and we suffer. If we could
                  experience language as it really is for us, we could be free from the suffering
                  language creates. This doesn’t mean that we would be free from pain or sorrow.
                  Only that we would be free from the special sort of anguish that human beings
                  feel when they are lonely and estranged from themselves, others, and the world.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">This thought lies at the
                  heart of Buddhism. The first three practices of the eightfold path are right
                  view, right intention, and right speech. These make right conduct possible, and
                  when there is right conduct, there can be meditation practice and mindfulness,
                  which lead to wisdom, thereby reinforcing right view. So from the first, the
                  Buddha saw that our language conditions our spirituality through our views,
                  intentions, and uttered words, and that training in an increased awareness of
                  this process has to be the starting point for spiritual practice. In later
                  Buddhist thought this insight was strengthened and made more explicit with the
                  teachings on emptiness, which understand the nature of human reality to be
                  “mere designation.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">As a spiritual teacher
                  operating in the real world with real students, the Buddha was sophisticated
                  yet quite practical in these matters. Like Socrates, he was a master of
                  dialogue. He knew that getting caught up in language was a trap. He saw that
                  nothing was more fundamental than right view—out of right view everything good
                  unfolds—but he also saw that right view isn’t some doctrine or propositional
                  truth. People sometimes ask me, what is the Buddhist view of this or that? But
                  there is no Buddhist view of this or that. The Buddhist view is a non-view, but
                  not a non-view that is the opposite of a view, a wishy-washy noncommitalism.
                  Non-view includes various views that arise in response to conditions. Non-view
                  is an attitude, a spirit of openness, kindness, and flexibility with regard to
                  language. Non-view is a way to stand within language, to make use of language,
                  to connect without being caught by—and separated from the world by—language.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Buddha
                  spent his life talking to people. In fact, he was one of the greatest masters
                  of talking to people in recorded history. One gets the sense in the suttas that
                  the Buddha talked not because he was particularly loquacious, or because he was
                  given to elaborate explanations, but in order to help people see through the
                  smoke screen of their own language and views. Once someone asked him for his
                  secret in answering questions as effectively as he did. He said that he had
                  four ways of answering questions. One way was categorically—just to say yes or
                  no without ambiguity. The second way was to examine the question analytically,
                  clarifying definitions and trying to determine what was actually being said,
                  usually by deconstructing it. Most of the time when the Buddha employed this
                  method there was no need to answer the question: under analysis the question
                  proved meaningless. The third way was by posing a counterquestion, the purpose
                  of which was to bring the questioner back to his or her own mind, redirecting
                  attention away from the entanglement of the language of the question to
                  something real that stood behind it. The fourth way was simply to put the
                  question aside, knowing that some questions are so hopelessly entangled that to
                  take them up at all means beating your head against a wall—there is no end to
                  it and you end up with a bloody head. To put the question aside is simply to
                  walk around the wall. This way you can get to the other side without beating
                  your head bloody. So sometimes the Buddha’s response to a question was silence.<em></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In his discussion of right
                  speech the Buddha also demonstrated the subtle and nuanced understanding that
                  words do not have fixed meanings and ought never to be taken at face value. The
                  meaning of a word depends on the context: who is speaking and listening, the
                  tone of voice employed, the underlying attitude, and the situation in which the
                  words are spoken. The very fact that the Buddha did not recommend that his
                  words be written down and that he allowed others to explain the teachings in
                  their own words, insisting that ordinary language, not special holy language,
                  be used, shows that he understood language to be a process—essentially a
                  dialogue, a dynamic experience—rather than a tool of exact description or
                  explanation. The Buddha saw that far from being a neutral conduit for the
                  conveying of preexisting meanings, language is an ever-shifting vehicle for the
                  self, and that the way to clarify the self and the world is to hold language in
                  an accurate and sensitive way.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Of all the Buddhist teachings
                  the Zen masters of ancient China inherited from India, what they emphasized
                  most was this point about language:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A monk asked Zhaozhou, “What
                  is the Great Perfection of Wisdom?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Zhaozhou replied, “The Great
                  Perfection of Wisdom.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Another monk asked him, “What
                  is meditation?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Zhaozhou replied,
                  “Non-meditation.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“How can meditation be
                  non-meditation?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">“It’s alive.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Another monk: “What is one
                  word?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Zhaozhou: “Two words.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">A monk asked Fengxue, “How
                  can I go beyond speech and silence?”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In response, Fengxue quoted
                  lines from a famous poem.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">What makes us miserable, what
                  causes us to be in conflict with one another, is our insistence on our
                  particular view of things: our view of what we deserve or want, our view of
                  right and wrong, our view of self, our view of other, our view of life, our
                  view of death. But views are just views. They are not ultimate truth. There is
                  no way to eliminate views, nor would we want to. As long as we are alive and
                  aware there will be views. Views are colorful and interesting and
                  life-enhancing—as long as we know they are views. The Chinese Zen masters are
                  asking us to know a view as a view, and not to mistake it for something else.
                  If you know a view as a view, you can be free of that view. If you know a
                  thought as a thought, you can be free of that thought.</p>
              <p><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">Going beyond language through
                  language is something we can practice and develop through meditation, study,
                  and awareness in daily life. In meditation we can learn to pay attention not
                  only to sensation but also to emotion and thinking. Learning to let thinking
                  come and go, we can eventually understand a thought as a thought and a word as
                  a word, and with this understanding we can find a measure of freedom from
                  thoughts and words. We can begin to appreciate Buddhist thought not as a new
                  set of concepts that we are to adhere to, but as a kind of mental yoga, a
                  counterweight to the concepts we already unconsciously hold and that hold us,
                  locking us into a small, temporary, atomized self. When in daily living we
                  learn to return again and again to where we are in body, emotion, and mind, we
                  are learning to hold our language and views lightly, to see that they are
                  ever-evolving currents of being, that they are not only ours but belong to
                  everyone else as well. When we cultivate the practice of paying close attention
                  to the way we talk to ourselves, we won’t fool ourselves too much. Another old
                  Zen master used to call out to himself, “Don’t be fooled by anything.” And he
                  would answer, “I won’t be!”</span></p>
