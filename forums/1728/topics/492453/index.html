              course you do. I don’t know a single cat owner – excuse me, a person who is
              owned by cats – who doesn’t talk to their feline friends. I’m not a dog person,
              but I see much the same behavior from them. Why do we do this? Even small
              children realize cats can’t understand language. But our intuition tells us we
              can communicate with them. And so we do, even if all they hear is voice tone
              and body language.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Do you talk to trees? That’s

You
              asked permission before taking a tree branch to make a wand or before
              harvesting an herb that grows in your back yard. Every so often I see an
              article that recommends talking to your house plants. They usually try to
              explain it away in materialist terms, but those of us who’ve done it regularly
              know there’s something<span> </span><em>more</em><span> </span>involved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>That something<span> </span><em>more</em><span> </span>is
              personhood. We intuitively recognize something of ourselves in cats and dogs,
              in plants and trees, and if we’re paying really close attention, in mountains
              and rivers. These aren’t things, they’re persons. They have inherent value and
              worth that does not depend on their usefulness or desirability to humans.
              Whatever animates us also animates cats and dogs, trees and rocks, rivers and
              storms. Whatever inherent sovereignty we possess, every other creature,
              ecosystem, and natural force also possesses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>This is a form of animism that
              is intuitive even to us here in the 21<sup>st</sup><span> </span>century
              West.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>In her book<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/johnbeckett/2013/12/the-wakeful-world.html"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #0066cc;'>The Wakeful World</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>, Emma Restall Orr gives a more
              sophisticated definition of animism that states everything has mind and that
              mind and matter are not separate. She says we can never see the world as it
              actually is, but only our idea of it – and our ideas are “data processed
              through the filters of perception established by beliefs based on limitations
              and experience.” We don’t see the personhood of cats and trees and
              lakes because the mainstream religion tells us we alone were made “in the
              image of God” – and we like being in the top position. It lets us justify
              exploiting other persons for our own greed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Are all these persons
              (including ourselves) inhabited by spirits? Are all these persons spirits who
              are currently manifesting in a physical form? Or are the spirit and the form
              inseparable elements of one whole person? I don’t know. My intuition tells me
              everything is inspirited – it does not tell me the structure of the spirits
              involved.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>If you don’t hear much about
              animism, it’s because early anthropologists and the school texts based from
              their work called it primitive. They presented a model of “progress” that went
              from superstition to animism to polytheism to monotheism to proper Protestant
              Christianity. In the last 50 years or so, that model has been extended to make
              atheism the pinnacle of human progress. We like to think of ourselves as
              “advanced” and those who came before us as “primitive” – the idea that our
              ancient ancestors’ thinking might be more accurate and more helpful never
              occurs to us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>But we still talk to our cats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>If every other creature,
              ecosystem, and natural force is a person, can we communicate with them? Should
              we communicate with them? Yes, but…</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Would you go up to a random
              person on the street and say “what do you have to teach me?” Of course you
              wouldn’t (or at least, I hope you wouldn’t). Then why would you go up to a
              random tree or bird and ask the same question? If you don’t think a random
              person on the street has some message for you, don’t assume a random bird or
              tree does either.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Would you go up to a Buddhist monk
              on the street and say “what do you have to teach me?” You might. It would be
              rude and presumptive, and he might teach you not to act so entitled in a way
              you wouldn’t particularly like, but at least there’s reason to believe a monk
              might actually be willing and able to teach you something useful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Now, if you bought the monk a
              cup of tea and sat with him while he drank it, he might be inclined to teach
              you something more in line with what you had in mind. If you started attending
              meditation and dharma lessons at his temple, you’d probably learn a lot more.
              You might even develop a friendship with the monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>We can best learn from other
              persons – human or other-than-human – when we’re in relationship with them. You
              can learn a lot from a bird or a tree, but it works best when you’re in a
              respectful and reciprocal relationship with them. If they’re persons – and they
              are – then treat them like persons, not like things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>The same intuition that tells
              us we can find a person in a cat or a tree or a mountain will also tell us we
              can find a person (or many persons) in our dreams, our devotions, our
              divination, and our worship. Whatever else the Gods may be, they are also
              persons. And just as we would not go up to a random person on the street and
              ask them to teach us something or give us something, neither should we approach
              a random deity and ask Them to fix our problems or lead us to enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>As with people, our
              interactions with the Gods work best in a respectful, reciprocal relationship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>Animism is not the same thing
              as polytheism, and it is not a necessary component of polytheism. You can
              affirm the religious regard for many real Gods and still think a mountain is an
              inanimate object and a cat is just an animal (but good luck convincing your cat
              of that). Likewise, polytheism is not a requirement of animism. You can
              recognize and interact with the persons in or of plants and rivers still think
              there are no Gods.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>But animism is a part of my
              polytheism. It provides a framework for an inspirited and enchanted world, a
              world where everything you see and touch and feel and sense is not a thing, but
              a person worthy of your respect and capable of entering into a reciprocal
              relationship with you – if that person so chooses. Those persons include the
              Gods. Animism teaches that just as I don’t relate to a cat or a tree in exactly
              the same way as I relate to another human, I may need to relate to Gods in
              different ways as well.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";'>But mainly, animism serves as a
              constant reminder to respect the dignity and sovereignty of all persons,
              whether they are human or not.</span></p>
