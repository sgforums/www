            <div class='col-md body'>Just my opinion,<br><br>If one want to really clear karma, there is no easy way out. Must pass through some difficult period of time. Karma is habituated energy... can be mental, physical or emotional.<br><br>In fact, the whole need to fix things is a karmic grasping.<br><br>Sometimes, the physcial conditions of a body is caused by traumatic or habitual imprints formed in one's former lifes and concreted over the years. For example, if one has a hand injury and it does not heal very well,  it is most probably due to some karmic imprint that is not released. This example may not apply to Kumangal's issues, though.<br><br>For karma resolution, one does not really need to see what happened in the past life in order to be healed. One is however required to be very 'attentive' to whatever sensations and reactions that arises. By allowing these sensations and feeling to arise and not habitually block them with fear and mental denial, we may actually discover new ways of viewing/experiencing a condition that allow for karmic release.<br><br>It is important to know how to just let whatever that arises to be just that and not allowing chains of thoughts to mess up the situation. Also the inherent compassion that is within us can soften some unpleasantness and aid in the resolution.<br><br>Also, conventionally, because the body can be subjectable to harm. Sometimes, there may be a need to response in a way that get the body out of harm's way. So, it is not just a case of 'all is illusion' that leads to the disregard of the physical condition. No doubt at another level, 'body is not mine' but compassion nevertheless necessitate a skillful response in the conventional sense.<br><br>just a sharing.</div>

Read up dharma book, attending dharma talks by dharma teachers. It could bring your spirtual practice to another level. With better understanding, wisdom and faith will develop and you can resolve obstacles in your life better.
