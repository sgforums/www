You may want to see Â‘clearingÂ’ from another perspective.<br>Since there is merely letting whatever arises to subside on their own accord with luminous clarity, it is not so much of 'clearing' of karmic propensities.  It is rather a Â‘non-re-enforcing' process.  Ignorance unknowingly deepens the tendencies due to dualistic action.<br><br>I used to find this a great challenge because the sense of self never fails to arise during challenging conditions but that is perfectly fine now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  However one must know the exact reason why it is fine and the mechanism of how karmic tendencies works.

As said, if anyone find recitation an aid to their cultivation and hence build a firmer faith in practice then I am really okay with it.<br><br>But to say that it is the <strong>only guaranteed</strong> way to gain enlightenment then I will have to disagree. Because to my understanding, it is definitely not so. If 6-syllabus mantra-reciting is the only way, that would have undermine the various other methods of cultivation as well.<br><br>Again with the many cultivated masters, I will hold my horse for this as no one can read another's mind thoroughly, so I will not be so fast to claim that they are enlightened master, and moreso what you claim the enlightenment they had through 6-syllabus mantra reciting.<br><br>Because as I had mentioned earlier which I believe you had definitely missed it (if not you would not keep using these "masters" over and over again), 6-syllabus mantra recitation is only one of the <strong>many</strong> methods that are prescribed in the Tipitaka. As AEN had also mentioned, repentance is a good method in clearing past negative kamma.<br><br>For you to keep <strong>insisting</strong> that such recitation is the <strong>sole</strong> and <strong>only</strong> way would only suggest that you are either<br><br>a. has little understanding in development of the buddhist tipitaka in history<br>b. apparently shut out other methods for cultivation<br>c. has little or no regards to other methods for cultivation<br><br>What I am suggesting here is just to shed an alternate light and hoping that buddhists will be thinking about their faith more than just believing as it is. As much as sadda (faith) is needed, as buddhist and rationale human beings we would have probably need to comprehend a little further to what we than just simply follow heresay.<br><br>I need no recite to 10000 times of that per day as I could have used the time to do other more meaningful things. Probably talking to my parents, do my homework, working out to keep fit, etc.<br><br>I again stress that if <strong>anyone</strong> think that reciting that mantra is important then please keep it in your practice.<br><br>For me I am much appreciative of what the Buddha had taught about living the here and now. That practical living integrated with buddhistic doctrines is then a practice to me.<br><br>There was this real incident. This sangha (to protect his/her ID so I said sangha) attending a meeting with a group of people. In it there was this layman kept reciting 6-syllabus mantra. Besides the need for him to talk, rest of the time he just kept reciting and it was actually very irritating. The sangha commented that that is definitely not a practical way of reciting there and then as it would be better to be focus on the meeting into solving issues then kept on reciting! I am not sure whether or not you want buddhists to be morphed into someone like him.<br><br>And bod, if you really think reciting 6-syllabus mantra can gain enlightenment and solve your problems, then you should quit your job, stop whatever you're doing (including coming to forum) and then just recite and gain that enlightenment! Wouldn't that be <strong>great</strong>?<br><br>But no, you hop into here, make a din out of a view that doesn't follow the mainstream idea. It is as if I am telling you that the Earth is spherical and you keep harping that it is flat.<br><br>And that you say you won't be lazy when you reach pureland, that we won't know, so you can say whatever you like and giving yourself a picture of a hardworking cultivator.<br><br>I definitely agree with you that different people need different methods of cultivation, as I stress again (as I sincerely believe you'd missed it many times), to me recite buddha-name, mantra are only one of the <strong>many</strong> methods available and to keep insisting that to be the only way is something that I have to disagree.<br><br>And the first sermon preached, is the fundamental principle which is large inferred to in the latter development of buddhist practice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>(The following is a continuation of Yamizi's reply, segmented them due to length)</strong><br><br>Having the correct perception in the things we see and hear (right understanding). With the right EQ, attitude, aptitude, etc (right thoughts), hence we will do and say the right things and words (right speech, actions, livelihood). Accompany with the correct understanding of Dhamma, we should have a firm and determined confidence (right effort), in applying Dhamma by being kind to ourselves and others (right mindfulness). And that buddhist should be focus by living in the here and now(right concentration).<br><br>Or I maybe don't know about 6-syallbus mantra-reciting practice itself <strong>can omit</strong> such practice of the Noble Eightfold Paths.<br><br>But if you take the reciting as a compliment practice to right mindfulness and concentration, that I can agree.<br><br>I never doubt the compassionate power of Avalokitesvara but I have more confidence in the compassionate power of Lord Buddha. Or are you trying to imply that Buddha is more inferior as compare to Avalokitesvara?<br><br>And bod,<br><br>I really have nothing against you, except that when you start to lose your footing in reasoning in a rationale and logical manner, you will start personal attack like what you have mentioned<br><br>"You will realise the Lotus Sutra will Guiding you<br><br>Walk the Lotus Sutra ,not Lotus Sutra walk (hog)   you"<br><br>I definitely believe that you are either<br><br>a. has little idea what Lotus Sutra is <strong>really</strong> about<br>b. has little idea that what I have understood from Lotus Sutra<br><br>Now let me give you a general idea of what Lotus Sutra is.<br><br>The primary, important and main idea from the Lotus Sutra (LS) is to tell you the our Sakyamuni Buddha has attained His enlightenment in the remoteless beginning (which means beginningless lah) and that the various Fa Hua Zong (would include Tiantai and Nichiren Buddhism) scholars would interpret that Sakyamuni is a direct incarnate (sorry guys, can't find a more appropriate term) of the Dhammakaya.<br><br>It is also knowned in LS that all other Buddhas are merely the manifestations from Sakyamuni Buddha. Believers of LS are supposed to have unshakable faith in this fact.<br><br>Then how about practice?<br><br>Well they are included too! That due to the different capacities of sentient beings, Buddha then taught about the 4 Noble Truths (including Noble Eightfold Paths) to the Sravakas, realising the 12 Dependant Origins for the Pratyaka and completing the 6 Paramitas for the Bodhisattvas. I often tell people that LS has summarised the Mahayana Teachings because all these are mentioned and they compliment each other in practice! Of course LS wouldn't have the capacity in elaborating each of these, but from these, we can go to the other sutras that are specialise in these fields and to have a better and further understanding.<br><br>Now these practices (besides dependant origins as that would more of a mental/spiritual realisation) are what we can do in our <strong>daily</strong> lives! How else can these practices <strong>not be done</strong>?<br><br>Example, see an old blind man wanting to cross a busy traffic. You can either<br><br>a. recite Om Mani Padme Hum and gain enlightenment (which I don't see any pratical help from here, probably some miracle will happen)<br><br>OR<br><br>b. being a thoughtful and considerate buddhist (right thoughts, mindfulness), you offer your little time and effort (right effort, dana parimita) to help the probably clueless and frightful (cos he blind and can't see the traffic) blind man to cross the road (the dana in remove the fear from others, as mentioned in Chapter 25 of LS, one of the qualities of Avalokitesvara, and ya you have become the 'miracle' for the blind old man).<br><br>Which practice is more meaningful and add value to humanity as a whole?<br><br>I am not sure with bod but I believe the rest of the readers would already have seen and understood my point.<br><br>In Chapter 16, where Sakyamuni Buddha told Matrieya Bodhisattva that the time He had used in perfecting the Parimitas is twice of His lifespan.<br><br>Now, wait a minute, how can one do something that is beyond one's lifespan?<br><br>Here Sakyamuni Buddha meant that the practice became part of His life and that the parimitas are no longer "practiced" but has become natural and part of the manner in how Buddha deal with other people!<br><br>Now the impression I have from the Tipitaka, is that Sakyamuni Buddha always exude this calmness, tranquil, kindness, encouraging speech, considerations for others, etc.<br><br>I don't see the <strong>whole</strong> of the Tipitaka "Om Mani Padme Hum" all the way.<br><br>Bod,<br><br>I don't consider myself to be any ivory tower. I just hope that buddhists would one day really dive into the Sutta Pitaka themselves and study the Dhamma instead of just following what is the mainstream is believing.<br><br>Ehipassiko.<br><br>Come and see, not come and just believe in hearsay. It is very easy for any religious followers to be delusioned if they have no idea in the rationality behind the practice they are undertaking.<br><br>As I had mentioned to AEN, I recite dhranis too. Chapter 26 of LS are full of dhranis. I have never doubt their prowess <strong>but</strong> I don't treat them as the <strong>only</strong> practice, I only see them as a complimentary practice to my belief.<br><br>Before you start 'advising' me of open my mind to other schools of thought, I believe I have never close in the first place. I also believe that different people will probably need different practising methods. However, I would appreciate more if the methods are practical and relevant to our daily lives. We are laypeople afterall.<br><br>And lastly, really, I am definitely okay with people who recite 6-syllabus mantra, or any other mantra or buddha-name, but I definitely do not agree if one is to say that recitation is the sole method to attain enlightenment. And I am a buddhists, not master-ist. Sakyamuni Buddha reminded us in the Parinibbana Sutta that we should infer the Dhamma not the person. Not saying these masters are no-good, but I see it as that the Buddha encouraged us to dwell into the Dhamma ourselves.<br><br>I believe and hope that at least the rest of the readers in this forum understood my stand because I believe that bod will probably missed my point again.</div>

His older brother, Mahapanthaka, was celebrated as an articulate and wise monk, a commanding figure in the Sangha, while Culapanthaka was the very opposite: dim-witted and bumbling in speech.

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm</a><br><br><strong>In cultivation, at what state of the mind does one awaken? What is the state of awakening like?<br><br>The correct concept of cultivation</strong><br><br>First of all we need to understand what is cultivation. Some people think that cultivation means not having an occupation but to be engaged in the daily activities of prayers to the Buddha, meditation or chanting the sutras. The actual purpose of cultivation is to eradicate our undesirable conduct and to maintain our good conduct. In other words, to follow the Bodhisattva path in emulating the practices of the Bodhisattvas. When we know the meaning of cultivation, then we understand its purpose, which is to eradicate our self serving and evil habits and thus reduce our negative karma. However, many people do not understand this principle and they misinterpret its meaning. Actually, not only those who have renounced to be Buddhist monks or nuns need to cultivate, lay-Buddhists also need to cultivate, if not more diligently. Even those who do not subscribe to any religion need to cultivate. Cultivation is not only a matter for monks or nuns alone.<br><br>What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation? Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you cultivating? I replied, "ThatÂ’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down! In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds, I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."<br><br>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a mistake. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates cultivating in the midst of our daily activities. Many retired old folks have no need to attend to household chores anymore, thus they can afford to spend their time to chant the names of the Buddhas and to cultivate in the midst of their leisure. However, there are many housewives who need to tend to their children, household chores and many other matters. How do you expect them to cultivate in their leisure? Thus, the need to cultivate in the midst of their activities; while cooking they could chant the names of the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas. No matter what activities they are engaged in, it is always possible to cultivate. Instead of gossipping about our neighbours and friends or engaging in other frivolous talks, why not refrain from all these. This is cultivation. Therefore, only when we cultivate in the midst of our activities do we understand the meaning of cultivation. To cultivate in our leisure may cause others a lot of frustrations. For example, a husband may be upset because his wife neglects the household by spending too much time chanting or running from temple to temple. For her to introduce Buddhism to her husband, thus, would not be an easy task. If she understands the principle of cultivating in the midst of her activities, it would be acceptable to the husband. Should he be invited to places of vice, he would know how to turn them down because his wife is a diligent cultivator. Both husband and wife are then cultivating at the same time.<br><br>There will be progress in our society when we understand the principle of cultivation. Otherwise, society will backslide. Over the last few decades, I have come to realize that we need to cultivate wherever we are. When we possess the correct concept of cultivation, any time is an appropriate time for cultivation, any place can be the place for us to seek enlightenment. If each and everyone of us conduct ourselves in this way, then the world will become a pure land. If we think that we can only cultivate in the temples, or that we cannot cultivate when we are working, then it is very possible that we commit evils deeds without even knowing. When we are with Buddha every moment, and cultivate constantly, then we are truly practitioners of Buddhism.<br><br>As to when in the cultivation process does one awaken and what it is like to be awakened, only when you follow the guidance of the Dharma and put it into practice, will you know you have awakened: when you drink the water, only you know how warm or cold it is.<br><br><strong>How do we practise Buddhism when we are so busy with our careers and constantly facing a shortage of time?<br><br>Cultivating amid our activities</strong><br><br>Many of us think that learning and practising Buddhism means utilising Sundays, our rest days or daily, to pray or meditate in temples. This perception is neither right nor wrong. We may be busy with our work and other activities, but, Buddhism is best practised amid these activities. Should one be totally inactive or free, what else is there to practise?<br><br>It is common to see people working and singing at the same time; machinists talking while working the machines; housewives working on their chores and exhorting their children at the same time; others work with their minds preoccupied with all sorts of other problems not related to their work. In short, they may be occupied physically, but mentally, their minds are not free or empty. As such, does learning and practising Buddhism really pose a problem to our heavy schedules? This is definitely not so. A verse from the "Seven Buddhas" reads: "Avoid all evils; do all that are good; purify oneÂ’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas".<br>So, we just need to purify our minds. While at work, although our body may be in action, it is actually amid these actions that we cultivate. The mind should not wander and the mouth should not chatter unnecessarily. We should concentrate on the work wholeheartedly, and constantly act on purifying our thoughts. This is practising Buddhism, and in fact it is the right approach. With this in mind, 	voice-cul2.jpg (8869 bytes)<br>the busier we are, the more opportunities we have in cultivating. Let us not treat Buddhism as a form of superstition and think that to practise means having to make extraordinary efforts such as going to the forests or temples to meditate or to chant.<br><br>A commuter, when travelling in a train for example, may emulate the mental purity of the Buddha, and listen to the rumbling of the wheels and at the same time rythmically chant the name of the Buddha or Bodhisattva so that the mind does not wander. Naturally the mind will become pure and calm. Learning Buddhism means emulating the mental purity of the Buddha. Buddha is one who has already attained perfect enlightenment, sublime wisdom and blessings. On the other hand the commoner has lesser blessings and wisdom. Still, he would have made tremendous advancements if he merely practises Buddhism amid his daily activities to the extent that he attains purity in his bodily actions, speech and thoughts.<br><br>Thus, no matter what we do, where we are or how busy we may be, we can still practise Buddhism. As long as we put this into practise, our wisdom will develop and our blessings will gradually grow. For this reason, Jen Chen Buddhism advocates practising amid the activities of our daily lives; practising without attaching to the notion of practice; maintaining awareness without attaching to the notion of awareness; and attaining without attaching to the notion of attainment. When we understand this principle and have no more confusions, we can be considered great practitioners of Buddhism....(cont. in webpage)<br><br>(continue reading in: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/cultivat.htm</a>)</div>

You should take it just to mean that the mind explains away what that is presented before it is understood by way of mere reflection.  Actually many images surfaced but are filtered or explain away very rapidly.  To the conscious mind, some of these images never even existed.  The mind is not even aware of their existence.  Nothing more than that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
