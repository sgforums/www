Killing: The first negative action is killing (literally, taking life) and involves the three emotions: hatred, attachment, and ignorance. When we regard someone as an enemy, or the enemy of someone we are trying to protect, the mind develops tremendous hatred. Regarding this individual or group as an enemy, we destroy them. This destruction involves the emotion of hate or anger (SHE-DANG). We could also kill beings through attachment, such as having attachment to their meat or fur. When we kill a being because of their meat, skin, or fur, the emotion of attachment is involved. It is also possible to kill through ignorance. Ignorance is the neutral state of not knowing why we are killing - we just enjoy killing. We do not regard the being we are killing to be our enemy. We do not have anger or hatred toward it. We are not killing because the being's fur or meat is useful to us. We are simply enjoying the act of killing, which is killing through ignorance. These are the unvirtuous actions of killing. When an individual engages in any type of killing, the result of this unvirtuous action is the certainty that this individual will experience inferior rebirth after their own death. A higher birth is never experienced as a result of killing, whether through attachment, anger, or ignorance. Not only will the individual experience an inferior rebirth, but during the next lifetime no matter what that individual tries to do, he or she will be unable to accomplish all of his or her goals. The individual will experience obstacles in life or career, which will prevent accomplishments. These obstacles are the result of the negative karma of killing; therefore, this is called unvirtuous.  We must learn to prevent that sort of unvirtuous action, as it is threatening to our lives and development.<br><br>To be continue:<br><br><a href="http://www.gotaro2.homestead.com/Page30.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotaro2.homestead.com/Page30.html</a><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Any unwholesome actions, speech and intention are the result of our ignorance which will lead to further suffering. In this case, the devious being is creating cause and condition for him to suffer. Sometimes, we also find ourselves blindly following the majority in our thoughts and actions for eg in this case prolly anger or hatred etc.<br><br>Ignorance is also the lack of understanding of how our mind is attached to impermanent things, of dharma.<br><br>PS PS PS: pls read this with wisdom and find out more.</span><br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>All that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with an evil thought, pain follows him, as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the carriage. All that that we are is the result of what we have thought: it is founded on our thoughts, it is made up of our thoughts. If a man speaks or acts with a pure thought, happiness follows him, like a shadow that never leaves him.<br><br>To control the eye is good; to control the ear is good; to control the nose is good; to control the tongue is good; to control the body is good; to control speech is good; to control the mind is good; good is control on every side. A bhikkhu (monk) who is thus controlled on every side is freed from all suffering.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pratitya-Samutpada - This is dependent origination, also known as conditioned arising, interdependent arising, conditional nexus, causal nexus.... It refers to the idea that, as long as we remain ignorant, clinging, and hateful, we will continue to create karma, and so continue to be reborn into this world full of suffering and pain. It is described using the metaphor of a wheel of life, wherein one thing inevitably leads to another.<br><br>Â“All psychological and physical phenomena constituting individual existence are interdependent and mutually condition each other...Â” which is what entangles us in samsara...<br><br>1. Ignorance (avidya) - "A" is ignorant of the dharma. The blind man cannot see the truth.<br>2. Impulses (samskara) - "A" therefore has intentions (karma), good, bad, or neutral, and acts on them. A potter creates a new pot from clay and water.<br>3. Consciousness (vijÃ±ana) - These create a new conscious being, "B," who enters a womb. A monkey, with no self control, jumps from one branch to another.<br>4. Name and form (namarupa) - "B" takes form. Three or four men in a boat: The body is the vehicle that carries us through life.<br>5. The six bases (shadayatana) - "B" comes into a world of objects ready to be experienced. House with doors and windows: The senses let in the world, like windows let light into a house.<br>6. Contact (sparsha) - "B" has contact with that world of objects. Lovers symbolize the intimate contact between world and mind.<br>7. Sensation (vedana) - "B" has perceptions of that world of objects. A man with an arrow in his eye: Sensations can be so strong that they blind us to the truth.<br>8. Craving (trishna) - "BÂ’s" perceptions give rise to desires. A man drinking: The promise of satisfaction only leads to intoxication.<br>9. Clinging (upadana) - Desire leads "B" to cling to life, even at death. Like a monkey clinging to a fruit tree, we cling to things.<br>10. Becoming (bhava) - And another conscious being, "C," is begun. A pregnant woman: A new life has begun.<br><br>PS:This is a brief introduction on dependent Origination.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Healing Hatred</strong><br><br>By His Holiness the Dalai Lama...<br><br>The destructive effects of hatred are very visible, very obvious and immediate. For example, when a strong or forceful thought of hatred arises, at that very instant it overwhelms one totally and destroys one's peace and presence of mind. When that hateful thought is harboured inside, it makes one feel tense and uptight, and can cause loss of appetite, leading to loss of sleep, and so forth. If we examine how anger or hateful thoughts arise in us, we will find that, generally speaking, they arise when we feel hurt, when we feel that we have been unfairly treated by someone against our expectations. If in that instant we examine carefully the way anger arises, there is a sense that it comes as a protector, comes as a friend that would help our battle or in taking revenge against the person who has inflicted harm on us. So the anger or hateful thought that arises appears to come as a shield or a protector.  But in reality that is an illusion. It is a very delusory state of mind. Chandrakirti states in Entry into the Middle Way that there might be some justification for responding to force with force if revenge would help one in any way, or prevent or reduce the harm which has already been inflicted. But that is not the case because if the harm, the physics, injury or whatever, has been inflicted, it has already taken place. So taking revenge will not in any way reduce or prevent that harm or injury because it has already happened. On the contrary, if one reacts to a situation in a negative way instead of in a tolerant way, not only is there no immediate benefit, but also a negative attitude and feeling is created which is the seed of one's future downfall. From the Buddhist point of view, the consequence of taking revenge has to be faced by the individual alone in his or he future life. So not only is there no immediate benefit, it is harmful in the long run for the individual. However, if one has been treated very unfairly and if the situation is left unaddressed, it may have extremely negative consequences for the perpetrator of the crime. Such a situation calls for a strong counteraction. Under such circumstances, it is possible that one can, out of compassion for the perpetrator of the crime and without generating anger or hatred, actually take a strong stand and take strong countermeasures. In fact, one of the precepts of the Bodhisattva vows is to take strong countermeasures when the situation calls for it. If a Bodhisattva doesn't take strong countermeasures when the situation requires, then that constitutes an infraction of one of the vows. In addition, as the Entry into the Middle Way points out, not only does the generation of hateful thoughts lead to undesirable forms of existence in future lives, but also, at the moment that strong feelings of anger arise, no matter how hard one tries to adopt a dignified pose, one's face looks rather ugly. There is an unpleasant expression, and the vibration that the person sends is very hostile. People can sense it, and it is almost as if one can feel steam coming out of that person's body. Indeed not only are human beings capable of sensing it, but pets and other animals also try to avoid that person at that instant. If we examine how anger or hateful thoughts arise in us, we will find that, generally speaking, they arise when we feel hurt, when we feel that we have been unfairly treated by someone against our expectations. These are the immediate consequences of hatred. It brings about a very ugly, unpleasant physical transformation of the individual. In addition, when such intense anger and hatred arise, it makes the best part of our brain, which is the ability to judge between right and wrong and assess long-term and short-term consequences, become totally inoperable. It can no longer function. It is almost as if the person had become crazy. These are the negative effects of generating anger and hatred. When we think about these negative and destructive effects of anger and hatred, we realise that it is necessary to distance ourselves from such emotional explosions. Insofar as the destructive effects of anger and hateful thoughts are concerned, one cannot get protection from wealth; even if one is a millionaire, one is subject to these destructive effects of anger and hatred. Nor can education guarantee that one will be protected from these effects. Similarly, the law cannot guarantee protection. Even nuclear weapons, no matter how sophisticated the defence system may be, cannot give one protection or defend one from these effects. The only factor that can give refuge or protection from the destructive effects of anger and hatred is the practice of tolerance and patience.<br><br><a href="http://www.gotaro3.homestead.com/Page47.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotaro3.homestead.com/Page47.html</a></div>
