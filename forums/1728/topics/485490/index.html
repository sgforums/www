                   in the earliest tradition of Buddhism, the Buddha himself have stated 
                  that the numbers of his lay followers attaining the stage of non 
                  returner were numbering in the range of thousand ( Majjhima Nikaya 73 ), likewise for lay 
                  once returners or lay </span></span><span><span><span>stream
                   enterers, in other words in addition to removing the first three 
                  fetters of self-view, attachment to rites and rituals, and skeptical 
                  doubt, a very substantial number of his lay students also attained the 
                  elimination of the fetter of 'sensual desire' and 'ill will', therefore 
                  they will no longer take birth in the sensual planes like the human and 
                  lower deva realms, and instead at most be reborn one more time in the 
                  pure abodes to attain arahantship there. That's non-tantric Buddhism.</span><br><br><span>Are
                   there lay arahants? Yes, a number of arahants have attained arahantship
                   as laymen in the suttas, however, interestingly all the laymen arahants
                   simply renounced after attaining full arahantship. Why is this so? I 
                  can only say, with my own logical deduction (since I am not arahant), 
                  that since arahants have cut off all attachments, they simply are 
                  completely unattached to worldly life, they have no more interest in 
                  living a worldly life or enjoying pleasures of the worldly life. They 
                  have no more attachments to family ties or material belongings at all, 
                  and see no more reason to continue living as a lay man. I think they 
                  would rather live a simple life of pleasant abiding in their nirvanic 
                  bliss. This however does not mean they no longer engage in human 
                  interactions - many arahants are known to have many students in dharma 
                  and continue to benefit many people.</span><br><br><span>Now
                   when it comes to later forms of Buddhism, like Mahayana Buddhism, (even
                   before the formation of Tantric Buddhism), there is becoming greater 
                  and greater emphasis on the role of a lay person in Buddhism. It does 
                  not mean that laymen have no role in Theravada Buddhism - in the suttas,
                   one of the layman (I think was either a sakadagami or an anagami) was 
                  designated as the 'best lay dharma teacher' (in fact - one best lay Male
                   and one best lay Female lay dharma teacher) basically by the Buddha, 
                  which also indicates his approval for experienced laymen and laywomen to
                   teach the dharma, and the potential for laymen to be advanced in dharma
                   practice and knowledge... nonetheless later on as the Theravada 
                  tradition developed it would appear that the emphasis has been more on 
                  the monastic community. It is unfortunate that in many Asian Theravada 
                  countries, most lay people only aim for gaining merits (e.g. through 
                  giving alms to monks) to be reborn in a higher realm or as a monk in the
                   future lifetime, since they do not believe it is realistic for them to 
                  attain awakening and liberation as a lay person. This is without any 
                  scriptural basis, since their scriptures clearly state that there were 
                  abundance of awakened lay persons. This is especially so in recent 
                  centuries whereby Theravada has degenerated quite a bit, and it is only 
                  in the recent 1-2 century that there has been revival of the vipassana 
                  practices and emphasis on bringing dharma to lay practitioners, which 
                  has seen very good results so far. More and more people - monastic and 
                  lay practitioners alike are learning to do vipassana meditation. </span><br><br><span>So,
                   it is accepted notion even in the earliest tradition that laymen have 
                  great potential to attain liberation, and that Nirvana is not limited 
                  only for monastic monks and nuns. Nonetheless there is more emphasis on 
                  cultivation and practice within the monastic context.</span><br><br><span>The
                   Mahayana further shifts the focus away from monastic to the lay people 
                  and community. i.e. all the images of Bodhisattvas you see are almost 
                  always in the form of laymen, there is only Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva 
                  which manifested as a monastic monk. In the Vimalakirti Sutra, the 
                  Vimalakirti Bodhisattva is a 10th stage bhumi bodhisattva living as a 
                  lay person completely engaged in living the lay life and benefitting 
                  people in all walks of life, which probably became the role model for 
                  the emphasis of 'entering the marketplace' in Zen Buddhism. Because of 
                  this, laymen are seen in Mahayana (including non-tantric) Buddhism to be
                   as equally capable of attaining the fruition of spiritual life as a 
                  monastic person.</span><br><br><span>"The
                   character of Vimalakirti is a pretext to express the teaching on 
                  emptiness âŽ¯ the ungraspability of phenomena âŽ¯ the most difficult aspect 
                  of the Buddhist teachings. He manifests this aspect by presenting 
                  seemingly contradictory characteristics: he lives alone yet he is 
                  surrounded by many servants; he lives a life of celibacy yet has a wife 
                  and children. He takes the teachings of the Buddha into every context: 
                  bars, brothels, schools and the market place. Vimalakirti is completely 
                  integrated within Indian society and, as a fictional figure, he 
                  illustrates integration in any type of society." -- </span><a dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.vimalakirtiusa.org/about_vimalakirti.html">http://www.vimalakirtiusa.org/about_vimalakirti.html</a><br><br><span>The
                   practice and engagement of the 10 paramitas (or 6) in the daily life 
                  becomes of utmost importance, allowing the twofold cultivation of merits
                   and wisdom so necessary for the attainment of full Buddhahood. It is in
                   fact in the very mundane activities of daily life and interactions that
                   allows us the opportunity to attain the ten perfections (paramitas) 
                  that allows us to attain full Buddhahood. The paramitas are not just 
                  'mundane qualities', but the actualization of awakened wisdom - for 
                  example, the perfection of generosity is not just the ability to give 
                  lots of money to other people, but rather, the selfless giving freed 
                  from any confusion of a giver-giving-gift. The wisdom of the emptiness 
                  of self and phenomena allows our act of generosity to be perfected. When
                   our giving transcends giver-giving-gift, without attachments we 
                  relinquish and give and sacrifice for other beings out of genuine 
                  compassion, that is true generosity. The cultivation of the ten 
                  paramitas in conjunction of the wisdom of emptiness is itself a method 
                  for the liberation of taints, and does not require tantric methods, 
                  though one can very well implement them.<br><br></span></span></span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span>It
                   is said that at each of the ten bhumi stages, one of the perfections 
                  have been perfected. For example, the first bhumi perfects the 
                  perfection of generosity, second bhumi the perfection of precepts, so on
                   and so forth... all these are part of the so</span></span><span><span><span> called 'common/non-tantric Mahayana' path.</span><br><br><span>In short, in the Mahayana (even non-tantric) path, as Huayan Patriarch Cheng'guan explained ( </span><a dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/httpssites.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/.../httpssites...</a><span> ), the essential wisdom that allows for the twofold liberation of 
                  afflictive obscurations and knowledge obscurations is the wisdom of 
                  twofold emptiness (this is similar to Tantric Buddhism as well). Then 
                  there is the emphasis on cultivating the paramitas.</span><br><br><span>If you're asking about specific meditation methods, there are lots of meditation methods.</span><br><br><span>For
                   example in the early tradition, i.e. the suttas, Theravada, etc, the 
                  four foundations of mindfulness are said to lead someone to the stage of
                   non-returner and arahant, in at most 7 years and as little as 7 days 
                  (mahasatipatthana sutta). I would think that would mean practicing them 
                  in a very diligent manner and not merely in a half hearted way. There 
                  are many methods involved in the four foundations of mindfulness, from 
                  anapanasati, to the contemplation of the impurities of the body. 
                  Different methods are taught with different emphasis. For example, the 
                  practice of the mindfulness of breathing is very suitable for someone 
                  with a very distracted and wandering mind, full of discursive thinking. 
                  Anapanasati is very suitable for developing the sort of calm abiding, 
                  mental samadhi, etc. Whereas, the contemplation of the impurities of the
                   body can lead to the elimination of sensual lust. So there are also in 
                  fact many kinds of practices in the early tradition that can help 
                  overcome the taints.</span><br><br><span>In
                   Theravada Buddhism, there are number of different systems of vipassana 
                  being practiced nowadays, including for example the Mahasi Sayadaw's 
                  system which emphasizes the technique of 'noting' and the progress of 
                  insight based on Venerable Buddhaghosa's Visudhimagga, as well as the 
                  Goenka's system of vipassana practices. One similarity between them is 
                  that both emphasizes mindfulness of one's direct perception/sensations 
                  and being mindful of the three dharma seals of impermanence, 
                  unsatisfactoriness and non-self in direct experience. This leads to 
                  direct insight and realization.</span><br><br><span>The
                   Mahayana (non-tantric) tradition has its own set of shamatha and 
                  vipashyana teachings. Venerable Dharmamitra has a number of translations
                   including Master Zhiyi's meditation manual of the Tiantai tradition's 
                  shamatha-vipashyana methods: </span><a dir="ltr" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.kalavinka.org/">http://www.kalavinka.org/</a><span> . Due to a large number of various Mahayana traditions, there are focus
                   on different methods of practices, however the many non-tantric sects 
                  of Mahayana Buddhism have in recent centuries died out only leaving Zen 
                  and Pure Land Buddhism. Zen has a system of zazen, koan, 
                  practice-enlightenment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

               anatta does not mean that at once you will overcome all sense of 
              grasping and mine-making. Something Thusness wrote years ago concerning 
              the difference between I-making and mine-making:</span><br><br><span>Hi Simpo,</span></span><span><span><br><span>How have you been getting on?  I am planning for my retirement. </span><br><br><span>I
               think after stabilizing non-dual experience and maturing the insight of
               anatta, practice must turn towards ‘self-releasing’ and ‘dispassion’ 
              rather than intensifying ‘non-dual’ luminosity.  Although being bare in 
              attention or naked in awareness will help in dissolving the sense of ‘I’
               and division, we must also look into dissolving the sense of ‘mine’.  
              In my opinion, dissolving of the sense of ‘I’ does not equate to 
              dissolving the sense of ‘mine’ and attachment to possessions can still 
              be strong even after very stable non-dual experience.  This is because 
              the former realization only mange to eliminate the dualistic tendency 
              while the latter requires us to embody and actualize the right view of 
              ‘emptiness’.   Very seldom do we realize it has a lot to do with our 
              ‘view’ that we hold in our deep most consciousness.   We must allow our 
              luminous essence to meet differing conditions to realise the latent 
              deep.  All our body cells are imprinted and hardwired to ‘hold’.  Not to
               under-estimate it. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
