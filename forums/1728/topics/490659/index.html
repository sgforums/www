              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Imagine sitting down in front of a mirror. Your face automatically
              appears. There is no effort required; the mirror is doing all the work. You
              can’t do it right or wrong. The Zen Buddhist practice of “just sitting” is like
              that. When we sit, our mind automatically begins to display itself to us. Our
              practice is to observe and experience what appears moment after moment. Of
              course, just as when we look in a real mirror, things don’t stay that simple
              for long.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We notice how our faces or our bodies look in the mirror, and we
              immediately have an emotional reaction and form judgments about what we see.
              Rainer Maria Rilke wrote that Paul Cezanne was capable of painting a
              self-portrait with utter objectivity, of looking at his own face with no more
              reaction than “a dog which sees itself in a mirror and thinks, 'Here is another
              dog.’” For the rest of us, it’s not so easy to simply observe who we are.
              Looking in the mirror, we are tempted to use it as a makeup mirror to touch up
              the parts of our self-image we don’t like.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Our minds are never what we want them to be. That’s part of why we sit
              in the first place. We are uncomfortable with ourselves as we are. The greatest
              dualism we face is the split between who we are and who we think we ought to
              be. Sometimes that gap fuels our aspiration to follow Buddhist teachings,
              sometimes it simply fuels our self-hatred, and all too often we confuse these
              two notions of self entirely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Just sitting means sitting still with all of the aspects of ourselves
              that we came to Buddhist practice in order to avoid or change—our restlessness,
              our anxiety, our fear, our anger, our wandering minds. Our practice is to just
              watch, to just feel. We watch our minds. Minds think. There’s no problem with
              that; minds just do what they do. Ordinarily we get caught up in the content of
              our thoughts, but when we just sit, we observe ourselves just thinking. Our
              body’s most basic activity is breathing: No matter what else is going on, we
              are breathing. We sit and breathe, and we feel the sensation of our breath in
              our bodies. Often there is tension or even pain somewhere in our bodies as
              well. We sit and feel that too and keep breathing. Whatever thoughts come,
              come. Whatever feelings come, come. We are not sitting there to fight off our
              thoughts or try to make ourselves stop thinking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When we sit, we realize how unwilling we are to leave anything about ourselves
              alone. We turn our lives into one endless self-improvement project. All too
              often what we call meditation or spirituality is simply incorporated into our
              obsession with self-criticism and self-improvement. I’ve encountered many
              students who have attempted to use meditation to perform a spiritual lobotomy
              on themselves—trying to excise, once and for all, their anger, their fear,
              their sexuality. We have to sit with our resistance to feeling whole, to
              feeling all those painful and messy parts of ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Just sitting means just that. That “just” endlessly goes against the
              grain of our need to fix, transform, and improve ourselves. The paradox of our
              practice is that the most effective way of transformation is to leave ourselves
              alone. The more we let everything be just what it is, the more we relax into an
              open, attentive awareness of one moment after another. Just sitting leaves
              everything just as it is.<br> <br> <strong>May We All Be Happy...<br> </strong>Metta meditation instruction from author and teacher Gil Fronsdal</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>May all beings be happy.<br> May they live in safety and joy.<br> All living beings,<br> Whether weak or strong,<br> Tall, stout, average, or short,<br> Seen or unseen, near or distant,<br> Born or to be born,<br> May they all be happy.<br> —From the Metta Sutta, Sutta Nipata I.8</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Metta, or lovingkindness, is one of the most important Buddhist
              practices. Simply stated, metta is the heartfelt wish for the well-being of
              oneself and others. When describing metta, the Buddha used the analogy of the
              care a mother gives her only child. Lovingkindness is also understood as the
              innate friendliness of an open heart. Its close connection to friendship is
              reflected in its similarity to the Pali word for friend, <em>mitta</em>. However,
              metta is more than conventional friendship, for it includes being openhearted
              even toward one’s enemies, developed from insight into our shared humanity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Metta practice is the cultivation of our capacity for lovingkindness. It
              does not involve either positive thinking or the imposition of an artificial
              positive attitude. There is no need to feel loving or kind during metta
              practice. Rather, we meditate on our good intentions, however weak or strong
              they may be, and water the seeds of these intentions. When we water wholesome
              intentions instead of expressing unwholesome ones, we develop those wholesome
              tendencies within us. If these seeds are never watered, they won’t grow. When
              watered by regular practice, they grow, sometimes in unexpected fashions. We
              may find that lovingkindness becomes the operating motivation in a situation
              that previously triggered anger or fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>To practice lovingkindness meditation, sit in a comfortable and relaxed
              manner. Take two or three deep breaths with slow, long, and complete
              exhalations. Let go of any concerns or preoccupations. For a few minutes, feel
              or imagine the breath moving through the center of your chest in the area of
              your heart.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Metta is first practiced toward oneself, since we often have difficulty
              loving others without first loving ourselves. Sitting quietly, mentally repeat,
              slowly and steadily, the following or similar phrases: <em>May I be happy. May I
              be well. May I be safe. May I be peaceful and at ease.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>While you say these phrases, allow yourself to sink into the intentions
              they express. Lovingkindness meditation consists primarily of connecting to the
              intention of wishing ourselves or others happiness. However, if feelings of
              warmth, friendliness, or love arise in the body or mind, connect to them,
              allowing them to grow as you repeat the phrases. As an aid to the meditation,
              you might hold an image of yourself in your mind’s eye. This helps reinforce
              the intentions expressed in the phrases.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>After a period of directing lovingkindness toward yourself, bring to
              mind a friend or someone in your life who has deeply cared for you. Then slowly
              repeat phrases of lovingkindness toward them:<em> May you be happy. May you be
              well. May you be safe. May you be peaceful and at ease.</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As you say these phrases, again sink into their intention or heartfelt
              meaning. And again, if any feelings of lovingkindness arise, connect the
              feelings with the phrases so that the feelings may become stronger as you
              repeat the words.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As you continue the meditation, you can bring to mind other friends,
              neighbors, acquaintances, strangers, animals, and finally people with whom you
              have difficulty. You can either use the same phrases, repeating them again and
              again, or make up phrases that better represent the lovingkindness you feel
              toward these beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Sometimes during lovingkindness meditation, seemingly opposite feelings
              such as anger, grief, or sadness may arise. Take these to be signs that your
              heart is softening, revealing what is held there. You can either shift to
              mindfulness practice or you can—with whatever patience, acceptance, and
              kindness you can muster for such feelings—direct lovingkindness toward them.
              Above all, remember that there is no need to judge yourself for having these
              feelings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As you become familiar with lovingkindness practice during meditation,
              you can also begin to use it in your daily life. While in your car, or at work,
              or in public, privately practice metta toward those around you. There can be a
              great delight in establishing a heartfelt connection to everyone we encounter,
              friends and strangers alike.<br> <br> <strong>Wisdom Arising<br> </strong>Sri Lankan monk Bhante Henepola Gunaratana on training the mind’s eye with
              Vipassana meditation</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Vipassana, or Insight meditation, is a way of training the mind to see
              things in a very special way as they happen. Seeing without using eyes is a
              special way of seeing. We train the mind to use our innate wisdom without using
              words, concepts, logic, or interpretation. In this training, concentration and
              mindfulness are united. Then wisdom arises and disintegrates what appears to be
              integrated. Our wisdom eye registers the constant flux of events that is taking
              place in every moment in our lives. Although this unbroken flux of events is
              what life is, one cannot be fully aware of this truth without paying attention
              to what is happening to one’s mind and body every waking moment. With developed
              insight, our mind can be fully aware of the evolving, processing, and
              dissolving of everything that happens to us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>So we train the mind to see things as they happen, neither before nor
              after. And we don’t cling to the past, the future, or even to the present. We participate
              in what is happening and at the same time observe it without clinging to the
              events of the past, the future, or the present. We experience our ego or self
              arising, dissolving, and evaporating without leaving a trace of it. We see how
              our greed, anger, and ignorance vanish as we see the reality in life. Mindfully
              we watch the body, feelings, sensations, perceptions, and consciousness and
              experience their dynamic nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Watching impartially opens the mind to realize that there is no way that
              we can stop this flux even for a fraction of a second. We experience the
              freshness of life. Every moment is a new moment. Every breath is a fresh
              breath. Every tiny little thing is living and dying every fraction of a second.
              There is no way that we can see these momentary existences with our eyes. Only
              when the mind is sharp and clear, without the clouds of craving, hatred, and
              confusion can our mind be fully aware of this phenomenon. When we don’t try to
              cling to these experiences, we experience great joy, happiness, and peace. The
              moment we try to cling to any part of our experience—however pleasant or
              peaceful—joy, peace, and happiness disappear. The very purpose of Vipassana
              meditation is to liberate the mind from psychic irritation and enjoy the peace
              and happiness of liberation. Nevertheless, if we cling to peace or happiness,
              that instant that very peace and happiness vanish. This is a very delicate
              balance that we should maintain through the wisdom that arises from Vipassana
              meditation.<br> <br> <strong>Awakening, Step by Step<br> </strong>Insight Meditation teacher Peter Doobinin introduces walking meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Walking meditation is a practice through which we develop concentration
              and mindfulness. We learn to cultivate mindfulness of the body while the body
              is moving. We learn to be awake. Walking meditation is a particularly important
              practice in that it enables us to make the transition from sitting meditation
              to being awake in our daily lives, in our work, and in our relationships. In
              the end, that’s what it’s all about.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Walking meditation is a simple practice. You choose a straight
              path—indoors or outdoors—roughly fifteen or twenty steps long. You walk from
              one end of the path to the other, turn around, and walk back. You continue in
              this fashion, walking back and forth, focusing your attention on your feet.
              Your posture is upright, alert, and relaxed. You can hold your hands at your
              sides, or clasped in front or behind. Keep your eyes open, cast down, and
              slightly ahead. You can experiment with your pace, perhaps walking quite slowly
              or at a more regular speed, in an effort to find the pace at which you’re most
              present. As you walk, direct your attention to the sensations in the feet, to
              the bare experience of walking. Try to feel one step at time. Be fully,
              wholeheartedly aware of the physical sensations involved in taking each step.
              Feel your foot as it lifts, moves through the air, places down against the
              ground. In particular, pay attention to the touching down of the foot, the
              sensations of contact, and pressure. Remember that you’re feeling each step,
              you’re not thinking about the foot, or visualizing it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>You’ll find, of course, that it isn’t always easy to stay focused on the
              meditation object, the sensations in the feet. The mind wanders, drifts. Your
              job is to notice when you’ve strayed, when you’re lost in thought. Be aware
              that you’ve wandered. And return gently to the physical sensations, the
              lifting, moving, placing of the foot. Just keep bringing your attention back.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As you walk, cultivate a sense of ease. There’s no hurry to get
              anywhere, no destination to reach. You’re just walking. This is a good
              instruction: just walk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>As you walk, as you let go of the desire to get somewhere, you begin to
              sense the joy in simply walking, in being in the present moment. You begin to
              comprehend the preciousness of each step. It’s an extraordinarily precious
              experience to walk on this earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>You can start by practicing walking meditation for ten minutes a day.
              Gradually, you can expand the amount of time you spend on this formal walking meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>In addition to this kind of formal practice, you’ll want to practice
              walking meditation in “real life” situations. You can practice “informally”
              just about anywhere, walking along a city sidewalk, down the aisle in the
              supermarket, or across the backyard. As always, the objective is to pay
              attention. Pay attention to your feet. Or pay attention to your whole body—the
              felt experience of your body as it’s moving. In this informal context, you’re
              aware, to some extent, of what’s going on around you, but your focus is on your
              walking. Practicing in this way, you begin to live more mindfully. This is when
              meditation practice takes hold and assumes a new relevancy. Being awake is no
              longer reserved for the times you spend in formal sitting meditation; it is the
              way you live.<br> <br> <strong>Hot and Heavy, Cool and Light<br> </strong>Naropa University’s Judith Simmer-Brown on the Tibetan Buddhist practice of
              tonglen</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Tonglen, literally “giving and taking,” is a Tibetan practice for
              cultivating compassion, the Mahayana path of the bodhisattva. The great master
              Atisha brought Tibetans this practice from India in the eleventh century.
              Tonglen reverses the pattern of self-cherishing that is the knot of our
              personal suffering. Using breathing as the basis, tonglen opens our hearts to
              those things we would rather avoid and encourages us to share what we would
              rather keep for ourselves. The practice shows that there are no real boundaries
              between living beings—we are all interdependent.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We begin tonglen by taking our seats in meditation with good posture,
              very simply and naturally. We ask, why would we want to do this practice?
              Fundamentally it is vast and choiceless. We recognize that the purpose of our
              human life is huge, to grow larger hearts and open minds, and we celebrate that
              we can do this in this moment. We are ready for transformation. Glimpsing this
              motivation begins the practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Then we become aware of our breathing, in and out, and establish the
              flow of the practice. On the in-breath, we breathe in thinking, “heavy, thick,
              hot,” and on the out-breath, we breathe out thinking, “light, bright, cool.” At
              first it seems only like words, but it is good to develop a literal sense of
              this. My teacher, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, suggested that we think of
              ourselves as air conditioners. We breathe in the stale, smoky, fetid air of the
              room around us, and we breathe out fresh, clean, cool air. We gradually purify
              the room. When we breathe, we are breathing with every pore of our bodies, in
              with “heavy, thick, hot,” and out with “light, bright, cool.” Do this for
              roughly one-third of the twenty-minute session, or until the texture is
              established.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Next, we breathe with a continuing sense of the texture we have
              established. But now we open our thoughts and emotions to all of our personal
              material. It is good to start with those who spontaneously arouse our
              compassion. Is there someone we know who is sick or in emotional turmoil? We
              begin with that person’s face before us and breathe in their heavy, thick, and
              hot suffering, sharing with them our own light, bright, and cool energy. Be
              quite tangible with the texture. Whatever suffering we see in them, we breathe
              it in; whatever sanity and kindness we see in ourselves, we breathe it out to
              them. When we are ready, extend beyond our loved ones to more difficult people.
              Are there people we see as threatening or as problematic in our lives? We allow
              their faces to come to us and then breathe in their suffering and extend to
              them our sanity and kindness. We are practicing embracing what we would
              normally avoid, and sharing what we would normally hoard. Do this part of the
              practice for seven to ten minutes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>We conclude the practice by extending it out beyond our familiar world.
              One way to do this is to move geographically. We begin in our immediate
              neighborhood, with the family next door with the two babies, to the college
              student on the other side who takes terrible care of her lawn, to the elderly
              woman across the street who recently lost her husband. We move to those people
              we encounter on our daily routines—our coworkers and our boss; the grocery
              checker and stock boy; the employees at the cleaners, the gas station, and the
              video store. Then we extend through our community, to the hospital, the
              shelter, the jail, the nursing home, including everyone suffering there. And we
              extend to our state, region, country, and world, our minds going to the painful
              situations there that are described in the newspaper—the wars, famines,
              epidemics. We also include the CEOs, the political leaders, and the people of
              privilege. We extend this practice until the twenty-minute session is over.
              Then we conclude with a simple session of meditation again.<br> <br> <strong>Body as Path: The Buddha’s instructions on the practice of mindfulness
