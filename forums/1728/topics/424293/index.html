              <p>The thing is, bear in mind the reply from MJK camp which had prompted the ongoing so call voicing out of my opinion. (And also some threads on the issue been locked up, and I bor bian have to start another thread to get to the bottom of the issue...) The MJK camp keep on finding excuses, thats why the whole thing just turn out to be so long winded. If they didn't come up with all kind of excuses, the issue would have settled long time ago.</p>
              <p>I apologize for my unskillful communication. I should have go ruthlessly straightforward, and the issue would have ended earlier. But its only until recently, then I buckle up and be as straightforward, and as blunt and to the point, instead of get carried away, sidetracked and tangle up with unnecessary debate. My apology.</p>

              Hello Zenist69, you have created negative emotions around yourself, 
              <div>affecting others to react in a negative manner.</div>
              <div>Raising doubts about any issue is not a problem. You can always</div>
              <div>post videos and direct quotation of any doubtful practice in whole.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>However, you lack objectivity.</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>If I want to say anything about you, I do it in your presence, giving </div>
              <div>you a chance to rebut me. I do not make sweeping or accuse a </div>
              <div>person or a group, without giving the accused the benefit of the doubt.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>This is a fundamental in being an honorable person.</div>
              <div>Anybody is free to rebut me on this point.</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>You have no wish to really to engage anybody in meaningful manner</div>
              <div>on your pet peeve. You only wish to a result, demonization and </div>
              <div>castigation of anything related to MJK.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I desisted a rebuttal when you switched to using mandarin to make </div>
              <div>your case, maybe then, you don't feel so hot and bothered. </div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Hope you have realised that anybody can play you like  </div>
              <div>a clown by pushing the MJK button.</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I really hoped you cool down a bit and learn  to engage </div>
              <div>yourself in skillful manner. Unfortunately, you have created a vicious</div>
              <div>cycle where you are currently unable to extricate yourself. </div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Do you feel happy? And do you wish to feel happy?</div>
              <div>Do you also wish others to be happy?</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>There are others I know whotruly have doubts about MJK, however,</div>
              <div>in this negative atmosphere. It is very difficult for any to comment</div>
              <div>without taking an adversarial position. you have clouded the issue</div>
              <div>with negative emotions.  These people cannot air their views with</div>
              <div>being accused of damning MJK.</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Please move on to more beneficial practice.!</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I sincerely hope any happy readers not let negative emotions affect </div>
              <div>them when dealing Zenist69. Like how the Buddha imposed the </div>
              <div>brahmadanda on Channa, his charioteer. </div>
              <div>For those who have arisen negative emotions, also</div>
              <div>Please let it go!</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Please transfer merits of goodwilland loving kindness  to Zenist69! </div>

              <p>Zenist69 is  not a bad guy.</p>
              <p>He is a good buddhist. He points out things that are valid</p>
              <p>But Zenist69 you must remember not to attack a ordained person.</p>
              <p>That will bring a lot of bad merits to you.</p>
              <p>There must be reasons why jing kong shifu did what he did.</p>
              <p>I am sure that he knew he will be attacked by putting  non-buddhist teaching into</p>
              <p>buddhism.</p>
              <p>He is sad that morals is down in this dharma ending age.</p>
