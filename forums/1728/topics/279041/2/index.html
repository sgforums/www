Isn't it just another thought?</div></blockquote>excerpts from Chapter: Bodhisattva Samantabhadra<br>(Sutra of Complete Enlightenment)<br><br>Â“Virtuous man, all illusory projections of sentient beings arise from the wondrous mind of the TathagataÂ’s Complete Enlightenment, just like flowers in the sky which come into existence from out of the sky. When the illusory flower vanishes, the nature of the sky is not marred. Likewise, the illusory mind of sentient beings relies on illusory [cultivation] for its extinction. When all illusions are extinguished, the enlightened mind remains unmoved. Speaking of enlightenment in contrast to illusion is itself an illusion. To say that enlightenment exists is to not have left illusion yet. [However], to say that enlightenment does not exist is also no different. Therefore, the extinction of illusion is called the unmoving [mind of enlightenment].<br><br>Â“Virtuous man, all bodhisattvas and sentient beings in the Dharma Ending Age should separate [themselves] from all illusory projections and deluded realms. [However], when one clings firmly to the mind that separates [from all illusory projections and deluded realms], this mind [should also be taken as] an illusion, and one should separate oneself from it. Because this separation is an illusion, it should also be separated. One should then be free from even this Â‘separating from the illusion of separation!Â’ When there remains nothing to be seperated from, all illusions are eliminated. It is like rubbing two pieces of wood together to obtain fire. When the fire ignites and the wood completely burns, the ashes fly away and the smoke vanishes. Using illusion to remedy illusion is just like this. Yet even though illusions are exhausted, one does not enter annihilation.<br></div>

Unless you understand what invoking means, youÂ’ll do it wrong. And if you do it wrong, youÂ’ll never go anywhere.<br><br>Buddha means awareness, the awareness of body and mind that prevents evil from arising in either. And to invoke means to call to mind, to call constantly to mind the rules of discipline and to follow them with all your might. This is whatÂ’s meant by invoking. Invoking has to do with thought and not with language. If you use a trap to catch fish, once you succeed you can forget the trap. And if you use language to find meaning, once you find it you can forget language. To invoke the BuddhaÂ’s name you have to understand the Dharma of invoking. If itÂ’s not present in your mind, your mouth chants an empty name. As long as youÂ’re troubled by the three poisons or by thoughts of yourself, your deluded mind will keep you from seeing the Buddha and youÂ’ll only waste your effort. Chanting and invoking are worlds apart, Chanting is done with the mouth. Invoking is done with the mind. And because invoking comes from the mind, itÂ’s called the door to awareness. Chanting is centered in the mouth and appears as sound. If you cling to appearances while searching for meaning, you wonÂ’t find a thing. Thus, sages of the past cultivated introspection and not speech. This mind is the source of all virtues. And this mind is the chief of all powers, The eternal bliss of nirvana comes from the mind at rest. Rebirth in the three realms also comes from the mind. The mind is the door to every world and the mind is the ford to the other shore. Those who know where the door is donÂ’t worry about reaching it. Those who know where the ford is donÂ’t worry about crossing it.</div>
