              <p>Ven Pesala:</p>
              <p>The primary goal should be to avoid rebirth in the lower realms. To be 
              sure of that we should strive to attain at least the first stage of 
              Stream-winning in this very life. That is not nearly as difficult at to 
              attain Arahantship and put an end to all suffering. <br><br>I would say that most people have the ability to attain Stream-winning <span style="font-style: italic;">if they really work hard for it,</span> but most of us just do not try hard enough. Very few individuals have 
              killed their own mother or father, or an Arahant, or caused a schism in 
              the Sangha. No one alive today could have drawn the blood of a 
              TathÄ�gata. Only these five kammas are heavy enough to make the 
              attainment of nibbÄ�na impossible in this very life. <br><br>Then there are those who aspire to attain Omnscient Buddhahood. <a class="postlink" href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Ledi/Uttama/Perfections/perfections.html#NoblestAspiration">The Noblest Aspiration</a> will prevent them from attaining nibbÄ�na in this very life, even though
               they have adequate perfections to do so if they wished to. <br><br>Then
               there are those with mental defects, commonly called mentally retarded,
               who lack the wisdom facility. They are also incapable of meditating 
              effectively as they are incapable of controlling their minds even to the
               extent of looking after their own physical needs.<br><br>Then there are
               those who have obstructive kamma such as insulting a Noble One. they 
              can also attain nibbÄ�na if they ask for forgiveness, but not otherwise. 
              That is why there is a tradition of asking for forgiveness before 
              undertaking a retreat. Those monks who have committed some offence, but 
              conceal it without confessing it are in the same position. Lay persons 
              who do not keep the precepts also have obstructive kamma. Those who 
              disparage meditation practice, or believe that it is no longer possible 
              to attain nibbÄ�na in this era, also have obstructive kamma.<br><br>Then 
              there are those who hold extreme wrong views such as annihilationists 
              and eternalists, or those who deny the Enlightenment of the Buddha or 
              the law of kamma. They can attain nibbÄ�na if they straighten their wrong
               views by studying the Tipitaka and questioning those learned in the 
              Dhamma. <br><br>Lastly, there is one other person who is incapable of 
              realising nibbÄ�na in this very life. Should I tell you who it is? That 
              person might be embarrassed and stop coming to waste their time posting 
              on Dhamma Wheel. Nevertheless I should say who it is. <br><br><br> <img title="Stirring the pot" src="http://www.dhammawheel.com/images/smilies/stirthepot.gif" alt=":stirthepot:"> <br><br><br><br><br> <img title="Juggling a million things" src="http://www.dhammawheel.com/images/smilies/juggling.gif" alt=":juggling:"> <br><br><br><br><br><br> <img title="Bored" src="http://www.dhammawheel.com/images/smilies/zzz.gif" alt=":zzz:"> <br><br><br><br><br>The lazy person is incapable of realising nibbÄ�na.</p>
