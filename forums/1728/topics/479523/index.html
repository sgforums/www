Well, Buddhist teaching about time can be a bit daunting, also.</span></span></p>

First is an explanation of measurements of time in Buddhist scriptures. Second is a basic explanation of how time is understood from the perspective of enlightenment.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There are two Sanskrit words for measurements of time found in Buddhist scripture, <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #333333;    '>ksana</span></em> and <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #333333;    '>kalpa</span></em>.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">A <em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #333333;    '>ksana</span></em> is a tiny unit of time, approximately one seventy-fifth of a second. I understand this is a generous amount of time compared to a nanosecond. But for purposes of understanding the sutras, it probably isn't necessary to measure ksana precisely.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

For example, it is said there are 900 arisings and ceasings within each ksana. I suspect the number 900 is not meant to be precise but rather is a poetic way of saying "a lot."</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

There are small, medium, great, and uncountable (<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif"; color: #333333;    '>asamhyeya</span></em>) kalpas. Over the centuries various scholars have attempted to quantify kalpas in various ways. Usually, when a sutra mentions kalpas, it means a really, really, really long time.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Once every hundred years, someone wipes the mountain with a small piece of silk. The mountain will be worn away before the kalpa ends, the Buddha said.</span></span></p>

These can mean one of two things. Sometimes it just means past, present, and future. But sometimes the three time periods or three ages are something else entirely.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Sometimes "three periods of time" refers to the Former Day, Middle Day, and Latter Day of the Law (or </span><a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/basicbuddhistteachings/a/What-Is-Dharma-In-Buddhism.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff;">Dharma</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;">). The Former Day is the thousand-year period after the life of the Buddha in which dharma is taught and practiced correctly. The Middle Day is the next thousand years (or so), in which dharma is practiced and understood superficially. The Latter Day lasts for 10,000 years, and in this time the dharma completely degenerates.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; " lang="EN"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Is this important? It depends. In some schools the three periods of time are considered important and discussed quite a bit. In others they are pretty much ignored.</span></span></p>

Very basically, in most schools of Buddhism it is understood that the way we experience time -- as flowing from past to present to future -- is an illusion. Further, it could be said that the liberation of </span><a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/abuddhistglossary/g/nirvanadef.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff;">Nirvana</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> is liberation from time and space.</span></span></p>

These are past, present, future, and timeless time. This is sometimes expressed as the "three times and timeless time."</span></span></p>

The Dzogchen texts I have read hint that time is empty of self-nature, as are all phenomena, and manifests according to causes and conditions. In the absolute reality (</span><a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhismglossaryd/g/dharmakaya.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #0000ff;">dharmakaya</span></span></a><span style="font-family: Calibri;">) time disappears, as do all other distinctions.</span></span></p>

              walk from point A to B, which implies distance,  space and time, 
              deconstructs when we realize there is no atemporal abiding entity or 
              self that is the traveller (this implies I am a truly existing atemporal
               self that is separate from time/the stream of transient phenomenality, 
              which is not the case). In fact there is not even  'traveling' or 
              'movement' when Point A is only point A or being-time-A, point B is only
               point B being-time-B, each instant is whole and complete - there is 
              nothing subjective or objective that is separate from each time-instant 
              that abides and travels from A to B. Where time is being and being is 
              time (things do not occur 'in' or 'pass through' time - they ARE time, 
              as everything is irremediably temporal), there is Only being-time which 
              is the sun and the moon and the stars, wherein there is neither an 
              atemporal object passing through time nor an atemporal subject 
              witnessing or passing through the passage of time and space from one 
              point to another, and neither is it the case of one thing becoming 
              another thing (winter is winter, spring is spring, winter does not turn 
              into spring). Each instance of  sight, sound, etc, is an entire and 
              whole being-time independent of past and future (it occupies or IS a 
              unique manifestation-position), yet inclusive of all causes and 
              conditions spanning all  time-space in a single moment that transcends 
              the structures of  time-object-self dichotomy. Each instant is a 
              happening without movement. Time stops in the midst of temporality but 
              Not by transcending to some unmoved backdrop.</p>

Firstly, they do not possess a separate efficiency of their own. It comes into being only with the things that exist in them. It is only due to our productive imagination that we can take different views of the same object and distinguish between the thing and its receptacle.</span></span></p>

                      the question "yes there is something that undergoes birth" people will 
                      become confused and assume there is a permanent self that undergoes 
                      retribution of action and so on. Likewise, if he answers the question 
                      "no, there is nothing which undergoes rebirth" likewise there are those 
                      who will assume there are no consequences of action and so on and will 
                      therefore feel no compelling need observe the principles of karma and so
                       on.<br> <br> Therefore when asked the question "what takes rebirth" he points out that question itself is flawed.<br> <br> The question should be "Why is there birth?" The answer to that question
                       is easy. There is birth, i.e. suffering, because of affliction and 
                      action.<br> <br> As long as the aggregates are afflicted, afflicted aggregates will continue to be appropriated.<br> <br> In Madhyamaka it is explained there is birth because of the innate 
                      self-grasping "I am" appearing to the afflicted mind. It is asserted 
                      that what appropriates birth in a new series of aggregates is the mental
                       habit "I am." That "I am" is baseless, has no correspondence in the 
                      aggregates or seperate from them or in any one of them, just as a car is
                       not found in its parts, seperate from them, or in any one of the parts.
                       Nevertheless, the imputation "car" allows us to use cars effectively. 
                      Likewise, the mental habit "I am" is proper as both the agent of action 
                      and the object upon which it ripens even though it is basically unreal 
                      and has no basis in the aggregates, outside the aggregates, or in any 
                      one of them, but allows us to treat the aggreates as a nominally 
                      designated "person".</p>

              <p>Past, present and future are conventional statements. It is valid on the conventional level.<br><br>Ultimately moments are non-arising. <br><br>I wrote:<br><br><br>In deep contemplation, it can become apparent in direct 
              experience and insight that all appearances are merely appearances, 
              nothing arising or staying or ceasing... there is no actual birth of 
              anything. Just like no matter what images appear on the movie or in a 
              dream it will never amount to anything more than an appearance, without 
              anything that truly come into existence.  This is different from 
              resolving non-arising through being-time. Lastly it is not that things 
              are mental projections but that they are dependent arising.. what 
              dependently originates is empty and nonarising appearance... momentary 
              suchness, but still as vivid.<br><br> It is with some reluctance that 
              I'm sharing this... I'm afraid that writing this might be a disservice 
              to readers. I shall refrain from posting and discussing further about 
              this. I do not wish this to become merely something to talk about, it 
              has to be seen in direct taste and insight... so that one knows what the
               experience is like and what the realization is. Spouting big words or 
              philosophizing about this do not mean anything.<br><br>...<span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span><span>I'm
               talking about is more about the non-arising, non-abiding, and 
              non-ceasing nature of appearance. This requires first deep penetration 
              of anatta by realizing that there is no background observer or agent 
              behind the appearance (be it sense perceptions or thoughts). At this 
              point, even without a thinker or seer behind appearance, there can still
               be a sense that thoughts or perceptions arise, abide and ceases. But 
              when we investigate further, the non-arising, indestructible and 
              illusory nature of appearance becomes apparent. It is an inseparability 
              of lucidity and emptiness. This aspect is not to be intellectually 
              understood... trying to grasp it intellectually only serves as a 
              hindrance later, and this is what I worry. So there is not much use for

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Much of our difficulty in understanding time 
                is due to the unwise use of spatial metaphors -- in fact, the objectification 
                of time requires such spatial metaphors -- but in this case another spatial 
                metaphor is helpful. We normally understand objects such as cups to be "in" 
                space, which (as explained above in relation to time) implies that in themselves 
                they must have a self-existence distinct from space. However, not much reflection 
                is necessary to realize that the cup itself is irremediably spatial. All its 
                parts must have a certain thickness, and without the various spatial relations 
                among the bottom, sides, and handle, the cup could not be a cup. Perhaps one 
                way to express this is to say that the cup is not "in" space but itself 
                <em>is</em> space: the cup is "what space is doing in that place," so 
                to speak. The same is true for the temporality of the cup. The cup is not an 
                atemporal, self-existing object that just happens to be "in" time, 
                for its being is irremediably temporal. The point of this is to destroy the 
                thought-constructed dualism between things and time. When we wish to express 
                this, we must describe one in terms of the other, by saying either that objects 
                are temporal (in which case they are not "objects" as we usually conceive 
                of them) or, conversely, that time is objects -- that is, that time expresses 
                itself in the manifestations that we call objects. Probably the clearest expression 
                of this way is given by DÅ�gen: "The time we call spring blossoms directly 
                as an existence called flowers. The flowers, in turn, express the time called 
                spring. This is not existence within time; existence</span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">"Being-time" means that time is being; 
                  that is, "Time is existence, existence is time." The shape of a 
                  Buddha-statue is time.... Every thing, every being in this entire world is 
                  time.... Do not think of time as merely flying by; do not only study the fleeting 
                  aspect of time. If time is really flying away, there would be a separation 
                  between time and ourselves. If you think that time is just a passing phenomenon, 
                  you will never understand being-time.<a name="%5B21%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew26578.htm#21.">[21]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Time "flies away" when we experience 
                it dualistically, with the sense of a self that is outside and looking <em>at</em> it. Then time becomes something that I <em>have</em> (or do not have), objectified 
                and quantified in a succession of "now-moments" that cannot be held 
                but incessantly fall away. In contrast, the "being-times" that we 
                usually reify into objects cannot be said to occur <em>in</em> time, for they 
                <em>are</em> time. As NÄ�gÄ�rjuna would put it, that things (or rather "thingings") 
                <em>are</em> time means that there is no second, external time that they are "within."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">This brings us to the second prong of the dialectic. 
                To use the interdependence of objects and time to deny only the reality (<em>svabhÄ�va</em>) 
                of objects is incomplete, because their relativity also implies the unreality 
                of time. Just as with the other dualities analyzed earlier in section II, to 
                say that there is <em>only</em> time turns out to be equivalent to saying that 
                there is <em>no</em> time. Having used temporality to deconstruct things, we must 
                reverse the analysis and use the lack of a thing "in" time to negate 
                the objectivity of time also: when there is no "contained," there 
                can be no "container." If there are no nouns, then there can be no 
                temporal predicates because they have no referent. When there are no things 
                which have an existence apart from time, then it makes no sense to speak of" 
                them" as being young or old: "so the young man does not grow old nor 
                does the old man grow old" (NÄ�gÄ�rjuna).<a name="%5B22%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew26578.htm#22.">[22]</a> DÅ�gen expressed this in terms of firewood and ashes:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">... we should not take the view that what is 
                  latterly ashes was formerly firewood. What we should understand is that, according 
                  to the doctrine of Buddhism, firewood stays at the position of firewood.... 
                  There are former and later stages, but these stages are clearly cut.<a name="%5B23%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew26578.htm#23.">[23]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Firewood does not <em>become</em> ashes; rather, 
                there is the "being-time" of firewood, then the "being-time" 
                of ashes. But how does such "being-time" free <em>us</em> from time?</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Similarly, when human beings die, they cannot 
                  return to life; but in Buddhist teaching we never say life changes into death.... 
                  Likewise, death cannot change into life.... Life and death have absolute existence, 
                  like the relationship of winter and spring. But do not think of winter changing 
                  into spring or spring into summer.<a name="%5B24%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew26578.htm#24.">[24]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Because life and death, like spring and summer, 
                are not <em>in</em> time, they are in themselves timeless. If there is nobody 
                who lives and dies, then there is no life and death -- or, alternatively, we 
                may say that there is life-and-death in every moment, with the arising and disappearance 
                of each thought, perception, and act. Perhaps this is what Heraclitus meant

                and death.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">In terms of time, this paradox can be expressed 
                in either of two contradictory ways. We may say that there is <em>only</em> the 
                present: not, of course, the present as usually understood -- a series of fleeting 
                moments which incessantly fall away to become the past -- but a very different 
                present which incorporates the past and the future because it always stays the

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">We cannot be separated from time. This means 
                  that because, in reality, there is no coming or going in time, when we cross 
                  the river or climb the mountain we exist in the eternal present of time; this 
                  time includes all past and present time.... Most people think time is passing 
                  and do not realize that there is an aspect that is not passing. (DÅ�gen)<a name="%5B26%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew26578.htm#26.">[26]</a></span></p>
