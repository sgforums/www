You do not have to keep dwelling on your action and thoughts to know what is right and wrong, I believe people have it naturally. Even if you need to plan and consider many things it is ok.<br><br>But to become attached to outcome of action and thoughts, and to cling unto thoughts without letting to, leading one thought to the next endlessly like a chain, is 'attachment' and 'ignorance'.<br><br>--------<br>By Thusness:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by la lapine blanche:</div><div class="quote_body">Just want to clarify this.  Generally I understand the concept of living in the present moment, feeling current sensations and feelings, being aware of thoughts, etc.  But there are a few examples that confuse me:<br><br>1. I am a teacher and I spend a large amount of my working time planning tomorrow's lessons or next week's lessons.  This is necessary for my job.  Does this mean I am not living in the present?<br><br>2. If you are an academic and your career involves researching abstract concepts, thinking about them, writing research on them, does this mean you are escaping from the present by doing this?<br><br>3. If you enter the "flow state" (popular term in American psychology, meaning losing all sense of time because you are so absorbed in what you're doing) would that be bad in Buddhism because you lost track of time passing and therefore the present reality?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)<br><br>thanks<br>LB</div></blockquote>Hi LB,<br><br>You may want to look more deeply into Â‘non-actionÂ’, i.e., plan but not be attached to outcome.  When engaging with conceptual models, just work within the laws and conditions of the model.  This is analogous to our Â‘buddha natureÂ’ working day in and day out within the conditions of our five senses yet not limited by it.<br><br>Before stabilization of our experience of Presence, there will be confusion.  No-self is a very distinct phase of our practices; without going through this phase, we will not be able to replace our conceptual mode of knowing with intuitiveness and directness.
