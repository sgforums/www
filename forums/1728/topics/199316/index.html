But among ordinary Tibetans, the game is as wildly popular as it is in the rest of sports-mad China.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"Most Tibetans love and play football," </span>says Bian Ba, a former rear guard for Tibet's official league team. He now works in the Potala Palace, helping with tourists and keeping an eye on the treasures.<br><br>At the sports bar of the Yak Hotel in Lhasa, about 20 mostly Tibetan fans watched games as they drank beer and ate meat and potatoes grilled on skewers over a trough of hot coals.<br><br>Restaurants in the Tibetan capital that stayed open until early morning were crammed with Tibetans and Chinese migrant workers watching the game.<br><br>At the Johkang Monastery, where the main hall is filled with jewel-encrusted gold religious statues, the walls of the dormitory for young monks are hung with posters of Brazil's Pele and Ronaldo and Real Madrid's Roberto Carlos. The monks call them the "soccer kings."<br><br>Other pictures show the Dalai Lama and the Karmapa, another exiled Tibetan spiritual leader.<br><br>A young monk sits on a floor cushion absorbed in a Chinese-language soccer magazine with articles about England's David Beckham and other stars.<br><br>But is it acceptable for monks to become so attached to a sport when their goal is to let go of worldly pleasures?<br><br>Lobsang, from the Potala, thinks so.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"This activity brings a kind of happiness," </span>he said. <span style="color: blue;">"It doesn't harm anybody and it brings people together."</span><br><br></div>

Those monks who are found watching World Cup must be punished and kicked out from their pagodas," the capital's supreme religious patriarch said.<br><br>There are more 40,000 Buddhist monks in Cambodia. The World Cup matches, which kicked off in Germany last Friday, have been widely broadcast across the Southeast Asian kingdom. -- Agence France Presse<br></blockquote>And worse...<br><blockquote>Soccer-mad Thai monks 'too tired to recieve alms'<br><br>3.20pm Thursday June 22, 2006<br><br>BANGKOK - Buddhist monks in Thailand are too tired to receive early morning alms because they are staying up late to watch the World Cup, according to a Thai newspaper.<br><br>The Nation quoted a woman in the northern city of Chiang Mai who said her birthday celebrations were ruined because monks at a city temple were not awake to receive her morning offering, a mandatory religious ritual in the predominantly Buddhist country.<br><br>The woman, who declined to be identified, said she was told by a senior monk that most of his young colleagues were still asleep because they had stayed up to watch the games which can go on well past midnight.<br><br>The Sangha Council, which oversees the tens of thousands of Buddhist temples in Thailand, has not banned monks from watching the World Cup but said it should not interfere with religious activities.<br><br>Chiang Mai chief monk Phra Thep Wisuthikhun said he had received complaints about "inappropriate behavior" at seven temples in the province. "It is the duty of the abbot of each temple to supervise the behavior of young monks, making sure that their religious activities will not be affected by the games," he said.<br><br>In neighboring Cambodia, some 40,000 monks have been warned they could be defrocked if they became too excited while watching the games.<br><br>"If they make noise or cheer as they watch, they will lose their monkhood," Phnom Penh patriarch Non Nget said earlier this month.<br></blockquote></div>
