              hmm when we doing chanting or puja aren't we upholding â€œæˆ’(preceptsï¼Œå®š(samadhi)ï¼Œæ…§(wisdom)â€œ which is merits åŠŸå¾·. 
              
              I suppose the problem is, we are  always caught up with the notion of I AM (as mentioned by Eckhart Tolle) when doing A MERITOUS ACT. The big "I" ego problem. However, if we would do it from a perspective of  Flower Adorenment Sutra, " There is no differences between a Buddha and Sentient Being." 
              
              We are all the same. We are just sharing the little merit  accrued through a simple act of devotion. It might turn up differently. In fact, I could testify to this merit transfer thingy. It goes beyond the distance, time, place and space. 
              
              My deceased brother who has passed away in an accident due to drug consummation was able to receive the merits through our simple chanting Lotus Sutra å¦™æ³•è“®è�¯ç¶“ and Namu Myoho Renge Kyo å�—ç„¡å¦™æ³•è“®è�¯ç¶“. He appears twice in my dream 6 month after his death and told me that he will become a local area deity åœ°ä¸»ç¥ž at certain date with specific instruction how and where to make offering to him after finishing his punishment in hell.
              
              The teaching of Buddha is inconceivable. Those Pali Sutta or Mahanyana Sutra about transference of merits is not a makeup fantasy. Once you experience it, you will know. 
              
              Beside, the truth is our ancestor is living in our body too. Why? Because scientific study has told us that we are connected to our past generation through the DNA code. When diseases can be passed down from generation to generation. Therefore, in my own opinion when we are practicing Buddhism, they are also practicing with us although they MAY NOT be physical with us. In the same manner, we are practicing for our future generation to come.

              <p> From my understanding, there is a difference between FD <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 16px;">ç¦�å¾· and GD</span><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14.399999618530273px; line-height: 16px;">åŠŸå¾·...</span></p>
              <p>FD can only be used in future lives. GD's results can manifest within this life and used at the end of one's life to go to Pureland.</p>
              <p>One of the main deciding factor of what positive deeds/ practice becomes FD or GD is one's motivation.  If the motivation is to leave samsara and attain liberation for all sentient beings, then it can become GD.  If it is a selfish or worldly motivation (ie to gain worldly benefits, like good health, fortune, relationships etc), then it can  become FD.</p>
              <p>FD and GD is not just a kind of merit bank account accumulation. But depends on your thought from moment to moment.  If you give rise to a worldly motivation or a wish to enjoy worldly stuff in your next life, if your motivation degenerates in this way, all your past GD can be transformed instantly to FD.</p>
              <p>There are also possibilities of wiping out your FD/GD easily with negative thoughts, wrongful actions etc.  Therefore, the concept is not one of accumulating only but it should be viewed also like a state of mind.  People with great GD automatically have a state of mind that is in line with the Dharma teachings.</p>
              <p>Many people practise for many years mistaking these very important concepts, that is why there is often reversal or lack of progression.  For Liang Wu Di, i heard that eventually he died of starvation in that very life. That may be because he had FD, not GD. FD to be used only in the next life.</p>
              <p>This also explains why the old Chinese masters always emphasized for us to appreciate our merits æƒœç¦�ï¼Œwe should not waste our merits easily in this life and squander it on all kinds of enjoyment.  The past masters were very careful with waste to ensure that they had sufficient merits and time to do practice and attain realisation.</p>
              <p>Buddhists are often questioning themselves or asking others why it is that someone do a lot of good things but they still have so many miseries and problems.  One of the reason is the difference between FD and GD.  Someone may do alot of positive things, but the motivation is very weak.  It may be for improving his worldly life, cure sickness, improve wealth etc.  But there is no mind to seek liberation.</p>
              <p>The other reason of course is that a practitioner who seeks liberation must be prepared to return all his karmic debts.  There is no way to attain Buddhahood without returning all your debts.  </p>
              <p>The workings of karma are very intricate and accurate. Anyone who is wise will have the highest respect and care for cause-and-effect.</p>

              <p>from my understanding FD can also be manifest within this life bah. like what our old MCK is doing. old MCK started out very poor, but he donated out what ppl had given to him. knowing that giving or generosity is the cause of wealth, but not that he want wealth. the more he gave out the more it come in. it's a good practice. i do it too, and it can be seen in this life. i heard even the real "God of Wealth" also do it when he was a human and the merit manifested within his life-span too. everytime he earn from a business, he gave it all away to the poor and start all over again. and everytime, his business keep booming even though he started from zero. but u can say it can be something of the past.</p>

              <p>According to the Chinese of Buddhism, they will have to get monk or priest to perform ritual to guide her spirit or soul away from that place to where she belongs then the place will be clean.</p>

              I think å…­ç¥–æƒ èƒ½ç¶“, Zen Master Hui Neng has answer it quite clearly. We should not caught up with the notion of merits, just practise with the flow.
              
              Prefect Wei ask, "that at Bodhidharma's first interview with Emperor Wu of Liang he was asked what merits the Emperor would get for the work of his life in building temples, allowing new monks to be ordained (royal consent was necessary at that time), giving alms and entertaining the Order; and his reply was that these would bring no merits ar all. Now, I cannot understand why he gave such an answer. Will you please explain." 
              
              "These would bring no merits," replied the Patriarch. "Don't doubt the words of the Sage. Emperor Wu's mind was under an erroneous impression, and he did not know the orthodox teaching. Such deeds as building temples, allowing new monks to be ordained, giving alms and entertaining the Order will bring you only felicities, which should not be taken for merits. Merits are to be found within the Dharmakaya, and they have nothing to do with practices for attaining felicities." 
              
              The Patriarch went on, "Realization of the Essence of Mind is Gong åŠŸ, and equality is Deå¾·. When our mental activity works without any impediment, so that we are in a position to know constantly the true state and the mysterious functioning of our own mind, we are said to have acquired Gong De (merits). Within, to keep the mind in a humble mood is Gong; and without, to behave oneself according to propriety is De. That all things are the manifestation of the Essence of Mind is Gong, and that the quintessence of mind is free from idle thoughts is De. Not to go astray from the Essence of Mind is , and not to pollute the mind in using it is De. If you seek for merits within the Dharmakaya, and do what I have just said, what you acquire will be real merits. He who works for merits does not slight others; and on all occasions he treats everybody with respect. He who is in the habit of looking down upon others has not got rid of the erroneous idea of a self, which indicates his lack of Gong. Because of his egotism and his habitual contempt for all others, he knows not the real Essence of Mind; and this shows his lack of De. Learned Audience, when our mental activity works without interruption, then it is Gong; and when our mind functions in a straightforward manner, then it is De. To train our own mind is Gong, and to train our own body is De. Learned Audience, merits should be sought within the Essence of Mind and they cannot be acquired by almsgiving, entertaining the monks, etc. We should therefore distinguish between felicities and merits. There is nothing wrong in what our Patriarch said. It is Emperor Wu himself who did not know the true way."

              <p><br>everywhere got these things BTW. 49 days; some can be 7, some can be 14, some can be 21 etc...not always 49. it's just an intermediate bardo state. after which they rebirth into another realm. so if she reborn into ghost realm(most properly), then she will always be there, more than 49 days. since it's a sucide, she would have to play out the same tiao lao scenario over and over again, until her karma is exhausted.</p>

              Hi Dawnfirstlight
              
              Knowing that the departed loved ones is in heaven is a source of comfort through drawing lot. However, it seem that there is no Buddhist sutra to support such form of practice as the protocol for point of reference. As drawing lot is a folklore practice æ°‘é–“ç¿’ä¿— not buddhist practice. I do not in anyway undermine the divine grace of Kuan Yin in offering a good advice through this method. As I had personally experience some good advice from her.
              
              Perhaps the proper Buddhist way is still through dedication of merits which is practise by Theravada and Manhayana buddhist. :-)

              Hi! Regarding transference of merits, I have always assumed that transference of merits is an integral part of buddhism rituals. 
              For the theravadan practice of punnanumodana,  after each puja session, there is both, one, an invitation for devas to share merits and another that accrue merits to one's departed relatives!
               So the question is; when was the practice of punnanumodana have been incorporated as part of the daily puja practice?
