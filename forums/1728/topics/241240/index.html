            <div class='col-md body'>I was looking through Dharma Dan's list of recommended books (<a href="http://www.interactivebuddha.com/booklist.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.interactivebuddha.com/booklist.html</a>) and found something which I think is worth sharing on this forum.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/cutting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/tib/cutting.htm</a> -- Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche<br><br>Excerpt from URL:<br><br><strong>Spiritual Materialism</strong><br><br>We have come here to learn about spirituality.  I trust the<br>genuine quality of this search but we must question its nature.  The<br>problem is that ego can convert anything to its own use, even<br>spirituality.  Ego is constantly attempting to acquire and apply the<br>teachings of spirituality for its own benefit.  The teachings are<br>treated as an external thing, external to "me," a philosophy which<br>we try to imitate.  We do not actually want to identify with or<br>become the teachings.  So if our teacher speaks of renunciation of<br>ego, we attempt to mimic renunciation of ego.  We go through the<br>motions, make the appropriate gestures, but we really do not want to<br>sacrifice any part of our way of life.  We become skillful actors,<br>and while playing deaf and dumb to the real meaning of the<br>teachings, we find some comfort in pretending to follow the path.<br><br>Whenever we begin to feel any discrepancy or conflict<br>between our actions and the teachings, we immediately interpret the<br>situation in such a way that the conflict is smoothed over.  The<br>interpreter is ego in the role of spiritual advisor.  The situation<br>is like that of a country where church and state are separate.  If<br>the policy of the state is foreign to the teachings of the church,<br>then the automatic reaction of the king is to go to the head of the<br>church, his spiritual advisor, and ask his blessing.  The head of<br>the church then works out some justification and gives the policy<br>his blessing under the pretense that the king is the protector of<br>the faith.  In an individual's mind, it works out very neatly that<br>way, ego being both king and head of the church.<br>This rationalization of the spiritual path and one's actions<br>must be cut through if true spirituality is to be realized.<br>However, such rationalizing is not easy to deal with because<br>everything is seen through the filter of ego's philosophy and logic,<br>making all appear neat, precise and very logical.  We attempt to<br>find a self-justifying answer for every question.  In order to<br>reassure ourselves, we work to fit into our intellectual scheme<br>every aspect of our lives which might be confusing.  And our effort<br>is so serious and solemn, so straight-forward and sincere, that it<br>is very difficult to be suspicious of it.  We always trust the<br>"integrity" of our spiritual advisor.<br><br>It does not matter what we use to achieve<br>self-justification: the wisdom of sacred books, diagrams or charts,<br>mathematical calculations, esoteric formulae, fundamentalists<br>religion, depth psychology, or any other mechanism.  Whenever we<br>begin to evaluate, deciding that we should or should not do this or<br>that, then we have already associated our practice or our knowledge<br>with categories, one pitted against the other, and that is spiritual<br>materialism, the false spirituality of our spiritual advisor.<br>Whenever we a have a dualistic notion such as, "I am doing this<br>because I want to achieve a particular state of consciousness, a<br>particular state of being," the automatically we separate ourselves<br>from the reality of what we are.<br><br>If we ask ourselves, "What is wrong with evaluating, with<br>taking sides?", the answer is that, when we formulate a secondary<br>judgment, "I should be doing this and should avoid doing that," then<br>we have achieved a level of complication which takes us a long way<br>from the basic simplicity of what we are.  The simplicity of<br>meditation means just experiencing the ape instinct of ego.  If<br>anything more than this is laid onto our psychology, then it becomes<br>a very heavy, thick mask, a suit of armor.<br><br>It is important to see that the main point of any spiritual<br>practice is to step out of the bureaucracy of ego.  This means<br>stepping out of ego's constant desire for a higher, more spiritual,<br>more transcendental version of knowledge, religion, virtue,<br>judgment, comfort or whatever it is that a particular ego is<br>seeking.  One must step out of spiritual materialism.  If we do not<br>step out of spiritual materialism, if we in fact practice it, then<br>we may eventually find ourselves possessed of a huge collection of<br>spiritual paths.  We may feel these spiritual collections to be very<br>precious.  We have studied so much.  We may have studied Western<br>philosophy or Oriental philosophy, practiced yoga or perhaps studied<br>under dozens of great masters.  We have achieved and we have<br>learned.  We believe that we have accumulated a hoard of knowledge.<br>And yet, having gone through all this, there is still something to<br>give up.  It is extremely mysterious! How could this happen?<br>Impossible!  But unfortunately it is so.  Our vast collections of<br>knowledge and experience are just part of ego's display, part of the<br>grandiose quality of ego.  We display them to the world and, in so<br>doing, reassure ourselves that we exist, safe and secure, as<br>"spiritual" people.<br><br>But we have simply created a shop, an antique shop.  We<br>could be specializing in oriental antiques or medieval Christian<br>antiques or antiques from some other civilization or time, but we<br>are, nonetheless, running a shop.  Before we filled our shop with so<br>many things the room was beautiful: whitewashed walls and a very<br>simple floor with a bright lamp burning in the ceiling.  There was<br>one object of art in the middle of the room and it was beautiful.<br>Everyone who came appreciated its beauty, including ourselves.<br><br>But we were not satisfied and we thought, "Since this one<br>object makes my room so beautiful, if I get more antiques, my room<br>will be even more beautiful."  So we began to collect, and the end<br>result was chaos.<br><br>We searched the world over for beautiful objects - India,<br>Japan, many different countries.  And each time we found an antique,<br>because we were dealing with only one object at a time, we saw it as<br>beautiful and thought it would be beautiful in our shop.  But when<br>we brought the object home and put it there, it became just another<br>addition to our junky collection.  The beauty of the object did not<br>radiate out any more, because it was surrounded by so many other<br>beautiful things.  It did not mean anything anymore.  Instead of a<br>room full of beautiful antiques we created a junk shop!<br><br>Proper shopping does not entail collecting a lot of<br>information or beauty, but it involves fully appreciating each<br>individual object.  This is very important.  If you really<br>appreciate an object of beauty, then you completely identify with it<br>and forget yourself.  It is like seeing a very interesting,<br>fascinating movie and forgetting that you are the audience.  At that<br>moment there is no world; your whole being is that scene of that<br>movie.  It is that kind of identification, complete involvement with<br>one thing.  Did we actually taste it and chew it and swallow it<br>properly, that one object of beauty, that one spiritual teaching?<br>Or did we merely regard it as a part of our vast and growing<br>collection?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I place so much emphasis on this point because I know that<br>all of us have come to the teachings and practice of meditation not<br>to make a lot of money, but because we genuinely want to learn, want<br>to develop ourselves.  But if we regard knowledge as an antique, as<br>"ancient wisdom" to be collected, then we are on the wrong path.<br><br>As far as the lineage of teachers is concerned, knowledge is<br>not handed down like an antique.  Rather, one teacher experiences<br>the truth of  the teachings, and he hands it down as inspiration to<br>his student.  That inspiration awakens the student, as his teacher<br>was awakened before him.  Then the student hands down the teachings<br>to another student and so the process goes.  The teachings are<br>always up to date.  They are not "ancient wisdom," an old legend.<br>The teachings are not passed along as information, handed down as a<br>grandfather tells traditional folk tales to his grandchildren.  It<br>does not work that way.  It is real experience.<br><br>There is a saying in the Tibetan scriptures:  "Knowledge<br>must be burned, hammered and beaten like pure gold.  Then one can<br>wear it as an ornament."  So when you receive spiritual instruction<br>from the hands of another, you do not take it uncritically, but you<br>burn it, you hammer it, you beat it, until the bright, dignified<br>color of gold appears.  Then you craft it into an ornament, whatever<br>design you like, and you put it on.  Therefore, dharma is applicable<br>to every age, to every person; it has a living quality.  It is not<br>enough to imitate your master or guru; you are not trying to become<br>a replica of your teacher.  The teachings are an individual persona<br>experience, right down to the present holder of the doctrine.<br><br>Perhaps many of my readers are familiar with the stories of<br>Naropa and Tilopa and Marpa and Milarepa and Gampopa and the other<br>teachers of the Kagy� lineage.  It was a living experience for them,<br>and it is a living experience for the present holders of the<br>lineage.  Only the details of their life-situations are different.<br>The teachings have the quality of warm, fresh baked bread; the bread<br>is still warm and hot and fresh.  Each baker must apply the general<br>knowledge of how to make bread to his particular dough and oven.<br>Then he must personally experience the freshness of this bread and<br>must cut if fresh and eat it warm.  He must make the teachings his<br>own and then must practice them.  It is a very living process.<br>There is no deception in terms of collecting knowledge.  We must<br>work with our individual experiences.  When we become confused, we<br>cannot turn back to our collection of knowledge and try to find some<br>confirmation or consolation:  "The teacher and the whole teaching is<br>on my side."  The spiritual path does not go that way.  It is a<br>lonely, individual path.<br><br>Q.	Do you think spiritual materialism is a particularly<br>American problem?<br><br>A.	Whenever teachings come to a country from abroad, the<br>problem of spiritual materialism is intensified.  At the moment<br>America is, without any doubt, fertile ground ready for the<br>teachings.  And because America is so fertile, seeking spirituality,<br>it is possible for America to inspire charlatans.  Charlatans would<br>not choose to be charlatans unless they were inspired to do so.<br>Otherwise, they would be bank robbers or bandits, inasmuch as they<br>want to make money and become famous.  Because America is looking so<br>hard for spirituality, religion becomes any easy way to make money<br>and acquire fame.  So we see charlatans in the role of student,<br>chela, as well as in the role of guru.  I think America at this<br>particular time is a very interesting ground.<br><br>Q.	Have you accepted any spiritual master as a guru, any<br>particular living spiritual master?<br><br>A.	At present there is no one.  I left my gurus and teachers<br>behind in Tibet, physically, but the teachings stay with me and<br>continue.<br><br>Q.	So who are you following, more or less?<br><br>A.	Situations are the voice of my guru, the presence of my guru.<br><br>Q.	After Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment, was there<br>some trace of ego left in him so that he could carry on his<br>teachings?<br><br>A.	The teaching just happened.  He did not have the desire to<br>teach or not to teach.  He spent seven weeks sitting under the shade<br>of a tree and walking along the bank of a river.  Then someone just<br>happened along and he began to speak.  One has no choice; you are<br>there, an open person.  Then the situation presents itself and<br>teaching happens.  That is what is called "Buddha activity."<br><br>Q.	It is difficult not to become acquisitive about<br>spirituality.  Is this desire for acquisitions something that is<br>shed along the way?<br><br>A.	You should let the first impulse die down.  Your first<br>impulse toward spirituality might put you into some particular<br>spiritual scene; but if you work with that impulse, then the impulse<br>gradually dies down and at some stage becomes tedious, monotonous.<br>This is a useful message.  You see, it is essential to relate to<br>yourself, to your own experience, really.  If one does not relate to<br>oneself, then the spiritual path becomes dangerous, becomes purely<br>external entertainment, rather than an organic personal experience.<br><br>Q.	If you decide to seek your way out of ignorance, you can<br>almost definitely assume that anything you do that feels good will<br>be beneficial to the ego and actually blocking the path.  Anything<br>that seems right to you will be wrong, anything that doesn't turn<br>you upside-down will bury you.  Is there any way out of this?<br><br>A.	If you perform some act which is seemingly right, it does<br>not mean that it is wrong, for the very reason that wrong and right<br>are out of the picture altogether.  You are not working on any side,<br>neither the "good" side nor the "bad" side, but you are working with<br>the totality of the whole, beyond "this" and "that."  I would say<br>there is complete action.  There is no partial act, but whatever we<br>do in connection with good and bad seems to be a partial act.<br><br>Q.	If you are feeling very confused and trying to work your way<br>out of the confusion, it would seem that you are trying too hard.<br>But if you do not try at all, then are we to understand that we are<br>fooling ourselves?<br><br>A.	Yes, but that does not mean that one has to live by the<br>extremes of trying too hard or not trying at all.  One has to work<br>with a kind of "middle way," a complete state of "being as you are.<br>"  We could describe this with a lot of words, but one really has to<br>do it.  If you really start living the middle way, then you will see<br>it, you will find it.  You must allow yourself to trust yourself, to<br>trust in your own intelligence.  We are tremendous people, we have<br>tremendous things in us.  We simply have to let ourselves be.<br>External aid cannot help.  If you are not willing to let yourself<br>grow, then you fall into the self-destructive process of confusion.<br>It is self-destruction rather than destruction by someone else.<br>That is why it is effective; because it is self-destruction.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Q.	What is faith?  Is it useful?<br><br>A.	Faith could be simple-minded, trusting, blind faith, or it<br>could be definite confidence which cannot be destroyed.  Blind faith<br>has no inspiration.  It is very naive.  It is not creative, though<br>not exactly destructive.  It is not creative because your faith and<br>yourself have never made any connection, any  communication.  You<br>just blindly accepted the whole belief, very naively.<br><br>In the case of faith as confidence, there is a living reason<br>to be confident.  You do not expect that there will be a<br>prefabricated solution mysteriously presented to you.  You work with<br>existing situations without fear, without any doubt about involving<br>yourself.  This approach is extremely creative and positive.  If you<br>have definite confidence, you are so sure of yourself that you do<br>not have to check yourself.  It is absolute confidence, real<br>understanding of what is going on now, therefore you do not hesitate<br>to follow other paths or deal in whatever way is necessary with each<br>new situation.<br><br>Q.	What guides you on the path?<br><br>A.	Actually, there does not seem to be any particular<br>guidance.  In fact, if someone is guiding you, that is suspicious,<br>because you are relying on something external.  Being fully what you<br>are in yourself becomes guidance, but not in the sense of vanguard,<br>because you do not have a guide to follow.  You do not have to<br>follow someone's tail, but you sail along.  In other words, the<br>guide does not walk ahead of you, but walks with you.<br><br>Q.	Could you say something more about the way in which<br>meditation short-circuits the protective mechanisms of the ego?<br><br>A.	The protective mechanism of ego involves checking oneself,<br>which is an unnecessary kind of self-observance.  Meditation is not<br>based on meditating on a particular subject by checking oneself; but<br>meditation is complete identification with whatever techniques you<br>are employing.  Therefore there will be no effort to secure oneself<br>in the practice of meditation.<br><br>Q.	I seem to be living in a spiritual junkyard.  How can I make<br>it into a simple room with one beautiful object?<br><br>A.	In order to develop an appreciation of you collection you<br>have to start with one item.  One has to find a stepping stone, a<br>source of inspiration.  Perhaps you would not have to go through the<br>rest of the items in your collection if you studied just one piece<br>of material.  That one piece of material could be a sign-post that<br>you managed to confiscate in New York City, it could be as<br>insignificant as that.  But one must start with one thing, see its<br>simplicity, the rugged quality of this piece of junk or this<br>beautiful antique.  If we could manage to start with just one thing,<br>then that would be the equivalent of having one object in an empty<br>room.  I think it is a question of finding a stepping stone.<br>Because we have so many possessions in our collection, a large part<br>of the problem is that we do not know where to begin.  One has to<br>allow one's instinct to determine which will be the first thing to<br>pick up.<br><br>Q.	Why do you think that people are so protective of their<br>egos?  Why is it so hard to let go of one's ego?<br><br>A.	People are afraid of emptiness of space, or the absence of<br>company, the absence of a shadow.  It could be a terrifying<br>experience to have no one to relate to, nothing to relate with.  The<br>idea of it can be extremely frightening, though not the real<br>experience.  It is generally a fear of space, a fear that we will<br>not be able to anchor ourselves to any solid ground, that we will<br>lose our identity as a fixed and solid and definite thing.  This<br>could be very threatening.</div>
