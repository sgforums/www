              <p>Oranges<br> There's this wonderful story about the first meeting between Kalu Rinpoche and Zen master Seung Sahn: <br> The two monks entered with swirling robes - maroon and yellow for the Tibetan, austere gray and black for the Korean - and were followed by retinues of younger monks and translators with shaven heads ... <br> The Tibetan lama sat very still, fingering a wooden rosary (mala) with one hand while murmuring, 'Om mani padme hung,' continuously under his breath. The Zen master, who was already gaining renown for his method of hurling questions at his students until they were forced to admit their ignorance and then bellowing, 'Keep that don't know mind!' at them, reached deep inside his robes and drew out an orange. 'What is this?' he demanded of the lama. 'What is this?' <br> This was a typical opening question, and we could feel him ready to pounce on whatever response he was given. <br> The Tibetan sat quietly fingering his mala and made no move to respond. <br> 'What is this?' the Zen master insisted, holding the orange up to the Tibetan's nose. <br> Kalu Rinpoche bent very slowly to the Tibetan monk next to him who was serving as the translator, and they whispered back and forth for several minutes. Finally the translator addressed the room: 'Rinpoche says, What is the matter with him? Don't they have oranges where he comes from?' <br><br>Before enlightenment, chop wood and carry water. <br> After enlightenment, chop wood and carry water ... but no longer trip over things at night.<br>Skye Milo</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The Pope, Sai Baba and the Dalai Lama <br> It was a beautiful day along the coast, quiet, sunny and warm. The Pope, Sai Baba and the Dalai Lama had decided to take a day off from their various opinions and duties, rented a boat, and went fishing. <br> A couple hours pass, at the expense of several ocean-creatures. Then Sai Baba spots a McDonalds at the beach. "Hey, I'm dead hungry. I'm off for a Big Mac". He jumps from the boat and quickly steps across the water. The Dalai Lama goes: "Great, I'm in." Jumps from the boat, runs across the water to land, where Sai Baba is already ordering. <br> The Pope stands a little behind, having never walked on water. But if those two non-Christians can do that, it should be no problem for him. He jumps the boat, goes "plop", and disappears. <br> Sai Baba and the Dalai Lama, enjoying their freshly materialized burgers, watch the scene. <br> Dalai Lama: "That didn't look good." <br> Sai Baba: "No, we really should have told him about those underwater stepping stones." <br> Dalai Lama: "Stepping stones??" <br><br>Enlightenment is your ego’s biggest disappointment.<br>Unknown</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>A noble one?<br> A man prepared a meal and some offerings for a monk who he expected to be a noble one, and had invited to his home. On the way back, he followed the monk closely. They passed by a drainage ditch, and the monk jumped over it. <br> The man thought to himself: "this fellow can’t be a noble one. How can an Arahant jump? I will offer only a meal to him, not the gift ”. <br> Further on, they have to pass a small streched water. This time, the monk carefully circumfered it and they crossed. The man was suspeciuos about the change in the monks behaviour, so he asked: “venerable, the first time you jumped over the ditch, but this time you did not… what is the reason of this?” The monk answered: “my dear donor, if this time I was to jump again you won’t even give me a meal.”<br><br>Why did the Buddhist coroner get the sack?<br> Answer:: because he’d always record the cause of death as 'birth'.</p></div>

              <p>Monastery Life <br> A young monk arrives at the monastery. He is assigned to helping the other monks in copying the old canons and laws by hand. <br> He notices, however, that all of the monks are copying from copies, not from the original manuscript. So, the new monk goes to the head abbot to question this, pointing out that if someone made even a small error in the first copy, it would never be picked up! In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies. <br> The head monk, says, "We have been copying from the copies for centuries, but you make a good point, my son." <br> He goes down into the dark caves underneath the monastery where the original manuscripts are held as archives in a locked vault that hasn't been opened for hundreds of years. Hours go by and nobody sees the old abbot. <br><br> So, the young monk gets worried and goes down to look for him. He sees him banging his head against the wall and wailing, "We missed the "R" ! , we missed the "R" !" <br> His forehead is all bloody and bruised and he is crying uncontrollably. <br> The young monk asks the old abbot, "What's wrong, father?" <br> With A choking voice, the old abbot replies, "The word was... CELEBRATE !!! " <br><br>Many Zen teachers, in their pride, vainly boast that they know nothing, <br> but it is I alone who have truly succeeded in achieving total ignorance.... <br>Unknown</p>
