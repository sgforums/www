              Buddha:
              
              When a person's mind is deeply attached,
              Infatuated with sons and cattle,
              Death grabs him and carries him away
              As a flood does a sleeping village.
              
              ....
              
              Khema, behold this mass of elements,
              Diseased, impure, decaying;
              Trickling all over and oozing,
              It is desired only by fools.
              
              Those enslaved by lust drift down the stream
              As a spider glides on its self-spun web.
              Having cut off even this, the wise wander
              Indifferent to the pleasures they've renounced.
              
              ....
              
              According to what you have, give alms;
              Observe the Uposatha, keep the precepts pure;
              Dwell upon the thought of death, mindful of your mortal state.
              For in the case of beings like us,
              Death is certain, life uncertain;
              All existing things must, subject to decay,
              Therefore be heedful day and night.
              
              -----
              
              Today I read the below passage from Peter Harvey's "the selfless mind" which spoke of a few analogies given by Buddha about the three characteristics, and it occurred to me that the dream about building falling is in fact a dream about the three characteristics of phenomena - 
              
              "Under contemplation of the personality-factors as 
              
              i) impermanent, wavering, perishable, unstable, of a nature to change, destruction, constructed (sankhata), of a nature to die; 
              ii) dukkha, a disease, a boil, a dart, a misfortune, a sickness, a plague, a distress, a danger, a menace, not a protection, not a cave of shelter, not a refuge, devoid (ritta-), a disadvantage, the root of misfortune, murderous, with-cankers, a prey to Mara (the evil temptor-god), of the nature of birth, ageing, grief, lamentation, despair and defilements;
              iii) other (para), disintegrating, hollow (tuccha-), empty (sunna), not-Self, lacking an essence"

The Buddha tells Ven. 
              Sariputta that one should train oneself such that "with regard to this 
              conscious body, there will be no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or 
              obsession of conceit, such that with regard to all external themes 
              [topics of concentration] there will be no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making 
              or obsession of conceit, and that we will enter &amp; remain in the 
              awareness-release &amp; discernment-release in which there is no 
              'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit." When one has 
              trained in this way, he says, one is called a person who has cut through
               craving, unraveled the fetter, who has, through the right penetration 
              of conceit, put an end to suffering &amp; stress. He then states that it
               was in connection to this state that he uttered this verse.</dd><dt><a id="fn-3" name="fn-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.5.13.than.html#fnt-3">3</a>.</dt><dd>For a discussion of "bringing consciousness to a halt" — showing

              <p>i must make my dream come true - the escaping from the perishing of building (the cyclical birth, ageing, sickness and death of the aggregates)</p>
              <p>Just read something from Bhikkhu Bodhi:</p>
              <p>"The Buddha's statement that the five aggregates are dukkha thus reveals that the very things we identify with and hold to as the basis for happiness, rightly seen, are the basis for the suffering that we dread. Even when we feel ourselves comfortable and secure, the instability of the aggregates is itself a source of oppression and keeps us perpetually exposed to suffering in its more blatant forms. The whole situation becomes multiplied further to dimensions beyond calculation when we take into account the Buddha's disclosure of the fact of rebirth. All beings in whom ignorance and craving remain present wander on in the cycle of repeated existence, samsara, in which each turn brings them the suffering of new birth, ageing, illness, and death. All states of existence within samsara, being necessarily transitory and subject to change, are incapable of providing lasting security. Life in any world is unstable, it is swept away, it has no shelter and protector, nothing of its own (MN 82.36).</p>
