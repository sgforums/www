              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Thailand is often referred to as “The Land of Buddhism”, the
              best country in the world for those looking to study the teachings of the
              Buddha, at least the Theravada branch of the teachings. Thailand’s reputation
              as the center of Buddhism is well renowned, with numerous people from all over
              the world often times coming to Thailand and even learning Thai so that they
              can study Buddhism there.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Buddhism is so revered in Thai culture that it is considered
              a tradition for Thai men to become monks at one point in their lives, even for
              a short period of time. Temples are considered sacred ground, with it being a
              taboo in Thailand to do any unwholesome acts on temple property.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Land of Buddhism or not, Buddhism in Thailand has not been
              free from secular politics, and Thai Buddhism has faced quite a few upheavals
              in modern times. Some monks have even become very active in Thai politics,
              political activist monk</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.khaosodenglish.com/politics/2014/02/11/1392101582/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">Buddha Issara</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">was a key leader in the
              anti-government protests of 2014.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The emergence of political involvement by members of the
              Buddhist clergy, a controversy over the succession of Thailand’s top monastic
              position, and of course the highly publicized case with the abbot of Wat Phra
              Dhammakaya have put the intricacies involved with Thai Buddhism into the light.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">On Wednesday June 22nd, 2016 the Foreign Correspondents Club
              of Thailand held a panel on the topic of the Politics of Thai Buddhism that
              conveys much valuable insight into the complicated nature of Thai Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">One point brought up about Buddhism in Thailand by Vichak
              Panich, one of the panel speakers, was that Thailand has a two-tiered system of
              religious organization, with monks on top and lay people on the bottom. This of
              course, is not something unique to Thailand, as Buddhist monastics are
              considered part of the revered Triple Gem, the most respected aspect of
              Buddhism. Regardless, due to Thailand’s strong Buddhist culture and reverence
              for Buddhism, this aspect is notably strong in Thailand.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Thai culture as a whole puts monks on a pedestal, almost like
              a noble class. Many Thais do not just highly respect monks, but are afraid to
              do anything malign to monks for the most part, in fear of karmic consequences.
              Monks are also governed for the most part by their own laws, led by the Sangha
              Council of Thailand, and anything involving monastic misconduct is usually
              dealt with by the Sangha Council rather than secular authorities. It should be
              noted the Sangha Council system exists in other Buddhist countries also
              however. This tier system even applies to certain aspects of criminal
              investigations, as Thai law gives special privileges that make it so royalty,
              diplomats, and monks cannot be summoned by law enforcement as witnesses, only
              requested.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Another interesting point brought up by Panich was that there
              are considered to be essentially 3 ways to practice Buddhism in Thailand:
              forest renunciation, settled monasticism, and the lay life. I don’t agree 100%
              with Panich’s analysis, but that is just my personal opinion and I think he
              still brings up some good points. As Panich explains, the forest tradition, is
              the most immersive practice of the Dhamma. Forest monks renunciate the world
              and focus on very strict asceticism. They give up most modern amenities and
              focus largely on strict Dhamma practice and mental cultivation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The lay life of Thai Buddhism focuses on living ethically in
              the worldly life. While it is okay to enjoy the conveniences and joys of the
              material world, one should live ethically and not cause suffering to others.
              Lay people should also still be mindful of the law of impermanence and that all
              things must come to an end. The key to true happiness comes from within,
              through personal practice, not through material enjoyment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The last way of practice is what Panich calls “settled
              monasticism”. The path of entering monkhood but not the forest. Becoming a city
              monk is what Panich calls a middle path between the Dhamma and worldly life.
              City monks still take on the 227 precepts and the vows of the entering the
              Sangha, but do not engage in as much asceticism as forest monks and still have
              a few modern conveniences such as cell phones to handle daily tasks. Monks
              having technology is</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conan-obrien-buddhist-temple_us_570d416be4b01422324a5bee"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">not unique to Thailand</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">just so you know.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Settled monastics live more integrated with society, and
              while they still put Dhamma practice at the front of their life, they still deal
              with some daily tasks laypeople might deal with that forest monks wouldn’t.
              While this isn’t true in every case, forest monks can usually be identified
              with darker colored robes while city monks will usually have brighter colored
              robes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Another shakeup Thailand is dealing with is the succession of
              the Supreme Patriarch, the leader of the Sangha Council. While the Thai Sangha
              Council did unanimously agree on a nominee for the new Supreme Patriarch, there
              has been controversy over the decision, as Thai law requires both the council
              and secular government agree on the nominee. The leading candidate was not
              approved by the secular government and the position appointment has been held
              up in gridlock for about two years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">And of course, no discussion on the current state of Buddhism
              in Thailand is complete without a mention of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The temple
              has been</span><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nicholas-liusuwan/why-is-wat-phra-dhammakay_b_10422798.html"><span><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; color: #2e7061;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">shrouded in
              controversy</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">for quite some time as many criticize
              the temple’s unorthodox practices. Some say the temple is unBuddhist, others</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln260/Dhammakaya.htm"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">say it is modern</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">. The ongoing case focusing on Dhammakaya has served
              as not just a legal case, but as a proxy war among those who support the
              temple, and those who oppose it. Many longtime opponents of the temple see the
              divisive case as the key to bringing down the massive yet controversial temple
              they so staunchly oppose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">On the other end, faithful followers are doing all they can
              to protect the abbot, including blocking an attempt by DSI to arrest the
              Dhammakaya abbot. US based devotees even made a White House Petition, and a</span><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><a href="http://freedomwatchinternational.org/freedom-watch-international-discusses-us-congressmans-visit-dhammakaya/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #2e7061;">US Congressman recently visited</span></a><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;  color: #222222;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">a US Dhammakaya branch in early June
              to discuss the case. A large part of why Venerable Dhammajayo supporters’ are
              so stern to defend the abbot has to do with the Thai legal code toward monks.
              Thai law requires that monks be forcibly disrobed if jailed before trial. Even
              if found innocent at trial, Buddhist monastic code will require Venerable
              Dhammajayo to start as a brand new monk and lose all seniority if he were to
              ordain again after being disrobed. The Buddhist monastic code requires 5 years
              seniority before a monk can be an abbot. The justice minister has made
              statements about disrobing the Dhammakaya abbot, which has made many followers
              suspicious.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As two of the four speakers of the panel were very well known
              anti-Dhammakaya critics, Dhammakaya followers were not pleased with the
              portrayal of the temple in the panel. A response from Dhammakaya followers
