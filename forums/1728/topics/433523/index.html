              <h1>A Teaching on Guru Rinpoche's 
                      Supplication That All Thoughts Be Self-Liberated</h1>
              <h2>Tashi Chöling, Oregon, U.S.A.<br> November 18, 2002</h2>
              <p><strong><span class="style1">Listen to Guru Rinpoche's "Supplication
                    That All Thoughts Be Self-Liberated"</span> <a href="http://www.ktgrinpoche.org/audio/guru_rinpoche_prayer.mp3">Download</a></strong></p>
              <p>Tashi Delek! I hope that for you everything is filled with 
                      auspiciousness, happiness, and excellence. To meet you all here makes 
                      me very happy. Gyatrul Rinpoche is a great friend of mine and I have heard 
                      a lot about his monastery here. Today, to actually come and be able to 
                      see it, to see what a secluded and beautiful place it is, makes me very 
                      happy.<br> <br> I would like to explain to you a supplication that was composed by Guru 
                      Rinpoche, a supplication that all thoughts be self-liberated. Guru Rinpoche 
                      composed seven chapters of supplications for students to recite to him, 
                      and this one comes from a chapter that he taught to the monk whose name 
                      was Namkha'i Nyingpo.<br> <br> Before listening to this teaching, please give rise to the supreme motivation 
                      of bodhichitta. When we give rise to bodhichitta, it means that for the 
                      benefit of all sentient beings, limitless in number as the sky is vast 
                      in its extent, we aim to bring our love and compassion to their ultimate 
                      perfection, and to bring our wisdom realizing emptiness to its ultimate 
                      perfection. We know that in order to do this we must listen to, reflect 
                      upon and meditate on the teachings of the genuine Dharma with all the 
                      enthusiasm we can muster in our hearts.<br> <br> The first verse of the supplication<sup>1</sup> is:<br> <br> <em>All these forms that appear to eyes that see,<br> All things on the outside and the inside,<br> The environment and its inhabitants<br> Appear, but let them rest where no self's found;<br> Perceiver and perceived when purified<br> Are the body of the deity, clear emptiness—<br> To the guru for whom desire frees itself,<br> To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.</em><br> <br> What appears to the eyes are forms, which are made up of shapes and colors. 
                      Everything that is a shape and color is included in the source of consciousness 
                      (Sanskrit: <em>ayatana</em>) that is called form. The shapes and colors 
                      that appear to the eyes are found in all of the aspects of the environment 
                      in which we live, as well as in all of the sentient beings who inhabit 
                      this environment. What is the true nature of the appearances of shapes 
                      and colors of the environment and sentient beings? It is that they are 
                      dependently arisen mere appearances, which do not exist in essence. The 
                      forms that appear do not truly exist. In the abiding nature of reality, 
                      their nature is emptiness. They appear while being empty; while empty, 
                      they appear. They are appearance-emptiness like rainbows, water-moons, 
                      and reflections. All of the objects that appear to the eyes are appearance-emptiness 
                      undifferentiable.<br> <br> As the protector Nagarjuna writes in his <em>Fundamental Wisdom of the 
                      Middle Way</em><sup>2</sup>:<br> <br> <em>Like a dream, like an illusion<br> Like a city of gandharvas, <br> That's how birth, and that's how living,<br> That's how dying are taught to be.</em><br> <br> The meaning of this verse and the one from Guru Rinpoche's supplication 
                      are exactly the same.<br> <br> This is the actual way forms are. They are appearance-emptiness undifferentiable, 
                      but sentient beings do not see this because they think things truly exist, 
                      and their thoughts that cling to the true existence of appearances obscure 
                      the appearance-emptiness that is their true nature. That is why we practice 
                      the Dharma—to cleanse ourselves of this clinging to appearances 
                      as truly existent so that we can realize appearances' true nature is appearance-emptiness 
                      undifferentiable.<br> <br> It is like when you dream and you do not know that you are dreaming. The 
                      appearances in the dream are appearance-emptiness, but your thought that 
                      they truly exist prevents you from seeing that. Even though the dream 
                      appearances are appearance-emptiness and have no inherent nature, they 
                      seem to be real when you do not know that you are dreaming. You think 
                      that they are real and you have experiences that seem to confirm your 
                      belief that they are real.<br> <br> But however much you cling to the appearances in a dream, that does not 
                      change what the appearances are from their own side. The essential nature 
                      of these appearances is unchanging appearance-emptiness. It never moves 
                      from being just that. When you dream and you know you are dreaming, you 
                      are free of the thoughts that fixate on the appearances as being truly 
                      existent. You are free from that obscuration so you can experience the 
                      appearances just as they are: as appearance-emptiness. That enables you 
                      to do wonderful things like fly in the sky, move unobstructedly through 
                      rock mountains, and travel to pure realms. All that is possible when you 
                      recognize a dream for what it is, and in that way, not be blocked by thinking 
                      that the appearances truly exist.<br> <br> In our waking life, even though the environment and sentient beings appear 
                      to us, the supplication says "let them rest where no self's found." 
                      The environment and sentient beings appear, but let them rest without 
                      clinging to them as truly existent. Let them rest in their natural state 
                      of appearance-emptiness without fixating on them as being real. When we 
                      let the appearances rest without fixating on them as being real, all of 
                      the thoughts of there being an actual object out there to perceive and 
                      an actual distinct subject perceiving it just dissolve. The thoughts that 
                      take the duality of perceived object and perceiving subject to be real 
                      dissolve. They are purified.<br> <br> When that happens, everything shines as luminous emptiness, clarity-emptiness. 
                      At this point, you are ready to meditate on the deity, because the deity's 
                      enlightened body is also appearance-emptiness. It appears while it is 
                      empty; it is empty while it appears—it is like a rainbow. When you 
                      meditate on the deity, everything appears as the body of the deity—appearance-emptiness.<br> <br> When all of the appearances of the physical environment shine as the appearance-emptiness 
                      immeasurable palace of the deity, and all the sentient beings in the environment 
                      shine as the appearance-emptiness enlightened bodies of the deities themselves, 
                      then all desire is free in its own place. It is self-liberated. Thoughts 
                      of desire do not come from anywhere and they do not go anywhere. They 
                      do not arise, so they do not cease. Since they are free from coming and 
                      going, and free from arising and ceasing, thoughts of desire are self-liberated. 
                      For this reason the verse says, "To the guru for whom desire frees 
                      itself, To Orgyen Pema Jungnay, I supplicate."<br> <br> The second verse of the supplication is:<br> <br> <em>All these sounds that appear for ears that hear,<br> Taken as agreeable or not,<br> Let them rest in the realm of sound and emptiness<br> Past all thought, beyond imagination;<br> Sounds are empty, unarisen and unceasing,<br> These are what make up the Victor's teaching—<br> To the teachings of the Victor, sound and emptiness,<br> To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.<br> </em><br> What appear to the ears are sounds. What is the nature of this source 
                      of consciousness that is sound? In fact, the sounds we hear are like sounds 
                      in a dream. Their basic nature is that they are always appearance-emptiness—they 
                      appear while being empty, and while being empty they appear.<br> <br> The two main kinds of sounds we hear are those that we find pleasing and 
                      those we do not. Both kinds of sounds, however, are equally appearance-emptiness, 
                      sound-emptiness, just as the sounds in a dream are sound-emptiness. If 
                      we know this and meditate on the mandala of the deities, then all sounds 
                      manifest as the natural sounds of the deity's mantra: sound and emptiness.<br> <br> From among the eight worldly dharmas,<sup>3</sup> four of them are related 
                      to sound—sounds that are pleasing, sounds that are displeasing, 
                      sounds of praise, and sounds of criticism. We need to give up attachment 
                      to the eight worldly dharmas—the four that we like and the four 
                      that we do not. To do that, we can see that we need to realize that sounds 
                      are sound-emptiness. Then we will not be attached to sounds that are pleasant 
                      and sounds of praise, and we will not be averse to sounds of criticism 
                      and unpleasant sounds.<br> <br> In a dream, all sounds of praise and all sounds of criticism, all sounds 
                      we like and all sounds we do not, are equally sound-emptiness. They have 
                      no inherent nature at all. But when we do not know that we are dreaming, 
                      we think these sounds truly exist, and we have experiences of happiness 
                      and suffering based on sounds of praise and blame, sounds that we like, 
                      and sounds that we do not; all because we do not recognize sounds' basic 
                      nature is sound-emptiness. Guru Rinpoche instructs: "Let them rest 
                      in the realm of sound and emptiness/Past all thought, beyond imagination." 
                      This is an instruction to rest free of clinging to sounds as being truly 
                      existent, free of clinging to them as being real. In their basic nature 
                      that is sound and emptiness, just let go and relax. Settle into your own 
                      basic nature within the nature of sound that is sound and emptiness. <br> <br> Since the enlightened body of the Buddha is appearance-emptiness, then 
                      the sound of the Buddha's speech is also emptiness. It is sound-emptiness 
                      undifferentiable. When you know that all sound lacks inherent nature in 
                      the same way, then all sound is like the sound of the Buddha's teachings 
                      and all sound manifests as the resonance-emptiness sound of the Buddha's 
                      speech. The last line of the supplication reads, "To Orgyen Pema 
                      Jungnay I supplicate." Here Orgyen Pema Jungnay represents the Buddha's 
                      speech that is the sound-emptiness abiding reality of all the sound there 
                      is. To this Orgyen Pema Jungnay, we supplicate.<br> <br> At the beginning of this twenty-first century, everywhere we go there 
                      are radios playing, tape recorders playing, the sound of movies and televisions—the 
                      world is filled with sound. At this time, then, it is quite important 
                      to know that all sounds have no inherent nature. They are sound-emptiness. 
                      These days, moment by moment, sounds can be carried across the globe and 
                      change so many people's feelings all at once—from happiness to suffering, 
                      from suffering to happiness. Just on the basis of hearing a few sounds, 
                      millions of people's feelings can change. Also these days it is easy to 
                      realize that sounds are sound-emptiness, because if you pick up the phone 
                      in America at noon and you call somebody in another country, then for 
                      some people it will be midnight, and for some people in other countries 
                      it will be morning. So at what time is this sound really being made? In 
                      this way, we can easily recognize sound-emptiness. If somebody in America 
                      calls someone in India and talks to them on the phone, in America it is 
                      noon, in India it is midnight. A daytime mouth is talking to a nighttime 
                      ear—at the same time! If sounds were truly existent, that would 
                      be impossible. It would be a contradiction for sound made during the day 
                      to be heard simultaneously at night. But it is not a contradiction when 
                      we know that it is just sound-emptiness. Thinking about things in this 
                      way, during these times it is much easier to understand how sound is sound-emptiness.<br> <br> Also, these days a famous person can give a speech that is broadcast all 
                      over the world. The people who like that person will hear that speech 
                      as something very pleasant and beautiful. The people who do not like that 
                      person will find it repulsive to listen to. The people who have no opinion 
                      do not have any reaction to that sound one way or the other. If we ask, 
                      "What is that sound, really? Is it good or bad?" again we see 
                      that the true nature of sound is inexpressible. These days, sounds beam 
                      down from empty space. They come from empty buildings and even empty cars. 
                      It is important for us to be able to examine these sounds and their sources 
                      to see that they are sound-emptiness, because most of the suffering we 
                      experience comes from hearing sounds. We need to train in the understanding 
                      of sound as it is taught in the Middle Way, which is that in genuine reality, 
                      sounds are empty of any essence. In apparent reality, they are dependently 
                      arisen mere appearances.<br> <br> As the glorious Chandrakirti wrote,<br> <br> <em>Things do not arise causelessly, nor from Ishvara,<br> Nor from self, nor other, nor both;<br> Therefore, it is clear that things arise<br> Perfectly in dependence upon their causes and conditions.</em><br> <br> Things do not arise from any of the four possible extremes: from self, 
                      other, both or without cause, and there's no fifth possibility. Therefore, 
                      things do not truly arise—they do not come into existence; they 
                      do not actually happen. Then what is the appearance of them happening? 
                      It is just like the appearance of things happening in a dream; like the 
                      appearance of a moon shining on a pool of water; and like the appearance 
                      of an illusion. It is dependently arisen mere appearance. In this way, 
                      since sounds do not exist in genuine reality, and since in relative reality 
                      they are just dependently arisen mere appearances, all sounds are simply 
                      sound-emptiness. When you recite mantras, then mantras are also sound-emptiness.<br> <br> We supplicate Guru Rinpoche at the end of the verse, because even though 
                      we know that sounds are sound and emptiness, we are obscured from realizing 
                      that directly by our thoughts that cling to sounds as being truly existent. 
                      We supplicate for Guru Rinpoche's blessing so that these thoughts that 
                      sounds truly exist may dissolve, and when they dissolve, that we will 
                      recognize the true nature of sound is sound-emptiness.<br> <br> The third verse of the supplication is:<br> <br> <em>All these movements of mind towards its objects,<br> These thoughts that make five poisons and afflictions,<br> Leave thinking mind to rest without contrivances,<br> Do not review the past nor guess the future;<br> If you let such movement rest in its own place,<br> It liberates into the dharmakaya—<br> To the guru for whom awareness frees itself,<br> To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.<br> </em><br> For ordinary beings, mind is discursive. It moves. It moves towards objects. 
                      It moves towards the three times. It is constantly thinking about one 
                      thing or another. Mind is moved by thoughts of the five poisons. When 
                      mind encounters an object it likes, it moves towards that object with 
                      thoughts of attachment. When mind encounters an object it does not like, 
                      it moves towards that object with thoughts of aversion, thoughts of anger. 
                      When mind judges something incorrectly, it moves towards that object with 
                      bewilderment. When one's mind believes that one has qualities that one 
                      does not have, it moves towards oneself with thoughts of arrogance. When 
                      mind looks at somebody else and sees things that it does not have, it 
                      moves towards that person with thoughts of jealously. In this way, thoughts 
                      of the five poisons constantly move the mind. "Leave thinking mind 
                      to rest without contrivances." When thoughts of the five poisons 
                      are moving the mind, just let mind rest without trying to fix anything, 
                      without trying to change anything, without reviewing the past <em>kleshas</em> (disturbing mental states) or wondering what happened to them; and without 
                      anticipating what types of disturbing states of mind one might experience 
                      in the future. Do not review the past, do not guess the future. Just let 
                      mind relax as it is right now.<br> <br> We do not need to try to prevent thoughts of desire from arising. We do 
                      not need to try to stop thoughts of anger or jealously once they have 
                      arisen. Do not try to prevent anything; do not try to stop or change anything; 
                      just simply do not take any of those movements of mind to be truly existent. 
                      That is the instruction because we could not stop the thoughts of the 
                      five poisons from arising, even if we wanted to! We could not do that, 
                      but we do not have to. All we have to do is recognize that these thoughts 
                      lack any essence.<br> <br> How do we do this? Whatever thought arises, look straight at it with your 
                      eye of wisdom and settle into its basic nature. When you do that, all 
                      thoughts and all disturbing states of mind are liberated within the dharmakaya. 
                      They are self-liberated. The whole collection of thoughts is free just 
                      as it is. This is awareness, and this awareness is awareness-emptiness. 
                      Since this awareness-emptiness is pure in nature, whatever obscurations 
                      there may be have no essence. Awareness itself is self-liberated. It is 
                      free just as it is.<br> <br> Then we supplicate the guru whose awareness is self-liberated. This is 
                      Guru Rinpoche. For Guru Rinpoche, awareness frees itself. We supplicate 
                      you Orgyen Pema Jungnay for your blessings so that we may realize, as 
                      you do, the self-liberation of awareness.<br> <br> The Lord of Yogis Milarepa sang in his vajra song of realization called 
                      "The Three Nails"<sup>4</sup>:<br> <br> <em>To describe the nails of meditation, the three<br> All thoughts in being dharmakaya are free<br> Awareness is luminous, in its depths is bliss<br> And resting without contrivance is equipoise</em><br> <br> All thoughts are dharmakaya in their nature. Thoughts are free all by 
                      themselves, without having to do anything to them, stop them, or change 
                      them in any way. They are naturally dharmakaya. What is dharmakaya like? 
                      It is luminous. It is awareness. It is bliss. How do we experience this 
                      dharmakaya in meditation? Rest without contrivance. Rest without artifice. 
                      This is equipoise. This is the experience of dharmakaya. The verses of 
                      Milarepa and Guru Rinpoche have the same meaning.<br> <br> What is awareness-emptiness like? Milarepa described it in the following 
                      way in the song "The Ten Things it is Like"<sup>5</sup>:<br> <em><br> When you know the true nature of everything to be known<br> The wisdom that's aware of the true nature's like a cloud-free sky</em><br> <br> With these two lines, Milarepa tells us the emptiness aspect of awareness 
                      is like the sky completely free of clouds. Then he sings:<br> <br> <em>When the mud settles down and mind's river is crystal clear<br> Self-arisen awareness is like a polished mirror's shine</em><br> <br> Milarepa illustrates the luminous, bright, vivid aspect of awareness with 
                      the example of a perfectly polished mirror's sparkling shine. In this 
                      way, we see what emptiness is like, we see what awareness is like, and 
                      then we can understand that the two are undifferentiable.<br> <br> The great pandit Shakya Chokden described the noble Asanga's explanation 
                      of genuine reality as follows:<br> <br> <em>Clarity-emptiness, mere awareness, empty of the duality of perceived 
                      and<br>      perceiver is all phenomena's abiding reality.<br> Knowing this and combining it with a limitless accumulation of merit, 
                      the <br>      spontaneously present three kayas will manifest.<br> This is Asanga's tradition.</em><br> <br> In this way, Asanga presents the true nature of reality of all phenomena 
                      as nondual luminous emptiness, nondual awareness-emptiness. The explanation 
                      that the true nature of reality is emptiness beyond all concept of what 
                      it might be is the presentation of the Middle Way Consequence School (<em>Prasangika 
                      Madhyamaka</em>). The presentation of the true nature of reality as awareness-emptiness, 
                      luminous clarity, is the presentation of the <em>Shentong Madhyamaka</em>, 
                      the Empty of Other Middle Way School, and also the presentation of the 
                      Mahamudra and Dzogchen traditions. What does the term "empty of other" 
                      or <em>shentong</em> mean? This is described in the text called the <em>Gyu 
                      Lama</em>, the <em>Treatise on Buddha Nature:</em><br> <br> <em>The element is empty of that which is separable from it, all fleeting 
                      stains.<br> But it is not empty of that which is inseparable from it, its own unsurpassable 
                      qualities.</em><br> <br> "Empty of other" means that the buddha nature, the true nature 
                      of mind, luminous clarity, awareness, is empty of that which is different 
                      from it: stains and flaws. It is empty of those. But it is not empty of 
                      the spontaneously present qualities, the naturally present qualities of 
                      enlightenment. These unsurpassable qualities are totally inseparable from 
                      the true nature of mind.<br> <br> In short, this supplication is a supplication that we will manifest our 
                      own basic nature. We supplicate the guru to bless us so that we can manifest 
                      the awareness-emptiness that is the true nature of mind. It is a supplication 
                      that all appearances will be self-liberated as the enlightened body of 
                      the deity, all sounds will be self-liberated as the enlightened speech 
                      of the deity, and all thoughts will be self-liberated as essential reality 
                      itself.<br> <br> The last verse of the supplication sums it all up:<br> <br> <em>Grant your blessing that purifies appearance <br> Of objects perceived as being outside;<br> Grant your blessing that liberates perceiving mind,<br> The mental operation seeming inside;<br> Grant your blessing that between the two of these<br> Clear light will come to recognize its own face;<br> In your compassion, sugatas of all three times,<br> Please bless me that a mind like mine be freed.</em><br> <br> Grant your blessings that all clinging to objects on the outside as truly 
                      existent will be self-liberated. Grant your blessings that all thoughts 
                      on the inside will be self-liberated. Grant your blessings that in between, 
                      luminous clarity, Dzogchen, will recognize its own face. In your compassion, 
                      realized buddhas of all three times, grant your blessings that I and all 
                      sentient beings may be freed from clinging to characteristics. Grant your 
                      blessings that I and all sentient beings may be freed from the bondage 
                      of samsara. Grant your blessings that I and all sentient beings may be 
                      freed from the bondage of believing that duality truly exists. Grant your 
                      blessing that all of our concepts of duality will be self-liberated.<br> <br> My departing prayer is that Gyatrul Rinpoche be healthy, that he live 
                      a long life, and that his activity for the benefit of all sentient beings 
                      flourish. And I pray that all of you, his students, bring your activities 
                      of listening to, reflecting on and meditating on the teachings of the 
                      genuine Dharma to their perfection and that, through this, you are of 
                      great benefit to all of the limitless number of sentient beings. And especially 
                      here at Tashi Chöling may the teachings of the practice and explanation 
                      lineages flourish and bring great benefit to all of the beings of this
