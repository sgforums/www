              <p>It is during the festivities that some of us are overwhelmed with feelings of self consciousness, sharp pangs of unfulfillment and emptiness.</p>
              <p>Some, it seems are unable to partake in the festivities in a joyous mood as they felt have not accomplished as much as compared to others, and as a result, felt left out, lagging behind.</p>
              <p>Others, being in amidst of it all, caught up in the flurry of activities,  are overwhelmed  in the opposite of the scale of participation, feels flustered. And when the  festivities ends, feels drained.</p>
              <p>On both ends, the feelings of emptiness creeps in, and one feels a sense of  loss and unrealness of existence.</p>
              <p>And why so?! It is because Self is something never permanent and inherent to begin with. Because the pace of life does not match the pace of our consciousness, our Self, that such a feeling of  uneasiness  arise. We project and expect expectations to conform them to occur within timeframe. But life, often do not turn out the way we want, so life is full of regrets and disappointment. Such is  the life. </p>
              <p>Life is dukkha, or dissatisfaction.   To find bliss, we need to go back to the ordinariness of being.</p>
              <p>To begin with,  we do not live in the present moment, for when either dwell in  the  past and project towards  what that has not come, in other words, the future. We often comes short, and end up dissatisfied. We hold back unsatisfactory feeling without acknowledging them. Suppressing them, allowing them to bite back at us on a later date.</p>
              <p>We crave self gratification,  and often  we fell  short and yet we are  often so comfortable in wallowing in self pity that we are unwilling to wake ourselves out of  this  state of unsatisfactoriness.</p>
              <p>What are states of unsatisfactoriness, unhappiness, regret, anger, envy, craving, denial are among them. We have develop such behavioral patterns to help as relate  life to us and know they  have come to haunt us. Such is the formulae that has come to define our personality and character has now  come to bind us in a vicious cycle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One  way of overcoming these sensations is  to savour each moment  as it come,  being in  respect for the  moment enjoying each  experience as it arises, not anticipating  nor over indulging.  The difficult  part is in the over indulging  of the pleasurable and negative  rise of emotions. One way of putting is like when holding a pen, or a weapon and  or even a broom when attempting using them. Holding firm without grasping it too tightly. This how we can hold our mind.</p>
              <p>A  light touch is called for not allowing them  to forment, aggravating them. We simply  acknowledge the rise of any  emotions, initially with a labelling, eg. I am angry, I am disgusted, so on. As we become more dexterous, we are now just responding to angry, disgusted, without the I.</p>
              <p>The more we are accustomed to such attention, we detected the rise  of reactions as quickenings  of   consciousness, until they are no  longer habitual.</p>
              <p>We progress from grossness of such emotions to subtle rise of such emotions. We gradually progress until they no longer become our push buttons.</p>
              <p>There are many conditions that impede the extinction of such arising of  such emotions, but they are doable. Just be mindful of aggravating  factors that causes the  negative emotion to rise. Practice  vigilance and single mindedness at  all  times will  help.</p>
