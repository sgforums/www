              <p>Hi All, </p>
              <p>I'm someone with abit of 3rd eye in one of my eyes, so I can see spirits every now and then for a short while. Recently I moved to a new house, and even though there is a guanyin altar, I still see spirits every now and then. Its very disturbing, I just saw a small kid in my room last night. </p>
              <p>Feel so frustrated, imagine having to sleep after knowing ure not alone in your room at night. Is there any way to solve this thing permanently? I rather I can't see such things. </p>

              <p>I can't see good things (good spirits). Bad things see every now and then, since teenage years. sibey suay. When i chant guanyin's name, I can sense her protection sometimes, but it doesnt stop the eye from 'auto-activating' now and then. </p>
              <p>Its not like I can see them for long periods at one shot, only 1-2 seconds. But its abit scary to know something is there with you, especially at night in your own room/house or in hotel room/office. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not hallucination. Ive consulted a few taoist mediums and also a Buddhist master. </p>

              <p>Mostly shadows (black/white), light blue. I haven't seen a red one before. Contrary to movies, red ones are really really rare i guess. Black and white shadow very common. </p>

              <p>Having this 'ability' sucks. I give you guys a few examples over the years since i was 12-13. </p>
              <p>1. Go to Malaysia with family for tour. At night before sleep, saw a lady wearing modern     clothes with skirt. Jialat liao, im not alone when im sleeping, got zha bo looking. </p>
              <p>2. Play game during weekend after midnight, come out take water. See shadow walking     across your living room, or standing in your kitchen (lol). </p>
              <p>3. Go new office, see black shadow at office lobby during evening after work. Now I         don't even dare to use the male toilet too long myself. </p>
              <p>4. Wake up in middle of night want to urine, see ginna or some shadow looking at you.    (Very rare, but happens to me dunno why). </p>
              <p>5. Walk past a road see wandering shadows. </p>
              <p>Last time when i saw shadow in my old house kitchen regularly, at first I didnt believe and thought i was too stressed. How can my house have these things when i have Guan Yin altar in the living room? </p>
              <p>Then after i moved out of the old house, my dad told me actually he heard some strange sounds at night when he bath. He comes home from work late, sometimes bath during midnight. </p>

              <p>I'm not sure if this is the cause, or linked to it. My eye kanna this thing around same time when my past life debtor come look for me when i was a kid.</p>
              <p>Apparently i owed some love debt to a woman, and even after I reincarnated liao she still look all over and finally found me when i was 12-13 years old. That time, a Buddhist master 'saved' me and told me not to tell anyone about this thing, even to friends. In real life, i have never mentioned this to anyone. </p>
              <p>So, past life and karma are very real. I always believe. </p>

              <p>Yes, im very open minded to all these things. But of course there are many hoaxes out there. There are many ppl out there who just want to cheat money. :) Don't easily believe anyone who tell you they got some power. </p>
              <p>Coming back to the main topic, i think the eye is there to stay. Maybe i just wanted to vent my frustrations. </p>

              <p>Hi Curseswith3rdeye,</p>
              <p>I got a theory about why certain people see ghost more easily... but i cannot be sure as i have not gathered enough data.</p>
              <p>If you don't mind, care to give me your date of birth plus time. Or better still do you know your 5 element composition (bazi- å…«å­— ) at the time of your birth.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>Cool that simpo is showing up :)</p>
              <p>From personal experience, I have seen ghost when I was 9 years old and living in a rented (very ulu) house for 9 months. Thank goodness it was only for 9 months.</p>
              <p>It was a white/black shadowy figure, I can only see the hand clearly and it was sort of reaching out to me. I freaked out needless to say, I was too shocked to even speak or move.</p>
              <p>Later I got a sense that it was trying to seek help, I told my mother and she helped donate money to dharma publishing in the name of the spirits. They didn't disturb me after that and my mom said on that day we were leaving that house, the whole house is very smokey and they were probably trying to say thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you know of a Buddhist master who can è¶…åº¦ the spirits so that they can be reborn in higher realms, that is best and you can invite him/her to your house.</p>
              <p>Otherwise you can just donate money, or attend a puja (fa hui) and dedicate the merits in the name of the spirit.</p>
              <p>You should tell the spirit before hand in the house: I am going to dedicate the merit of this deed in your name, please accept this deed being done in your name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF the spirits keep disturbing you for some reason (usually it won't be the case), there are ways like burning guggulu/guggul in your house. As Loppon Namdrol says, that's one simple way to ward off spirits. I'm not sure where you can buy them but they should not be expensive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. dedication of merits is an effective way for lower realm beings to attain a more favourable rebirth: <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no1a.htm</a></p>

              <p>My mom said in the past there was someone who went to Lim Chu Kang (cemetary area) during her girl guides days. Then she dreamt of some ghosts who appeared in her dream and requested that she help them by dedicating merits.</p>
              <p>She dedicated merits by donating to the publishing of free dharma magazines, later the spirits thanked her in her dream.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. those ghosts said they were killed during World War 2 by the Japanese.</p>
