              <p>Hope I can help alittle bit. I hear some opinion from buddhist monk</p>
              <p>1.  We human tend to treat that we are the owner of the house but actually  you move to that house and the spirit( in Buddhist teaching we call it peta) is already there long time before you come. So actually you're the intruder  not them. So sometimes we tend to make the way how to chase away the spirit because it trouble you. The fact is you trouble them first . So why can't in same place live peacefully as they don't disturb you really ? you're the visitor not them.</p>
              <p>2. the spirits ( they have psychic power) that they can make you see them or not. If they want you to see them , maybe they need your help. Life beings spirit( peta) is very sad.</p>
              <p>You can  donate foods or clothes ( those things they really need) to monks around your place  or the orphange or  old folks living and transfer merits to them. Hope that can help you live harmony with them.</p>

              <p>Dear TS</p>
              <p>sorry to hear your predicament. It is basically living a life full of unease and uncertainties......dunno when they will pop out.....where you will see them.</p>
              <p>There is not much I can help you as your gift may come from various reasons such as along your ancestral lines there were some who were gifted like you and it will be passed through the lines. 2nd, during your maturity stage, your Tian Ling Gai have not been fully formed/closed, thereby giving you this gift like how some young kids can see. Last but not the least, maybe something, be it a deity or a spirit had opend for you....be it a duty or a punishment....i dunno</p>
              <p>It is good for you to appreciate their manifestation by colours.....not many can do that. Try to avoid the reddish/red ones.....they have a lot of angst when they expired.....we really had a hard time subduing them and it takes even a longer time to assuage their anger.</p>
              <p>Finally, my last advice after seeing ppl like you (or special abilities get mess up), NEVER GIVE your Ba Zi to anyone who claims he can help you. A well trained bastard can see your lot in this life and do ATM transfer between you and him</p>

              <p>Ha ha.. actually i dun need his Bazi. Yeah... one can read alot about another person if he knows the bazi or ziweidoushu.</p>
              <p>I only need to find out about the 5 element composition. From the few persons that I have gathered that can see ghost... all their 5 element composition got little or no fire.  Their energy system has very little fire. My theory is that if Fire is present or strong enough, we may not resonate with ghosts enough to see them. This is just my theory. Fire-like prana (qi) is also link with sexual energy.. So my theory is that as long as you do not leak sexual energy through sex or masturbation, the fire composition should be high enough to not see them.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion..</p>

              <p>This is what I heard from my friends who know Tibetan Rinpoches. It is not advisable to have affinity with unknown beings. Unless you have the ability to help, or else it is better to leave it to well practice monks to help them. There are monks who dare not to help because they think that they don't have the abilityï¼ˆæ³•åŠ›ï¼‰to help them. What we can do is to dedicate merits to them but I doubt any ordinary practitioners like us have the ability to help them. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cursedwith3rdeye, I see you are in good hands now. Everybody are trying to help you. You must at least believe it will help you because if you don't help yourself, nobody can. I want you to see these people suggestions positively and let it be known to you that you are not alone. Because when you read those messages, you are also reading for them...them as those ghosts you are seeing. They hear what you hear and they listen to it. Light could be the best solution for you and them. I think if you feel like doing this just know that you are ok not harm. Close your eyes, Imagine and Visualize within your mind,  you are receiving a source of light from above and then your whole body is absorbing this rich and pure source of light. After you have seen your body is overflowing with this light, visualize your body is spreading it all around you by letting your body to shine out that Bright Light until you see the whole house of yours is illuminated with that pure light and then listen with calmness...with your heart and soul....speak with compassion ..."I see you and I know you need to go home to your place of origin..go with peace...as Light." They will know and be happy. When you feel its over open your eyes. Then don't think or talk about it anymore.</div>
