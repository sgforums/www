                  <p>I'm someone with abit of 3rd eye in one of my eyes, so I can see
                  spirits every now and then for a short while. Recently I moved to a
                  new house, and even though there is a guanyin altar, I still see
                  spirits every now and then. Its very disturbing, I just saw a small
                  kid in my room last night. </p>
                  <p>Feel so frustrated, imagine having to sleep after knowing ure
                  not alone in your room at night. Is there any way to solve this
                  thing permanently? I rather I can't see such things. </p>

              You shouldn't curse your third eye. Are you afraid of ghosts if you are then you must get used to it. Adjust and try to understand them. Take it that having the ability to see the ghosts as your gifted gift. Don't worry they won't harm you or try to frighten you once you understand them and they understand you. Used your thoughts when speaking to them they can received read your mind and you too can communicate with them once you know how to use your mind to communicate with them. However, don't try to be a medium for them to convey messages to people. Many people don't understand and they will think you are crazy. Just be yourself ya.

              I agree with you there. If you can just listen or ignore them that is good. About Quija board, to those who play this seance game, be advised that you are actually being possessed by those unseen being though you are conscious and aware of your surrounding.

              <p>Last time I was sleeping on the floor in a very very ulu house in Pulau Tekong (like those abandoned houses in 1970s) during an exercise.</p>
              <p>I had a dream, and a spirit asked me, you are a practitioner (I meditated for a while before I slept, perhaps thats why they knew), what supernatural powers do you have?</p>
              <p>I said no. Then that spirit/deity of that place tried to flung me out of that house perhaps to showcase his power or something, and at that time I instantly woke up.</p>

              <p><br>they say ufo in the future are really ghosts from the future dimensioned to the present time and dimension.so they are kind of related.its like chariots of the old age and future airplanes or people from the pat and future warped to the present time and dimesnion.sounds complicated?but if u think deep enough its not too difficult to understand.its not a joke either as supernatural guides have linked ufo to ghosts too.</p>
