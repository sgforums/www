              <p>Excerpts from <a href="http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/48">http://www.kenwilber.com/blog/show/48</a></p>
              <p>To help unfold it, here’s a simplified version of the Path of the 
              Great Liberation, which actually has two paths united in it.  Start by 
              noticing that you have two basic arenas of awareness: that which is 
              seen, and that which is the Seer, the Witness, your True Self.</p>
              <p>Now, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you can see your ego</span>, you are aware of it right now.  You
               are aware of the ego or self-contraction, you can feel it in this 
              moment.  And you can feel your self-contraction because, in reality, it 
              is an object, not a subject.  It is not a real subject or True Self at 
              all.  Yet we tend to always be identifying with the ego or 
              self-contraction, which is what I am <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>, and forget to rest as the Witness, which is what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am</span>.  We are the feeling Witness, not the felt ego.</p>
              <p>It’s a classic case of mistaken identity, a mistake called samsara, 
              maya, sin, illusion, etc.—and probably given its best, shortest 
              definition by Patanjali, founder of yoga: “Bondage is the identification
               of the Seer with the instruments of seeing.”</p>
              <p>Now both sides of awareness are necessary—the phenomenal or manifest 
              or relative realm of objects, and the ultimate or absolute or nondual 
              realm of the one and only Subject or True Self—the One Self in us all, 
              and the Self of all that is.  YOUR True Self is the same True Self in 
              all sentient beings, so by resting in the Witness, you will know the 
              entire Kosmos from within….</p>
              <p>(We will come back to this, and I’ll give a very effective experiential exercise for contacting your own True Self <em>right now</em>….)</p>
              <p>The True Self is marked by a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">radical</span> inclusiveness, so radical
               it is sometimes hard to understand.  It embraces everything that is 
              arising with no exceptions whatsoever—ozone hole, car crash, beautiful 
              sunset, terrorist attack, Bach music: all the same.  This is why it is 
              often called <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mirror Mind</span>.   If something good arises, it 
              impartially reflects that with complete nonattachment.  If something bad
               arises, it impartially reflects that, with no aversion at all.</p>
              <p>You can notice that part of your awareness right now: clouds float by
               in the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, sensations float by in the 
              body, sounds float by as well—there is an aspect of your awareness that 
              simply Witnesses or Notices, without judgment or condemnation, 
              everything that is arising.  The Mirror Mind is always there, even if we
               forget it.  It witnesses Hitler in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">precisely</span> the same way it witnesses Mother Teresa.  Again, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">radical inclusion</span>.</p>
              <p>On the relative plane, however, judgments are made and should be 
              made.  This is the plane where they are relatively real.  As Buddha 
              said, “Choose good, avoid evil, this is the path”—the path, that is, in 
              the relative realm of objects.</p>
              <p>In the relative realm, more inclusive is better than less inclusive, 
              more depth is better than less depth, more love is better than less 
              love, second tier is better than first tier, more compassion is better 
              than less compassion.  In the absolute realm (of your own impartial 
              Witness of all that is arising), all of those are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">absolutely equal</span>.
                (As we said, the Mirror Mind reflects Hitler and Teresa equally).  But
               in the relative or phenomenal realm, Teresa is better than Hitler, and 
              so on.</p>
              <p>Here is the point: idiot compassion is a confusing of relative and 
              absolute paths.  Idiot compassion is not only afraid to ruffle feathers,
               it is afraid to make judgments and rankings and holarchies and 
              gradations and so on, because it confuses total nonjudgmentalism (which 
              applies only to Mirror Mind) with the realm of objects where judgments 
              should be made.  What is supposed to happen is that, resting in Mirror 
              Mind, and reflecting everything equally as it arises, relative judgments
               arise within that space and are made about things that are better or 
              worse, good or bad, true or false, and so on.  So you should feel <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> a radical impartially (or total inclusion) as the ground of everything arising in your own I AMness or Witness, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and</span> some things that arise within all space are definitely judged better and worse than others.</p>
              <p>So, both the self-contraction and idiot compassion are cases of <em>mistaken identity</em>,
               and you can feel—and overcome—this mistake in this very moment, if you 
              follow a few pointing out instructions (which I will give in a moment). 
               As we saw, the ego or self-contraction is merely and actually an 
              object, it’s not what you really are, it’s not even a real subject, it’s
               just an object, it’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seen</span>, it can’t see anything.  Objects can’t see, only subjects can.  But we mistake the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seen ego</span> for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Real Seer</span>, the True Self—we mistake the temporal ego for our timeless I AMness.</p>
              <p>That’s the first mistake of confusing the relative, objective, phenomenal ego for the absolute Self that I AM.</p>
              <p>The second mistake is to similarly confuse the radical 
              nonjudgmentalism of the Real Self (or Mirror Mind) with the phenomenal 
              world where judgments should and must be made. Thus, on the relative 
              plane the path is “Do good, avoid evil, this is the path.”  On the 
              absolute or nondual plane, however, the path is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">choiceless awareness</span>,
               beyond good and evil, reflecting each impartially, or simply resting in
               the pure Presence of this moment, the simple feeling of Being, the 
              Witness of this and every moment, and let it all come rushing through in
               radical nonattachment and purest equanimity—the vast and infinite 
              Mirror Mind that, Chung Tzu says, “grasps nothing, seeks nothing, 
              receives but does not keep.”</p>
              <p>Both paths are to be practiced together in the genuine nondual Path 
              of the Great Liberation—a Great Liberation that occurs each and every 
              moment—right now—that one’s identity shifts from a false self (the seen 
              ego, the self-contraction) to the True Self (Big Mind or Mirror Mind, 
              the infinite I AMness in each and every sentient being), embracing all 
              that arises in the brilliant clarity and luminosity of the infinite 
              shine of Mirror Mind.  That is the aim of the nondual paths of 
              Liberation, and the aim of Integral Life Practice as well.</p>
              <p>In ILP, with regard to the <em>relative path</em>, we follow the <strong>Prime Directive</strong>: work diligently to protect and promote the greatest depth for the greatest span.  But in the ultimate or <em>nondual path</em>, we allow everything to be exactly as it is.  <strong>Choiceless awareness</strong>,
               without judging, condemning, condoning, grasping, or keeping—no 
              accepting or rejecting, no judging or not judging, all in the timeless 
              Now of Mirror Mind.</p>
              <p>But to confuse the two paths (as opposed to integrating them) is to 
              wind up missing the truths of both.  You apply relative traits to the 
              absolute and end up dualistic (e.g., a realized sage embraces just 
              heaven but never hell) and then both truths actually go to hell.  This 
              is the world of idiot compassion, and unfortunately, the very 
              characteristics of the green meme make this confusion extremely common: a
               spiritual path with Manjushri carrying a wooden spoon instead of the 
              sword of discriminating wisdom (prajna), whereupon depth disappears from
               the world almost immediately, leaving in its place a placid sea of the 
              herd mentality, holding its breath lest it speak too loudly, ruffle a 
              feather, and find that “the person who caused it must go away”—and in 
              green, everybody is afraid of going away, of uttering a single thing 
              that sets in motion a <em>judgment</em> of real wisdom or compassion.</p>
              <p>I will come back to this, as I said, and give those pointing out 
              instructions for the Great Liberation.  But I want to quickly point out 
              that, with reference to idiot compassion, I put a few sentences in the 
              post that carried its real message, knowing that those who had eyes of 
              wisdom and compassion, not flatland wisdom and idiot compassion, would 
              see the few sentences in the blog that called to them:   “People will 
              make up their own minds.  I just wanted them—wanted us—wanted you—to 
              have some other facts and perspectives to take into account when making 
              up your mind…  which I hope will be to include <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both</span> sides, all 
              sides, in a larger picture.  I already have moved to do so in my own 
              mind, and I hope that you will too, because there is room for all in Big
               Mind, in a third-tier embrace of the entire Kosmos.  Things float by as
               clouds in the sky, with effortless ease in the all-inclusive Presence 
              that is witnessing this screen, and this room, and this world, arise in 
              luminous clarity and radiant splendor… and that is why it all rolls off 
              the back so easily, when all is said and done, for all are textures of 
              your very own Self, alone in the Alone….”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, as promised, here are some pointing out instructions for 
              realizing I AMness, or the perfect Mirror Mind, the infinite Self that 
              is your own True Self, and the Self of this and all the worlds.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Notice your present awareness.  Notice the objects arising in your 
              awareness—the images and thoughts arising in your mind, the feelings and
               sensations arising in your body, the myriad objects arising around you 
              in the room or environment.   All of these are objects arising in your 
              awareness.</p>
              <p>Now think about what was in your awareness 5 minutes ago.  Most of 
              the thoughts have changed, most of the bodily sensations have changed, 
              and probably most of the environment has changed.  But something has not
               changed.  Something in you is the same now as it was 5 minutes ago.  
              What is present now that was present 5 minutes ago?</p>
              <p>I AMness.  The feeling-awareness of I AMness is still present.  I am 
              that ever-present I AMness.  That I AMness is present now, it was 
              present a moment ago, it was present a minute ago, it was present 5 
              minutes ago.</p>
              <p>What was present 5 hours ago?</p>
              <p>I AMness.  That sense of I AMness is an ongoing, self-knowing, 
              self-recognizing, self-validating I AMness.  It is present now, it was 
              present 5 hours ago.  All my thoughts have changed, all my bodily 
              sensations have changed, my environment has changed, but I AM is 
              ever-present, radiant, open, empty, clear, spacious, transparent, free. 
               Objects have changed, but not this formless I AMness.  This obvious and
               present I AMness is present now as it was present 5 hours ago.</p>
              <p>What was present 5 years ago?</p>
              <p>I AMness.  So many objects have come and gone, so many feelings have 
              come and gone, so many thoughts have come and gone, so many dramas and 
              terrors and loves and hates have come, and stayed a while, and gone.  
              But one thing has not come, and one thing has not gone.  What is that?  
               What is the only thing present in your awareness right now that you can
               remember was present 5 years ago?  This timeless, ever-present feeling 
              of I AMness is present now as it was 5 years ago.</p>
              <p>What was present 5 centuries ago?</p>
              <p>All that is ever-present is I AMness.  Every person feels this same I
               AMness—because it is not a body, it is not a thought, it is not an 
              object, it is not the environment, it is not anything that can be seen, 
              but rather is the ever-present Seer, the ongoing open and empty Witness 
              of all that is arising, in any person, in any world, in any place, at 
              any time, in all the worlds until the end of time, there is only and 
              always this obvious and immediate I AMness.  What else could you 
              possibly know?  What else does anybody ever know?  There is only and 
              always this radiant, self-knowing, self-feeling, self-transcending I 
              AMness, whether present now, 5 minutes ago, 5 hours ago, 5 centuries 
              ago.</p>
              <p>5 millennia ago?</p>
              <p>Before Abraham was, I AM.  Before the universe was, I AM.  This is my
               original Face, the face I had before my parents were born, the face I 
              had before the universe was born, the Face I had for all eternity until I
               decided to play this round of hide and seek, and get lost in the 
              objects of my own creation.</p>
              <p>I will NEVER again pretend that I do not know or feel my own I AMness.</p>
              <p>And with that, the game is undone.  A million thoughts have come and 
              gone, a million feelings have come and gone, a million objects have come
               and gone.  But one thing has not come, and one thing has not gone: the 
              great Unborn and the great Undying, which never enters or leaves the 
              stream of time, a pure Presence above time, floating in eternity.  I am 
              this great, obvious, self-knowing, self-validating, self-liberating I 
              AMness.</p>
              <p>Before Abraham was, I AM.</p>
              <p>I AM is none other than Spirit in 1st-person, the ultimate, the 
              sublime, the radiant all-creating Self of the entire Kosmos, present in 
              me and you and him and her and them—as the I AMness that each and every 
              one of us feels.</p>
              <p>Because in all the known universes, the overall number of I AMs is but one.</p>
              <p>Rest as I AMness always, the exact I AMness you feel right now, just 
              as it is, which is Unborn Spirit itself shining in and as you.  Assume 
              your personal identity as well—as this or that object, or this or that 
              self, or this and that thing—resting always in the Ground of it All, as 
              this great and completely obvious I AMness, and get up and go on about 
              your day, in the universe I AM created.</p>
              <p>And if you want to change the world, change yourself first of all, 
              resting in that great and ever-present Mystery of I AMness while working
               with the arising world of objects, knowing that ultimately they are not
               two.  Resting in your own I-I, come and join us at I-I, and help that

              <p>If talking from a Western eg. Christian or talking to a person grounded in Christian beliefs, one must be able to relate the spirituality.</p>
              <p>Most Buddhist do not believe Jesus is an evil being,  is with honorable intentions,so it is a honor calling Jesus Christ a pusa in order to highlight acts of compassion. You may take exception to that if you please.</p>
              <p>Dharma is also wisdom,  so it means one can find wisdom in the bible, you can take exception to that also, if you please .  </p>

              <p>In Buddhism, Pusa means a person who is kind, compassionate and loving (è�©è�¨å¿ƒè‚ ï¼‰. Don't you think Jesus has those qualities or you think Jesus is not fit to be a Pusa ?  It is with high respect that we address him as Pusa.</p>

As an inseparatable part of Infinite Consciousness, as a wave in the ocean of infinite consciousness that is God, each soul exists as one of the countless individualizations existing within the whole. Each soul will eventually come to realize the simple truth that Moses spoke: “I am that” and will come to rest as “I am”.</span></span></em></p>

The soul as well as all manifest creation would “immediately be annihilated and cease to exist.” if Divine Consciousness was not it. The truth is that only Divine Consciousness exists.

In that faith I see that my soul has life, and in that light receives you who are Light...</span></span></em></p>

This water is a mirror in which you, eternal Trinity, grant me knowledge; for when I look into this mirror, holding it in the hand of love, it shows me myself, as your creation, in you, and you in me through the union you have brought about of the Godhead with our humanity.</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #555555; padding: 0px;"><em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Is the wave (the soul) the same as the whole of the ocean (God) or is the whole of the ocean simply the wave? After all, they are the same light, the same substance, the same being and consciousness. (In most things) When I have rested in any of the three aspects of the trinity, that is the Father, Christ or Holy Spirit it has been like being a wave resting in an infinite ocean of light. This light of Divine Consciousness appears continuous and infinite, enveloping all things. In my own humble experiences with the three different aspects of God, I have never found that there is a point where the light that is the soul ends and the light that is God begins. It seems to be one continuous light whose understanding and direct experience of is only limited by how much we have limited our own consciousness.</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #555555; padding: 0px;"><em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">Take the example of the ocean. In the whole of it, you cannot isolate any of its waves from the body from which they come, the body that supports them and upon which they owe their existence. Their substance cannot be removed and isolated and have them remain waves. Waves are more like impulses created by the wind or other creative forces that as impulses travel across the surface of the sea. You must realize that the particles of ocean water do not travel the thousands of miles from land to land that make up the birth (individualization) and death (reabsorbtion into the whole) that is the lifespan of a wave; that only the impulses travel and can be said to be waves. The waves have no substance of their own that they can say this is me and not the ocean. Take away the wind or the other creative impulses and what happens? Is not the whole of the ocean still there? Not one particle of it is missing but the waves cease to exist.</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 10pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12px; color: #555555; padding: 0px;"><em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"><span style="font-size: small;">The same is true of the soul. There is no point at which you can isolate the soul's being from the whole of God. Like a wave, the soul is an impulse created by the wind of God that rides upon the surface of the body of Divine Consciousness. The saint's who have directly experienced God repeatedly tell us that the soul has not substance of its own that it can say this is me and not God. If the Wind of God should stop blowing, what happens? The whole of Divine Consciousness is still there. Not one particle is missing but the impulse, the manifested divine consciousness returns to formlessness, returns to that point in time before manifestation and souls as well as all else that is manifest as the heavens and earth will have ceased to exist.</span></span></em></p>

              <p><strong>Question: "What is Christian mysticism?"<br><br>Answer: </strong>The term "Christian mystic" is an oxymoron. Mysticism is not the experience of a Christian. Whereas Christian doctrine maintains that God dwells in all Christians and that they can experience God directly through belief in Jesus, Christian mysticism aspires to apprehend spiritual truths inaccessible through intellectual means, typically by emulation of Christ. The Bible tells us that Christ-likeness is achieved only by dying to self—not by self-effort at emulating anyone—and that spiritual truth is discerned through the intellect as guided by the indwelling Holy Spirit, who lives in all believers (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%2016.13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 16:13</span></span></a>; <a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%202.14"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 2:14</span></span></a>).<br><br>The closest valid experience of a Christian that might resemble mysticism to an unbelieving observer is when the Christian is filled with the Holy Spirit. For Christians, it is evident that the extraordinary wisdom, boldness, understanding, strength, etc. that such spiritual believers demonstrate is the result of being filled with the Spirit, as it is set forth in the Bible. Unbelievers cannot correctly comprehend such things. The Bible tells us why: "The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment: 'For who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him?' But we have the mind of Christ "(<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%202.16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 2:16</span></span></a>).<br><br>Consciousness of God is part of the common definition of the mystic’s experience, but the only valid experience of this nature for the Christian is that which is allowed according to Scripture. "The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Romans%208.16"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Romans 8:16</span></span></a>). Most modern mystical experiences suggest either things that don't really have much substance (make no meaningful contribution to the understanding of corporeal life) or things that would appear to challenge Evangelical Bible doctrine, which invalidates the experience. <br><br>The closest biblical account that an unbeliever might conclude was a mystical experience might be the Apostle Paul's Damascus Road experience (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Acts%2022.1-21"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Acts 22:1-21</span></span></a>) or the experience he described in 2 Corinthians: "I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God knows. And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, but God knows—was caught up to paradise. He heard inexpressible things, things that man is not permitted to tell" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/2%20Corinthians%2012.2-4"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">2 Corinthians 12:2-4</span></span></a>).<br><br>As we examine this account from a Christian perspective, however, we notice particularly that Paul makes it clear God would not allow him to give the details of that experience. Thus it would hardly be reasonable for us to believe that God would be willing to divulge spiritual truth by the manner in which mystics seem to flaunt their experiences. It is His will to declare spiritual truth through the Apostles of the Church by the vehicle of the Holy Scriptures. "Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%2017.17"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 17:17</span></span></a>). "My prayer is not for them alone. I pray also for those who will believe in me through their message" (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%2017.20"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 17:20</span></span></a>). God said, “my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge” (<a class="lbsBibleRef" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/Hosea%204.6"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Hosea 4:6</span></span></a>), not from lack of a mystical experience.<br></p>

Mysticism is not the experience of a Christian. Whereas Christian doctrine maintains that God dwells in all Christians and that they can experience God directly through belief in Jesus, Christian mysticism aspires to apprehend spiritual truths inaccessible through intellectual means, typically by emulation of Christ. The Bible tells us that Christ-likeness is achieved only by dying to self—not by self-effort at emulating anyone—and that spiritual truth is discerned through the intellect as guided by the indwelling Holy Spirit, who lives in all believers (<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/John%2016.13"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">John 16:13</span></span></a>;<a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" rel="nofollow" href="http://bible.logos.com/passage/niv/1%20Corinthians%202.14"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">1 Corinthians 2:14</span></span></a>).</span></p>
