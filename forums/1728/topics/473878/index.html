              <p>p.s. I was trying to do vipassana earlier, but was more attracted to</p>
              <p>the deconstruction of the self as in bahiya sutta and so tried to do it,</p>

              <p>Hello awakenedmind.</p>
              <p>I'm wondering if when you're doing the deconstructing, if you're sometimes going "ok so it's seeing touching smelling etc... so what?" Would this happen to be true for you?</p>
              <p>I think that the realization of anatta means that you are able to label everything in your experience accurately, so probably there's some "murkiness" that you're experiencing. For example, certain aspects like thinking are incredibly tough to label properly. Are you familiar with the awareness teachings, with the identification of the watcher/knower? It could be very useful to you. After all, how exactly do we refute the existance of a self if we don't even know what a "self" is referring to?</p>

              <p>Hi Awakenmind,</p>
              <p>If possible buy the book instead of obtaining as a free download. It is so as to not to break a precept of taking what is not given... as it may impend your own progress.</p>
              <p>Yah.. i find the book really helpful.</p>
              <p>If you realise no-self (enter the stream) before you get married... you can perhaps see better why getting married is not always a good idea.... for example... is your spouse able to understand your realisation? Marriage is based on attachment and is maintained by attachment. ...  Can one remain unattached and be in a marriage?</p>

              <p>hmm,true that.<br>I would love to get my hands on a paperback copy,but I am unable to find it locally.</p>
              <p>As to marriage, yes I can see that it's not possible to remain unattached in marriage</p>
              <p>and it may even be a hindrance to my practice.</p>
              <p>But, I am thinking that I do business and one cant remain unattached in business too. at least I think that business causes attachments and hinders one's practice.</p>
              <p>mind cant be still when one's thinking how to make sales.</p>
              <p>but I dont know how to stop doing that and still live in this world.</p>
              <p>I am not asking this to argue, but I really want to know how to handle this.</p>
              <p>marriage and business thing. I am at a kind of cross roads right now</p>
              <p>and one decision could change my whole life.</p>
              <p>to tell the truth, I am not very inclined to get married, but on the other hand I am a male who desires a female. I think that if I dont get married then this desire/lust may also hinder my practice. any solutions for that ? or can stream entry help me to get rid of this lusty desire?</p>
              <p>And then parents are forcing me to get married.</p>

              Hi awakenedmind,
              
              	You said that YOU WANT to deconstruct YOUR self and is TRYING very hard. Take note of the word in capital in my previous statement. 
              
              	Have you wonder who is the YOU or I that WANT and TRY? Is it the self that TRY and WANT? Have you fallen into the trap of the self trying to de-construct the self? The self cannnot de-construct the self because if the self is de-constructed, who is the one doing the de-construction? It is similar to the chicken and egg example.
              
              	This is a subtle trap that befallen many people. It is not fault that they put in good effort into the practice, but in the process of TRYING hard, they have instead reinforced the self which they are trying so hard to let go.
              
              	Think of it from another perspective, if the self is truly non-existent, then how can you drop or de-construct something that is non-existent. The Sixth Patriarch Hui Neng has said before that if there is truly nothing there, why is the worry about dust settling on it? (æœ¬æ�¥æ— ä¸€ç‰©ï¼Œä½•å¤„æƒ¹å°˜åŸƒ)
              
              	Seek without seeking. Try without trying. 
              
              	The key point is to let go. I repeat: let go. Let go of your clinging to concept. Let go of your WANTING to achieve something, in this case deconstruction of self. Let go of everything. When you have successfully let go and is free of all the worldly concept, there will be no self. It drops by itself. 
              
              	The letting go is the hardest to achieve for all people. As long as one does not let go, they are not on the path, irregardless how they practice. 
              
              	"Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi Svaha!" - Heart Sutra
              
              	"Let go, Let go, Totally let go, Totally completely let go, Enlightened, So be" - Heart Sutra
              
              	The entire path is contained within these few words.

              This is a very difficult forum to use for me. It took me so many tries to just post something. And yet I didn't get the formatting right. Lol. 
              
              The key point is to let go. Let go of everything. As long as you have some idea about anything, just anything, you are still clinging to your concepts. Behind all concepts in your mind is the ego-self that is manifesting these concepts. 
              
              Ultimately, you have to even let go of the concept of letting go. Let go of EVERYTHING. I mean EVERYTHING.

              Hi An Eternal Now,
              
              I tried many methods including yours. But the formatting is still off. I don't know why. I even try to delete the content and try to post a new one ... the old content just refused to be 'deleted' for some reasons ... lol. 
              
              Nevermind lah. Just let it be. Just be. 
              
              Anyway, this is off-topic. :)

              Hi awakenedmind,
                  
                  I gave it some thought on how to assist you in dropping the self. Contemplating on emptiness (anatta) to realize non-self is not easy for beginner. It is not easy even for experienced meditator because our clinging to our ego-self has been conditioned deep within since beginningless time. 
                  
                  One good way to practise dropping the self is to practice giving. Buddha has taught this in his teaching. But we may not have seen his wisdom of guiding us to practise giving in the context of realizing non-self. 
                  
                  True giving is giving without any thought of personal interest, such as thought of gaining something back in return. Conventional giving is always tagged with wanting to gain some merits from the act of giving. There is nothing wrong in this respect if the motivation is good and in the process, you help some other sentient beings. But we should strive to practice giving at a higher level - giving without any thought of personal interest. If we are able to do that, we will be one big step towards dropping our ego-self.
                  
                  Why? When you give without any thought of personal interest, you are essentially practising non-self. Through this practice, you are actually realizing non-self. Without you noticing it, you are actually realizing non-self. At that moment when you give without thinking about your self interest, you have actually dropped your ego-self, again without yourself noticing it. 
                  
                  This is to seek without seeking. Try without trying. 
                  
                  The challenge is to maintain our practice. The moment we think about it, our ego-self arise in us. If we are able to diligently practise self-less giving over long period of time until it becomes our second nature, when no thoughts of any other selfish motives of giving shall arise within us, that we sincerely give purely for the sake of other sentient beings, we would have reached a non-self state naturally.
                  
                  Practising by the above would also create wholesome causes for our future practices too. Just like morality which is taught by the Buddha as the foundation for our practise, the act of pure giving generates wholesome karmic result which will eases away the obstacles that challenges us in our practise. We will be in a more wholesome state of mind to more easily enter the stillness and calm and concentration in meditation and contemplation. With such concentration, wisdom will arise naturally. 
                  
                  The above 3 pillars of morality, concentration and wisdom is contained in the Noble Eightfold Path. This is the path as recommended by the Buddha. 
                  
                  With Metta, may the Buddhadharma be with you always.

              <p>Practicing altruism is *not* realizing non-self. Realizing the truth of anatta as a dharma seal must not be mistaken with altruistic/selfless acts, and selfless acts (although also a good form of practice) does not in itself lead to realizing the dharma seal of anatta. In and of itself, such acts only make more virtuous karmas that lead to more samsaric rebirths in the higher realms, it doesn't lead to nirvana.<br><br>That would require contemplation and vipassana meditation geared at investigating non-self at the sensate, experiential level.<br><br>As I wrote before: <br><br>"First I do not see Anatta as merely a freeing from personality 
                  sort of experience as you mentioned; I see it as that a self/agent, a 
                  doer, a thinker, a watcher, etc, cannot be found apart from the moment 
                  to moment flow of manifestation or as its commonly expressed as ‘the 
                  observer is the observed’; there is no self apart from arising and 
                  passing. A very important point here is that Anatta/No-Self is a Dharma 
                  Seal, it is the nature of Reality all the time -- and not merely as a 
                  state free from personality, ego or the ‘small self’ or a stage to 
                  attain. This means that it does not depend on the level of achievement of a practitioner to experience anatta but <strong>Reality has always been Anatta</strong> and what is important here is the intuitive insight into it as the nature, characteristic, of phenomenon (dharma seal). <br><br>To put further emphasis on the importance of this point, I would like to borrow from the Bahiya Sutta (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.1.10.irel.html</a>)
                   that ‘in the seeing, there is just the seen, no seer’, ‘in the hearing,
                   there is just the heard, no hearer’ as an illustration. When a person 
                  says that I have gone beyond the experiences from ‘I hear sound’ to a 
                  stage of ‘becoming sound’, he is mistaken. When it is taken to be a 
                  stage, it is illusory. For in actual case, there is and always is only 
                  sound when hearing; never was there a hearer to begin with. Nothing 
                  attained for it is always so. This is the seal of no-self. Therefore to a
                   non dualist, the practice is in understanding the illusionary views of 
                  the sense of self and the split. Before the awakening of prajna wisdom, 
                  there will always be an unknowing attempt to maintain a purest state of 
                  'presence'. This purest presence is the 'how' of a dualistic mind -- its
                   dualistic attempt to provide a solution due to its lack of clarity of 
                  the spontaneous nature of the unconditioned. It is critical to note here
                   that both the doubts/confusions/searches and the solutions that are 
                  created for these doubts/confusions/searches actually derive from the 
                  same cause -- our karmic propensities of ever seeing things 
                  dualistically"</p>

              <p>No self can never be realised. As self do not exist how could we realised the non existence of something ? What we do realise are the fabrications, the dependence, the causes and conditions that give rise to self.<br><br><br>In order to realise emptiness of phenomenon and nuomenon as well as all of the natural and artificial world we have to decondition, as opposed to deconstruction of our habitual mental formation. The zen style of stating this was "seeing the horn the mind conceive of a bull". <br><br>Such habitual conception can be seen for what it is through meditation - either concentration or vipassana.<br><br>There is no quick-fix. Which method you adopt slowing the mindstream is a pre-requisite.</p>

              concentrate on breath.</p>
              <p>it seems like my breathing pattern changes when i focus on
              it</p>
              <p>and so i am unable to breathe properly.</p>
              <p>should I still be focussing on the breath or maybe some other
              object?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>actually too much words doesn't help...</p>
              <p>for the breathe in meditation, you focussed too hard.</p>
              <p>Just take it easy... there is nothing that 'you' can do to control the breathe. Just be aware of it.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is not the focus of the breathing that is important... rather...it is that when there is no wondering and entangling with thoughts... there will only be awareness of the breathe.</span></p>
