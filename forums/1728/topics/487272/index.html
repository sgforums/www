                  explained</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><strong></strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #444444;">December 16, 2014 </span><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Thanissara</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">One of the essential
                  messages of the Buddha is that it's really important to get to know the
                  experience of <em>dukkha</em>, or dissatisfaction. Not to know it intellectually,
                  not to write a thesis about it, but to get to know it by meeting this
                  experience directly. Until we know dukkha, we don't really have a way to end
                  it. The discourse of the four truths that the Buddha gave after his awakening
                  begins not with enlightenment, but with the encouragement to know dukkha, to
                  know it in order to overcome it. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">To know the experience of
                  suffering can sound fairly straightforward. But the mind is pretty slippery
                  around the experience of dukkha. We tend to say, "The problem is it's too
                  hot or too cold, or it's the situation I'm in, or because I got so screwed up
                  when I was a kid, or it's my partner, or my job." Of course external
                  factors contribute to our happiness or suffering, we don't need to dismiss the
                  factors that shape our lives—but in Vipassana we're not trying to figure out
                  where the dukkha came from. Instead we work with pain and suffering as we
                  experience it, without blaming others, repressing it, or projecting it inward
                  onto our self. Meeting dukkha in this direct way doesn't preclude challenging
                  or changing our individual or collective circumstance, but it does empower us
                  to stop unnecessary stuffering right at the place we experience it, which is
                  the mind.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">When we experience dukkha,
                  our first instinct is to move our attention away and distract ourselves. We
                  have billion-dollar industries based on entertainment and consumption keeping
                  us distracted from this core truth of life. But are we more content?
                  Conversely, we can become addicted to pain, finding ourselves repeatedly
                  gravitating toward worry, old wounds, and resentments. We can even wallow in
                  suffering, our own and others'. Some people become sufferers, great martyrs
                  thinking "no one suffers as much as me—let me just tell you about
                  it." We all have complex reactions to this everyday experience of
                  unsatisfactoriness. Often those reactions are personalized as "my
                  problem." It is very common for the mind to project suffering onto the
                  "self," interpreting dukkha as a personal failure: we are failing
                  because we suffer. Or the mind will project our suffering onto those around us;
                  it's somehow "their fault." In this activity of projection and blame
                  we miss how the mind itself generates an endless stream of dukkha through its
                  inability to accept self, others, and life as it is. In short, it's our
                  reactivity that generates dukkha, keeping us agitated and therefore unable to
                  contemplate the actual, direct, here and now experience of it. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">The Buddha's way of
                  explaining dukkha is a great relief. He didn't say, "Well, it's your
                  suffering, it's your fault." Nor was his teaching, as it is sometimes
                  articulated, "This world's just a pile of suffering." That's pretty
                  negative. Actually he put it in a very dispassionate way. He just said,
                  "There is dukkha." Just as one might comment on a fact of nature,
                  saying "It's raining hard today" or "The trees are shedding
                  their leaves." Dukkha is inherent within the conditioned realm. Conditions
                  mean anything that emerges from formlessness and comes into form, whether it's
                  the body, feelings, perception, thought, or sensations. Whatever form emerges,
                  dukkha is inherent. Things are dukkha because they are impermanent and
                  therefore unreliable. Actually, dukkha is natural and not suffering. It becomes
                  suffering when the mind identifies with phenomena and grasps. The meaning of <em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>dukkha</span></em> that conveys this process is derived from the breakdown of the word into <em>du</em>,
                  which means "apart from" and <em>kha</em>—or <em>akash</em>—which means
                  "space." This gives the sense of being apart from the spacious, the
                  perfect, and the complete. In this way <em><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>dukkha</span></em> conveys the deepest anguish and
                  dilemma of the self, which is its state of separation from the whole. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">In meditation, when we
                  bring attention to "now," it allows whatever is present to be real to
                  us. For example, we notice the breath, the body, our feelings, and whatever
                  impinges upon our senses. Attention illuminates whatever is here, which is
                  often the experience of dukkha. Usually, even at a very subtle level, there
                  will be some sense of discontent, anxiety, or restlessness. It's important to
                  know dukkha, not to obsess about it, but just to meet it. It's important
                  because if we don't know it, we continue to generate dukkha from false
                  assumptions. We actually make dukkha; the mind habitually and unconsciously
                  generates <em>it</em>. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">Dukkha is different from
                  pain. Buddhist thought makes a distinction between pain and suffering. Pain is
                  part of our human experience. For example, getting sick is painful, as is grief
                  at the loss of a loved one; this is natural and appropriate. However, we then
                  tend to generate a whole extra layer of suffering, through our difficulty in
                  accepting how things are. When we resist the natural flow of life we create
                  suffering, stress, and struggle. When we assume ownership and permanence in a
                  world that is constantly changing, we become burdened. In essence, it is the
                  ignorance of the mind, when it doesn't see the true nature of reality, that
                  produces suffering. And so, our relationship to "how it is" becomes
                  the conditioning factor for either generating or reducing suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">We are doing the suffering;
                  no one is doing it to us. It is because of this that we can free ourselves from
                  unnecessary dukkha. This is not always easy to do. "How it is" can
                  really challenge us. Yet even though it is difficult, this is a doable
                  practice, otherwise the Buddha would not have taught it for regular people like
                  us. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">For example, I suffered
                  when the unethical behavior of someone I trusted came to light. It had a
                  devastating impact. I felt betrayed. The theme of betrayal became a powerful
                  contemplation, particularly as there was no resolution. In the end this
                  situation taught me a lot. I kept reflecting on where the suffering really was.
                  Was it in the behavior of the other, in the divisiveness that followed, in the
                  blame that was projected? I wanted more truth to come out, but it didn't, it
                  stayed hidden in a web of lies. When lies are covered up, it leaves those
                  abused without recourse to justice. This is a powerful theme that runs through
                  human history: people manipulating others for their own ends, while at the same
                  time distracting from their behavior by shifting blame elsewhere. We'd be naive
                  not to understand that the conversion of lies to "truths" is
                  pervasive in contemporary political and corporate culture. When apprehended
                  correctly, such experiences become the sharpening for our wise realism.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">To have a conscious
                  relationship to suffering is different than having an unconscious one. We will
                  all experience pain, simply due to our incarnation into form. It is part of
                  being human. We experience bodily pains, ill health, fatigue, hunger, thirst,
                  and as we get older we will feel the pains of aging. That's just the way it is.
                  Freedom from dukkha doesn't mean eternal youth, or that we are never going to
                  have a headache, never going to feel irritation, or loss, or get betrayed and
                  hurt by others. Freedom from dukkha is not abdication from the human race, but
                  a deeper acceptance of how we are, an acceptance that brings both equanimity,
                  and also a clearer response. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Dukkha</span></em><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; "> is also categorized as the pain of things ending. Even within pleasant
                  experiences there is dukkha, because the nature of conditioned things is to
                  pass. All things already have their endings within them. If we become attuned
                  to this, then we can appreciate the moment. We can appreciate the extraordinary
                  fact of our unique and precious lives. We can even appreciate dukkha, rather
                  than resisting it. We understand that the experience of suffering is a portal
                  to our awakening. We don't wish for suffering, but once we understand how to be
                  in relationship with it, it becomes the means through which we mature as loving
                  and wise people.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">The Buddha placed the
                  contemplation of dukkha at the heart of his teaching. The foundation of
                  Buddhist teaching is formulated around his four noble truths: "There is
                  dukkha," "Dukkha has a cause," "Dukkha has an end,"
                  and "The eightfold path which brings about the ending of dukkha."
                  Each of these truths has a corresponding practice. In response to the first
                  truth, the practice is to "meet, understand, and contemplate" dukkha.
                  The practice for the second truth is to "let go or abandon" the
                  causes of dukkha. The third is to "realize or recognize" the end of
                  dukkha, and the fourth is to "develop or cultivate" the path leading
                  out of dukkha. Sometimes this teaching is misrepresented as a negative view on
                  life, such as "Buddhists are just into suffering." Actually, it's a
                  very positive message, as it says we can do something about the dukkha we
                  unconsciously generate and then experience. This simple teaching is actually
                  extremely profound and direct. It offers a clear diagnosis of the fact of
                  suffering, an insight into the causes of suffering, and a remedy and cure for
                  suffering.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">The four noble truths may
                  not be a very fashionable teaching, but it's an extremely profound one.
                  Wherever we are, when dukkha arises, we have a pathway to peace. In calming
                  meditation, we develop strength of mind through the practice of steadying
                  attention on the breath, body, or our chosen object of contemplation. In
                  insight meditation, we take that same strength of attentiveness and bring it
                  directly to the experience of dukkha, as it is felt within the body and heart.
                  We do this in a very particular way, by neither justifying nor trying to fix
                  the pain, neither being overwhelmed nor shaped by it, nor repressing or
                  distancing ourselves. The art of meditation is to meet dukkha directly, to
                  breath with it, and inquire into it. This is ultimately less painful than
                  avoiding it. </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">I remember as a young nun I
                  suffered a lot. I trained in a male monastic hierarchy deeply ambivalent to the
                  presence of nuns. Initially, I didn't see the impact, but as time went on, I
                  noticed it generated a painful and divisive power dynamic. I was grateful to
                  live as a monastic, but the fine line between "training" and the
                  blunt use of power was unhealthy—particularly when as nuns, we had no agency in
                  the decisions that shaped our lives.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">However, there wasn't much
                  I could do about the situation. Basically, it was just a lot of suffering. One
                  day, I was contemplating the pain in my heart due to some new rules that had
                  been handed down without consultation, which I found churlish. I was just right
                  there, holding attention to the sensation. It felt like a knife in my chest and
                  a hand around my throat. It was very visceral, and although the trigger was a
                  controlling hierarchy, the feeling felt ancient. It was the familiar pain of
                  powerlessness. In the middle of my walking meditation, I stopped and stretched
                  out my arms like Christ on the cross, and screamed out, "I accept this
                  suffering!" It sounds dramatic (and somewhat inflated), and fortunately I
                  was well hidden in the monastery forest! But something profound happened. I
                  realized I could be with a painful dynamic and not suffer. My suffering was
                  there because I didn't want things the way they were. In my acceptance, the
                  suffering turned to compassion. I felt compassion for the monks and nuns, for
                  myself, for everything and everyone. Meeting experience <em>as it is </em>empowers.
                  We may not always be able to change a challenging situation, but we can be
                  better resourced to engage with it.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">Ajahn Chah came from a
                  farming community in Northeast Thailand and left school at thirteen. He tended
                  to put things in unacademic, immediate, and straightforward ways. He often
                  pointed to the fact that dukkha arises because the mind is caught up in
                  "wanting and not wanting." We want what is not here and don't want
                  what is here. This is very simply put and yet challenging to really see.
                  However, framing it like this, Ajahn Chah points to a direct practice. With
                  some steadiness of mind, we can reflect on desire, and its internal narrative
                  of always wanting things to be different from what they are. We frame our
                  experience: "I don't want it to be like this; I want it to be
                  different." Each moment we want, long, wait, and look for something that
                  is not there, we generate dukkha. Conversely, when there is resistance or
                  aversion to how it is, we generate dukkha. We resist what is "now."
                  The push and pull of the mind undermines our capacity for contentment. When we
                  look into the second truth of desire and aversion, we get perspective. What we
                  struggle with can be okay. It is workable. We can work with all of it, people
                  blaming us, pains in the body, emotional turmoil—instead of continually adding
                  dukkha through our judgment, "It shouldn't be like this." </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">A lot of the time we feel,
                  "It shouldn't be like this!" It should be somehow different. We
                  should be in a heaven-like world. But we weren't born into heaven; we were born
                  in this world, with its wars, environmental degradation, suffering,
                  exploitation, difficulty, and pain. Accepting the reality of dukkha isn't an
                  abdication from response, it is a way to understand that the most effective way
                  we can change the world is through the quality of our own awareness. As we work
                  to resolve our personal dukkha, we lessen the possibility that our actions will
                  increase the suffering that already exists.</span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">When Kittisaro was a novice
                  monk, just before his full ordination, his parents took a trip to Thailand, all
                  the way from Chattanooga, Tennessee, to find out what he was doing. In the
                  process they met Ajahn Chah. Kittisaro's father is a very astute political
                  observer and at that time he was concerned, as were most Americans, with the
                  war in Vietnam and the threat of communism. He was concerned that the
                  monastery, which was on the border of Laos, would be invaded by communist
                  guerillas. Ajahn Chah said that the thing he should really worry about was the
                  "communist guerrillas in the mind." I guess nowadays he would have
                  pointed us back to the "terrorists of the mind." </span></p>
              <p class="p12" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">This is where we begin and
                  end. We take everything back to the mind. As we experience life, all sorts of
                  feelings, thoughts, and reactions arise. Our problem isn't so much "what
                  is" but our relationship to what is. When I consider my own suffering, so
                  much of it comes from the fact that I simply cannot accept life, and people as
                  they are. I get upset by what people do. Ajahn Chah said it's like hollering at
                  a person who upsets you. Then someone comes up and says, "You know, that
                  person is crazy." You relax, because suddenly there's perspective. Until we
                  are mature human beings, we're all a little crazy; we all produce suffering. So
                  it means we are going to learn patience! The ongoing inquiry into the nature of
                  suffering is a patient process. These four truths are a deepening hologram:
                  wherever we touch them we enter the process of contemplation. When we locate
                  clinging, desire, and aversion, then, as encouraged by the Buddha, we let go. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Letting go is the third noble
                  truth. Vipassana insight meditation reveals where we hold on. Where we hold on,
                  right there is dukkha. Right where there's dukkha is the place of letting go.
                  In insight meditation we contemplate the nature of suffering and its release.
                  Actually, the mind in its natural state is open, aware, and present. It is
                  reflective. But the mind, when tinged by ignorance, has a tendency to constrict
                  around thought-forms and desire, generating a sense of self that feels
                  "It's not enough" or "I'm not enough." Our lack of inner
                  freedom is often born from this feeling of "not enough." The constriction
                  around "I need to be something more" or "I don't want what is
                  here" is a constant irritation. Ajahn Chah likened it to a dog with mange.
                  He goes into the shade, to the heat, from place to place, running around
                  everywhere trying to find relief, scratching here, scratching there. The dog
                  keeps feeling each place is the problem, not realizing his discomfort is due to
                  his own skin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>In a moment of just stopping and
                  relinquishing our addiction to "wanting and not wanting," a whole
                  other dimension opens up. When the cause of dukkha is released, we recognize a
                  timeless abiding, always here now, which is the heart/mind's natural state.
                  Recognizing the mind in its natural state is not something to attain; it's a
                  realization. When grasping and resistance cease, the endless chasing of one
                  thing after another, then the mind recognizes the taste of its own nature,
                  which is the taste of peace. This peace is nibbana. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>Just as the grit in an oyster
                  becomes a pearl, so dukkha has its function. Awakening quickens through wise
                  contemplation of suffering. Instead of blindly reacting to the experience of
                  dukkha, shifting around it or blaming someone else for it, we apprehend it
                  directly, and more quickly. A conditioning factor for this process is what the
                  Buddha called <em>nibbida</em>, which means "disenchantment." We
                  finally come to a place in ourselves when we know another experience isn't
                  going to alleviate our basic sense of discontent—the next holiday, the next
                  acquisition, or the next exciting distraction. In our contemporary society,
                  when we feel <em>disenchanted </em>it is seen as a problem. We are encouraged to
                  go shopping, take medication, or find some other escape. We think, "If I
                  sit on the beach today I'll be much happier than staying here." So we go
                  to the beach. We're happy for a few minutes and then think, "If I just had
                  a nice coffee, I'd feel better." Or we think, "It's too hot here. If
                  I go up into the mountains where it's cooler, I'd be happy." This seeking
                  drives us on and on. It's a good sign when we begin to be suspicious of endless
                  pursuit; it means we're not buying into it so much. Periods of retreat bring us
                  into direct confrontation with what we've been trying desperately to avoid—this
                  basic feeling of dissatisfaction. This isn't to say that things like
                  anti-depressants and holidays don't have their place. But even when we get life
                  as perfect as we can, the underlying message of dukkha still crashes in. It
                  prods us until we respond to the invitation to contemplate our experience more
                  carefully. Sometimes when we acknowledge the presence of suffering, we
                  immediately want a solution. Fix it quick! Get a Band-Aid! Take it away!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  '>This is kind and careful work.
                  When circumstances generate pain or anguish, we can lessen dukkha by patiently
                  containing our reactivity. Then, at the place of suffering, the journey of
                  transformation opens up. As beauitfully articulated in Mark Nepo's poem, we
                  become "a soft and sturdy home in which real things can land." This
                  describes perfectly the quality of awareness and receptivity needed to
                  undertake the journey through suffering. We "no longer try to make sense
                  of the pain." We create a space and allow awareness to provide a gentle
                  holding for the "irritations that rub to a pearl." This is the work
                  of Vipassana. As we inquire into the moment, dukkha becomes dharma, or nature,
                  rather than "me" that is wrong or bad. As we listen more deeply to
                  suffering, we begin to notice non-suffering. The heart realizes its innate
                  courage, strength, and invincibility. This journey through pain and suffering
                  burns away the impurities, and what is revealed is something pristine, clear,
                  and beautiful, like a moonlit pearl: the tender, merciful heart, and its
                  infinite ability to receive the cries of the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 13.1pt; text-align: justify;">When we're with suffering, it's
                  as if we are with a child that's very unhappy. If the child is wailing and
                  wriggling, wanting to get away, wanting something but it doesn't know what, we
                  kindly hold the child. Sometimes we can experience our minds as the child and
                  the awareness as the mother. The child of the mind can be really hurting and
                  screaming, "I can't bear this. I'm hopeless!" Or, "No one is
                  there for me," or just an unnameable pain that seems so familiar, so
                  ancient, and so intractable. But the mother, our aware, present heart, just
                  sits it out and waits patiently for the deeper truth to emerge. She is
                  breathing with the pain while gently holding the mind and body with kind
                  awareness. Then something happens; something beyond the re-activity of the
                  mind. Instead the heart softens. It sees its own nature: spacious,
                  non-suffering, peaceful, and timeless. Here is freedom. Here we find the
                  courage to bear suffering in order to overcome it.</span></p>
