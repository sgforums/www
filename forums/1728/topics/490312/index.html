              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 18.0pt;">Has Modi found a Buddhist
              Vivekananda in Anagarika Dharmapala?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><a href="http://www.catchnews.com/author/ranjan-crasta-1431337074.html"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;  text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .95pt;">Ranjan Crasta</span></a><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .95pt;"> 9 October 2015 catch News</span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; text-transform: uppercase; letter-spacing: .25pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>On 8 October, Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena arrived
              in Delhi. But this wasn't a run-of-the- mill state visit. Sirisena was
              accompanied by 150 of Sri Lanka's top Buddhist monks to celebrate the 150th
              birth anniversary of the man credited with reviving Buddhism in the Indian sub-continent
              - Anagarika Dharmapala.</span></p>
              <h4 style="margin-bottom: 2.8pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #ed1c24;">There's more to it than religion</span></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>The memorial event will begin in Delhi and culminate on 10
              October when the delegation visits Bodh Gaya. While the event obviously has
              deeper religious overtones, it's also an Indian attempt to wrest Buddhism from
              the cultural claims of China.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>China, after all, is home to the world's largest Buddhist
              population in addition to its control over Tibet. The Modi government though,
              since it has come to power, has made strident attempts to appropriate the
              Buddhist legacy from China. This has been evident in Modi's statements during
              state visits to India's South-east Asian neighbours. Recently, at a
              Buddhist-Hindu conference, organised partly by the Vivekananda International
              Foundation in Japan, Modi even went as far as to call Buddhism one of India's
              "crown jewels".</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>That Sirisena's visit coincides rather well with China's fourth
              consecutive Global Buddhist Forum, further indicates India's ulterior motives. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Even so, in today's age where India's religious legacy is being
              rewritten to promote the significance of Hinduism at the expense of other
              religions, the reemphasis on Dharmapala's legacy is one that we should
              seemingly welcome. But if we delve deeper into Dharmapala's story, the Modi
              government's affinity for him becomes a little less surprising.</span></p>
              <h4 style="margin-bottom: 2.8pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #ed1c24;">How Don David became Dharmapala</span></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Even though Dharmapala played a massive role in the
              re-popularisation of Buddhism in India, his journey began in Sri Lanka, or
              Ceylon as it was called at that time. He was born in 1864 under the yoke of
              British colonisation and christened Don David Hewavitharane. But his life came
              to be a rejection of and battle against colonial rule.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>At an early age, even as he was educated in Christian
              institutions, he found himself drawn towards Buddhism. This affinity to
              Buddhism was eventually cemented when Colonel Olcott and Madam Blavatsky, two
              of the founders of the Theosophical society in Britain began visiting Ceylon
              and declared themselves Buddhists. A 16-year-old Dharmapala grew close to the
              two, assisting Olcott as a translator as he travelled around Sri Lanka
              furthering Buddhist education.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Even though he eventually broke with the Theosophical Society,
              rejecting their beliefs of a universal religion in favour of Buddhism, it is
              this period that set him on his path. He took the name Dharmapala, which means
              'guardian of the Dharma'. He also took the title Anagarika, a title that means
              "homeless one" and carries a status somewhere between a layperson and
              a monk.</span></p>
              <h4 style="margin-bottom: 2.8pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #ed1c24;">The Indian connection</span></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>His tryst with India though, was yet to come. That began on a
              visit to the recently-renovated Mahabodhi temple where the Buddha, Siddhartha
              Gautama, had attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya. The year was 1891, and a
              27-year-old Dharmapala was shocked to find the temple managed by a Hindu
              priest, with the image of Buddha replaced by Hindu gods. Buddhists were barred
              from worship at the temple, one of Buddhism's most sacred sites.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Dharmapala began an agitation to return control of the temple to
              Buddhists. It was a battle that was eventually won two years after India gained
              independence, 16 years after his death. But even as he fought a protracted
              legal battle for the Mahabodhi temple, Dharmapala was busy spreading Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="tweet-text" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   '>Dharmapala's
              views were often racist. He once described Africans as 'semi-savage half-animal
              people'</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>He set up the Maha Bodhi Society, initially in Sri Lanka before
              relocating it to Kolkata. Through the Society's many chapters he managed to
              spread the word and teachings of Buddhism. Incidentally, when the Mahabodhi
              temple committee did eventually get its first Buddhist head, it was the
              then-head of the Maha Bodhi Society. In fact, over 50 years before Ambedkar
              encouraged Dalits to embrace Buddhism, Dharmapala led many Tamil dalits to take
              up the religion.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Dharmapala gained acclaim for his teachings, even travelling
              with Swami Vivekananda to speak at the World Parliament of Religions in
              Chicago.</span></p>
              <h4 style="margin-bottom: 2.8pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 22.45pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  color: #ed1c24;">Sinhalese nationalism and parallels with today's right-wing</span></h4>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>But perhaps it is something other than the work he did in India
              which has made him so acceptable to India's unabashedly saffron ruling
              dispensation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Like Vivekananda, Dharmapala had a strong nationalist bent. He
              is often credited with being one of the driving forces behind the rise of
              Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Dharmapala preached that Sinhalese culture and Buddhism were
              facing extinction due to colonialism. His vision was for a Sinhalese Buddhist
              revival in Sri Lanka. He believed that the Sinhalese were a pure Aryan race and
              that it was the influence of Christianity and other religions that was ruining
              them and by extension Sri Lanka. This mirrors a lot of the right-wing
              sentiments currently being spewed in India. Though the Indian right-wing is
              obsessed with Hinduism and Hindu culture, the discourse is essentially the
              same.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>Dharmapala's views could often border on the racist. He once
              described Africans as "semi-savage half-animal people". Muslims were
              also on the receiving end of some of his diatribes - he considered them
              "alien people" who prospered at the expense of the Sinhalese. And
              long before the Indian right-wing was playing spoilsport to inter-religious
              coupling, Dharmapala was busy forbidding Sinhalese women from marrying
              non-Sinhalese men.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #333333;'>With such striking similarities to the current attitude of
              India's right-wing, perhaps it's not so surprising that the Modi government has
              chosen to project Dharmapala as the face of Buddhism in the country. </span></p>

              <p>If you want to 'continue' and proliferate being a buddhist, which you may since the Buddha adovcates life over death and liberation over suffering, use your liberation wisely.
