              <div class="_5pbx userContent">
              <div id="id_53a4eebf8cb678a29772983" class="text_exposed_root text_exposed">“Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who 
              knows and sees, not for one who does not know and does not see. For one 
              who knows what, for one who sees what, does the destruction of the 
              taints come about? The destruction of the taints comes about for one who
               knows and sees: ‘This is suffering’; for one who knows and sees: ‘This 
              is the origin of suffering’; for one who knows and sees: ‘This is the 
              cessation of suffering’<span class="text_exposed_show">; for one who 
              knows and sees: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’
               It is for one who knows thus, for one who sees thus, that the 
              destruction of the taints comes about.<br> “Therefore, bhikkhus, an 
              exertion should be made to understand: ‘This is suffering.’… An exertion
               should be made to understand: ‘This is the way leading to the cessation

               Noble Truth of Suffering (dukkha), monks, is this: Birth is suffering, 
              aging is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, 
              association with the unpleasant is suffering, dissociation from the 
              pleasant is suffering, not to receive what one desires is suffering — in
               brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering.</span><br><br><span>"The
               Noble Truth of the Origin (cause) of Suffering is this: It is this 
              craving (thirst) which produces re-becoming (rebirth) accompanied by 
              passionate greed, and finding fresh delight now here, and now there,

               non-existence (self-annihilation).</span><br><br><span>"The

              liberating oneself from it, and detaching oneself from it.</span><br><br><span>"The
               Noble Truth of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering is this:

               interests me nowadays is not free will/no free will, effort/effortless,
               sudden/gradual, atman, The Absolute, etc. I am not interested in them 
              anymore. What interests me nowadays is the complete and total 
              termination of the taints, clinging, karmic propensities, the complete 
              and total termination of suffering. And talking about the illusoriness 
              of burning fire on an intellectual level when you are on fire isn't 
              going to work. Neither is denying it. The point is to put out the fire. 
              (I'd be very surprised if someone whose clothes catches fire would 
              continue ranting on and on about how the fire is not real or how there 
              is actually no clothes and no fire and just sit around.. haha) </span><br><br><span>Fire
               burn, ouch, pours water on it. That is direct path and actualization. 
              Noble eightfold path. That is true spontaneous activity of awakening. 
              Not denying and being deluded about one's condition (the truth and cause
               of suffering)... or ranting on about spontaneity or how fires are 
              naturally happening. That only goes on due to our complete ignorance of 
              our afflictions. And it is precisely because we are literally aflame, 
              that we should practice with utter urgency to put an end to suffering, 
              like our heads are on fire. If we even truly have an inkling, or even a 
              glimpse, into our true predicament, into the four noble truths, our 
              entire approach to our path will become totally different.</span><br><br><span>In
               fact, given this urgency and predicament, all the side-issues are 
              naturally cast aside (just like when your clothes are on fire you have 
              no time to think about whether there is free will to put out the fire 
              etc, or whether putting out the flame is a sudden or gradual thing, or 
              whether we should put out the flame when its illusory, or whether 
              putting out fire should be an effortless happening or effortful  - as 
              these are quite irrelevant, or about residing as a background unaffected
               Absolute which is ultimately an illusion), instead, there is just total
               exertion and engagement in actualization of right view and right 
              practice, that's all. Otherwise we are like what the Buddha gave in an 
              analogy - someone struck with a poisoned arrow trying to inquire all 
              sorts of things about the shooter, arrow, etc, while slowly dying due to
               not seeking treatment.<br><br>This might put off many readers but I'm 
              going to say it anyway: screw all neo-Advaitish 'no-practice' talk, 
              screw all FB debates that have nothing to do with putting out fire. No 
              wonder Buddha preferred to maintain noble silence many times. Lets just 
              practice like our heads are on fire.</span></span></span> Longchenpa says, "To reject practice by saying 'it is

               have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Gaya, at

               the All is aflame. What All is aflame? The eye is aflame. Forms are 
              aflame. Consciousness at the eye is aflame. Contact at the eye is 
              aflame. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at 
              the eye — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — 
              that too is aflame. Aflame with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, 
              the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion. Aflame, I tell you, with 
              birth, aging &amp; death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses,
               &amp; despairs.</span><br><br><span>"The ear is aflame. Sounds are aflame...</span><br><br><span>"The nose is aflame. Aromas are aflame...</span><br><br><span>"The tongue is aflame. Flavors are aflame...</span><br><br><span>"The body is aflame. Tactile sensations are aflame...</span><br><br><span>"The
               intellect is aflame. Ideas are aflame. Consciousness at the intellect 
              is aflame. Contact at the intellect is aflame. And whatever there is 
              that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect — experienced as 
              pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is aflame. Aflame
               with what? Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the 
              fire of delusion. Aflame, I say, with birth, aging &amp; death, with 
              sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, &amp; despairs.</span><br><br><span>"Seeing
               thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted
               with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with consciousness 
              at the eye, disenchanted with contact at the eye. And whatever there is 
              that arises in dependence on contact at the eye, experienced as 
              pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that, too, he grows 
              disenchanted.</span><br><br><span>"He grows disenchanted with the ear...</span><br><br><span>"He grows disenchanted with the nose...</span><br><br><span>"He grows disenchanted with the tongue...</span><br><br><span>"He grows disenchanted with the body...</span><br><br><span>"He
               grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, 
              disenchanted with consciousness at the intellect, disenchanted with 
              contact at the intellect. And whatever there is that arises in 
              dependence on contact at the intellect, experienced as pleasure, pain or
               neither-pleasure-nor-pain: He grows disenchanted with that too. 
              Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion, he is fully 
              released. With full release, there is the knowledge, 'Fully released.' 
              He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task 
              done. There is nothing further for this world.'"</span><br><br><span>That
               is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his 
              words. And while this explanation was being given, the hearts of the 
              1,000 monks, through no clinging (not being sustained), were fully 
              released from fermentation/effluents.</span></span></span></div>

Readers should look into that post first to get the context for this posting.<br> <br> First of all we have to understand that taints, clinging, karmic 
              propensities are empty. But it is not empty in the sense of being 
              non-existent, rather, it is empty of inherent existence due to dependent
               origination. For example we may think that craving exists somewhere in 
              our 'minds' that we must somehow 'get rid of it'. This is having an 
              inherent view. This is like looking into the mirror and trying to 
              destroy the person appearing in the mirror by punching the mirror and 
              cracking the mirror in order to "destroy the person inside the mirror" 
              (as if there is a person living inherently inside the mirror, where in 
              reality what's reflected is a dependently originating, non-arising 
              appearance). That would be totally silly, and likewise trying to destroy
               afflictive emotions conceived as inherently existing somewhere "in us" 
              without discerning its causes and conditions would be totally silly. If 
              you want to remove the reflection, you have to discern the whole chain 
              of dependencies which leads to that, and those afflictive causes are to 
              be remedied. To have insight into the emptiness and dependent 
              origination of our afflictive condition is to realize the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com.au/2013/11/total-exertion-of-karmic-tendencies.html">Total Exertion of Karmic Tendencies</a><br> <br> Likewise, thankfully our suffering is not inherently existing but arises
               due to dependent origination, and what is arising is fundamentally 
              non-arising and free from extremes. Precisely because of this, we can 
              discern the whole chain of dependent origination whereby ignorance 
              depends on taints, taints dependents on ignorance, setting the whole 
              chain of suffering. If we understand this, we don't focus our efforts on
               the wrong place. Things don't exist inherently - they manifest due to 
              dependent origination, and when the causes and conditions are present, 
              no effort or will can prevent them from arising, that is the nature of 
              manifestation. If we fail to understand emptiness in the context of 
              dependent origination, we will fall into a non-Buddhist or nihilistic 
              version of emptiness, and it will not liberate us.<br> <br> In the path of Buddhadharma, since we understand dependencies, we do not
               attempt to get rid of afflictive emotions by hard will, or by 
              dissociation (which strengthens the fundamental delusion of an 
              inherently existing subject and an inherently existing object), or other
               ways based on the view of inherent existence - which is akin to 
              punching the mirror to get rid of the reflection. At the same time, we 
              are not saying "they are purely an illusion, nothing to work on" (let's 
              try that tactic when your clothes catch fire!). What we're saying is 
              that by directly penetrating the dependent origination and emptiness of 
              taints, precisely because they are illusory and not inherently existing,
               we can understand the necessity to apply the right remedy which cuts 
              the basis for suffering (the 12 links from ignorance... to death). What 
              path? The engagement in right view and right practice, in which integral
               conduct allows the arising of integral samadhi which allows the arising
               of integral wisdom, which results in the cessation of ignorance and the
               chains. With the arising of wisdom, the chain of afflictive dependent 
              origination is released. <br> <br> As Nagarjuna pointed out, it is precisely because of emptiness that the 
              soteriological values of Buddhadharma can work at all. This is nicely 
              explained in <a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew103934.htm">http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/ew103934.htm</a> :<br> <br> <blockquote> (Excerpt)<br> <br> Nagarjuna's
              Critique of the Dharma<br> <br> In chapter XXIV of the Karikas,
              NAgarjuna continues his attack on the Abhidharma philosophers by
              analyzing the Four Noble Truths, and argues that-like causality,
              impermanence, suffering, and bondage-they, too, are "empty."
              The problem of this chapter needs to be seen against the background
              of the preceding section. If the Abhidharma views of causality are
              "empty," as Nagarjuna says they are, and if causality is a
              central feature of Buddhist praxis, then Nagarjuna seems to undermine
              everything that is vital to Buddhism. He begins chapter XXIV by
              expressing the Abhidharma position in the following way:<br> <br> If
              all of this is empty,<br> Neither arising nor ceasing,<br> Then for
              you, it follows that<br> The Four Noble Truths do ont exist.<br> <br> If
              the Four Noble Truths do not exist,<br> Then knowledge,
              abandonment,<br> Meditation and manifestation<br> Will be completely
              impossible.<br> <br> p.571<br> <br> If these things do not exist,<br> The
              four fruits will not arise.<br> Without the four fruits, there will be
              no attainers of the fruits.<br> Nor will there be the faithful.<br> <br> If
              so, the spiritual community will not exist.<br> Nor will the eight
              kinds of person.<br> If the Four Noble Truths do not exists,<br> There
              will be no true Dharma.<br> <br> If there is no doctrine and spiritual
              community,<br> How can there be a Buddha?<br> If emptiness is conceived
              in this way,<br> The three jewels are contradicted.<br> (Garfield 1995,
              p.67)<br> <br> In the passages above, the Abhidharma opponent is saying
              that if Nagarjuna is right about "emptiness," then the very
              practices that make Buddhism soteriologically efficacious will be
              destroyed. That is, if it is true that the Four Noble Truths are
              "empty," then there is no such thing as the Buddha, the
              Dharma, and the Sangha, no such thing as impermanence, "non-self,"
              and nirvana, and the practices that supposedly lead to liberation
              will be destroyed. Nagarjuna responds to the opponent by saying that
              he has misunderstood "emptiness":<br> <br> We say that this
              understanding of yours<br> Of emptiness and purpose of emptiness<br> And
              of the significance of emptiness is incorrect.<br> As a consequence
              you are harmed by it.<br> (Garfield 1995, p.68)<br> <br> Because the
              opponent has taken "emptiness" to signify the nonexistence
              of the Four Noble Truths, he is "harmed by it"-in other
              words, he sees "emptiness" as destructive. But his reason
              for thinking of "emptiness" in this way is that he thinks
              that a "correct" meditation on causality, the aggregates,
              and the Four Noble Truths is necessary for liberation.<br> <br> Nagarjuna
              responds to this assumption by reversing the tables and saying, in
              effect, that it is not "emptiness" that destroys practice,
              but the very idea that such things as causality, the aggregates, and
              the Four Noble Truths are "inherent," essential, or
              necessary:<br> <br> If you perceive the existence of all things<br> In
              terms of svabhava,<br> Then this perception of all things<br> Will be
              without the perception of causes and conditions.<br> <br> Effects and
              causes<br> And agent and action<br> And conditions and arising and
              ceasing<br> And effects will be rendered impossible.<br> (Garfield
              1995, p.69)<br> <br> p.572<br> <br> Nagarjuna goes on to say that the
              reason essences militate against causal conditions, arising, ceasing,
              agency, and so forth is that the idea of essence entails
              independence, and if things are by nature independent then it is
              impossible for them to interact causally. If this is true then there
              is no "dependent arising," and without "dependent
              arising" it is impossible to make sense of the ability to
              cultivate a virtuous life. In other words, without the process of
              change the whole idea of cultivating the "fruits" of a
              Buddhist life is rendered nonsensical. Nagarjuna responds by saying
              that Buddhist praxis must be "empty" if we are to make any
              sense of the Four Noble Truths:<br> <br> If dependent arising is
              denied,<br> Emptiness itself is rejected.<br> This would contradict<br> All
              of the worldly conventions.<br> <br> If emptiness is rejected,<br> No
              action will be appropriate.<br> There would be action which did not
              begin,<br> And there would be agent without action.<br> <br> If there is
              svabhava, the whole world<br> Will be unarising, unceasing,<br> And
              static. The entire phenomenal world<br> Would be immutable.<br> <br> If
              it (the world) were not empty,<br> Then action would be without
              profit.<br> The act of ending suffering and<br> Abandoning misery and
              defilement would not exist.<br> (Garfield 1995, p.72)<br> <br> Nagarjuna
              has thus shifted the debate. Whereas the Abhidharma thinker begins
              with the assumption that a "correct" meditation on the
              Dharma is a necessary prerequisite for liberation, Nagarjuna
              undercuts this by saying that if one takes the Dharma as essential,
              that is, as necessary, then the very essence of Buddhism is
              undermined. Like the first chapter on causation, Nagarjuna is
              reminding the Abhidharma philosophers here about nonattachment. The
              Four Noble Truths are supposed to be medicinal "rafts" that
              help specific sentient beings overcome their attachments, but if one
              becomes attached to the practices of nonattachment then one has
              missed the entire point of Buddhism. Thus, Nagarjuna says that the
              Dharma-which includes causation, impermanence, suffering, bondage,
              and liberation-is "empty."</blockquote> <br> <br> Now, after the awakening of twofold emptiness, we simply engage and meet
               conditions to allow the latent tendencies to self-liberate without 
              modification. Practice becomes practice-enlightenment, where every 
              engagement in daily activities becomes an opportunity to release our 
              deeply held clinging - I, me, mine, inherent existence. 
              (Practice-enlightenment is a term in Soto Zen to denote the path as the 
              actualization of one's wisdom, so one's practice is no longer 'for' 
              enlightenment but an 'actualization' of enlightenment in every mundane 
              activities from sitting to walking to talking.. etc) <br> <br> For example when I talk with people, there is no I, no others, only the 
              situation and activity that is totally exerted... no clinging to center,
               self, mine... this allows the afflictions to dissolve. This is only 
              possible after anatta and emptiness, if we merely rest in clarity of 
              'Awareness', it would not be sufficient to dissolve the bonds. <br><br>To
               understand why insights into anatta and emptiness help we have to 
              understand that all our afflictions are rooted in the view of an 
              inherently existing I, me, mine, in inherently existing self and things 
              and ownership. For example if someone's child is lost or dies, you may 
              not feel mentally afflicted, but when it comes to your sons and 
              daughters, you may feel afflicted, because there is ownership, I and 
              mine making involved, which results in holding onto someone as 'dear to 
              me'.<br> <br> To address this question more thoroughly let me just quote some people including myself here:<span><span class="UFICommentBody"><br><br><span>"We
               cannot get rid of suffering by saying, "I will not suffer." We cannot 
              eliminate attachment by saying, "I will not be attached to anything," 
              nor eliminate aggression by saying, "I will never become angry." Yet, we
               do want to get rid of suffering and the disturbing emotions that are 
              the immediate cause of suffering. </span><br><span>The
               Buddha taught that to eliminate these states, which are really the 
              results of the primary confusion of our belief in a personal self, we 
              must get rid of the fundamental cause. </span><br><span>But
               we cannot simply say, "I will not believe in the personal self." The 
              only way to eliminate suffering is to actually recognize the experience 
              of a self as a misconception, which we do by proving directly to 
              ourselves that there is no such personal self. We must actually realise 
              this. Once we do, then automatically the misconception of a self and our
               fixation on that "self" will disappear. </span><br><span>Only
               by directly experiencing selflessness can we end the process of 
              confused projection. This is why the Buddha emphasized meditation on 
              selflessness or egolessness. However, to meditate on egolessness, we 
              must undertake a process that begins with a conceptual understanding of 
              egolessness; then, based on that understanding, there can be meditation,
               and finally realization." </span></span></span><br> <br> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>- Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, Pointing Out the Dharmakaya<br><br>"Though worldly beings cultivate meditative stabilization,<br>They do not destroy the discrimination of self.<br>They are greatly disturbed by the return of afflictive emotions,<br>As was the case of the cultivation of meditative stabilization by Udraka.<br><br>If phenomena are individually analyzed as selfless<br>And what has been analyzed is meditated upon,<br>That is the cause for attaining the fruit, nirvana.<br>Through any other cause one does not go to peace..."<br> </span></span></span><br> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>- King of Meditative Stabilizations Sutra</span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><br><br>"Monks, when a monk’s mind frequently remains acquainted with the
               recognition of selflessness in what is unsatisfactory, his mind is rid 
              of “I-making” and “mine-making” with regard to this conscious body and 
              externally with regard to all representations, and has transcended 
              conceit, is at peace, and is well liberated."<br><br>- </span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span>AN 7.49 DutiyasaññÄ� Sutta<br> <br>"When our own self is involved, we emphasize that connection: now it is "<em>my </em>body," "<em>my </em>stuff," "<em>my </em>friends," or "<em>my </em>car."
               We exaggerate the object's attractiveness, obscuring its faults and 
              disadvantages, and become attached to it as helpful in acquiring 
              pleasure, whereby we are forcibly led into lust, as if by a ring in our 
              nose. We might also exaggerate the object's attractiveness, making 
              something minor into a big defect, ignoring its better qualities, and 
              now we view the object as interference with our pleasure, being led into
               hatred, again as if by a ring in our nose. Even if the object does not 
              seem to be either agreeable or disagreeable but just an ordinary thing 
              in the middle, ignorance continues to pervail, although in this case it 
              does not generate desire or hatred. As the Indian scholar-yogi Nagarjuna
               says in his <em>Sixty Stanza Reasoning:<br><br>How could great poisonous afflictive emotions not arise</em></span></span></span><br> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><em>In those whose minds are based on inherent existence?</em></span></span></span><br> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><em>Even when an object is ordinary, their minds</em></span></span></span><br> <span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><em>Are grasped by the snake of destructive emotions.</em><br>Cruder
               conceptions of "I" and "mine" evoke grosser destructive emotions, such 
              as arrogance and belligerance, making trouble for yourself, your 
              community, and even your nation. These misconceptions need to be 
              identified by watching your own mind.<br><br>As the Indian thinker and yogi Dharmakirti says in his exposition of Buddhist thinking:<br><br><em>In one who exaggerates self<br>There is always adherence to "I."<br>Through that adherence there is attachment to pleasure.<br>Through attachment disadvantages are obscured.<br>And advantages seen, whereby there is strong attachment,<br>And objects that are "mine" are taken up as means<br>of achieving pleasure.<br>Hence, as long as there is attraction to self,<br>So long do you revolve in cyclic existence."</em><br><br>- H.H.

              afflictions, for the most part I don't have negative emotions anymore. 
              And either the anatta or the strict shamatha training has resulted in 
              stable shamatha where thoughts have little effect and are diminished by 
              the force of clarity. I'm also able to control them, stopping them for 
              any amount of desired time etc. but I understand that isn't what is 
              important.<br> Can I fully open to whatever arises I would say yes. I 
              understand that every instance of experience is fully appearing to 
              itself as the radiance of clarity, yet timelessly disjointed and 
              unsubstantiated..<span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span><span>"<br><br>And I wrote last year:</span></span></span></span></span><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><br><br>"I
               remember Kyle telling me how since the realization of anatta it has 
              severed many emotional afflictions, for the most part he doesn't have 
              negative emotions anymore. In my experience this has also been the case.
               It wasn't always the case as I used to be capable of anger, throwing 
              temper, and so on. This just doesn't happen nowadays... since anatta 
              I've noticed large chunks of emotional afflictions not just anger has 
              sort of disappeared.</span><br><br><span>It's
               like the habitual way of seeing and relating with the world through 
              dualistic and inherent view as independent, separate beings interacting 
              with independent, separate others along with its stories have 
              disappeared. There is just impersonal and totally exerted actions and 
              experiences experienced in vivid clarity, without needing to leave 
              traces.</span><br><br><span>So
               perhaps the most ultimate advice for overcoming afflictions is: work 
              hard contemplating and practicing insight and calm-abiding in tandem, 
              those can really make permanent changes to your patterns of emotional 
              afflictions that are not meagre."</span></span></span></div>
