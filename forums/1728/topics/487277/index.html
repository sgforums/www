              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">December 18 marks the 144th anniversary of the birth
              of D. T. Suzuki, Japanese teacher, author, translator, and at one time the most
              famous Zen Buddhist in the world. The importance of Suzuki’s role in
              introducing Westerners to Zen, and Buddha-dharma in general, cannot be
              overstated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Yet, the bright sheen that his image once radiated has
              lost some of its luster in recent years. Brian Victoria in his book </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Zen at
              War</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> has accused Suzuki of complicity with Japanese nationalism during World
              War ll. Victoria has himself suffered some slings and arrows as the quality and
              methodology of his scholarship has been questioned by many and Kemmyo Taira
              Sato in “D. T. Suzuki and the Question of War”, among others, has refuted
              Victoria’s account of Suzuki’s views on militarism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Suzuki was not only an influential figure of his time,
              but a unique one, in that he was not an ordained Buddhist priest, but rather a
              professor of Buddhist philosophy. As a result, while he had great influence
              outside the Zen tradition, his secular standing limited his influence within
              the tradition. And by taking a more secular approach, eschewing some of the
              more metaphysical and ritualistic elements of Zen, and emphasizing the
              meditative aspect as well as the “special transmission” with “no dependence on
              words and letters,” he likely did more to shape the still-present form of Zen
              in the West than anyone else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Suzuki Daisetsu Teitaro was born in 1870, into a
              samurai family. It was the era of the Meiji Restoration when the samurai class
              lost its privilege in Japanese society. His father, a physician, died when he
              was six, leaving his mother, a Jodo Shinshu believer, to raise him amid
              impoverished circumstances. By the time she passed away in 1890, Suzuki was
              already very interested in spirituality, gravitating toward Zen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Suzuki attended the University of Tokyo, where he
              studied Chinese, Sanskrit, Pali, several European languages, and of course,
              philosophy and religion. It was around this time that he also began Zen
              training at Engaku-ji in Kamakura, where he eventually became a disciple of
              Shaku Soen, a great Zen master. Shaku Soen invited Suzuki to accompany him to
              the Parliament of Religions at the 1897 World Fair in Chicago and act as his
              translator. There he met Paul Carus and began to translate into Japanese Carus’
              work </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The Gospel of Buddha</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">. Suzuki lived in the United States and worked
              for Carus’ publishing company for ten years. It was here that he also met and
              married Beatrice Erskine Lane, a Radcliffe graduate and Theosophist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Suzuki took up a professorship back in Japan, at Otani
              University in 1921.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Following the death in 1939 of his wife, Suzuki went
              into seclusion until the end of World War II. When he emerged in 1949, he went
              to Honolulu to attend the Second East-West Philosopher’s Conference and taught
              for a year at the University of Hawaii. He spent a year in California, then in
              1951 he moved to New York and began teaching on Zen at Columbia University.
              Some of the notable people who were his students at that time included
              psychoanalysts Erich Fromm and Karen Horney and the composer John Cage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Suzuki retired from Columbia in 1957 and traveled to
              Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he taught and helped found the Cambridge
              Buddhist Society. Suzuki’s influence was perhaps most profound on those figures
              of the time who also wielded considerable influence, people such as Carl Jung,
              Thomas Merton, Gary Snyder, Allen Ginsberg, and British dharma enthusiast </span><span class="st" style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Christmas
              Humphries, founder of the Buddhist Society</span></span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">While he is credited mostly with spreading Zen in the
              West, during the latter half of his life Sukuki was actually more interested in
              Jodo (Pure Land).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">This is merely a snapshot of Suzuki’s life. For those
              who would like to learn more, I invite you to read </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Life-D-T-Suzuki-Remembered/dp/0834802139/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418859835&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=d.t+suzuki">A Zen Life: D.T.
              Suzuki Remembered</a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> by Masao Abe. There is also a documentary
              available called </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-Life-D-T-Suzuki/dp/B0013HUWYS/ref=sr_1_1?s=movies-tv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418859728&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=d.t+suzuki">A Zen Life</a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">.
              And I recommend the books by Suzuki himself: </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Zen-Buddhism-D-Suzuki/dp/0802130550/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418859868&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=d.t+suzuki">An Introduction to Zen

              and </span><a style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;" href="http://www.amazon.com/Mysticism-Christian-Buddhist-Routledge-Classics/dp/0415285860/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1418859972&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=d.t+suzuki">Mysticism: Christian
              and Buddhist</a><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">, to mention just three.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The latter work is one of the Suzuki books in my
              library. I am not sure I am agreement with him on every point he makes, yet at
              the same time it would be rather vain on my part to think that I know more
              about it than he did. Here is a short passage from the book:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 24.0pt;">“</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A few more remarks about “Emptiness.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Relativity [</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">pratitya-samutpada</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> or dependent
              arising] is an aspect of Reality and not Reality itself. Relativity is possible
              somewhere between two or more things, for this is the way that makes one get
              related to another.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">A similar argument applies to movement. Movement is
              possible in time; without the concept of time there cannot be a movement of any
              sort. For a movement means an object going out of itself and becoming something
              else which is not itself. Without the background of time this becoming is
              unthinkable.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Therefore, Buddhist philosophy states that all these
              concepts, movement and relativity, must have their field of operation, and this
              field is designated by Buddhist philosophers as Emptiness (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">sunyata</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">When Buddha talks about all things being transient,
              impermanent, and constantly changing, and therefore teaches that there is
              nothing in this world which is absolutely dependable and worth clinging to as
              the ultimate seat of security, he means that we must look somewhere else for
              things permanent (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">jo</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">), bliss-imparting (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">raku</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">), autonomous (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">ga</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">),
              and absolutely free from defilements (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">jo</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">). According to the Nirvana
              Sutra (of the Mahayana school), these four (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">jo-raku-ga-jo</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">) are the
              qualities of Nirvana, and Nirvana is attained when we have knowledge, when the
              mind is freed from thirst (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">tanha</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">), cravings (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">asava</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">), and
              conditionality (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">sankhara</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">). While Nirvana is often thought to be a
              negativistic idea the Mahayana followers have quite a different interpretation.
              For they include autonomy (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">ga</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">, </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">atman</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">) as one of its qualities (</span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">guna</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">),
              and autonomy is free will, something dynamic. Nirvana is another name for the
              Emptiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The term “emptiness” is apt to be misunderstood for
              various reasons. The hare or rabbit has no horns, the turtle has no hair
              growing on its back. This is one form of emptiness. The Buddhist </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">sunyata</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> does not mean absence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">A fire has been burning until now and there is no more
              of it. This is another kind of emptiness. Buddhist </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">sunyata</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> does not mean
              extinction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The wall screens the room: on this side there is a
              table, and on the other side there is nothing, space is unoccupied. Buddhist </span><em style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">sunyata</em><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> does not mean vacancy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">D.T Suzuki died in 1966 in Tokyo at age 95.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Gary Snyder said he was “probably the most culturally
              significant Japanese person in international terms, in all of history.”</span></p>
