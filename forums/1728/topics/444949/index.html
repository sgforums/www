              </p><p>Whatever we see, it is not I, not me, nor a man, not a woman.  In the eye, there is just color.  It arises and passes away.  So who is seeing the object?  There is no seer in the object.  Then how is the object seen?  On account of certain causes.  What are the causes?  Eyes are one cause; they must be intact, in good order.  Second, object or color must come in front of the eyes, must reflect on the retina of the eyes.  Third, there must be light.  Fourth, there must be attention, a mental factor.  If those four causes are present, then there arises a knowing faculty called eye consciousness.  If any one of the causes is missing, there will not be any seeing.  If eyes are blind, no seeing.  If there is no light, no seeing.  If there is no attention, no seeing.  But none of the causes can claim, "I am the seer." They're just constantly arising and passing.  </p>
              <p>As soon as it passes away, we say, "I am seeing."  You are not seeing; you are just thinking, "I am seeing."  This is called conditioning.  Because our mind is conditioned, when we hear the sound, we say, "I am hearing." But there is no hearer waiting in the car to hear the sound.  Sound creates a wave, and, when it strikes against the eardrum, ear consciousness is the effect.  Sound is not a man, nor a woman; it is just a sound that arises and passes away.  But, according to our conditioning, we say, "That woman is singing and I am hearing."  But you're not hearing, you are thinking, "I am hearing."  Sound is already heard and gone.  There is no "I" who heard the sound;  it is the world of concept.  Buddha discovered this in the physical level, in the mental level: how everything is happening without an actor, without a doer - empty phenomenon go rolling on.</p>

              <p>Good question...</p>
              <p>Thinking and thoughts also do not constitute a self. There is thinking but no thinker.</p>
              <p>Another viewpoint for consideration. Under normal circumstance there seems to be a flow in the sequence of thoughts. In actual fact, the flow is not a singular continuous process. It is actually one thought activating the next and so forth. This apparent linear continuity gives the impression that there is a person thinking.</p>
              <p>In actuality, thoughts flows can be disjointed and unsupported. Thoughts can pop up and dissapear. </p>
              <p>An example of disjointed thoughts are phenomena of ghost sightings. Ghosts often seems to be doing the same thing... this is possibly because that is all that is left of the memory. </p>
              <p>No-self is not the same as nothingness. Conceptually, when one read this, it may be depressing if they think that nothing exist. Awareness/Presence is there everywhere... but just don't make this 'inconceivable' into another self again !</p>

              <p>If thoughts pop up and disappear uncontrolled by a self centre, and we essentially do not decide what to think next, by what mechanics can we alter the 'quality' of thoughts that do pop up?  For example, if a person is constantly thinking murderous thoughts, can he give the excuse that the thoughts just come anyway and that he has no volition?</p>
              <p>I pose this question not just in relation to thoughts but also with regards to the 'unfolding' of events.  I have heard it said somewhere that we are essentially "being lived".  (Lol.  Sounds a bit like we are possessed but I'm sure the person meant that more in the context of No Self.)</p>
              <p>Since Buddhism doesn't teach fatalism, then there must be some mechanism by which we can alter the course of events.  I'm just not understanding at present, how to tie these two sets of knowledge together.</p>

              <p>Just my opinion here... the debate of 'fatalism' vs 'free will'  takes place on the level of relative truth where ignorance is assumed.  As 'free will' in our common usage of the word implicitly refers to an ego or 'I' that is making the decision.  "Control" also implicitly refers to a "controller".</p>
              <p>In terms of absolute truth, there is no need for such concepts at all.  In terms of absolute truth, everything takes place <strong>as it is </strong>without the need to superimpose an extra "I" which is our basic delusion anyway.</p>

              <p>Also, another thing about 'determinism' or 'fatalism' is the implicit assumption of time.  The main argument about 'fatalism' is that are things already fated or determined right <strong>from the beginning</strong> and therefore should we still bother to make a good decision... </p>
              <p>there is a thin line between 'spontaneity' and 'fatalism' in this regard. But i think 'spontaneity' is free of the concept of time whereas  'fatalism' uses time as a crutch/excuse.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Thank you for your interest in Munindra's teaching. I am delighted that people are discussing what he said regarding 
              anatta. He embodied anatta even in the way he responded to questions. For example, when someone asked him, "Munindra-ji, are you hungry?" he would say, "Hunger is there, but I am not hungry." He deeply understood that conditions arise and fall away and have nothing to do with identity or ego.</p>
              <p>I would like to point out that the quotes offered in this forum are not an article, 
              but taken directly from a book I wrote to honor Munindra-ji's life and legacy in the Dhamma: "Living This Life Fully: 
              Stories and Teachings of Munindra," published by Shambhala. For more information: www.mirkaknaster.com/. Also, a 
              slight correction: the word "car" should be "ear" in order to best 
              understand the meaning of the sentence.</p>
              <p>May all beings we happy and peaceful.</p>

              You have to understand what causes clinging? What causes trace? When we hold on to the false view of self and inherency, the mind is unable to let go. If we hold on to I, me, mine, if we hold on to a solid sense of a body, or even the sense of an ultimate awareness, all these causes the mind to cling, and it is always due to the false view of inherent self that is at the root of falsely clinging to things (treating self, body, mind, awareness, or ownership as real, inherent and pertaining to a self). Everything is arising and passing away every moment, but if we falsely perceive them to be real and inherent, we will certainly leave "traces".
              
              When realization occurs and one realizes there never was a self, then naturally all becomes self-liberating and self-releasing. There is no ground, nothing at all to hold on to. The entire stream of experience is seen to be insubstantial, bubble-like, unsupported and without anything to cling to, everything self-releases. There is no longer that view of an inherent self that prevents the self-liberation of experience.
              
              Prior to insight, attempts at letting go is always contrived, effortful, and often a holding in disguise. We may treat dissociation as letting go but in actuality we are strengthening the sense of self, the "me" that is trying to distance itself from "bad things and mental states". We think we are the controller or thinker or watcher of thoughts.
              
              Even if we manage to let go to some extent and calm our minds, it is the result of deliberate effort and is merely a state of shamatha where afflictions temporarily suspends but is not permanently removed or uprooted.
              
              However one who realizes the twofold emptiness is different. Without the view of inherency, one does not cling, and does not perceive something one needs to let go of, nor someone who can let go of something. It is like realizing "originally no self", never was a self, so how can you say you need to let go of the self? Also, all thoughts are primordially pure, empty and illusory, so how can you say there is a "thought" that you need to let go of? The instantaneous recognition of the twofold emptiness results in the spontaneous self-liberation of dualistic fixation. Perceiving a self that needs to let go of a real something is itself a manifestation of dualistic fixation, so it goes into a loop. That itself is an example of "leaving traces". Liberation comes from an insight that cuts all dualistic, contrived, mind effort into the spontaneous perfection and primordial purity of the essence, nature and energy of mind, which results in the self-release of all experiences.
              
              Non-judging is not itself a quality perculiar to anatta or emptiness. A normal nonbuddhist person can also practice non judging. A person at I AM stage will also practice non judging but sees in terms of a nonjudging watcher or witness which means still cling to self. Non judging is good but we should not misunderstand or equate it with enlightenment.
              
              Also, non-discrimination, non-conceptualization is a basic aspect of mindfulness practice. It is important to be bare, naked in awareness, but it is a form of practice and not to be confused with realization. From Vipassana of Theravada to Dzogchen practice of TB, all talks about it. But when realization arises one is naturally inclined to drop all proliferations.

              <p>Only 8th bhumi and above are free from afflictions... so I do
              not think lower bhumi Bodhisattvas stop creating karma totally.
              However like the stream enterer, one who is awakened is no longer
              capable of creating very unwholesome karma that leads to rebirth in
              lower realm.</p>
              <p>When you realize twofold emptiness and end afflictions, you stop
              creating karma out of craving, anger, and ignorance. Whatever
              action is pure and unafflictive, thus not a cause for further
              karmic cycle.</p>
              <p>Even if you are not yet free from afflictions completely, if you
              can do as Guru Padmasambhava said, then the craving, anger, and
              ignorance that do arise nonetheless self-liberate and thus one is
              freed from karmic repercussions.</p>
              <p>Why? Karma only forms when your actions leave traces of karmic
              imprints in your mind which may then ripen later. If you are as
              traceless as drawing in water, you don't create karmic
