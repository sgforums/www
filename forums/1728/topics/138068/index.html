            <div class='col-md body'>A Christian bishop came to ask Venerable Master Chin Kung on the issue of the end of the world and anti-Christ. Venerable Master Chin Kung replies that it is not other people that rejected Christian. It is Christian rejecting Christian. In a broader sense, it is religionist rejecting religionist, that causes the end of the world attitude. Education no longer teaches moral concepts, but useless knowledge; Media teaches the evil concept of self, greed, hatred and ignorance. teaches killing, lust, stealing, intoxications, and lying.<br>Sooner or later the root of moral concepts will be uprooted; how can there not have the issue of end of the world. American empire  fall not because of terrorist but because of the tv media. Now the Internet media is even worst.<br><br>Children fight when they are young; upgrade it becomes a battle; upgrade it becomes a war; upgraded it become end of the world. Sociality is walking into a path of grave and had reached a point where less can be made. Family education had fail; School education had fall; Society education had too fall; except a last hope on Religion education.<br><br>Religionist don't reject religionist, Christian don't reject Christian. Buddhist sects don't reject Buddhist sects. Buddhist sects now no longer interact with each other. We must know that Shakyamuni Gotama, the Buddha, passed down our teachings. He is like our father, and different sects are like siblings. Bother and sisters no longer love each other; imagine how our father felt when he sees this. We are a big family; other religions are like our cousins. <strong>We should treat all as one big family. Buddhism is the eye; Christian is the<br>nose; Moslem is the mouth; Hinduism is the ear etc; all are but one face; all are number one, nobody is number two.</strong><br><br>This is the forth most attitude that we must uphold. This is meaning of religionist anti religionist, not other religion anti-ing one religion. <strong>God loves all people, not God loves his believers only. I am part of all people, and I love all people. God and me are but one compassionate love. Believers only love God but dislike all people. You and God had different ideas of love, how can God love you back. God talks on love; Buddha talks on compassion are all base on one unconditional emptiness. This is the meaning of anti-Christ.</strong><br><br>It's sad thing to see that people are arguing about wrong and right when only our mind makes it so. Pointing people mistakes, when one should be pointing at one's own deluded mind. If we want the world to be good. start from oneself and don't aspect others to start first.<br><br>Ps: One had even communicated with the spirits. Spirits had already turned over a new leaf; only human are still so stubborn and deluded. Hence when the spirits are liberated, we human shall take over their places. The bad karma that we now create is more than a 100 times more than that of the pass karma that the spirits had created.<br><br>However we should not under estimate the power of repentance. During Buddha's time, there's a evil person who breaks the five inhabitants states of deprivation, but repented in his later life was then liberated to Amitabha Pureland in Top middle class!!! It's a skeptical truth but real. We might think at least a Bottom lower class is more suitable for those who committed evils, but no, he repented to a Top middle class. So we should not look down on evil<br>peoples, as we might not imagine that he/she might attain a higher realisation at the very last moment.<br><br>metta,<br>amituofo,<br></div>
