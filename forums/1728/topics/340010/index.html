              <h1>Reality Isn’t What You Think</h1>
              <p>By <span class="article_author">Andy Karr</span><br><em><span class="article_blurb"><br>Unlike
                  most religions, Buddhism says our big problem is not sin but
                  ignorance—our fundamental misunderstanding of reality. Contemplative
                  practice, says Andy Karr, is a good way to analyze whether things are
                  as solid, separate, and lasting as we habitually think they are.</span></em><br><br><br>Do
                  things really exist the way we see them? Do they exist as the separate,
                  independent entities we usually take them to be? “I” and “mine”
                  certainly seem to exist. This world with its mountains, rivers, oceans,
                  and cities seems solid and reliable. Past, present, and future seem to
                  be three different things. That’s how things seem to most everybody
                  most of the time. But it turns out that if these things were ultimately
                  real, we would be completely stuck, because liberation from the painful
                  confines of this reality—the main promise of Buddhism—would be
                  impossible. <br><br>If things existed the way we see them, all our
                  fears would be well-founded and all our hopes would be worth struggling
                  for. The inexorable cycle of birth, old age, sickness, and death would
                  be the final truth. The Buddha would be wrong about ego because it
                  would truly exist and egolessness would be impossible. Buddhism would
                  be a delusion.<br><br>There seems to be a contradiction between the
                  reality we expect and experience on a daily basis and the reality
                  described by the Buddha. This is because the way things appear to us is
                  not the way things truly are. There are two ways of seeing everything.
                  Whereas we see a world that is limited, confining, and solid, buddhas
                  experience the world as open, spacious, and relaxed. What we experience
                  as suffering, buddhas experience as great bliss. How could that be? <br><br>Investigating
                  the difference between the way the world appears to us and the reality
                  proclaimed by the Buddha is a key practice in many Buddhist traditions.
                  This practice of “contemplation” involves using our everyday thought
                  process to help us discover how things are, and how they are not. This
                  process gives direction to meditation practice and is also supported by
                  it. Once you get the hang of it, contemplation not only leads to
                  insight but also is enjoyable. It inspires us to go forward on the
                  Buddhist path.<br><br>Contemplation invites us to question what we
                  experience. The Buddhist tradition tells us that what we ordinary
                  beings see are our own confused projections. Our seeing is obscured by
                  basic ignorance and the delusion arising from that ignorance. This is
                  what is called <span style="font-style: italic;">apparent reality</span>.
                  It is not the way things really are; it is only the way they appear to
                  us. It is like the delusion that takes objects in dreams to be real
                  when we don’t realize we are dreaming.<br><br>Buddhas and bodhisattvas who have overcome ignorance and delusion see <span style="font-style: italic;">ultimate reality</span>. These realized beings see <span style="font-style: italic;">emptiness</span>—the
                  true nature of things. This is like recognizing a dream to be a dream.
                  How can we transform seeing apparent reality into seeing the ultimate?
                  The answer is found within us. It can be unlocked through careful
                  contemplation. Contemplation can be done alone; it can also be done in
                  a group and with the aid of a teacher. In any case, we need material to
                  contemplate, and the Buddhist tradition provides ample choices. In this
                  essay, we will take a step-by-step approach to contemplating emptiness.
                  While contemplation takes effort and is sometimes frustrating, it is
                  much more rewarding than just speculating about what emptiness is,
                  which often just generates more concepts that obscure what the buddhas
                  see.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Cultivating Insight<br></span><br>The
                  contemplative process of transformation depends on cultivating insight.
                  To do this, we need to look closely at our experience. Normally, when
                  things appear to us, in the second moment we project concepts onto them
                  and think the appearances are what we <span style="font-style: italic;">conceive</span> them to be. For example, we see these black lines on the page and think they <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> letters and words. It is only because we are deeply habituated to
                  reacting to these shapes in this way that sounds and meanings arise in
                  our minds. We can’t see letters and words. We can only see shapes and
                  colors. The process of projection happens so quickly that we don't even
                  notice it. <br><br>We constantly project our version of reality, this
                  seemingly solid world. These projections are handy when we want to ask
                  for some cinnamon on our cappuccino, but to realize ultimate reality we
                  need to distinguish appearances from our own projections. Here are some
                  simple contemplations that illustrate this. They are meant to be
                  experiential rather than intellectual. Please try to approach them in
                  as childlike a way as you can.<br><br>Think about this planet. No doubt
                  it seems like you are on the top, but what about people 10,000 miles
                  away from you? They feel equally that they are on the top of the world.
                  If people in each location point “up” at the same time, they will be
                  pointing in completely different directions. Up and down don’t truly
                  exist either.<br><br>Next think about two people: one you like and one
                  you find difficult. Think about a third person who doesn’t get on well
                  with the person you like but gets on well with the one you find
                  difficult. If you contemplate this state of affairs for a little while,
                  you will understand that pleasant and unpleasant don’t truly exist
                  either. If the first person was truly pleasant, everyone would see them
                  that way, and if the second person was truly unpleasant, everyone would
                  see them that way.<br><br>All qualities are like these: large and
                  small, up and down, pleasant and disagreeable, beautiful and ugly, hot
                  and cold, good and bad, light and dark, old and new, mine and yours. No
                  one can deny appearances, but whatever appears is empty of whatever we
                  conceive it to be. Ultimate reality, the true nature, is free from all
                  conceptual fabrications. This is the meaning of emptiness, or <span style="font-style: italic;">shunyata</span>, as it is called in Sanskrit. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Seeing Mirages</span><br><br>Basic
                  ignorance is not recognizing the emptiness that is ultimate reality. It
                  is the root cause of delusion and the bondage and suffering that come
                  from it. It’s as easy as one-two-three. First, we don’t recognize the
                  nature of what appears to our minds. Next, we generate desire, anger,
                  or stupidity toward our projections, as if they were external objects.
                  Finally, we make decisions, act, and react to what we have merely
                  imagined.<br><br>To return to the dream example, when we don’t know we
                  are dreaming, we might dream of being attacked by a snake, experience
                  great fear, and try to escape from his fangs and writhing body—all
                  without realizing that the snake was only made of dream stuff. If we
                  can realize we are dreaming, fearsome images have no more power over us
                  than a painting of a snake in a museum.<br><br>It is like the
                  experiences and emotions we have while watching a movie. Even though we
                  know we are sitting in a theater or watching TV, we still believe we
                  see real people in real situations on the screen. We sit there
                  thinking, “He’s going to fall in love with her.” “Don’t go in there!”
                  “They’re all going to die.” It is nothing but colored light coming from
                  a screen, but the illusion of a well-made movie is completely
                  compelling.<br><br>Dreams and movies are good examples of what happens
                  when we don’t recognize the true nature of appearances, and what
                  happens when we do. In our daily life, when we think about someone we
                  like, we don’t recognize the nature of what is appearing to our minds
                  and think about that person with attachment, failing to see that we are
                  thinking about our projection of a person rather than an actual human
                  being. If someone we don’t like comes to mind, anger arises. It’s the
                  same with jealousy, pride, and stupidity. All confused emotions arise
                  in relation to our projections. In turn these emotions give rise to
                  confused actions.<br><br>When a person happens to be right in front of
                  us, we see or hear them, and in an instant project a concept on to what
                  is merely a sight or a sound. Next, emotions arise toward the
                  projection, and confused actions arise in response to that. This
                  happens so quickly that we don’t even notice we are doing it. Our
                  actions then give rise to new appearances, which give rise to new
                  projections, emotions, and further actions. These chain reactions go on
                  constantly. As the great Tibetan yogi Milarepa said, “Mind has even
                  more projections than there are dust-motes in the sun.”<br><br>When we
                  begin to recognize the nature of our projections, it is like waking up
                  from a dream, or recollecting that we are merely watching a movie.
                  Gradually, as we do this more and more, we start to experience freedom
                  from our claustrophobic imagination and begin to experience the
                  spaciousness and relaxation of emptiness. <br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>What Emptiness Is</span><br><br>Sometimes when students of Buddhism first learn about emptiness, <span style="font-style: italic;">shunyata</span>,
                  they get frightened or angry, as though emptiness was something that
                  would suck all the warmth from life, the way a black hole sucks in
                  light. Emptiness sounds a lot like nothingness, which is clearly not
                  what ultimate reality is. Shantideva, the great Indian practitioner and
                  teacher who lived in the eighth century, made it clear in his classic <span style="font-style: italic;">The Way of the Bodhisattva</span> that nothingness is not the meaning of emptiness nor the intention of teaching it:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It’s not indeed our object to disprove</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Experiences of sight or sound or knowing.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Our aim is here to undermine the cause of sorrow:</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The thought that such phenomena have true existence.</span><br><br>Sometimes
                  people think that emptiness is a Buddhist philosophical concept, but
                  the Buddha did not create emptiness; even if the Buddha had never
                  appeared in this world, the nature of phenomena would still be
                  emptiness. We teach emptiness to remove the suffering that comes from
                  clinging to fabrications. It is not presented to destroy appearances.
                  What the teachings on emptiness destroy is delusion, and the suffering
                  that arises from it. Shantideva goes on to say:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Whatever is a source of pain and suffering,</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Let that be the object of our fear.</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But voidness will allay our every sorrow;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">How could it be for us a thing of dread?</span><br><br>What
                  we really need to be afraid of is ignorance and delusion. These are the
                  causes of suffering. Recognizing emptiness is the antidote for
                  suffering. It is what we need to embrace.<br><br>Emptiness is not easy to realize, because it is not an object for the conceptual mind. What does recognizes emptiness is <span style="font-style: italic;">prajna</span> (Skt.), which translates literally as “highest knowing.” It is usually
                  rendered as “wisdom,” “insight,” or “knowledge.” Prajna is basic to our
                  makeup, but it is covered over by veils of concept and emotion. We need
                  cultivation to bring it out. There are three ways to cultivate prajna:
                  listening to the teachings, contemplating their meaning, and
                  meditating. These three form a natural sequence.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Listening</span> is straightforward. It includes both hearing teachings and studying
                  them. We study such topics as suffering and its cause, the cessation of
                  suffering, the nature of apparent reality, the nature of ultimate
                  reality, and the general workings of samsara and nirvana. The prajna
                  that arises from listening removes our coarsest misunderstandings about
                  reality.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Contemplation </span>takes
                  the understanding that arises from listening and starts to mix it with
                  our personal experience. There are many ways to contemplate. The
                  simplest way is to reflect on what you have studied and ask yourself
                  how it applies to you. Is all your experience tinged with suffering,
                  for example, or not? What does emptiness mean? Is it something you
                  vaguely understand, or is it clear to you that all phenomena are empty?
                  <br><br>Another way to contemplate is to use questions that arise from
                  your studies to investigate your experience, such as asking yourself,
                  What is the nature of the enemy I’m thinking about? Is it really my
                  friend arising in my mind, or is it a projection?<br><br>A third way to
                  contemplate is to use logical analysis to clarify your understanding.
                  You can ask yourself such questions as, Is this body one thing or many
                  things? It must be one or the other, or else it does not truly exist.
                  When you see the body is made of parts, you understand it is not one
                  thing. And since the parts can also be broken down endlessly, at that
                  point you can realize that its nature is emptiness.<br><br>Sometimes
                  practitioners have doubts about the validity of contemplation. Since
                  many teachings on meditation emphasize non-conceptuality, they feel it
                  isn’t kosher to practice with concepts. This is an overly simplistic
                  understanding about how to work with conceptual mind. Genuine freedom
                  from fabrications comes from seeing through the delusion of concepts,
                  not from suppressing them. If we don’t use concepts to develop prajna,
                  we will have no way to develop it. Contemplation plays an essential
                  role in transforming dharma from mere theory into personal experience.
                  Through repeated contemplation, we develop confidence in the meaning of
                  the profound teachings and confidence in our understanding. Gradually,
                  we develop certainty about the meaning of prajna and shunyata.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Meditating</span> transforms the intellectual understanding developed by contemplating
                  into realization, or direct experience. Intellectual understanding only
                  approximates ultimate reality. The genuine ultimate reality is beyond
                  the intellect. It is inconceivable and inexpressible. We say that
                  ultimate reality is emptiness, for example, but the genuine ultimate is
                  even empty of anything called “emptiness.”<br><br>Nagarjuna, the great
                  second-century master whose teachings refuted all extreme views of
                  existence and nonexistence, described the characteristics of the
                  ultimate (calling it the precise nature) in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way</span>:<br><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Unknowable by analogy; peace;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Not of the fabric of fabrications;</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Nonconceptual; free of distinctions—</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">These are the characteristics of the precise nature.</span><br><br>Because
                  it is beyond the reach of the intellect, ultimate reality can only be
                  realized through meditation. There are two main aspects to meditation:
                  resting and looking. These are sometimes called cultivating peace and
                  cultivating insight. In the beginning, resting is emphasized, because
                  first we need to pacify mind’s wildness. There is not much point trying
                  to look around inside a whirlwind. As mind begins to settle, the
                  emphasis shifts to investigating the nature of experience. At this
                  point we alternate resting with investigating. This is the way to
                  develop prajna through meditating.<br><br>It is worth mentioning that
                  some people feel they need to practice resting meditation until their
                  minds are completely still before they can move on to developing
                  insight, and others feel that if they settle their minds enough, they
                  will be freed from suffering and disturbances by that alone. Both of
                  these approaches overestimate the role of resting meditation. It is
                  insight that liberates, because it is insight that sees through
                  ignorance and delusion.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>Starting to Investigate</span><br><br>In
                  apparent reality, such things as outer objects and inner mind; past,
                  present, and future; me and mine; self and other; all seem to truly
                  exist. In ultimate reality, there are no such distinctions. To
                  understand, experience, and finally realize ultimate reality, we need
                  to investigate apparent reality thoroughly so we can see that <span style="font-style: italic;">whatever</span> we cling to is empty. Prajna doesn’t have just one thing to accomplish; it must accomplish many things. <br><br>There
                  are countless ways to investigate. To give you a feeling for the
                  process, here is a series of investigations that proceeds from what we
                  discussed before, the emptiness of outer objects.<br><br>The outer
                  environment seems solid and dependable because we always carry our
                  projections with us the way a snail carries its shell. As the 1980s
                  cult-film sage Buckaroo Banzai said, “Wherever you go—there you are.”
                  While we are deeply habituated and cling tightly to our projections,
                  they’re relatively easy to see through. We can begin by investigating
                  what we think of as “home.”<br><br>Home appears to be as reliable as
                  the earth, but when we look closely at our experience of home, all we
                  find are glimpses of our front door, cooking smells, the sounds of
                  people’s voices and flushing toilets, the feeling of snuggling into
                  bed, the sight of the TV and perhaps pictures on the wall, and so on.
                  We never find “home,” because home is merely a conception. <br><br>This
                  is something we should contemplate. To do this, ask yourself, “Where
                  precisely is this thing called ‘home’? Is it in the walls, floors, and
                  ceilings?” If you think that is where it is, investigate each of them
                  in turn to see whether they are anything other then collections of
                  glimpses and tactile sensations held together by concepts. Investigate
                  gradually. Look at all the experiences that seem to make up your home.
                  By investigating in this way, you will find that home is in fact
                  emptiness! The experiences conceived of as home do appear, but they are
                  empty appearances. They have no base or support, no fixed, durable
                  foundation.<br><br>Investigate “this planet” in the same way. You might
                  feel that you know where various geographical reference points are
                  located—Asia, Canada, Kansas, San Francisco. With your mind’s eye, see
                  if you can find them. Are they in the east, west, north, or south? Did
                  you take into consideration the curvature of the earth? How far away
                  are they? Look at your experience of each reference point in turn. Is
                  “Asia” anything more than the memory of a shape on a map? Can you ever
                  find a whole city, or is San Francisco made up of lots of different
                  glimpses the way home is? By contemplating in this way, you will
                  understand that the planet and its geography are also projections. All
                  outer objects can be investigated in this way, and you will find that
                  all are emptiness. Outer objects still appear, but they have no
                  essence. <br><br>Next, moving into more intimate territory, we should
                  investigate the object of our self-clinging. The only thing we cling to
                  more tenaciously than the external world is ego, the self. The self is
                  our most precious possession, yet we really have no idea what it
                  actually is. We think “I” and “mine” all the time, but what exactly are
                  we referring to? If pressed, most people would say that it is their
                  body and mind, although some would say it is something separate and
                  more abstract, like a spirit or soul.<br><br>We need to deconstruct the
                  actual experiences that seem to be “the self.” We see glimpses of hands
                  and feet, clothing and reflections. We experience feelings, emotions,
                  and other perceptions. We see reflections in mirrors, feel pleasant and
                  painful sensations, get headaches and stub our toes. We think a lot,
                  get sleepy, and sometimes feel uncomfortable. None of these is the
                  self, and when we investigate we can’t find anything else that holds
                  all of these experiences together.<br><br>You may protest, But all these things are part of “<span style="font-style: italic;">me</span>”!
                  If so, then ask yourself, What is it that experiences all these things?
                  Is it something separate from the experiences, like a soul or spirit?
                  Can you find such an entity? <br><br>Are thoughts the <span style="font-style: italic;">experiencer</span>?
                  If you think that thoughts experience things, then investigate what
                  produces the thoughts. Can you find “a thinker” as well as a thought?
                  Perhaps the experiences experience themselves. Is that how it is?<br><br>Look for the <span style="font-style: italic;">doer</span> in the same way you looked for the experiencer. When you think, “I am
                  going to walk the dog,” will the thought do the walking or the one who
                  thinks? If it is the latter, then they must be two separate things and
                  you should be able to identify both of them. For whatever action you
                  experience, try to find the actor. Is the doer anything more than an
                  assumption?<br><br>This is a difficult contemplation to do, so don’t
                  rush or push too hard. We have a tremendous investment in the existence
                  of ego, and there is incredible resistance to exposing this illusion.
                  It is easy to dismiss such investigation simply as mind games or word
                  play: it’s all semantics. But the Buddhist tradition of investigation
                  is not based on playing games. The proof of the power of investigation
                  has always been the result: loosening the grip of ego. Sensing this
                  possibility, ego is amazingly resourceful at fending off investigation.
                  All sorts of emotions, distractions, and confusion will come up to ward
                  it off. Investigate repeatedly and you will gradually see that the self
                  is also emptiness. It too has no base or root.<br><br>At some point you
                  might conclude that there is no self, but there must be a consciousness
                  that is the experiencer of all and the doer of all. If you arrive
                  there, this is what you need to investigate next. The subjective aspect
                  of experience is undeniable, but does this prove that a thing truly
                  exists that is the experiencer? There are many types of
                  consciousness—visual consciousness, auditory consciousness, smell
                  consciousness, taste consciousness, tactile consciousness, mental
                  consciousness, and self-awareness, to name the main ones. Is there a
                  basis or unifying entity for all of these? Each of these
                  consciousnesses is always conscious of <span style="font-style: italic;">something</span>. Can you find mind or consciousness that is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> connected with some specific experience? Can you find the root of mind? <br><br>Investigating
                  the root of mind is an extremely subtle investigation. You might
                  reflect on it from time to time to see if it illuminates itself. You
                  could also refresh yourself by studying more, receiving teachings, and
                  meditating. This gives contemplation more power to work on you.<br><br>Because
                  there are two ways of seeing everything and we are deeply habituated to
                  only seeing apparent reality, for realization of ultimate reality to
                  develop, everything must be seen anew. Popular literature holds out the
                  hope that this transformation can occur like a flash of lightning, but
                  I am afraid this is wishful thinking.<br><br>Understanding, experience,
                  and realization develop gradually through lots of listening,
                  contemplating, and meditating. Meeting ultimate reality is more like
                  exploring a new continent than a cosmic revelation, but the good news
                  is that the journey of exploration itself is invigorating and endlessly
                  rewarding.<br><em><br style="font-style: italic;"><br><span class="article_closing_bio">Andy

              <div class="title">&gt;</div>
              <div class="title">For a full listing of all articles written by Laurie Conrad, please type her name in Buzzle's search engine. Thursday, November 8: This week we continued our studies of the <em>Eight Verses on Training the Mind</em> written by Langri Thangpa (1054-93), the final verse: <br><br>Verse Eight: <br><br><em>By ensuring that all this remains undefiled <br>From the stains of the eight mundane concerns, <br>And by understanding all things as illusions, <br>I will train myself to be free of the bondage of clinging.</em> <br><br>This verse in a way includes all the other seven vows: if we can free ourselves of all attachments to all forms, the previous seven vows are not difficult to achieve. This is why in his lecture, His Holiness the Dalai Lama called the last two verses the "short path". <br><br><em>By ensuring</em> For me, this phrase, <em>By ensuring</em> is similar in nature to the phrase <em>I will train myself</em> , which is found in all eight verses or vows: i.e. it is our own responsibility to put these vows into practice, to live them. No one can take these vows for us, nor practice them for us. <br><br><em>all this  </em>We decided that all this referred to the previous seven verses. <br><br><em>remains undefiled From the stains of the eight mundane concerns</em> I asked the class what the <em>eight mundane concerns</em> were. After some thought, Trudy answered: "We don’t know what they are." Which is true, we did not know. However: it is not necessary to know specifically what those eight mundane concerns are. The point is that they are <em>mundane</em> , and therefore connected to the ego - and that to entertain them defiles and stains the Mind of Clear Light and our lives, as all the aggregates, or ego thoughts, do. <br><br><em>And by understanding all things as illusions</em> This is the key to this very valuable verse. First, I asked the class for a definition of <em>The Doctrine of Emptiness</em> : this Tibetan Buddhist Doctrine is often misunderstood in the West. Westerners tend to think of it as a doctrine that supports nihilism, that nothing exists - which is not true. In fact, in past lectures I have attended, the Dalai Lama has warned us against falling into nihilism. His Holiness has suggested that if we feel that we are falling into nihilism that we apply the antidote, i.e. remind ourselves that mundane, conventional, physical reality has its own conventional reality. <br><br><em>The Doctrine of Emptiness</em> , for the Tibetan Middle Way Buddhists, means that all forms are empty of independent, inherent existence. <br><br>This includes the ego, or "I thought". Chris took notes at His Holiness’ lecture on <em>The Eight Verses of Training the Mind</em> and she gave them to me after class. Chris had written: "The ego, the personality, the small self is also devoid of inherent existence. ‘Self’ and sense of ‘I am’ are constructs based on physical and mental elements, derived from factors that cannot stand on their own. Therefore, the self is empty of inherent existence. The self only exists in dependent relation with physical and mental elements or aggregates. The physical and mental elements also have no true Reality (and here the Dalai lama mentioned Quantum physics.). Grasping at the sense of ‘I am’ is at the root of our afflictions. For instance, holding onto a notion of self leads to attachment and clinging." <br><br>In other words, if we examine who we are: we are more than our thoughts and emotions, more than our personalities and physical bodies. If we examine our personality or ego: it is only comprised of thoughts that come and go. Therefore, those thoughts cannot have inherent existence; they arise within the mind and physical brain, a physical brain which is dependent upon our physical body. Our physical body is dependent upon our parents for its very existence, and the food we eat and the water we drink for its continued existence. Therefore, we must be something more than the ego or personality and physical body. If this is so, then our ego or smaller self - does not independently, inherently exist. Our ego self is devoid of true Reality. <br><br><em>The Doctrine of Emptiness</em> is closely connected to <em>The Doctrine of Dependent-arising.</em> The Dalai Lama would say that nothing in form inherently exists, i.e. nothing in form has Ultimate or True Reality or Existence. Everything in form - all physical and mental things and objects, including our own physical bodies - depend on something else for their very existence. Therefore, they do not independently, inherently exist. For instance, if we take the example of a wooden cart: if we take the cart apart, take its wheels off, disassemble the sides and bottom: where is the cart? The cart is dependent on the tree’s wood, the wood cutters, the workmen that cut the wood and those who then assembled the cart. The cart does not exist on its own, is does not <em>independently</em> or <em>inherently</em> exist. The tree is dependent on other factors for its physical existence as well: the seed that began it, the rain and sun that supported its growth. For the Tibetan Buddhist, all forms are empty of independent, inherent existence. Any thing in form is dependent on something else for its very existence; therefore nothing in form can be Ultimately Real. <br><br>In this sense: the world is <em>illusion.</em> <br><br><em>And by understanding all things as illusions, <br>I will train myself to be free of the bondage of clinging.</em> <br><br>In other words, if we understand the Doctrines of <em>Emptiness </em>and <em>Dependent-arising</em> : we can then train ourselves to be free of <em>clinging</em> , or attachment. <br><br>I asked the class why attachment put us into bondage, why we need to rid ourselves of this <em>clinging</em> . Diana said: fear of loss leads to anger which leads to hatred which then leads to jealousy and greed: in other words, attachment leads to pain and suffering. Trudy said that attachment to things or people blocks us from the Higher; attachment replaces the Higher in our lives, i.e. we get stuck in material forms. I asked the class to define "forms" and they said forms included material things, ideas and emotions, as well as people, animals and flowers and all other beings. <br><br>I added that these <em>illusions</em> also include the notions of time and space, and the notions of duality and separation. If we think we are merely the physical body, and that others are merely their physical bodies - then we will feel separation from others. The erroneous notion of duality tells me that I am here, sitting on the couch - and Pam is there, across the room - i.e. that we are two separate entities separated by space. To know that space does not ultimately exist as we know it, we need only to examine the bilocation skills of the saints of many religions; to disprove that time ultimately exists, we need only to examine the clairvoyance of the saints of many religions. Separation, as we experience it, either of time or space, does not Ultimately exist. Only our human perceptions convince us that separation exists. If we realize that separation does not truly exist, then we will not cling to anything in form, there is no need to cling. <br><br>Then I asked the class how the <em>Doctrine of Emptiness</em> could help us overcome the bondage of clinging, or attachment. M. said: "What are you clinging to, if it does not ultimately exist?".</div>

              <p>Whether you use concepts or not are completely irrelevant to your true nature.</p>
              <p>You don't need concepts to know you are alive and you are breathing.</p>

              <p>Yes. Intellectual understanding is not the same as truly realising it deeply and seeing emptiness in everything. The deeply held bond, the attachments to form, is still present in our subconscious. Our usual way of seeing things dualistically and 'inherently' still functions because the bond is too strong and is affecting almost every moment of our lives with the exception of deep sleep and deep meditative absorption.</p>
              <p>Only through a quantum shift of perception, a true insight into the nature of reality, these bonds are 'burnt' away. Furthermore, an initial glimpse or insight into non-duality, no-self, emptiness, etc... will not be sufficient to clear all these bonds. It requires years of maturation, deepening and cycles of insight that it can totally penetrate the subconscious and clear all remaining bonds and afflictions. That is why there are 4 stages to Arhatship and 10 stages (bhumis) of a Bodhisattva... and at each stage certain obscure and subtle layers of bonds are cleared.</p>
              <p>So to truly clear all of these attachments, all bonds, we still have to continue practicing hard to develope the prajna wisdom that sees the emptiness of self and the emptiness of all phenomena.</p>
              <p>When we practice subjectless and objectless awareness, when seeing a cup, there is just the sight -- when there is sound of airplane or birds it's just sound -- not an airplane or a bird. There is also no sense of a separate seer or hearer, only sights and sounds. There is no discriminations, and thus no grasping nor rejecting of what appears in our sensory awareness.</p>
              <p>What we call 'bird' or an 'airplane' is just a luminous and empty Appearance, a manifestation of consciousness. It has in fact empty of an objective reality and it is not 'out there' in contrast to 'me in here'. It is due to the bond at seeing things dualistically and inherently, the deep conditioning within us, that makes us constantly experience things as external objects in contrast to an inner experiencer.</p>
              <p>Similarly when emotions arise we should just feel the emotions without grasping on it 'solidly' -- it's just a pure feeling, don't interprete, judge, chase, or grasp the emotion. They are also impermanent, ungraspable.</p>
              <p>When we observe anything -- say a red flower, though they vividly manifest due to conditions, it's in fact insubstantial and empty. It's just an appearance. A dog sees a black flower, and if we observe its quantum characteristics it's mostly void. So there is no inherent 'red' 'flower' with inherent characteristics, colours and shapes. There is just an insubstantial, empty yet luminous appearance.</p>
              <p>When we truly observe everything and contemplate on its emptiness, insights may eventually dawn for us. But this is not something that can be done over one day's time, it requires a period of practice.</p>

              <p>There's something very important that Thusness just wrote in the other thread</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He said: <em> ...To conciousness, it is always insights that
                                          liberates.  Spontaneous perfection is not about the
                                          path we adopt, it is that ultimate and thorough insight that allows
                                          us to willingly, fearlessly and unreservedly open to whatever that
                                          arises; for whatever arises is always to liberate itself when
                                          experienced as non-dual and empty awareness....</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And how to allow insight to arise?</p>
              <p>As Thusness so clearly stated: The syncing of the Right View (1st of Eightfold Path) and Right Path/Practices (2nd to 8th of Eightfold Path) allows Fruition (insight/enlightenment) to arise.</p>
              <p>Have a thorough understanding of the Buddhist teachings of Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness/Dependent Origination, the 5 skhandas and 18 dhatus etc, and practice to experience the truths for oneself.</p>
              <p>When insight arise, one will automatically let go of all our attachments. Prior to that, the attachments will still surface intermittently when the conditions for them to arise surfaces. We should not supress them but to continue dropping, and observing. Only until one day when insight arise and self-liberation is experienced at all moments, then all bonds and karmic propensities (deep conditionings) that affects the way we perceive things dualistically and inherently and thus attach to them, are cleared.</p>
              <p>As Thusness wrote years ago:</p>
              <p><em><br>"...When one is unable to see the truth of our nature, all
                  letting go is nothing more than another from of holding in disguise.
                  Therefore without the 'insight', there is no releasing.... it is a
                  gradual process of deeper seeing. when it is seen, the letting go is
                  natural. You cannot force urself into giving up the self...
                  purification to me is always these insights... non-dual and emptiness
                  nature...."<br><br>~ Thusness</em></p>

              <span>
              <p>At some point, either before or after the initial enlightenment
                                      experience—at least in my tradition—you must become absolutely certain
                                      that you are not your body.</p>
              <p>All that you know is consciousness. Think about it. Everything you
                                      experience, your body, the world, thinking, memories, science, history,
                                      dreams, other people--all happen in your consciousness. If something
                                      happens outside of your consciousness, such as a storm while you slept,
                                      or Lincoln’s assassination, you only know about it if someone, or
                                      something within your consciousness tells you. That learning occurs
                                      now, within your present consciousness. Of course, you can also infer
                                      something happened by after effects, such as wet ground implies there
                                      was rain. Yet, even that inference is a thinking, a speculation, and it
                                      occurs in your present consciousness. All memory about the past and
                                      thinking about the future, occurs in your now consciousness. Thus, all
                                      knowing and experience occurs now. It is then obvious that you need to
                                      experience and understand now-consciousness.</p>
              <p>If all that you know or experience is consciousness,<strong> then you too, at least for argument’s sake, are consciousness. </strong>Your
                                      consciousness is not limited by body, mind, world, time or space; all
                                      these occur within your consciousness as objects of that consciousness.</p>
              <p>Even the intangible, the invisible, and the hidden, such as an atom,
                                      or gravity, are known only by inference from present experience in your
                                      now consciousness. The inference to the unobserved, such as the
                                      existence of an atom, or a gravity wave, is a mental process occurring
                                      within your present consciousness too. Atomic physics, cosmology, and
                                      all of science becomes a set of inferences about hidden and non-hidden
                                      objects and forces, derived from simple acts of perception conjoined
                                      with a set of mental functions we call inference or logic, which are
                                      also happenings in now consciousness.</p>
              <p>So what is this now-consciousness? Intellectually understood it is
                                      called mind. Others would call it imagination. It is all mental stuff.
                                      This, of course doesn’t help understanding one whit except that it is a
                                      pointer that helps you get before the concept that the body it real,
                                      and by real, I mean as having its own, autonomous self-existence. Its
                                      existence is imaginary, mindstuff.</p>
              <p>I must admit my own evolution appears idiosyncratic. That is, for
                                      many years before awakening, I was conscious of an almost palatable
                                      emptiness or Void. When I described it to someone else, he ascribed it
                                      to seeing God.</p>
              <p>The only persistent mention I see of it is in Mahayana, where the
                                      Void’s meaning is explained according to differing schools, and
                                      Vajrayana Buddhism, such as the Tibetan Kargya school. It is only in
                                      the latter that I see much description of the experience of the Void
                                      (as opposed to the theory of the Void), or the mention that the
                                      essential quality of mind, mental space, is that of clear light.</p>
              <p>The clear light experience is found when the mind is quiet, and the
                                      light of consciousness, which is always there, rather than a background
                                      awareness, becomes the foreground awareness. That is, the light becomes
                                      a more compelling experience than any object within mind. The screen,
                                      so to speak, becomes more important than the play of images that make a
                                      movie.</p>
              <p>How to get to this place is explained further on another page on this site, but it is so important that it is worth repetition.</p>
              <p>When at first we look within, rather than at an object in the world,
                                      we only find darkness. However, as our ‘inner eye’ ‘adjusts’ to the
                                      darkness of the mental space within, the darkness gradually gives way
                                      to an inner light. It is like entering a darkened movie theater. The
                                      eyes have to acclimatize before they see the reflected light from the
                                      movie. That inner light illuminates a mental world of emptiness, or
                                      void. Many years of looking leads the inner emptiness to expand, and
                                      the light to illuminate it ever more brightly.</p>
              <p>Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhists call this clear, self-illumined
                                      Void our true nature. Our true nature is nothingness, this
                                      nothingness-emptiness, which is absolutely clear, is illumined by its
                                      own light.</p>
              <p>At first, this light appears different from physical light. It is
                                      less clear, less intense and less ‘grabbing’ of attention. However,
                                      over the years, its intensity grows and its manifested forms change.
                                      Color patterns and shadows dance and fill its radiance. An inner movie
                                      of insubstantial forms plays to its one audience. Eventually the
                                      meditator discovers that the inner light and outer physical light are
                                      the same. They arise out of the basic functioning of vision
                                      consciousness itself. Of course there is sound consciousness and that
                                      is described in many other sources.</p>
              <p>Knowing this inner Void of light and peace leads to dramatic changes
                                      in one’s belief systems. For example, no matter how hard you look, no
                                      matter how long you look within, and that within becomes a clear,
                                      light, Void, you cannot find an I.</p>
              <p>With your eyes open, operating and functioning in the world, you may
                                      act like a me, and even feel like a me if you turn your attention to
                                      yourself. However, if you stop and look within, eyes open or closed,
                                      trying to pursue the I, whether it is a thought or a feeling, you
                                      cannot find it. Even if you turn even further inward to look for the
                                      one who is looking, you will find the same self-illumined emptiness
                                      only. That’s it. That’s all you’ll ever find looking within.</p>
              <p>Looking within and abiding within, means getting to the
                                      non-experiential state lying beneath (or before) thoughts, feelings or
                                      sensations.</p>
              <p>All that you find is nothingness, a lighted void. While this
                                      experience may not change you radically, you do begin to wonder who is
                                      it that exists, and what is the nature of that existence.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One day the realization comes that within the entire fabric of your
                                      being there is no I at all. There never has been an I. There is no
                                      coordinator. There is no thinker. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You discover there are thoughts, but no thinker. There are actions,
                                      but no actor. There are decisions, but no decision maker. There is
                                      movement, but no mover. There is life, but no one who lives. There are
                                      trees, but no perceiver.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Everything takes place without a perceiver or organizer. Thoughts
                                      come and go, but they are like drops of rain, not something you create
                                      and implement. Everything happens without a central point of I-ness.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>When this absence of I is clearly understood, your world is turned
                                      upside down. Without an I, there is no other opposed to it. I and other
                                      become one. I am no longer different from my percept, because there is
                                      no longer a me. There is percept, and I am that. There is only one
                                      field of perception, undivided by categories of me and thee, I and
                                      Thou, inner and outer, and I am all that.</strong></span></p>
              <p>With the disappearance of the I-idea, there is the temporary
                                      replacement by the Oneness-idea. You go around saying there is only
                                      One, only One! However, even this Oneness-idea is eventually overturned
                                      because we realize it too, is only an idea. With the disappearance of
                                      the I-idea, all ideas begin to vanish too. Atom is an idea. Quantum is
                                      an idea. Communism and capitalism are ideas, as is central bank, gross
                                      domestic product, integrity, dishonesty, brain, pancreas, and even
                                      Oneness and consciousness. They all disappear and with them, the
                                      existence of that which they purportedly denoted. The world is not
                                      other than mind and mind is no other than thoughts.</p>
              <p>Soon our apparent brains begin to close out random thoughts and we
                                      begin to really look at our direct experience without the intervention
                                      of thought or the guidance of theory and memories of how things ought
                                      to be. The world revealed is vastly different from the world we thought
                                      we lived in.</p>
              <p>We eventually discover we are not human beings at all, trapped in a
                                      body doomed to death, but we are everything we experience. We are the
                                      totality of consciousness. Without the I to limit us, without an I to
                                      direct our lives in routines of please and pain avoidance, we are
                                      allowed to expand and take ownership of the totality of real existence.
                                      We leave behind the world of thought existence.</p>
              <p>The inner world and the outer world come together. The inner world
                                      of vast, inner, self-illumined space merges with the outer world of
                                      objects and sense impressions. When you look within you see the inner
                                      light, and when you look without, everything you see is illumined by
                                      physical light. When you walk into a dark room, you leave the physical
                                      light behind, and you see only the inner light. One day you realize
                                      that inner light is always there, even in the external world of
                                      sunlight. One day you realize there is only light. Sometimes you may
                                      call it sunlight, or lamplight, and sometimes you may call it inner
                                      light. However, there always is light, and that light illumines all,
                                      whether an inner fantasy or an outer tree.</p>
              <p>When we are quiet and still, sometimes the inner vastness opens
                                      completely, and we, as discrete sentient objects, as subjects,
                                      disappear completely, to be replaced by our totality of experience of
                                      the world. The boundary between the trees and us disappears, and we
                                      become the trees. We become the sound of the tree blowing in a breeze.
                                      We become the jet plane overhead. Body and mind disappear completely,
                                      and we become the totality of experience, including portions of body
                                      experience mixed in.</p>
              <p>We experience we are not the body. We are the totality of
                                      experience. We are the totality of consciousness, which includes the
                                      experience of the body as a part of a larger totality.</p>
              <p>Now comes a most important step. We begin to investigate the body as
                                      an object of consciousness, and therefore, like all objects in
                                      consciousness, it too is consciousness. We explore the body as
                                      consciousness, just as we explored the vast, inner emptiness.</p>
              <p>Since the vast, inner, self-illumined emptiness is now always
                                      present, eyes open or closed, it is not surprising to see that the body
                                      too has this quality. The body is experienced in many ways. We can
                                      touch it, and be touched by it. We can hear the sounds it makes. We can
                                      taste its skin, and we taste our mouths. We can see portions of it with
                                      our eyes open. We can feel its muscles moving. We can feel our lungs
                                      pulling in air. We can feel a headache or muscle strain. We can look
                                      within, using our inner vision and find the lighted void that permeates
                                      all sensations of touch, taste, smell, sight, and inner feelings.</p>
              <p>We begin to see the body is essentially empty and light, as is
                                      everything else within consciousness, as well as it should be, because
                                      the body too is only another object within consciousness, and thus is
                                      consciousness itself.</p>
              <p>Whether there is something that reincarnates into a new body is a
                                      moot point. Speculating about it does not help you know yourself first
                                      hand. Someone who has recognized there is no I can see there is nothing
                                      to reincarnate, except the vast, self-illumined Void. But, this is
                                      everyone’s void, everyone’s true and original nature. Who can say that
                                      this part of the Void is me, and that will reincarnate?</p>
              <p>The same self-illumined speck of void is in everyone and permeates
                                      everyone’s every experience. The void is everyone and contains
                                      everyone. The void is One. As the Prajna Paramita Hridaya Sutra so
                                      succinctly states: Form is no other than Emptiness, Emptiness no other
                                      than form. Feeling, thought, sensation, and consciousness are also like
                                      this. All forms arise out of the Void, and return to the Void, just as
                                      clouds materialize from a clear sky, and after an hour or a week,
                                      dissipate back into the clear sky.</p>
              <p>Perceiving the body and its experience from the inside, with the
                                      understanding that it too is consciousness, changes the body’s
                                      experience. Things no longer happen to it as a passive subject. Rather,
                                      the body and environment are inseparable. One cannot experience one
                                      without the other. In fact, the body is the One world, and the One
                                      world is the body.</p>
              <p>Sensations become less substantial. They are all permeated by
                                      emptiness. They feel less cluttered, more discrete and clear, but at
                                      the same time, less substantial, and in a sense, less "real." We often
                                      use the term ‘real’ synonymously with hard, tangible, or especially
                                      impactful sensations. However, all sensations now occur within a
                                      simultaneously perceived vast emptiness, which is as real as the
                                      sensations.</p>
              <p>The experience is a little like seeing the old pirate hologram at
                                      Disneyland’s Pirate Cove. There is a discrete image of light with the
                                      form of a man, but you can see through the image, as if it were a
                                      ghost. It has an intangible, empty feel about it. So too become the
                                      body’s sensations. They seem less substantial, and less real, which is
                                      good if you are dying a painful death, but bad if you are having
                                      enjoyable sex.</p>
              <p>Another result of the constant presence of the Void is that no
                                      experience is more important than any other portion of the totality of
                                      the experience. The body is no more important than the tree. With
                                      increasing freedom from the demands of the world, we can begin to
                                      explore our experience of our bodies more closely. One day we make the
                                      remarkable discovery: we have no bodies!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We realize that the body, like our sense of I, is only a concept.
                                      There is no central experiencer of the body that coordinates the body’s
                                      many sensations and perceptions. If you look closely at the body,
                                      examine each sensation moment by moment, you will understand
                                      completely, there is no such thing as the inner experience of the body
                                      as a totality. The sense of body totality is a concept only. </strong></span>Try it,
                                      you’ll see this is true. You must become convinced that you have no
                                      body by this direct experience before you can become free. In fact,
                                      this appears to be the essence of Ramana Maharshi’s experience. He
                                      discovered he was not his body. He did not find realization through
                                      self enquiry as he taught everyone else to do, but through a process
                                      where he realized he was not his body. I call this sort of
                                      self-investigation Microanalysis, and it is a great adjunct to the "Who
                                      Am I?" sort of self-enquiry.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If we look at our experience of our bodies from the inside, in a
                                      careful, thorough manner, we discover all sorts of things. At any one
                                      time we only experience portions of our bodies’ feelings. Sometimes we
                                      feel a muscle tightness in the neck or back. Sometimes just the
                                      pressure of the chair against the buttocks. Sometimes we experience the
                                      taste in or mouths. Sometimes a tingling sensation on the feet.
                                      Sometimes we feel our heart beating, and sometimes we hear it.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Though many sensations may vie for our attention, and reside on the
                                      edges of direct awareness, we actually can only attend to one sensation
                                      of the whole at a time. It is like trying to hold onto two thoughts at
                                      a time-impossible. Just as you cannot think two thoughts at the same
                                      time, you cannot attend to two sensations simultaneously.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>While we can examine one sensation after another, either randomly,
                                      or in a linear fashion, we cannot experience them all at once. Nor can
                                      we experience the body as a whole, as one complete form. If you think
                                      you do, please examine that wholeness feeling. You will discover that
                                      the experience of the body as a whole, is in fact, an "enduring" image,
                                      a fantasy, not an actual experience of the body as a whole. We have a
                                      body image, imagination, so to speak, derived from many years of body
                                      experience, and this image acts as an inner cognitive reference map
                                      that gives all the random sensations a meaning within the context of
                                      that map, i.e., a banged toe, hot mashed potatoes in the mouth.</strong></span></p>
              <p>It also becomes clear that the external world has its own reference
                                      map, but that map is still within our imagination. It then comes as no
                                      surprise that they are the same: reference maps of various dreams.</p>
              <p>For example, I will have a sudden slight burning ‘pain’ somewhere. I
                                      search through my memories of similar sensations, until there is a
                                      match. I can then declare it a foot pain or a back pain based on past
                                      experience. Back sensations are different from foot sensations. The
                                      body image then gives me a map, and I place that pain in my body
                                      image’s foot. I can then reach down and rub my foot.</p>
              <p>Isolating the spatial location of any body sensation from the inside
                                      is impossible without this body image map. The map is not itself a
                                      sensation or perception of the body. It is an image, born of
                                      experience, and supported by our ideas about our body. In fact, for
                                      most people, the body image grabs more attention than the sensations,
                                      which means we do not experience our experience, but we experience our
                                      ideas about ourselves.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This all leads up to my initial statement and final conclusion, the
                                      requisite knowledge of awakening: You have no body. The body is only a
                                      concept. There are only scattered sensations and perceptions that the
                                      brain puts together with a body image. There is only One experience,
                                      one field of consciousness, and you are that, the totality of all that
                                      is.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Robert used to say, "You are nobody, No Body at all." The body idea
                                      is very limiting. You are much more than the body and its many
                                      sensations. These all come and go, but who you are essentially, stays
                                      the same: Emptiness, without form, vast like space, lighted by its own
                                      light. But even this emptiness is not you. It is added to you. Form
                                      dissolves into emptiness and both into you.</p>
              <p>You are not your body. In effect, you have no body, nor is there a
                                      you to have one. No body, no you. Even consciousness is just a concept.
                                      The vast, self-lighted Void too, is just a concept, a knowing added
                                      onto your emptiness nature. These concepts are both stepping stones and
                                      hindrances to discovering who you are, without words, images or
                                      concepts. About This, nothing can be said, because that which can be
                                      said has nothing to do with you.</p>

              <p><br>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>You must first know that “Emptiness” cannot be understood by second hand knowledge except by prajna wisdom.  Prajna is a form of intuitive insight of ‘emptiness’; a kind of direct knowing.  You must be deeply aware of this “direct without intermediary” sort of perception -- too direct to have subject-object gap, too short to have time, too simple to have thoughts.</p>
              <p>I will not comment on the article but just want you to be clearly aware of this immediate sort of seeing.  An experience of the Eternal Witness is not a form of knowledge that is derived from relating, associating, deducing or inducing anything.  It is not about thinking, there are no thoughts.  It is a whole and complete sense of ‘I’; a pure sense of existence free from all artificialities.  Unlike relative knowledge that always requires an element of faith to bridge the gap as there is no certainty of knowledge, the experience of Eternal Witness is completely free from doubts.  A practitioner is fully convinced, unshakeable and unmovable; not even Buddha can shake his insight. </p>
              <p>It is this sort of insight that must arise when it comes to spirituality.  It is the ‘wisdom eye’ that can see the whole of ‘sound’ by being ‘sound’.  It is the same ‘eye’ that sees ‘anatta’ and ‘emptiness’.  After the maturing of insight, one will naturally understands that ‘Eternal Witness’ is no more “purer” than the arising and passing sound, the empty phenomena.  It is just the awakening of this non-dual eye.</p>
              <p>Therefore after some pointers, to progress further and truly know, reflecting relatively will not help; you should start to let go completely and learnt the art of feeling directly and wholly.  Buddha taught mindfulness that practices bare attention at the same time experience the impermanent nature of all arising and passing phenomena.  We should not take this lightly.  We can start from there to awake the intuitive insight of anatta and emptiness. :)</p>

              <p>I agree with you about the understanding of 'clear light'... 'clear light' is without any features, or colours, but is the subtle luminosity that pervades and allows every experience. I also have had experiences of lights in kasina in meditation and 'clear light' is not refering to Kasinas.</p>
              <p>About the experience of "Oneness"... I wouldn't agree that "Oneness" is "a direct
              connection can be made with objects outside of us". Speaking from my experience, in non-dual experience there is no one to make a connection with objects.... Awareness is not 'in here' taking in/observing things, it is that thing being seen in itself, without a seer.</p>
              <p>In non-dual seeing... there is no 'you' seeing the objects or have a relationship with the object or 'connect with' the object... you ARE that seeing/seen. When seeing the tree you are the tree, there is no 'you' in here perceiving the tree... no self at all... just the self-shimmering tree.</p>
              <p>That said I did not experience a permanent shift to non-dual awareness... that requires deep insight into the 'Always So' nature of non-duality, that the nature of reality has always been non-dual at all moments... Thusness and Longchen can talk more about this from experience.</p>

              <p>To me "Oneness" is a sense of 'totality'.  It doesn't matter how clumsy outward appearances may be, as long as there is a deep sense of totality in action or activity or experience or sensation, there will be this sense of "Oneness".   </p>
              <p>Regardless of the forms of practices we engaged, be it chanting or breathing or bare attention of not imputing concepts and labels on objects or naked awareness on whatever arises, the experience of "Oneness" appears to have 2 distinct characteristics; one is the dissolving of subject/object or agent/activity division and the other, the sense that the phenomena taking place "is on its own".  When these 2 characteristics are there, there will be the experience of "Oneness".</p>
              <p>Just a sharing.</p>
