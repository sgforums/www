Recent discoveries in quantum physics suggest that science is slowly coming round to a view of reality not unlike that described in Buddhist philosophy.<br><br>The problem  in the East is that buddhism is so laden with rituals and tied in to cultures by folk traditions that the dharma is often obscured. The west are finding a real movement toward a strong lay practice that is based on the simplicity of the dharma without much of the cultural baggage carried by eastern traditions<br><br>the problem with the 'joss stick buddhists'  is tat they thought they r buddhists but in actual fact they r not.Actually the so-called buddhists convert to another religion are just folk practitioners (pray this pray that...dono wat r they praying also ) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
