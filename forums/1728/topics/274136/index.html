Unless one practices deviant meditation, or focus in between the eyebrow, etc. Which are not Buddhist practices, and Thusness did mention that these practices could possibly open the channel to the spirit realm and interferences.<br><br>On contrary, proper BUDDHIST meditation especially for experienced practitioners WILL close the channels to spirit attacks or possessions.<br><br>Thusness said before, when Presence is experienced correctly, such channels to the spirit realms and possessions and interferences is being closed, and as Longchen said, "maintaining a nondual awareness should overcome the interference" (to all spirit attacks, possessions, etc).<br><br>My taiwanese teacher spoke of his experiences of encountering a past life creditor coming to take his life during his meditation but couldn't affect him because of his meditative state.<br><br>Oh and... remember Shariputra being hit by a powerful spirit, but shariputra wasn't affected because he was in a state of samadhi (diamond samadhi or something) and could not be harmed. The spirit immediately fell into avici hell.</div>

The spirit had the power to kill just about anyone else, but he was foolish enough to attack an Arhat (and failed) and had to suffer very very bad karma for that one.<br><br>And yes, there will of course be bad karma resulting.<br><br><blockquote>It's also interesting that I only hear and read of such a concept within the general Mahayana groups, e.g. Pureland but not that in the Theravada teachings.</blockquote>The case I mentioned about Sariputra is from the Pali texts as well. In Theravada, there are malevolent spirits who do harm people.<br><br><blockquote>Although, I did listen to a talk on a freely distributed CD recorded by Venerable Aggacitta, a Malaysian Therevada Buddhist monk, he spole on five methods of self-defence against attack by malevolent or unwelcome spirits.</blockquote>Hmm.. haven't heard on that..</div>
