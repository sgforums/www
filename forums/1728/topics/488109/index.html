              “orphanage tourism” (Westerners going abroad to help or adopt orphans) in
              Cambodia. Surely such selfless, Angelina Jolie-style generosity is a beacon of
              hope in a bleak world?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">Not quite. As it turns
              out, Western do-gooders are funding a multi-million dollar enterprise that <em>creates</em> orphans. Over the last five years, “orphanage tourism” has led to a 75 percent
              increase in the number of orphanages. Children are being sold into what
              UNICEF’s Rana Flowers describes as an “incredibly abusive and exploitative”
              system.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">To the economic
              free-marketeers, this is good example of supply meeting demand. To the rest of
              us, it is an apparent paradox: an attempt to do good that ends up achieving the
              opposite.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">How to make sense of
              this contradiction? To begin with, the only real power we seem to have is that
              over our personal conduct. Although we aspire to social change, any action begins
              with a personal moral choice to take a stand. Of course, when moral outrage
              drives people to demonstrate or organise at work, it pushes over into
              collective action and towards political thinking. The moral vision isn’t lost,
              but provides force for something more powerful.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">The individualist
              starting point carries a risk. It’s all too common for a moral gesture or
              lifestyle choice to masquerade as a solution. In this way, an apparently
              ethical stance becomes self-serving. The German philosopher Friedrich Hegel,
              keenly aware of this problem, discussed a number of individual types who embody
              it.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">The “knight of virtue”
              was his name for one. These ethical individuals have a vision that the system
              can be used to pursue good. So we get “ethical entrepreneurship”. The ethical
              entrepreneur’s business model incorporates those who are seen as needy – “third
              world” producers or the homeless, for example. When a normal business pays its
              workers or producers, it is called a wage. When an ethical business does the same,
              it is called “community empowerment”<em>.</em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">But an ethical business
              is still a business; it still must compete in the market and pay its
              “producers” less than the value they create for the enterprise. But given that
              its products often are more expensive, it relies on a related species: the
              ethical consumer or investor. These people buy absolution in the form of “fair
              trade” coffee, quirky handicrafts and “ethical” stock portfolios.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">Notwithstanding that the
              Vatican pioneered the sale of such “indulgences” hundreds of years ago,
              everyone feels happy – <em>except </em>those who are trapped as exploited
              victims. Microfinance is an example of this. Hailed as “empowering”,
              microfinance enterprises in India granted loans of as little as $US100 to
              ultra-poor slum dwellers otherwise incapable of qualifying for loans. “India’s
              microfinance sector was once touted as a saviour of the poor and a good bet for
              investors …”, noted the <em>Economist</em> in 2013. “Things went downhill
              fast.” There were scores of suicides of small farmers. “It is alleged that they
              were hounded to their deaths by lenders’ coercive recovery practices.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">Not all ethical
              businesses are so disastrous, but none can escape the fact that inequality and
              marginalisation are necessary parts of their business model. In a way, it’s
              like drug dealers running rehab centres.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">A more radical
              individual type is the “virtuous conscience”. In the past, these advocates of a
              moral lifestyle could be found leading crusades against alcohol and obscenity,
              and preaching salvation through Jesus. Today, they aren’t so interested in
              Jesus – but they still harbour an almost perverse interest in consumption and
              obscenity. Thus, you get lifestyle-ism, identity politics and privilege
              checking.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">Taken to an extreme, the
              virtuous conscience can descend into what Hegel called the “insanity of
              self-conceit”. For example, an obsession with “calling out” privilege leads to
              fragmentation and marginalises the uninitiated. But this needn’t bother the
              virtuous conscience. The more humanity is mired in sin, the more the virtuous
              conscience can feel saved.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">The final type of moral
              individual is the “beautiful soul”. Despairing of changing the world, the
              beautiful soul retreats into the conviction of its own goodness. This isn’t as
              hard as it sounds. To the beautiful soul, war is caused by hatred. Inequality
              is caused by greed. The problem with politics is negativity and deceit. So, the
              key is to embrace the opposite values. This wisdom is all the more compelling
              if attributed to a Buddhist monk or a Native American shaman.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">This type of thinking
              isn’t marginal – the statement by a young Greens candidate for Manly in last
              month’s NSW election bemoaned cynicism and negativity in politics, and pointed
              out that idealism and naivety “can only contribute positively to our political
              culture”. In many ways, the beautiful soul is the least serious. For them,
              morality is just window-dressing: vacuous exhortations to “be swept away in the
              wake, or stand up and be counted” (by voting for yet another aspiring
              politician) shows only the beautiful soul’s reconciliation with the world as it
              is.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   ' lang="EN">The thread running
              through these examples is that they all are stuck on the level of moral
              individualism. Taking a moral stand might be a starting point, but if morality
              doesn’t rise to an understanding of the system, it not only fails to change
              capitalist society – it helps reinforce it.</span></p>

After Su Dongpo had experienced a total relaxation of body and mind, he asked Ch'an Master Foyin, "Master, what do you think of my sitting posture?"<br>    "Very magnificent. Like a Buddha!"<br><br>    Su Dongpo was very delighted to hear that. Master Foyin then asked him, "Scholar, what do you think of my sitting posture then?"<br>    Su Dongpo, never giving up any chance to tease and jeer at Master Foyin, immediately replied, "Like a pile of bullsh**." Master Foyin was very delighted to hear the answer and did not utter another word.<br><br>    Su Dongpo thought he had beaten Master Foyin because the Master was wordless while being compared to a pile of bullsh**. He was so proud of himself that he told everyone he met, "Today I won."<br><br>    This news soon reached Su's sister Su Xiaomei. She asked him, "Brother, how was it that you beat Master today?" Su repeated the whole story vividly to his sister. Su Xiaomei, talented and smart as she was, told Su Dongpo straight to his face, "Brother, you actually lost. It is because Master's mind is actually that of a Buddha that he could see you as a Buddha. As your mind is like a pile of bullsh**, you, of course, saw him as a pile of bullsh**." Su Dongpo, realizing his Chan practice was far inferior to Master Foyin's, was speechless.<br><br>    Moral: Ch'an does not depend on knowledge but upon the capacity to awake. Ch'an is not about eloquent debate but intuitive wisdom. Don't think all Ch'an masters handle encounters with sharp words. Sometimes, when they are silent and don't communicate via words and language, they can still utter the same deafening Dharma sounds."<br><br>(Retrieved http://viewonbuddhism.org/buddha.html)</p></div>
