                          and Beyond </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua; font-size: medium;"><strong><br></strong></span><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>By John Welwood </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>Form is emptiness, emptiness itself is form; 
                          emptiness is no other than form, form is no other than emptiness. -Heart 
                          Sutra</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>In every crescendo of sensation, in every effort to recall, in every 
                          progress towards the satisfaction of desire, this succession of an emptiness and 
                          fullness that have reference to each other and are one flesh is the essence of 
                          the phenomenon. -William James</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>In the gap between thoughts nonconceptual 
                          wisdom shines continuously. -Milarepa</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Western philosophy has studied the mind 
                          mainly through conceptual thought and rational analysis; as a result, it has 
                          granted thinking, even "thinking about thinking," the highest status. Modern 
                          depth psychology has gone beyond this traditional understanding by giving 
                          greater importance to what eludes thought--subconscious feelings, wishes, 
                          impulses, images. Yet modern psychology's view of mind remains limited because, 
                          in characteristic Western fashion, it focuses on the contents of mind, while 
                          neglecting mind as an experiential process.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>William James (1890, 255) was an 
                          early critic of psychology's tendency to overemphasize the contents of the mind, 
                          while ignoring the flowing stream of consciousness itself--which for him was 
                          like saying that <br>a river consists of nothing but pailsful, spoonsful, 
                          quartpotsful, barrelsful, and other molded forms of water. Even were the pails 
                          and the pots all actually standing in the stream, still between them the free 
                          water would continue to flow.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>In directing attention toward the flow of 
                          consciousness, the free water that cannot be confined to its molded forms, James 
                          comes close to the Buddhist understanding of everyday mind as a mindstream, a 
                          continuous flow of moment-to-moment experiencing.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Buddhist psychology goes 
                          one step further, however. Beyond the static Western focus on contents of mind 
                          and the more dynamic view of the mindstream as a flow of experiencing, it 
                          recognizes a still larger dimension of mind--the presence of nonconceptual 
                          awareness, or "nonthought," as it is sometimes called. In contrast to the forms 
                          that consciousness takes--thought, feeling, perception--the larger nature of 
                          consciousness has no shape or form. Therefore, it is often described as 
                          "emptiness." If the contents of mind are like pails and buckets floating in a 
                          stream, and the mindstream is like the dynamic flowing of the water, pure 
                          awareness is like the water itself in its essential wetness. Sometimes the water 
                          is still, sometimes it is turbulent; yet it always remains as it is-wet, fluid, 
                          watery. In the same way, pure awareness is never confined or disrupted by any 
                          mind-state. Therefore, it is the source of liberation and true 
                          equanimity.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>When we start to observe the play of the mind, what we most 
                          readily notice are the contents of consciousness--the ongoing, overlapping 
                          sequence of perceptions, thoughts, feelings. As we develop a subtler, finer, 
                          more sustained kind of witnessing, through a discipline like meditation, we 
                          discover in addition to these differentiated mind-moments another aspect of the 
                          mindstream that usually remains hidden: inarticulate gaps or spaces appearing 
                          between our discrete thoughts, feelings, and perceptions. These spaces between 
                          the pailsful and bucketsful of water floating in the stream are hard to see at 
                          first and impossible to remember because they have no definite form or shape we 
                          can grasp. Yet if we do not try to grasp them, these undifferentiated 
                          mind-moments can provide a glimpse of the larger reality that lies beyond the 
                          mindstream: the pure ground of nonconceptual awareness that encompasses and also 
                          surpasses all the activities of mind.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Thus the play of the mind includes 
                          three elements: differentiated and undifferentiated mind-moments, and the larger 
                          background awareness in which the interplay between these two takes place. In 
                          the Tibetan Mahamudra tradition, these three elements are known as movement, 
                          stillness, and awareness. The alternation between movement and 
                          stillness--differentiated and undifferentiated mind-moments--makes up the 
                          flowing stream of consciousness that is the foreground level of mind. And 
                          through the relative stillness of the silent spaces between thoughts we find a 
                          doorway into the essence of mind itself, the larger background awareness that is 
                          present in both movement and stillness, without bias toward either. This larger 
                          awareness is self-existing: it cannot be fabricated or manufactured because it 
                          is always present, whether we notice it or not.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>In terms of the Buddhist 
                          teaching of the three kayas, we could say that the contents of consciousness 
                          belong to the nirmanakaya, the realm of manifest form. The pulsation of the 
                          mindstream, with its alternation between movement and stillness, belongs to the 
                          sambhogakaya, the realm of energetic flow. And the larger open ground of 
                          awareness, first discovered in moments of stillness, is the dharmakaya, the 
                          realm of pure being itself, eternally present, spontaneous, and free of 
                          entrapment in any form whatsoever.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Form and Emptiness in the Stream of 
                          Consciousness </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Our most common experience of nonthought or emptiness is the 
                          appearance of little gaps between our thoughts--which are continually occurring, 
                          though normally overlooked. For instance, after speaking a sentence, there is a 
                          natural pause, marked by a punctuation mark when written out, which allows a 
                          split-second return to undifferentiated awareness. Or between the words of the 
                          sentence itself, there may be halts and gaps (often covered verbally by "hm" or 
                          "ah") that allow split-second attention to a preverbal sense of what we wish to 
                          say.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>As one of the first Western explorers of consciousness, William James 
                          was particularly interested in these undifferentiated moments in the 
                          mindstream--which he called the "transitive parts," in contrast to the more 
                          substantial moments of formal thought and perception. James (1890, 243-4) also 
                          understood the impossibility of using focal attention to try to observe these 
                          diffuse transitional spaces that occur between more substantive 
                          mind-moments:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Now it is very difficult, introspectively, to see the 
                          transitive parts for what they really are. If they are but flights to a 
                          conclusion, stopping them to look at them before the conclusion is reached is 
                          really annihilating them. . . . The attempt at introspective analysis in these 
                          cases is in fact like seizing a spinning top to catch its motion, or trying to 
                          turn up the gas quickly enough to see how the darkness looks.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The difficulty 
                          of apprehending these undifferentiated moments through focal attention has led 
                          Western psychology to disregard or deny them as having any importance in the 
                          stream of consciousness, an error that James (1890, 244) called the 
                          "psychologist's fallacy":</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>If to hold fast and observe the transitive parts of 
                          thought's stream be so hard, then the great blunder to which all schools are 
                          liable must be the failure to register them, and the undue emphasizing of the 
                          more substantive parts of the stream.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The mind's tendency to hold onto solid 
                          forms is like a bird in flight always looking for the next branch to land on. 
                          And this narrow focus prevents us from appreciating what it is like to sail 
                          through space, to experience what one Hasidic master called the 
                          "between-stage"--a primal state of potentiality that gives birth to new 
                          possibilities. Continually looking for a belief, attitude, identity, or 
                          emotional reaction to hold onto for dear life, we fail to recognize the 
                          interplay of form and emptiness in the mindstream--out of which all creativity 
                          arises.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Beauty itself is a function of this interplay. Things stand out as 
                          beautiful only in relation to the space surrounding them. The loveliest antiques 
                          mean nothing in a cluttered room. A sudden clap of thunder is awesome not just 
                          because of the sound, but because of the silence it has interrupted, as James 
                          (1890, 240) points out:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Into the awareness of the thunder itself the 
                          awareness of the previous silence creeps and continues; for what we hear when 
                          the thunder crashes is not thunder pure, but 
                          thunder-breaking-upon-silence-and-contrasting-with-it. . . . The feeling of the 
                          thunder is also a feeling of the silence as just gone.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Similarly in music, 
                          the contour, meaning, and beauty of a melody derive from the intervals between 
                          the notes. Recognizing this, the great pianist Artur Schnabel once wrote, "The 
                          notes I handle no better than many pianists. But the pauses between the 
                          notes--ah, that is where the art resides." A single tone by itself has little 
                          meaning, and as soon as two tones are sounded they are instantly related by the 
                          shape of the space or interval between them. The interval of a third conveys a 
                          totally different feeling-quality than does a fifth. Since any pair of tones the 
                          same interval apart will sound rather similar, the sequences of intervals are 
                          what give a melody its particular quality, rather than the particular tones 
                          themselves.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Thus music provides an interesting analogy for the interplay 
                          between form and emptiness within the larger ecology of mind. Form is emptiness: 
                          the melody is actually a pattern of intervals between the tones. Although a 
                          melody is usually thought of as a sequence of notes, it is equally, if not more 
                          so, a sequence of spaces that the tones simply serve to mark off. Emptiness is 
                          form: nonetheless, this pattern of intervals does make up a definite, unique 
                          melodic progression that can be sung and remembered. And the ground of both the 
                          tones and the intervals is the larger silence that encompasses the melody and 
                          allows it to stand out and be heard.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Our usual addiction to the grasping 
                          tendency of mind causes us to overlook the spaces around thoughts, the felt 
                          penumbra that gives our experience its subtle beauty and meaning. Neglecting 
                          these fluid spaces within the mindstream contributes to a general tendency to 
                          over-identify with the contents of our mind and to assume that we are the 
                          originator and custodian of them. The troublesome equation "I = my thoughts 
                          about reality" creates a narrowed self-sense, along with an anxiety about our 
                          thoughts as territory we have to defend.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Absolute Emptiness: The Larger 
                          Ground of Awareness </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>So far we have focused on gaps in the mindstream--spaces 
                          between thoughts, moments of quiet--that represent a relative kind of emptiness. 
                          These gaps are relatively formless in comparison to the more graspable forms of 
                          thought, perception, or emotion. And the stillness in these gaps is only 
                          relative because it is easily disrupted or displaced by the next moment of 
                          activity that occurs in the mindstream. This type of stillness is simply an 
                          experience among experiences--what the Tibetans call nyam (temporary 
                          experience).<br>Beyond the relative emptiness we discover in these gaps in the 
                          mindstream there lies the much larger, absolute emptiness of nonconceptual 
                          awareness, which Buddhism regards as the very essence of mind. This 
                          nonconceptual awareness is an absolute stillness or emptiness because its space 
                          and silence actually pervade, and thus cannot be displaced by, whatever goes on 
                          in the mind. Meditation practice can help us find this larger stillness in 
                          movement, this larger silence within sound, this nonthought within the very 
                          activity of thinking.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Without sustained and disciplined inner attention, it 
                          is almost impossible to discover, enter, or abide in this absolute ground of 
                          steady awareness. For as long as we skim along the surface of consciousness, our 
                          moments of stillness are quickly disrupted by the activity of thought, feeling, 
                          and perception. Meditation practice provides a direct way to tune into this 
                          larger dimension of nonconceptual awareness. As one Tibetan text (Trungpa and 
                          Hookham 1974, 8) describes this discovery:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Sometimes in meditation there is a 
                          gap in normal consciousness, a sudden complete openness. . . . It is a glimpse 
                          of reality, a sudden flash which occurs at first infrequently, and then 
                          gradually more and more often. It may not be a particularly shattering or 
                          explosive experience at all, just a moment of great simplicity.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Meditation is 
                          designed to help us move beyond the surface contents of the mind. Underneath the 
                          mind's surface activity, the ocean of awareness remains perfectly at rest, 
                          regardless of what is happening on its surface. As long as we are caught up in 
                          the waves of thought and feeling, they appear solid and overwhelming. But if we 
                          can find the presence of awareness within our thoughts and feelings, they lose 
                          their formal solidity and release their fixations. In the words of Tibetan 
                          teacher Tarthang Tulku (1974, 9-10):<br>Stay in the the thoughts. Just be there. 
                          . . . You become the center of the thought. But there is not really any center. 
                          . . . Yet at the same time, there is . . . complete openness. . . . If we can do 
                          this, any thought becomes meditation.<br>In this way, meditation reveals the 
                          absolute stillness within both the mind's turbulence and its relative 
                          calm.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Here then is the deeper sense in which form is emptiness: The essence 
                          of all thought and all experience is complete openness and clarity. In this 
                          sense, Buddhist psychology provides an understanding of mind that resembles the 
                          quantum physics view of matter. In quantum field theories, "the classical 
                          contrast between the solid particles and the space surrounding them is 
                          completely overcome" (Capra 1975, 210). Just as subatomic particles are intense 
                          condensations of a larger energy field, so thoughts are momentary condensations 
                          of awareness. Just as matter and space are but two aspects of a single unified 
                          field, so thought and the spaces between thoughts are two aspects of the larger 
                          field of awareness, which Zen master Suzuki (1970) described as "big mind." If 
                          small mind is the ongoing grasping and fixating activity of focal attention, big 
                          mind is the background of this whole play--pure presence and nonconceptual 
                          awareness.<br>The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the 
                          three aspects of mind discussed here:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>" " " " "</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>In this figure, the dots 
                          are like differentiated mind-moments, which stand out as separate events because 
                          of the spaces between them. Although these spaces appear to be nothing in 
                          comparison to the dots, they nonetheless provide the context that allows the 
                          dots to stand out as what they are and that joins them together. The spaces 
                          between the dots also provide entry points into the background, the white space 
                          of the page, which represents the larger ground of pure awareness in which the 
                          interplay of form and emptiness takes place.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>Big Mind </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The big mind of 
                          pure awareness is a no-man's-land--a free, open reality without reference 
                          points, property boundaries, or trail markers. Although it cannot be grasped as 
                          an object by focal attention, it is not an article of faith. Quite the contrary, 
                          in the words of a Tibetan text, "The nothingness in question is actually 
                          experienceable" (Guenther 1959, 54). Unfortunately, when the untutored mind 
                          regards it as a mere blankness or nothingness, the jewel-like radiance of this 
                          pure awareness becomes obscured. As Dzogchen teacher Tenzin Wangyal (1997, 29) 
                          points out:</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The gap between two thoughtsis essence. But if in that gap there 
                          is a lack of presence, it becomes ignorance and we experience only a lack of 
                          awareness, almost an unconsciousness. If there is presence in the gap, then we 
                          experience the dharmakaya [the ultimate]. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong><br>The essence of meditation could be 
                          described quite simply, in Tenzin Wangyal's words, as "presence in the gap"--as 
                          an act of nondual, unitive knowing that reveals the ground of being in what at 
                          first appears to be nothing at all. As another Tibetan text (Guenther 1956, 269) 
                          explains, "The foundation of sentient beings is without roots. . . . And this 
                          rootlessness is the root of enlightenment." Only in the groundless ground of 
                          being can the dance of reality unfold in all its luminous 
                          clarity.</strong></span></p>

              <p><br>[23:27] &lt;^john^&gt; "Buddhist psychology goes one step further, however. Beyond the static Western focus on contents of mind and the more dynamic view of the mindstream as a flow of experiencing, it recognizes a still larger dimension of mind--the presence of nonconceptual awareness, or "nonthought," as it is sometimes called. In contrast to the forms that consciousness takes--thought, feeling, perception--the larger nature of consciousness has no shape or form."<br>[23:28] &lt;^john^&gt; this is not right. :)<br>[23:28] &lt;^john^&gt; -the larger nature of consciousness has no shape or form.
