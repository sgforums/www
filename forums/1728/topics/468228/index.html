              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman,Bold';">Advice from Lama Zopa Rinpoche regarding Medicine Buddha </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">If you can recite Medicine Buddha mantra as much as you can every day (good to do at
              least 5 malas), this will purify negative karma and will help you never to be reborn in the
              lower realms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">TADYATA OM BHEKHANDZYE BHEKHANDZYE MAHA BHEKHANDZYE (BHEKHANDZYE)
              RAJA SAMUDGATE SVAHA </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Medicine Buddha said that even if an animal hears the Medicine Buddha mantra it will
              never be reborn in the lower realms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">If you don’t purify negative karma, even dying, having cancer, still you have to die because
              of negative karma, because it is not purified, so you will be reborn in the lower realms as a
              hell being, hungry ghost or animal, and again and again without end have to suffer.
              Therefore, you need to purify the negative karma now. If you cannot bear the sickness now
              how can you bear the suffering of the lower realms? Especially because of the incredible
              length of time that beings have to suffer in the lower realms. It is a billion times more
              suffering than all the human problems put together. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Medicine Buddha mantra prevents you from experiencing all these things. So it is much
              more precious than skies of gold, diamonds and wish-fulfilling jewels—all this wealth
              means nothing because it can’t purify all the negative karma. Even if you own that much
              wealth, this one Medicine Buddha mantra is much more precious because it leaves imprints
              of the whole path to enlightenment in your mind; it helps you to have realizations of the
              whole path to enlightenment. It ceases all the gross and subtle defilements and makes you
              achieve enlightenment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Besides the benefits you receive from reciting Medicine Buddha mantra, also these are the
              benefits just from hearing the mantra. So therefore this mantra is much more precious than
              the whole sky full of diamonds and infinite jewels. With the Medicine Buddha mantra you
              can liberate numberless sentient beings from oceans of suffering and bring them to
              enlightenment. Therefore, again, reciting even one mantra or hearing just once the
              Medicine Buddha mantra is much more precious than the sky filled with gold, diamonds,
              wish-fulfilling jewels and zillions and zillions of dollars. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">So with full trust in Medicine Buddha you recite the mantra, knowing that Medicine
              Buddha will completely take care of your life, heal you. With full trust know how Medicine
              Buddha is always with you, in your heart, on your crown, in front of you. There is not one
              second that Medicine Buddha does not see you or have compassion towards you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">One student in Hong Kong does Medicine Buddha practice daily and she had a very heavy
              brain operation. During the operation she actually saw Medicine Buddha. She had a miracle
              recovery, as it was a very risky operation, but she surprised all and was able to recover and
              is still alive. So Medicine Buddha looked after her. </span></p>
              <p>
              </p><div class="page" title="Page 2">
              <div class="layoutArea">
              <div class="column">
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Also one person in Taiwan, he is not Buddhist, he could not move his body, could not get
              up and he didn’t have any helpers around him. He very badly needed to take his medicine
              and the medicine was far away in the bathroom. Next to him was a Medicine Buddha statue
              and when he turned his head he saw that the Medicine Buddha statue was holding his
              medicine. So he was able to take his medicine. Later he passed away and when he passed
              away he was able to put his hands in the mudra of prostration at his heart to show that he
              remembered Medicine Buddha; he passed away peacefully. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">So, if you can, do the Medicine Buddha practice. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Also a short way to practice is by reciting the refuge and bodhicitta prayer: “The purpose of
              my life is to free all beings from suffering and lead them to enlightenment, therefore, I am
              going to do the Medicine Buddha practice, especially to purify the negative karma,
              defilements, disease and spirit harm, as well as to do healing, so that I can have a healthy
              and long life to offer service and actualize the path.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Visualize Medicine Buddha on the crown of your head or in front of you [at the level of
              your forehead.] Nectar beams emit from Medicine Buddha and enter your own body and
              mind like water. It pushes away all the dirty things, like pouring water into a glass pipe; all
              the dirty water flows out the top. All the disease, spirit harm, negative karma and obstacles
              are completely purified. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">Also think that all sentient beings are in your heart on a moon disc, especially people who
              have cancer. Think that the nectar is purifying the four things (disease, spirit harm, negative
              karma and obstacles). All are purified, including your sickness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">If you are doing the practice for someone else, visualize is the same except that you
              visualize Medicine Buddha above their heads. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">At the end dedicate the merits: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">“Due to all the merits I have collected in the past and present and that I will collect in the
              future, may the wish-fulfilling, most precious, ultimate good heart bodhicitta, cherishing
              other sentient beings and letting go of the I, be generated in my heart and within the hearts
              of all living beings without delay of even a second. May the bodhicitta that is already
              generated be increased forever more. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">“Due to all the merits of the past, present and future that I have collected and that others
              have collected, however many sick sentient beings there are may they be instantly liberated
              from their sicknesses and may sentient beings never get sick. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';">“Due to the merits of the three times, which exist but are empty from their own side,
              collected by me and all others, may I, who exists but is empty from my own side, achieve
              enlightenment, which exists but is empty from its own side, and lead sentient beings, who
              exist but are empty from their own side, to that enlightenment, which exists but is empty
              from its own side, by myself alone, who exists but is empty from my own side.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'TimesNewRoman';"> </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; font-size: 12pt;">“I dedicate all the merits as the bodhisattvas Samantabhadra and Manjughosha realized and
              in the way that the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the three times dedicate and admire the
              most.</span></p>

              Khapa, which unify sutra and tantra in this life, and may those teachings flourish and
              spread in all directions.” </span></p>
