The Buddha suggested that we divide our money into various portions, such as for investment, for old age or rainy days, etc.<br><br>Also, dana does not mean giving to Buddha, it means practising generosity and charity wherever possible, not only limited to giving to the Sangha but also to any charitable causes and even helping the society.<br><br>Lastly, Buddhism discourages superstitions and greed.</div>
