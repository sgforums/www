              early 50s with only a couple of nephews she was in touch with, Jenny was being
              cared for at the Assisi hospice in Singapore where I was a volunteer.</span></p>

              lot about what might happen during the dying process and afterwards and it was
              then that she told me she wanted me to be with her as she died. I said I would
              do my very best to make this happen.</span></p>

              time, something in her shifted. I noticed this and asked her if she felt
              different and she replied that she felt that she was coming to accept what was
              happening.</span></p>

              but I remember that when she would have a sip of coffee, her eyes would light
              up at the taste and she would savour it with delight. And when she went into
              the garden, she would marvel at the sun and the wind — simple, present joys
              became very strong for her.</span></p>

              after leaving a lonely old patient who begged her to stay, returned after her
              rounds to find he had died alone. She couldn’t forget this and eventually set
              up this no-fuss, volunteer-run program that has been implemented in many large
              hospitals across the US.</span></p>

              in hospitals, volunteers are called to sit with dying people who are alone,
              estranged from their families or far away from loved ones when they are
              actively dying.</span></p>

              time an alone person is admitted to the hospital, the NODA volunteers become
              the family and visit them until they were actively dying and then sit in vigil
              during the last couple of days of their life — if that’s what they wanted.</span></p>

              took the first shift, setting up Jenny’s room with music and soft lights. Jenny
              was not conscious but I believe she knew I was there. I spoke to her and told
              her I was there to be with her as she had requested. I remember feeling nervous
              as I went into the room and initially I felt like I had to ‘do’ things, like
              read poems or inspiring verses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Gradually, I took some
              time to ground and centre myself and create an atmosphere of awareness and
              presence, as we had learnt in our training. Then, I just focused on really
              being with Jenny, with no distractions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>I was aware that this
              was not a normal time, that something big was happening. Jenny had had a fever
              and when I first sat with her, she was moaning a little. This was unsettling
              but it also seemed quite normal — I was struck by how OK everything was, even
              though it was also very sad. In some weird way, as humans, we know how to do
              this end of life thing. Her breathing became very shallow and there were long
              pauses between each breath. I remember at one point, I thought that perhaps she
              had breathed her last breath when suddenly she took a big inhale and I jumped in
              fright. I sort of laughed to myself and thought that Jenny was again teaching
              me, reminding me that this was not about me, it was about Jenny and I just
              tried to relax and be with whatever was happening.</span></p>

              only 90 minutes, very gently and softly while I was singing quietly to her. I
              couldn’t help but think that as usual, she didn’t want there to be a fuss.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>We had promised her
              that she would not be alone when she died, and I was so grateful that we could
              fulfil that promise.</span></p>

              they die is powerful but it is not frightening. Many people make this
              comparison, but dying is a bit like labouring to give birth. There are urgent
              bits and struggling bits and then at the end, it all goes quiet. When Jenny
              actually died, I hardly even realised, it was so soft, a tender sigh.</span></p>

              her nephew told me that her life had been quite hard and often lonely but that
              she had shared with him that she was amazed that in her last months of life,
              when things were really difficult, there was so much love and care in her life.</span></p>

              the NODA team at Assisi has accompanied more than 10 people during the last
              months of their lives and sat with them during their final hours. Many of the
              people we have accompanied lived hard, isolated, rough lives and I wish they could
              have been otherwise, but at least at the end part, they were loved with no
              expectations.</span></p>

              all over the world will adopt the NODA program in their own way so that we can

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>However, another part
              of me celebrates that perhaps this interest might be indicative of people
              wanting to face their mortality head on. I also like that death doulas are
              there to help people reclaim death as a natural part of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>In the past, most
              people died at home — it was just another of the momentous life events — but in
              the past 50 years, we’ve pushed it away out of sight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>One thing I do want to
              say is that it is sometimes easy to romanticise dying but it’s not romantic —
              death is messy, draining, demanding, challenging, funny, heartbreaking, boring
              — everything ... Death is often also really sad and a big loss, so I don’t
              really feel comfortable about making it a big celebration, unless of course it
              is!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>I’m also wary of the
              idea of having a “good death” — that kind of creates a weird sort of pressure —
              like the one that is given to mums when they are striving to have a natural
              birth at all costs — our death will be what it will be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>However, what I do
              think is great is that people are talking about end of life and their choices.
              This conversation is so crucial and helpful and will make the end of life much
              clearer at a time when things are so rarely clear. However, once again, I
              wonder about being too attached to a plan — I think death would chuckle wryly
              at that idea.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: inherit; word-wrap: break-word;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>To me, being with
              someone at the time of death is to become intimately exposed to not knowing —
              it asks us to be fully present and fully OK with whatever happens and not to
              impose a preconceived idea of what it should be like. To me, accompanying
              someone at the time of death is not really about doing anything, it’s about
              being able to hold and be there for whatever. We like to control everything in
              our lives but death does its own thing ... it’s still the biggest mystery in
              our lives.</span></p>

              — other people get depressed because they lose a loved one or suffer a terrible
              trauma — me, I thought I’d wrecked my face and down I went into the dark pit.
