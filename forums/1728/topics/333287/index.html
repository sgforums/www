              <p>First I would like to say that I admire you for your willingness to quit your job for a retreat.  As a buddhist, I would think that it is very important to go for a good retreat, esp. one which is probably going to be the last.  Moreover, everything in life is actually pre-destined.  Whether you can get a job in the future is already pre-determined.  How much you're going to earn, who you are going to meet etc have already been decided.</p>
              <p>However, as a working adult, I can understand your dilemma.  Also, we should try to make all sentient beings happy, esp. your parents, so don't make them worry too much also.  Follow your heart!</p>
              <p>Whatever your decision, after you've made it, leave any regrets behind.  We should always abide by the true Buddhist's way of non-abiding.</p>

              <p> I am sorry if it sound blunt .</p>
              <p>there is a friend of mine who encounter a staunch christian HR interviewer wasnt so pleased with the word "retreat"</p>
              <p>She feel that retreat = do nothing ,mean no marketable value in resume ,so my friend didnt clinch the dream job</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It boils back to how u see Buddhism .Many of our Parent keep scolding Buddha for misleading their children to go for 1 year or 2 year retreat .If u know what I mean</p>
              <p>This is singapore ,before you made decision ,understand if u go retreat , your parents is paying on your behalf .</p>
              <p>Many of my fren still havent get a proper job after 1 year since graduation ,then what is your grades to them when they also honours student ?</p>
              <p>retreat is best to go for 2 weeks and start the job hunt ...<br>if your heart is with Buddha , you dont need to go that far for a meditation retreat .</p>

              <p>Hi Isis,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice is to stay on with your present job now.  I have never seen such terrible fear in the market before, not even during the 1997 financial crisis.  The coming crisis will create a lot of instability therefore not only your current job is uncertain, your parent's jobs are equally in doubt.  Your parents will have a lot to cope so you are right that you should not add to their worries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to practice, my opinion is practice should start with right view of our pristine nature.  Try to spend quality hours penetrating deeply into the truth of the 5 aggregates, 18 Dhatus and Dependent Origination till you have non-conceptual experience of these teachings.  It is important to re-orientate our 'self' view with the Buddha's teachings.  It will not be obvious how and why these teachings lead to liberation until we are able to stop imputing the sense of onto our momentary experiences.  Do take it seriously and practice with utmost sincerity.   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With firmly established right view as the cause and conditions perpectually arising, all will fall in place so not to worry too much about missing opporutnities. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Laslty I am truly glad that Dharma has created such impact in you, continue the zeal and heart for dharma and you will not regret. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May you be enlightened of your empty pristine nature this life. :)</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The current situation is quite uncertain in the market, due many unforeseen circumstances of natural disaster, the milk issue, the oil, the financial collaps and more maybe popping up soon to come. I believe as a buddhist we should be more clear minded in making decision, each decision made will has different result. Indeed it is a rare opportunity to go for retreat, but prority is, you have to settle your own problems so that you will have a clearer mind to attend any retreat.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">So, I strongly encourage you to stay onto your job, need not necessary go for a long retreat at this moment,as our daily life is already a good practising ground. If possible find some short retreat, where you only has to take a couple days of leave as it will not affect your job. You made your own destiny, as destiny is not predetermind.</span> </p>

              <p>Hi isis,</p>
              <p>This financial crisis we'r experiencing tdy is not a normal one, worst scenario may not be just a recession or depression but who knows, it may triggers a third world war.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> </p>
              <p>But no matter what comes ( even if the earth explodes), we still have to live life normaly and meaningfully. For Buddha , He can leave his palace, family and wealth to pursue the ultimate enlightenment for the betterment of all sentient beings, but for many of us, I think we have to take one step at a time at our pace. We hv to keep reality in check.</p>
              <p>Yes, the ground may give way, death may come tomorrow; but till that day, we have obligations to fulfill now, not just to ourselves but to the ones around us. This is not sacrifice, but duties. Untill we can perform a greater duty, we should deliver the minor ones first.</p>
              <p>So if our short term objective hinders our long term objective, then maybe it should be postphone for the time being. Nothing regretable. Just æš‚æ—¶å› ç¼˜ä¸�å…·è¶³ã€‚</p>
              <p>But of cos only you yourself can decide which is of higher importance to you without compromising your other options in life.  </p>
              <p>Be happy and well.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>First I would like to say that I admire you for your willingness to quit your job for a retreat.  As a buddhist, I would think that it is very important to go for a good retreat, esp. one which is probably going to be the last.  <strong>Moreover, everything in life is actually pre-destined.  Whether you can get a job in the future is already pre-determined.  How much you're going to earn, who you are going to meet etc have already been decided.</strong></p>
              <p>However, as a working adult, I can understand your dilemma.  Also, we should try to make all sentient beings happy, esp. your parents, so don't make them worry too much also.  Follow your heart!</p>
              <p>Whatever your decision, after you've made it, leave any regrets behind.  We should always abide by the true Buddhist's way of non-abiding.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Karma does not necessarily mean past actions. It embraces both past and present deeds. Hence in one sense, we are the result of what we were; we will be the result of what we are. In another sense, it should be added, we are not totally the result of what we were; we will not absolutely be the result of what we are. The present is no doubt the offspring of the past and is the present of the future, but the present is not always a true index of either the past or the future; so complex is the working of Karma. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Karma does not necessarily mean past actions. It embraces both past and present deeds. Hence in one sense, we are the result of what we were; we will be the result of what we are. In another sense, it should be added, we are not totally the result of what we were; we will not absolutely be the result of what we are. The present is no doubt the offspring of the past and is the present of the future, but the present is not always a true index of either the past or the future; so complex is the working of Karma.</span></p>

              <p>According to æ‚Ÿé�“æ³•å¸ˆï¼Œ practice in the Saha world is characterized by extreme volatility (å¤§èµ·å¤§è�½ï¼‰ã€‚This is bcos practice requires great motivation and will power to overcome a lot of obstacles. For example, to join ä½›ä¸ƒ, you must take leave, have a good wife to be willing to let you go (perhaps take turn :-), good health etc. So naturally, you might have great advance during the retreat /  ä½›ä¸ƒ. However, when you are back to reality, you are constantly bombarded by unfavorable conditions (æ�¶ç¼˜) and soon fall back to the Saha world's of greed, anger and ignorance again. In Sukavathi, there is no æ�¶ç¼˜, so you will not fall back but it is also slower to make advance.</p>
              <p>Quote from Large Immeasurable Life Sutra (one day one night of pure practise in Saha world makes more advance than doing similar deed in Sukavathi for hundred years):</p>

              <p>For most of us, frequent retreat is important. If that is not possible, perhaps we can switch focus to the following two strategies first:</p>
              <p>- avoiding unfavorable conditions and get rid of all bad habits (e.g. going to disco, trading in stock market, shouting at kids) that can set you back greatly</p>
              <p>- make it a habit to praticse something good everyday e.g. donate to TWC2, Tzu Chi Foundation, distribute Buddhist VCDs, become vegetarian</p>
