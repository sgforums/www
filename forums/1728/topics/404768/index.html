              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>Why do we recite "Namo Amitabha Buddha?" It is because Amitabha Buddha has a great affinity with living beings in the ten directions. Before Amitabha Buddha realized Buddhahood, during his cultivation on the "cause ground," he was a Bhikshu named Dharma Treasury who made forty-eight vows. Among those vows was one that said, "I vow that after I realize Buddhahood, any living beings throughout the ten directions who recite my name will certainly realize Buddhahood. If they will not be able to realize Buddhahood, then I will not realize Buddhahood."<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>The power of Amitabha Buddha's vows is like a magnet; living beings of the ten directions are like iron filings. That is how he draws beings of the ten directions to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. What if they aren't attracted? Amitabha Buddha vowed that he himself wouldn't realize Buddhahood if they couldn't be! Therefore, all who recite the name of Amitabha Buddha have the opportunity to realize Buddhahood.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black;">The<span> </span><em>Amitabha
              Sutra</em><span> </span>belongs to the category
              of Sutras that the Buddha "spoke without request." Why was that Sutra
              spoken without request? No one understood this Dharma-door, and so no one could
              request the Buddha to speak it. Although the greatly wise Shariputra was an
              interlocutor in the assembly, even he didn't know how to ask about this
              Dharma-door. Probably the Buddha couldn't hold back any longer, so he told
              everyone about this most convenient, most direct, most satisfying, easiest, and
              most inexpensive Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name. If a person can
              recite Amitabha Buddha's name "whether for one day, two days, three, four,
              five days, six days, as long as seven days, with one mind unconfused, when this
              person approaches the end of life, before him will appear Amitabha Buddha and
              all the assembly of holy ones" to guide him. Although most people find it
              hard to believe this Dharma-door, it is the most direct and certain practice.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">The Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name is
              appropriate for those of all three faculties and beneficial for both the
              intelligent and the stupid. Whether you are stupid or wise, you can realize
              Buddhahood. When one is born in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">, where beings "endure none of the sufferings, but
              enjoy every bliss," one will be born transformationally from a lotus. We
              will not pass through the womb as in the human realm, but will enter a lotus
              flower, live in it for a while, and then realize Buddhahood.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: black;">Don't look lightly on the Dharma-door of reciting

              <p><strong><span style="color: black;"><br>Contemplate at All Times and Reflect Well</span></strong><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">There are four types of mindfulness of the Buddha:<span> </span><br> 1.<span><em> </em></span><em>Mindfulness of the
              Buddha through holding the name</em>. This involves reciting "Namo Amitabha
              Buddha" over and over.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">2.<span> </span><em>Mindfulness
              of the Buddha through contemplative reflection</em>. This means contemplating
              that:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: black;">Amitabha's
              body is the color of gold.<span> </span><br> The splendor of his hallmarks has no peer.<span> </span><br> The light of his brow shines 'round five </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Mount</span></em><em><span style="color: black;"> </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Sumerus</span></em><em><span style="color: black;">.<br> Wide as the seas are his eyes, pure and clear.<span> </span><br> Shining in his brilliance by transformation<span> </span><br> Are countless Bodhisattvas and infinite Buddhas.<span> </span><br> His forty-eight vows will be our liberation.<br> He enables all those in the nine lotus-stages to reach the farthest shore.</span></em><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p>This is mindfulness of the Buddha
              through contemplative reflection.<br> <br> 3.<span> </span><em>Mindfulness of the Buddha
              through contemplative visualization.<span> </span></em>This
              means reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha" while facing an image of that
              Buddha. One should recite the phrase very clearly, hear it very clearly, and
              keep it very clearly in mind.</p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">4.<span> </span><em>Mindfulness
              of the Buddha's Real Appearance.</em><span> </span>This
              is just Chan meditation. When we meditate, we investigate the question,
              "Who is reciting the Buddha's name?" We recite "Namo Amitabha
              Buddha" for two weeks, and then we try to find out who is reciting the
              Buddha's name. We have to find out "who" and not lose the "who."
              If we lose it, then we won't be able to get home. If we can't get home, we
              won't see Amitabha Buddha.<br><br>
              </span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black;">One with Proper Faith, Proper Vows, and Proper
              Practice</span></strong><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Faith, vows, and practice are the three
              prerequisites of the </span><span style="color: black;">Pure</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> Dharma-door. One who goes on a journey takes along some
              food and a little money. One who wishes to go to the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> needs faith, vows, and the practice of holding the
              Buddha's name.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Faith is the first prerequisite, for without it
              one will not have an affinity with Amitabha Buddha in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. You must have faith in yourself, faith in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">, as well as in cause and effect, noumenon and phenomenon.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">What does it mean to believe in oneself? It is to
              believe that you certainly have the qualifications necessary to be born in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. You should not take yourself lightly and say, "I
              have committed so many offenses, I can't be born there." Suppose you have
              created karma involving heavy offenses, well, now you have a good opportunity:
              you can "take your karma with you into rebirth." That means that regardless
              of the offenses you have committed in the past, you can still be reborn in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">, and that karma goes along with you. However, you need to
              know that the karma you can take is karma you have already created, not karma
              that you continue to create. Karma you have already created is the karma from
              previous lives. Karma you continue to create will ripen in the future. What you
              can carry is offenses that come from karma created in the past; what you cannot
              carry is offenses from karma you create now that will ripen in the future. No
              matter what you have ever done, not withstanding any kind of offenses, you can
              now change your faults and reform your conduct, stopping evil and becoming
              wholesome. Then you can take those previously-created offenses with you to the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. But continuing to create karma will keep you from being
              able to go.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Secondly, you must have faith in the Western Land
              of Ultimate Bliss which is hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands
              from here. Before he realized Buddhahood, Amitabha Buddha, as the Bhikshu
              Dharma Treasury, vowed to create the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> where living beings of the ten directions who vowed to be
              born there could gain rebirth by reciting his name. There is no need to do
              anything else; it is easy, simple, convenient, and interpenetrating--yet it
              doesn't cost a thing and doesn't waste energy. This Dharma-door can be
              considered the highest and most supreme, for if you just recite, "Namo
              Amitabha Buddha," you will be born in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">It is also necessary to believe in cause and
              effect. Believing in cause is to believe that in the past you have planted good
              roots that now enable you to believe in this Dharma-door. Without good roots,
              no one can encounter this Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name, or any
              other Dharma-door, for that matter. Because of the good roots you planted in
              the past, you can now encounter the </span><span style="color: black;">Pure</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> Dharma-door of faith, vows, and holding the name. But if
              you don't continue to nourish the good roots you planted, then you won't be
              able to reap the fruition of Bodhi in the future. That is why you must believe
              in cause and effect; believe that in the past you already planted causes for
              Bodhi and so in the future you will certainly reap the fruition of Bodhi. The
              principle is the same as planting a field: the seeds must be watered and
              nourished before they can grow.<span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Finally, one must have faith in phenomenon and
              noumenon. The specific phenomenon is this: Amitabha Buddha has a great affinity
              with us and will certainly guide us to Buddhahood. The noumenal principle is
              this: We know the great affinity exists because without it we would not have
              met the </span><span style="color: black;">Pure</span><span style="color: black;"> </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> Dharma-door. Amitabha Buddha is all living beings and all
              living beings are Amitabha Buddha. Amitabha Buddha became Amitabha Buddha by
              reciting the Buddha's name, and if we recite the Buddha's name, we, too, can
              become Amitabha Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">We should cultivate according to the phenomena and
              the noumenal principle. The<span> </span><em>Avatamsaka
              Sutra</em><span> </span>speaks of four Dharma
              Realms:</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">1. The Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Phenomena<br> 2. The Dharma Realm of Unobstructed Noumena<br> 3. The Dharma Realm of Noumena and Phenomena Unobstructed<span> </span><br> 4. The Dharma Realm of All Phenomena Unobstructed</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Considering the four Dharma Realms, and speaking
              from the standpoint of our self-nature, we and Amitabha Buddha are united in
              one, and therefore we have the qualifications to realize Buddhahood.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">&lt; Amitabha Buddha is the Amitabha Buddha within
              the minds of all living beings, and living beings are the living beings within
              the mind of Amitabha Buddha. Due to this interconnection, there are phenomena
              and the noumenon. However, you must believe in this principle and energetically
              practice it by reciting the Buddha's name; you cannot get lazy. Your recitation
              of the Buddha's name should increase day by day, not decrease.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Having discussed faith, we will now discuss vows.
              What is a vow? When you want something, when your thoughts tend toward a
              certain thing, your mind has a wish, then you make a vow. In Buddhism there are
              four vast vows:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: black;">I vow to
              save the limitless living beings.<br> I vow to cut off the inexhaustible afflictions.<br> I vow to study the immeasurable Dharma-doors.<br> I vow to realize the supreme </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Buddha Way</span></em><em><span style="color: black;">.</span></em><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the past, present,
              and future practiced the Bodhisattva conduct and attained Buddhahood by relying
              on these four great vows.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">But in order to make vows you must have faith.
              First, believe there is a </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">; secondly, have faith in Amitabha Buddha; thirdly, believe
              that you and Amitabha Buddha have a great affinity, and that you can certainly
              be born in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate
                Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. With
              faith in these three things, you may then make the vow, "I desire to be
              born in Amitabha's country." There is a saying,</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: black;">"I
              want to be born in the </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Western</span></em><em><span style="color: black;"> </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Pure</span></em><em><span style="color: black;"> </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Land</span></em><em><span style="color: black;">."</span></em><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">I want to be born there. Nobody's forcing me to
              go; nobody's dragging me there. Although Amitabha Buddha has come to guide me,
              I'm going as a volunteer because I want to be close to him. I want to be born
              in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate
                Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> and to see
              Amitabha Buddha when my lotus flower opens. I want to meet the Buddha and hear
              the Dharma." These are the vows you need.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Then you must practice. How? Recite the Buddha's
              name, saying "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amitabha Buddha..." as if
              you were trying to save your head from the executioner, running ahead to keep
              your head.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Faith, vows, and practice are the travel expenses
              for rebirth in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate
                Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. They are
              your ticket.</span></p>

              </p><p><strong><span style="color: black;">The Song of Mindfulness of the Buddha, the
              Dharma, and the Sangha</span></strong><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">As we recite "Namo Amitabha Buddha" we
              each create and adorn our own </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. We each accomplish our own </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> which is certainly not hundreds of thousands of millions
              of Buddhalands from here. Now, the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> really is hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands
              away; and yet it doesn't go beyond the very thought we are having right now.
              Since it's right in our hearts, we say it's not hundreds of thousands of
              millions of Buddhalands from here. The </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> is the original true heart, the true mind, of every one of
              us. If you obtain this heart, you will be born in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. If you don't understand your own original true heart, you
              will not. Amitabha Buddha and living beings are not distinct--that's why I say
              the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate
                Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> is not so
              far away. In one thought, turn the light within. Know that originally you are
              the Buddha, and your original Buddhahood is just the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">For this reason, you should cast out your defiled
              thoughts, your lustful desires, your confusion, jealousy, contrariness,
              selfishness and plots for personal gain. Be like the Bodhisattvas who benefit
              everyone and enlighten all beings. Just that is the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. Don't you agree that the absence of confusion and false
              thoughts is the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate
                Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">? If it
              isn't, what is? Don't seek outside.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Good and Wise Advisors, you are all ones of great
              wisdom and great intelligence. You are all more clever than I, and in the future
              you will explain the Dharma better than I do. But now, because you don't know
              Chinese, I am introducing you to this old-fashioned tradition. In the future
              you'll transform it and make it unspeakably wonderful.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Let me sing you a song:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: black;">Amita, the Great Sage and Master,<br> Serene, subtle, wonderful beyond all others...</span></em><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: black;">Pools of
              seven gems,<br> Flowers of four colors and<span> </span><br> waves of shimmering gold.</span></em><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">It mentions the four shades of lotus blossoms. Who
              is the great sage and master?<span> </span><em>Amitabha
              Buddha is. Amita, the Great Sage and Master, serene, subtle, wonderful beyond
              all others.</em><span> </span>He is upright,
              adorned and very wonderful. There is no image as fine as that of Amitabha
              Buddha. Within the<span> </span><em>Pools of
              seven gems are flowers of four colors.</em><span> </span>Not
              only are the pools filled with seven jewels, the water forms<span> </span><em>waves of shimmering gold.<br><br></em></span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: black;">Wondrous Green, Yellow, Red, and White Lotus
              Flowers</span></strong><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">The response from our reciting "Namo Amitabha
              Buddha" here where we are is that in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;"> a lotus forms in the pools of the seven jewels, filled
              with the waters of eight meritorious virtues. The more we recite the bigger it
              grows, but it doesn't open. When we die, our intrinsic nature is born in that
              lotus in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate
                Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">. There are
              nine grades of lotuses, and how high a grade of lotus we are born in is
              determined by how much we recited the Buddha's name. Reciting more causes our
              lotus to grow bigger; fewer recitations result in a small lotus. "Well,
              suppose I don't recite at all?" If we stop reciting altogether, our lotus
              will wither and die. The grade of lotus depends on our own effort in reciting
              the Buddha's name.<br><br><br>
              </span></p><p><strong><span style="color: black;">The Blowing Wind and the Calm Waters Proclaim
              the Mahayana</span></strong><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">The pure heart is like the moon in water. The mind
              in samadhi is like a cloudless sky.If you can recite so completely that you
              enter the Buddha-recitation samadhi, then hearing the wind, it's "Namo
              Amitabha Buddha," and hearing the rain, it's "Namo Amitabha
              Buddha." Every sound you hear recites the Buddha's name.<span> </span><em>The water flows, the wind blows,
              proclaiming the Mahayana...</em>The Chinese poet Su Dongpo said:<span><em> </em></span><em>Of the colors of the
              mountain, none is not the vast, long tongue. Of the sounds of the streams, all
              are the clear, pure sound.<span> </span></em>All
              the mountain's colors are the Buddha's long tongue proclaiming the wonderful
              Dharma. This is the attainment of the Buddha-recitation samadhi. So I wrote
              this verse:</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: black;">If you
              recite the Buddha's name,reciting without cease,<br> The mouth recites "Amita"and makes things of a piece.<br> Scattered thoughts do not arise, samadhi you attain.<br> For rebirth in the </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Pure</span></em><em><span style="color: black;"> </span></em><em><span style="color: black;">Land</span></em><em><span style="color: black;">, your hope is not in vain.<br> If all day you detest the suffering Saha's pain,<br> Make rebirth in Ultimate Bliss your mind's essential aim.<br> Cut off the red dust thoughts within your mind.<br> Put down impure reflections, and pure thoughts you will find.</span></em><span style="color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Recite the Buddha's name from morning to night and
              your confused thoughts will not arise. You will naturally attain the
              Buddha-recitation samadhi and be reborn in the </span><span style="color: black;">Land</span><span style="color: black;"> of </span><span style="color: black;">Ultimate Bliss</span><span style="color: black;">, according to your will. You know that the Saha world is
              full of pain and suffering; so cut off worldly pleasures and have no thoughts
              of sexual desire, craving, or struggling for fame and profit. Put down all
              worldly concerns and view them as false. Seek rebirth, ultimate bliss; this
              thought of rebirth is extremely important.This verse clearly explains the
              principles of reciting the Buddha's name, and if you carefully savor its
              flavor, you'll find it very helpful.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>One Mind Unconfused Is Samadhi </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Reciting the Buddha's name every day in a recitation session, we are planting the seeds of Buddhahood. Each recitation sows a seed; ten recitations sow ten seeds. If you recite a million times a day, you plant that many seeds, and one day they will sprout. Just recite; don't worry about having a scattered mind. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>When the water-clearing pearl is tossed in muddy water, <br>the muddy water becomes clear. <br>When the Buddha's name enters a confused mind, <br>the confused mind attains to the Buddha.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Reciting the Buddha's name is like throwing a pearl into muddy water so that the muddy water becomes clear. This clear-water pearl can purify even the filthiest water. Recitation of the Buddha's name is just like this pearl. Who can count the false thoughts which fill our minds and succeed one another endlessly like waves on the sea? When the Buddha's name enters a confused mind, the confused mind becomes the Buddha. Recite the name once and there is one Buddha in your mind; recite it ten times and there are ten Buddhas; recite it a hundred times and there are a hundred Buddhas. The more you recite, the more Buddhas there are. Say, "Namo Amitabha Buddha," and there's a Buddha-thought in your mind. When you are mindful of the Buddha, the Buddha is mindful of you. It's like communication by radio. You recite here, and it's received there. There is that kind of response. When you recite the Buddha's name, you don't have any other false thoughts, so your inherent nature has inconceivable merit and virtue.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>When All Thoughts Are Empty, One Enters the Lotus Land</strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Our restless mind is constantly looking for something to keep it busy. To set it at ease, we give it the task of reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha." This is also a form of Dhyana meditation. You don't have to sit in lotus posture with your eyes closed, like Dhyana Master Linzi, to investigate Dhyana. You can also meditate with your eyes open. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 12pt; text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>Walking is Dhyana, sitting is Dhyana. <br>In speech or silence, movement or stillness, <br>One is always at peace. </em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One can investigate Dhyana whether moving or still, awake or asleep. An ancient saying goes: </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>With Dhyana and Pure Land, one is like a tiger with horns, <br>A teacher of humans in this life, a Patriarch or Buddha in the next. <br>With Dhyana but not Pure Land, nine out of ten go astray. <br>With Pure Land but not Dhyana, ten thousand cultivate and<br>ten thousand go.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Pure Land Dharma-door is the easiest method of practice. All the great Bodhisattvas have praised it. Manjushri Bodhisattva praises it, and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, in the "Conduct and Vows of Universal Worthy" chapter of the Flower Adornment Sutra, exhorts all living beings to seek rebirth in the Pure Land. He himself recites the Buddha's name and seeks rebirth as well. Guanshiyin Bodhisattva is also mindful of the Buddha, and in the Shurangama Sutra, Great Strength Bodhisattva praises this Dharma-door of reciting the Buddha's name and describes how he obtained perfect penetration by means of it. Thus, all the great Bodhisattvas of the past have praised and cultivated the Pure Land Dharma-door.The patriarchs of the past all first investigated Dhyana, became enlightened, and then exclusively recited the Buddha's name. There were those who, every time they recited the Buddha's name, would have a transformation Buddha come out of their mouths. Dhyana Master Yong Mingshou was that way. More recently, Elder Master Yinguang exclusively advocated mindfulness of the Buddha and Elder Master Hsu Yun also advocated reciting the Buddha's name. It is the easiest, most convenient, and most perfect Dharma-door, praised by all Buddhas of the ten directions. Doesn't the Amitabha Sutra describe how the Buddhas of the six directions each bring forth a vast and long tongue covering the three thousand great thousand worlds to praise this Dharma-door? This is the best practice, and everyone should take it up especially in the Dharma-ending Age. However, since we are upholding the Proper Dharma Age here, if you choose not to recite the Buddha's name, then you should investigate Dhyana (meditate) as if your lives depended on it! Don't fear suffering!<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Suddenly Awakening to Non-production, One Sees the Buddha </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the Dharma-ending Age, recitation of the Buddha's name is a most important Dharma-door. Don't take it lightly. Every time Dhyana Master Yong Mingshou, the Sixth Patriarch of the Pure Land School, recited the Buddha's name, a transformation Buddha came out of his mouth. Those with the Five Eyes and Six Spiritual Penetrations could see it. When you recite the Buddha's name, you emit a light which frightens all weird creatures and strange ghosts away. They run far, far away and leave you alone. So the merit and virtue of holding the Buddha's name is inconceivable.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Attaining Wonderful Enlightenment Is Our Personal Responsibility </strong></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Don't see the Buddha-recitation as true, and don't regard it as false. If you practice skillfully, it becomes true. If you practice poorly, it turns into something false. All Dharma-doors are like this. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>When deviant people practice proper methods,<br>Proper methods become deviant.<br>When proper people practice deviant methods,<br>Deviant methods turn proper. </em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Proper and deviant depend on the person.When we bow to the Buddha, we should make this contemplation: "My body pervades limitless Buddha lands as I bow before each Buddha in each Buddha land." Contemplate your body as expanding to fill the entire Dharma Realm. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>If people wish to understand<br>All Buddhas of the past, present, and future,<br>They should contemplate the nature of the Dharma Realm:<br>Everything is made from mind alone.<br></em><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>May All Virtuous Ones Work Hard Together </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Everyone can practice the Buddha-recitation Dharma-door. All you have to do is recite "Namo Amitabha Buddha," and at the end of your life you will be born in a lotus in the Land of Ultimate Bliss, where you will hear Amitabha Buddha speak Dharma and eventually attain Buddhahood. "Death is still far off," you say, "why should we recite the Buddha's name now?" You must develop your skill in reciting right now, so that you will remember to recite at the time of death. Just as a tree must grow for many years before it becomes a hundred feet tall, you must begin practicing reciting the Buddha's name now so that when it comes time to die, you will be able to recite single-mindedly, without sickness, greed, hatred, stupidity, or confusion, and Amitabha Buddha will come to guide you. If you don't recite now, you won't remember to when your body starts to fall apart at the time of death, unless a Good and Wise Advisor is there to remind you and help you. Therefore, it's important to recite the Buddha's name every day and enter the Buddha-recitation samadhi, so that reciting will come naturally at the time of death and you won't forget. Or if you are unable to recite Namo Amitabha Buddha, Amitabha Buddha won't forget you and so he will come riding the ship of his great vows, receive you onto a golden dais, and take you to the Land of Ultimate Bliss. He won't forget about you.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>You are mindful of the Buddha, <br>I am mindful of the Buddha;<br>Why are we mindful of the Buddha? </em></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em>To end birth and death, to transform the Saha,<br>So that everywhere is ultimate bliss, everywhere Amitabha.<br>With no you and no me, what is there?<br>In still contemplation, the myriad things are understood.<br>Cut off afflictions, smash through ignorance;<br>Leap out of the Triple Realm's great river of love.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Foolish people recite the Buddha's name, hoping the Buddha will give them some good food to eat. Some recite, "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amitabha Buddha, please give us some warmer weather!" Other people recite hoping to obtain good luck and happiness, or to escape problems and suffering. The primary purpose of reciting the Buddha's name is to end birth and death, that is, to have control over our own births and deaths. If we want to live, we can recite Amitabha Buddha's name day after day and live forever. If we want to die, then we recite "Namo Amitabha Buddha" and the Buddha will come to receive us. We will be free of illness, greed, and delusion, as if entering samadhi, and we will be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss with no problem at all. Secondly, if we recite the Buddha's name, we can transform the Saha world itself into the Land of Ultimate Bliss, where beings endure none of the sufferings and enjoy every happiness.Recite to the point that you, me, the Buddha, and everything else disappears. "That's too dangerous! If everything is gone, won't we all be finished?" you say. It's only to be feared that you won't be finished. If you are truly "finished," then you are free. At that time, you will understand the myriad phenomena of the world, such as why crows are black and cranes are white, why pines are straight and brambles are twisted. Since you understand everything, afflictions are cut off, ignorance is smashed, and you leap out of the great river of love that courses through the Desire, Form, and Formless Realms. In the Triple Realm, we are so deluded by love, loving each other until we die, and then coming back for another round, never waking up enough to escape. Now, however, we want to leap out of the river of love. "I don't want to," someone says. Then you can undergo a few more rounds of birth and death. With each round, you sink lower and lower, until you sink to the very bottom of the river of love! Drowning represents your soul being split into many small creatures, such as mosquitoes and ants.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In this world, nothing is fixed before it happens. The future can always be changed. For example, before we recited "Namo Amitabha Buddha," we didn't have the qualifications to be reborn in the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Once we recite, we become qualified. Even if originally it would have been difficult for you to be reborn in the West, once you recite it becomes possible. On the other hand, even if you could be reborn in the West with a single recitation, if you don't recite once, you won't get there. So nothing is fixed. The Vajra Sutra says, "There are no fixed dharmas. This is called Anuttarasamyaksambodhi." That is the method for attaining unsurpassed, proper and equal, right enlightenment. We should advance courageously, undaunted by suffering, difficulty, cold, and hunger, until we arrive at the Land of Ultimate Bliss. Reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha" is what really counts. In reciting, the most important thing is to end birth and death.</span></p>
