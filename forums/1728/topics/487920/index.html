              <p><em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">“Some people call me an idiot, but I know who I am. I am The
              Killer.”</span></em><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><br> – Jerry Lee Lewis</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Last weekend I watched all six episodes of <em>The Jinx</em>,
              HBO’s documentary on millionaire real estate heir Robert Durst. No doubt,
              you’ve heard about this guy in recent days. He is a suspect in the 1982
              disappearance of his wife, Kathleen; in 2003, he was acquitted of murder
              charges in Texas, despite that he admitted dismembering the victim; and
              Saturday in New Orleans he was arrested in connection with the 2000
              execution-style murder of his friend Susan Berman here in Los Angeles. It’s an
              engrossing story, and in a warped sort of way, Durst is a highly interesting
              person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">What is it about killers that fascinates us so?
              Macbeth, Jack the Ripper, Lizzie Borden, Charles Manson, Hannibal Lecter, and
              my all-time favorite, Dexter Morgan – fictional or real, we love ‘em. Can’t get
              enough of their stories. Perhaps it is because they commit the foulest of all
              deeds, the taking of life. Whatever it may be, I am not going to try to analyze
              it here. Instead, I would like to recount for you briefly the story of the
              Buddha and a murderer named Angulimala.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The story of Angulimala (“finger garland,” or
              “necklace of fingers”) comes from the early sutras. Angulimala’s father was the
              Brahmin minister to the king of Kosala. The story goes that when Angulimala was
              born, a “constellation of thieves” appeared in the sky, prophesying he would
              become a robber. And as it often happens in tales like this, the prophesy was
              fulfilled, in a manner of speaking.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Angulimala was sent to study in Taxila, in present day
              Pakistan, where one of the earliest universities in the world existed. He
              became the student of a Brahmin teacher and he excelled at his studies. Other
              students resented Angulimala’s brilliance and they made up stories that caused
              the teacher to believe Angulimala was evil. The teacher demanded that
              Angulimala provide him with a gift before he would be allowed to “graduate.”
              The gift the teacher requested was 1,000 fingers, each taken from a different
              victim. The teacher figured that that Angulimala would get himself killed
              during the course of collecting the fingers and thus he would be rid of this
              evil student.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Evidently, Angulimala had no problem accepting this
              grisly assignment. He became a highwayman, hiding in the forest and robbing
              travelers of their fingers. Unfortunately, the travelers died as a result of
              these holdups.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The people in the area asked the king of Kosala to
              capture Angulimala. Angulimala’s mother went out to find him and warn him that
              the king had vowed to hunt him down. The Buddha set out to find Angulimala,
              too. Buddha had divined that Angulimala had collected 999 fingers and needed
              only one more.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">When Angulimala saw the Buddha enter the forest, he
              rushed out to murder him and take his 1000th finger. He took out his sword,
              raised it and chased after the Buddha but could not catch him even though the
              Buddha was walking at a slow pace. Eventually, Angulimala became wore out and
              shouted for the Buddha to stop. Buddha turned and calmly said, “Angulimala, I
              have stopped for all time, forsaking violence; but you have not stopped, you
              have no restraint towards living beings; that is why I have stopped and you
              have not.” So moved was Angulimala by the words the Buddha spoke to him that he
              immediately renounced his murderous ways and became a bhikkhu.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The story is about the transformative power of
              compassion as well as the redemptive power of the Buddha’s teachings.
              Transformation is always possible. Any person, regardless of how many negative
              acts they have committed, can change and live a more positive life. Compassion
              is more powerful than punishment. Angulimala could have been captured,
              imprisoned or executed. Instead, he changed and thus was able to benefit far
              more beings than those he previously harmed. If you accept the doctrine of
              karma, there is also the notion that he was able to change his karma and
              improve his circumstance in future lives, so he would not come back to kill
              again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Most importantly, we should always remember that every
              life matters. There is an old Buddhist saying that even a murderer loves his
              mother, meaning that every person, no matter how wretched and depraved, has
              some good in him or her somewhere. Even Charles Manson is entitled to the basic
              dignity of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">It’s a safe bet that most people who know Robert Durst
              or know about him believe he is guilty of at least three murders. Whether he is
              or not, it doesn’t alter the fact that even Robert Durst has a Buddha-nature.</span></p>

By Pema Chodron<br><br>Don’t impose the wrong notion of what harmony is, what compassion is, what patience is, <br><br>what generosity is. Don’t misinterpret what these things really are. There is compassion <br><br>and there is idiot compassion; there is patience and there is idiot patience; there is <br><br>generosity and there is idiot generosity.<br><br>For example, trying to smooth everything out to avoid confrontation, not to rock the <br><br>boat, is not what’s meant by compassion or patience. It’s what is meant by control. Then <br><br>you are not trying to step into unknown territory, to find yourself more naked with less <br><br>protection and therefore more in contact with reality. Instead, you use the idiot forms <br><br>of compassion and so forth just to get ground.<br><br>When you open the door and invite in all sentient beings as your guests, you have to drop <br><br>your agenda. Many different people come in. Just when you think you have a little scheme <br><br>that is going to work, it doesn’t work. It was very beneficial to Juan, but when you <br><br>tried it on Mortimer, he looked at you as if you were crazy, and when you try it on <br><br>Juanita, she gets insulted.<br><br>Coming up with a formula won’t work. If you invite all sentient beings as your guests <br><br>while just wanting harmony, sooner or later you’ll find that one of your guests is <br><br>behaving badly and that just sitting there cheerfully doing your tonglen and trying to <br><br>cultivate harmony doesn’t work.<br><br>(For an introduction to the practice of tonglen, see: All-Embracing Compassion-The <br><br>Heart-Practice of Tonglen)<br><br>So you sit there and you say, “Okay, now I’m going to make friends with the fact that I <br><br>am hurting and afraid, and this is really awful.” But you are just trying to avoid <br><br>conflict here; you just don’t want to make things worse. Then all the guests are <br><br>misbehaving; you work hard all day and they just sit around, smoking cigarettes, drinking <br><br>beer, eating your food, and then beating you up. You think you’re being a warrior and a <br><br>Bodhisattva by doing nothing and saying nothing, but what you’re being is a coward. <br><br>You’re just afraid of making the situation worse. Finally they kick you out of your house <br><br>and you’re sitting on the sidewalk. Somebody walks by and says, “What are you doing <br><br>sitting out here?” You answer, “I am practicing patience and compassion.” That’s missing <br><br>the point.<br><br>Even though you’ve dropped your agenda, even though you are trying to work WITH <br><br>situations instead of struggling AGAINST them, nevertheless you may have to say, “You can <br><br>stay here tonight, but tomorrow you’re going, and if you don’t get out of here, I am <br><br>calling the police.” You don’t really know what’s going to benefit somebody, but it <br><br>doesn’t benefit anybody to allow someone to beat you up, eat all your food, and put you <br><br>out on the street.<br><br>So “Don’t misinterpret” really gets at the notion of the big squeeze. It’s saying that <br><br>you don’t know what’s going to help, but you need to speak and act with clarity and <br><br>decisiveness. Clarity and decisiveness come from the willingness to slow down, to listen <br><br>to and look at what’s happening. They come from opening your heart and not running away. <br><br>Then the action and the speech are in accord with what needs to be done, for you and for <br><br>the other person.<br><br>We make a lot of mistakes. If you ask people whom you consider to be wise and courageous <br><br>about their lives, you may find that they have hurt a lot of people and made a lot of <br><br>mistakes, but that they used those occasions as opportunities to humble themselves and <br><br>open their hearts. We don’t get wise by staying in a room with all the doors and windows <br><br>closed.</p></div>
