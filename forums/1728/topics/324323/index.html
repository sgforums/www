              <h1>WAKING UP NOW: The Simplicity of What Is</h1>
              <p><em>by Joan Tollifson </em></p>
              <p>What
              is life all about? Does it mean anything? Where are we looking for
              happiness or liberation? Do we have free will? What is enlightenment
              and how can I get it? Can anything be done to free ourselves from
              depression, anxiety, compulsive behavior, wars, holocausts, prejudices?
              What is spiritual (and what isn't)? What happens when we die?<br> <br> The thinking mind wants to find answers to questions. When you're
              trying to find out which bus to take or how to build a house, this
              ability to find answers is a useful function. But the thinking mind
              doesn't know when to stop thinking or when thinking is useful and when
              it isn't. And so, as we grow up, we live more and more in a conceptual
              world trying to think our way to happiness. We lose touch with the
              immediacy and wonder we had as children.<br> <br> When I was a little girl, my mother used to give me a pail of water and
              a paintbrush so that I could paint on the sidewalk. I'd paint these
              paintings on the sidewalk with water, and they would disappear in a
              matter of minutes, but that didn't matter because what I was enjoying
              was the sheer joy of doing it. It needed no reward, no praise, no
              permanence. It was complete in itself.<br> <br> And then at another point in my life, I was an art student, and I can
              remember seriously questioning whether it was worth painting at all if
              I weren't Leonardo or Picasso, if I were less than perfect. That sense
              of playfulness and curiosity that children have so naturally, enjoying
              the simplicity of being, gets overshadowed by this attempt to make
              something out of me, to make "me" into a successful me.<br> <br> Very often when we come to spirituality, even when it's supposedly all
              about waking up from this story of me, it morphs into it's own new
              version of this same story, focused now on how successfully I'm waking
              up, how well I'm meditating, whether I'm enlightened or not. Oddly
              enough, this me that we're so concerned about may be nothing more than
              a kind of mirage or mental image, the central character in a movie
              story generated by thought and imagination, nothing real at all.<br> <br> How can we find out? Is it possible to wake up from this mental mirage,
              this entrancement in thought? What is it that would wake up? Is it
              "me"? Or is it something else?<br> <br> Again, the thinking mind looks immediately for answers. We seek out
              authorities and adopt their views. We cling to ideas and explanations,
              and seek bigger and better experiences.<br> <br> Being awake is not about having the answers or having an experience. It
              has nothing to do with belief, but is rather the absence (or
              transparency, or seeing through) of belief. Waking up does not happen
              in the past or the future; it is always only now. Liberation or
              enlightenment is not something you find or acquire like a new car. It
              is not some dazzling or exotic experience like being permanently high
              on ecstasy or LSD. Liberation is seeing through the ubiquitous
              fabrications and mirages that conceptual thought creates and waking up
              to what actually <em>is</em>, right here, right now.<br> <br> The secret of life and liberation is hidden right in front of our eyes
              in plain view. It is right here showing up as breakfast dishes,
              laundry, sunlight on leaves, the barking of a dog, sound of traffic or
              rain, the humming of the computer, the taste of tea, the shapes of
              these words, and the awareness being and beholding it all. And only
              when we describe all of this in words does it seem as if "awareness" is
              one thing and "the taste of tea" is something else. The non-conceptual
              actuality of this breathing-hearing-seeing-being is undivided, without
              center or periphery. No inside, no outside. No subject, no object.
              Simply <em>this</em>, just as it is.<br> <br> And then perhaps a thought: "There must be more to life than this," or
              "What is the meaning of it all?" or "What about final enlightenment?"
              or "Isn't this all just the phenomenal manifestation, and isn't that an
              illusion?" Thought creates imaginary problems and tries to solve them.
              The complex human brain has an astonishing ability to conceptualize,
              imagine, remember, project, and think about things that have no actual
              reality. And even these thoughts are nothing but a momentary dream-like
              shape, appearance or expression of the One, undivided, boundless Whole.<br> <br> Thought labels, categorizes, evaluates, and reifies the ever-changing
              perceptions that appear. Conceptual thought creates the hypnotic,
              mirage-like illusion of solid, persisting, independent <em>things</em> (including "me" and "you") -- the illusion of duality and separation.
              Thought imagines "me" as a separate character on a journey through
              time. It conjures up goals and projects stories of success and failure.
              It even creates the image of "me" as a serious spiritual person
              dedicated to getting rid of the "me." But without thinking, where is
              the "me"? What am I, really?<br> <br> Is it possible that
              the peace and well-being we seek (that longing at the root of all our
              more superficial desires), cannot be found or satisfied by answers or
              attainments or experiences of any kind? Is it possible that the very
              search for it "out there" is precisely what prevents us from noticing
              that what we are seeking is the very essence of here and now?<br> <br> And what is that?<br> <br> It is nothing you can take hold of conceptually, and it's not any <em>particular</em> experience (as opposed to any other experience). It is the awaring
              presence, the beingness, the IS-ness of this moment -- this that is
              undeniably present beyond all doubt, requiring no proof or belief,
              impossible to deny -- before and after and even during all the grasping
              and searching and experience-mongering. The words (presence, beingness,
              awareness, IS-ness) are only pointers. What they point to is nothing
              you can get hold of as an object. What is, is thorough-going flux, and
              yet it is always right here, right now. This awaring presence (or
              emptiness, or no-<em>thing</em>-ness) is pure subjectivity, your true nature. This is all there really is. The grasping and searching and thinking <em>seems</em> to destroy the open spaciousness of presence-awareness, but can anything <em>really</em> destroy awareness, or the present moment, or beingness? Doesn't <em>everything</em> appear here and now, in awareness? And doesn't everything appear altogether at once as one diverse but seamless whole?<br> <br> Conceptual thought (apparently) divides it up. The division and
              separation are never really there, of course. They exist only in
              thought and imagination, but if that thought isn't seen through, if it
              is believed and taken seriously, then the result is suffering. Zen and
              Advaita are all about waking up from this entrancement and suffering.
              But it isn't "you" who wakes up and then becomes "an awakened person."
              That is delusion. The very notion that there is someone who needs to
              wake up from delusion is part of the delusion! The problem of bondage
              only exists in the thought-created movie world of imagination. The
              whole problem is a kind of mirage. What's real is never absent.<br> <br> No words can ever capture the actuality of this one eternal present
              moment. It can be talked about and pointed to in various different
              ways, but anything we say about actuality is never actuality itself. We
              may nod in agreement upon hearing that; nevertheless, we habitually
              tend to mistake the map for the territory, the concept for the actual.
              We then get into endless debates and confusion over imaginary dilemmas
              such as whether there is or isn't free will, or whether any kind of
              spiritual practice is worth doing or not, or whether the world is real
              and deserving of our attention or only a dream-like illusion that is
              best ignored. This mind-spinning goes in circles leading nowhere.
              Reality can't ever be captured in concepts (like free will or no free
              will, self or no self, this or that). Whatever you say is never quite
              right. No word or concept is ever complete enough. If you say that you
              can't learn to ride a bicycle because there's no you to do it, or no
              free will, you'll be foolishly disempowering yourself. And yet, if you
              look carefully at who or what is riding the bicycle or "choosing" to do
              so, you won't find anything or anybody, nor can you really explain how
              exactly "you" do this bicycle riding.<br> <br> We can argue endlessly over who rides, and whether or not they can
              freely choose to do it, or whether instruction and training is
              necessary or only a hindrance, and we can discuss the mechanics of
              bicycles and bicycle riding, or tell stories about legendary riders of
              the past, but finally, no amount of description or prescription will
              tell you how to ride a bicycle or how it is to be riding one. Talking
              about it, reading about it, watching others do it, or debating about
              who does it best, is not the same as simply doing it. Spiritual
              awakening isn't quite the same thing as riding a bicycle, because
              instead of being a particular something you do, so-called spiritual
              awakening is more like the recognition that "it" is doing "you," and
              that <em>everything</em> is it, and that "it" is actually it-less-ness, and that there is no way in or out of this boundless "it-less-ness" because<em> that</em> is all there is, and you are that. But as in bicycle riding, it's the
              actuality that matters, the territory itself and not the map.
              Discussing awakening, thinking about it, or seeking it as a future
              event are all map-events. But awakening is in the territory itself, the
              actuality. And the actuality is absolutely simple and immediate and
              unavoidable.<br> <br> Right now, simply listen to the
              sounds that are occurring. Traffic sounds, honking horn, bird cheeping,
              lawn mower, snow blower, rain falling, wind, rustling leaves, dog
              barking, vacuum cleaner, children's voices, boom box, siren, train
              whistle, whatever it is. Listen to the sounds as pure sound, in the
              same way you might listen to music. If there is no sound at all where
              you are, listen to the silence. Feel the breathing, the sensations of
              the body, the heart beating, the tightness in the chest, whatever is
              felt. Feel all of this as pure sensation, without labels or judgments,
              without resistance, without trying to correct or improve or enhance it
              in any way. See all the colors and shapes and movements around you in
              the same way you might enjoy an abstract painting. Notice that
              everything is constantly changing, and yet, it all happens here and
              now. Here is always here. It's always now. This "now" can't be pinned
              down, nor can it be avoided. It's always right here, seamlessly
              present. Here and Now is obvious, unavoidable and undeniable.<br> <br> What <em>is</em> here and now?<br> <br> Notice what happens when this question is asked. Does the thinking mind
              instantly kick in looking for the answer? Does thought begin searching
              the spiritual (or scientific, or psychological) files? "This is all
              Consciousness," we might think. Or, "This is pure awareness," or "This
              is brain activity," or "This is my living room," or "This is text on a
              web site," or "This is Intelligence Energy vibrating into different
              patterns," or "This is a dream," or "This is the phenomenal
              manifestation and I am pure neumonom."<br> <br> Can it be seen right now that these are all thoughts? They are
              concepts, ideas, explanations, words, labels, beliefs. They may have
              their usefulness, and they may be relatively more or less accurate as
              pointers or maps, but notice right now that they are all <em>words</em>. They are not the <em>actuality</em> (the <em>suchness</em>)
              of ever-changing sounds, sensations, shapes and colors. They are
              descriptions or labels (as are all the words I just used). The word
              "awareness" is not awareness. Any <em>idea</em> of awareness or presence can be doubted or argued. But the <em>actuality</em> of awareness or presence is beyond doubt or belief. It needs no proof.
              The word "awareness" seems to make "awareness" into a separate thing.
              But the actuality isn't really separate from everything else, is it?<br> <br> Can <em>all</em> words, labels, concepts, ideas, and beliefs be allowed to fall away
              (not forever and ever, but right now)? If they are let go, then what
              remains?<br> <br> Is the thinking mind again beginning to look for <em>something</em> (an experience, a particular sensation, the right conceptual
              understanding, the absence of something, or whatever it might be)? Can
              that seeking activity be seen through and allowed to drop away? Can
              there be a simple resting in what <em>actually</em> remains -- <em>this</em> that is utterly inconceivable and yet totally obvious and impossible to
              avoid? Seeing, hearing, awaring, breathing -- simply this. Not the
              words, but the actuality. (And if the mind is now trying to banish
              words and thoughts in order to achieve some imagined non-conceptual
              purity, can that effort also be seen for what it is? <em>Nothing</em> needs to be banished, not even this effort! It's <em>all</em> one indivisible flowing whole -- this ever-changing appearance that always happens in this omnipresent here and now).<br> <br> Every moment is utterly new. Don't cling to the words. They're never
              quite right. Language is inherently dualistic. It requires subjects and
              objects, it reifies and divides, but in actuality, where are the
              boundary lines? Where does "inside" turn into "outside"? You can <em>think</em> of a conceptual answer, but looking directly with awareness, can you actually <em>find</em> such a place? Can you see that this boundary is purely conceptual, that
              it's not actually found in direct experience? Don't take this on
              belief, but right now, if you close your eyes and pay careful
              attention, can you actually find the place where "inside" ends and
              "outside" begins? How solid is what you <em>think</em> of as "your
              body"? Is the apparent border between "you" and "everything else"
              really there in your actual experience, or is it actually nothing more
              than an idea, a mental image, a river of ever-changing sensations, a
              story appearing <em>in</em> awareness? Can you find any limit to present awareness?<br> <br> What is being pointed to is not something you can formulate and take
              hold of and possess. Zen, Advaita, Dzogchen, Taoism, meditative
              inquiry, the power of now, presence-awareness, radical non-duality -
              many names have been given to this fresh seeing, this waking up, this
              aliveness. The danger in names is that they so easily solidify, codify,
              and deaden into dogma. Next thing we know, we have priests, scriptures,
              lineages, doctrines, holy wars, blogs - right ways and wrong ways. You
              may consider yourself a free-thinking, anti-authoritarian type, but
              this tendency toward dogmatism, fundamentalism, and authoritarianism
              can take subtler and subtler forms. It's easy to see it "out there" in
              Christian or Islamic fundamentalism, or in someone else, but what
              really matters is seeing it in oneself, as it arises. Faced with
              uncertainty and insecurity, the human mind has a natural tendency to
              want answers. It's very easy to slide into believing something, and
              then into identifying with those beliefs, and then into defending them
              to the death (literally or metaphorically). Waking up from this
              tendency is a lifelong, moment-to-moment, awakening. In other words, it
              happens Now. And like weeding the garden or cleaning the house, it's
              not something you finish doing. And actually, <em>you're</em> not doing it. It's happening. Consciousness is seeing through illusion and waking up.<br> <br> And even that is a story. It takes thought and imagination to conjure
              it up. In the context of this story, we could say that much of our
              dysfunctional human behavior is rooted in our genetics and our survival
              instinct combined with our complex brain with its ability to
              conceptualize, abstract and project. Reactions and behaviors that make
              perfect sense in the wild very often become useless or destructive when
              they get carried over into the psychological realm. We react to an
              insulting remark in the same way we react to an attacking tiger, or we
              search for enlightenment "out there" in the same way we search for food
              and shelter, and we end up with anxiety, depression, insomnia, and
              global warfare. We could say that waking up is about seeing through
              illusion, discerning the difference between what makes sense and what
              doesn't, between what is real and what is imagination. Awakening
              doesn't mean never thinking again or throwing out all the conceptual
              maps, but it does mean being able to see (in the present moment) the
              difference between the map and the territory, and this seeing gets ever
              more subtle and refined.<br> <br> Thinking is not the enemy. In practical matters, thinking makes sense.
              It's a wonderful tool. But much, maybe most, of our thinking has
              nothing to do with practical matters. Instead, it's a kind of habitual
              spinning of our wheels, chasing mental phantoms, battling with ghosts,
              obsessing over dreams. This kind of thinking never really works or
              satisfies us in the way we want it to. If you pay careful attention to
              it, you'll begin to notice how painful it is, and yet also how
              compelling. It's very much like an addiction. In fact, we could say
              that this kind of thinking <em>is</em> our root addiction. You may also notice that all of these obsessive
              thoughts center around the fictional "me" in some way or other:
              evaluating "me," judging "me," trying to make "me" happy or safe or
              powerful or enlightened. Waking up is not about bringing the story of
              me to a satisfying conclusion. It's about seeing through the story.
              It's about recognizing that the story appears and disappears within
              you, within awareness. The story is ephemeral, insubstantial,
              intermittent, fleeting. Awakening doesn't mean you forget your name or
              your life history, or that you lose all sense of being a particular
              individual. It simply means recognizing that all of that is a momentary
              appearance in the play.<br> <br> In some spiritual circles,
              there is considerable preoccupation with having a big bang awakening,
              imagined to be some line in the sand that "you" cross, after which the
              mirage of encapsulation is forever, irrevocably ended, and after which
              "you" are a liberated sage at last! Among so-called seekers, there is
              often great fascination with teachers, sages, and gurus who have
              supposedly crossed that mythical line and had such a magnificent, final
              experience. Everyone wants to hear their story. And above all, we want
              to know how this same wonderful thing can happen to me! Is it possible
              to see that this is the same old story about me? There may be people
              (in the dream-like movie of waking life) for whom the mirage of
              encapsulation has totally ended, but what matters is whether that
              mirage is seen through right here, right now when it arises. And
              however many times the illusion appears, the only thing that ever
              really matters is waking up now. And it isn't "me" who wakes up. In
              fact, it isn't "me" who does anything.<br> <br> As "you" are reading these words right now, little markings appearing
              on this page in various combinations are being seen and instantly
              translated into meaning. Is there someone doing this remarkable
              activity, overseeing all these elaborate optical and neurological
              processes, or is it all happening automatically, on its own? We say,
              "I" am reading, "I" am seeing, "I" am hearing, "I" am thinking, "I"
              stopped smoking, "I" overate. But what exactly is that "I"? Do "you"
              really know (or control) what "your" next thought or "your" next action
              will be?<br> <br> Right <em>here</em>,
              there is the ability to put attention on your left foot and wiggle your
              toes. But how does all that actually happen and what initiates it?
              Where do will and intention come from? Once the mind tries to capture
              this happening in words, it instantly creates the mirage of duality.
              Suddenly we are apparently lost in imaginary problems and conundrums:
              Do I have free will? If so, why do I do things I don't want to do? How
              can I change? What should I do? Can I do anything? Do I exist?<br> <br> This is all thought. Whenever there is confusion and seeking, it's a
              clue that thought is busy chasing its own tail. Actuality is simple.
              The present moment is simple. <em>Here</em>,
              there is no confusion, no problem, no free will, no absence of free
              will. You are simply doing whatever you are doing. And actually, there
              is no "you" doing any of it. That "you" is an after-thought, a mental
              image, a grammatical convention, a reification of some energetic flow
              that is truly no-thing at all. In actuality, life is simply living
              itself through the appearance of "you" and "me." Truly seeing this
              eliminates all guilt and blame.<br> <br> Given the "wrong"
              combination of genetics, neurochemistry, conditioning, provocation, and
              opportunity, what we consider horrible things can happen. "I" could be
              the perpetrator of such things, or "you" could. And while we would
              certainly want a serial killer or a child molester locked up for the
              protection of everyone; at the same time, if we look deeply, we can see
              that they are blameless. No one would commit atrocities if they really
              had a choice, if they were really free. Looking closely, it can be seen
              that if "I" were in "their" shoes (that is to say, if "I" had the same
              combination of genetics, neurochemistry, conditioning, provocation, and
              opportunity), then "I" would do exactly the same thing "they" did,
              because there is no "I" and no "them" apart from the "shoes" (the ten
              million conditions -- nature and nurture).<br> <br> Does that mean that we should be totally passive or inert or maybe
              wildly licentious because, "It's all just happening," and "We have no
              choice"? No. It means that the "me" who could apparently <em>choose</em> to be this way or that way is a phantom, a mental image with no
              substance. Does that mean we are powerless, that nothing can be done?<br> <br> Rather than slap down a conceptual answer (yes or no), is it possible
              to live with the question, to not know? Watch carefully as actions
              occur, as choices are made and decisions are reached - from the little
              ones like whether to get up from the chair, to the big ones like
              whether to get married or move across country - watch carefully. See if
              you can find the one in control, or if you can catch the decisive
              moment, or if you can explain how it all happens. You may find that you
              can't find anyone at the helm or say how it is that "you" do the
              simplest things, like raising your arm or reading these words. On the
              other hand, you can't really say that you <em>can't</em> do things either, since there is clearly an ability <em>right here</em> to act. You simply can't get hold (conceptually) of exactly what that
              is or how it works. And the more awareness is brought to any particular
              activity, the more refined the activity and the awareness seem to
              become, and the more possibilities open up. But who brings awareness to
              an activity? Is there a choice involved? You may find that words and
              concepts simply can't contain the actuality.<br> <br> <em>Here</em>,
              in open awareness, in non-conceptual actuality, is the natural
              response-ability and intelligence, the choiceless choice or effortless
              effort exerted by life itself: breathing, circulating blood, thinking,
              awareness of thinking, dreaming, waking up, appearing, disappearing --
              one indivisible wholeness in which there is nothing separate to have or
              not have free will, to cause or be caused, to be born or to die, to be
              enlightened or unenlightened. You <em>are</em> life itself, the wholeness of the present moment. You contain everything. You are everything. Everything is One.<br> <br> Thought seemingly divides this wholeness up. It imposes a grid on top
              of the emptiness and conceptually sorts it into little squares. Then it
              imagines that Square A causes Square B, or that Square B is the result
              of Square A, or that Square A has free will to choose between Square B
              and Square C, or that Square A comes before Square B in time and space.
              This is all imagination, a way of conceptualizing. The squares aren't
              really separate; the boundaries don't actually exist; they're only
              conceptual, as are the imagined relationships between the squares,
              including time and space. The squares are actually not related at all
              because they're not two. And this thinking process that imposes
              conceptual grids on wholeness is itself an aspect of the same
              emptiness, as is the awareness that sees through the imaginary grids. <em>Everything</em> is included in the Absolute. We could say that the Absolute includes
              the relative (the world of apparent grids), but isn't bound by it.
              Awakening doesn't mean ignoring, discounting or denying relative
              reality, but awakening sees through it. It recognizes the emptiness of
              everything. But in relative reality, the show goes on, and you (as an
              apparent character) play your part, apparently making choices and
              taking actions.<br> <br> What we often think of or <em>call</em> choices are simply thoughts that arise unbidden that may or may not be
              followed by the result they appear to select. A thought such as "I am
              going to quit smoking" arises on its own out of the ten million
              conditions and may or may not be followed by the cessation of smoking
              because that thought has no power. The "I" to which it refers is a
              powerless mirage, an illusion. A mirage cannot choose to do (or not do)
              anything. To the mind, this idea of having no choice and no free will
              sounds scary, as if "I" might then be a robot with no control. But this
              apparent dilemma vanishes into thin air with the realization that there
              is no "I" here in the first place to be either bound or free.<br> <br> And actually, thought is robotic and mechanical, but awareness is free
              and unbound. The real power or energy or aliveness is in awareness. In
              awareness, "you" as the character in the story of your life are seen to
              be an idea, a conceptualization, an imagination, a phantom, an
              abstraction or reification of what is actually an ever-changing
              appearance. You (in Truth) are the emptiness that is being and
              beholding it all, the no-<em>thing</em>-ness,
              the awareness or pure subjectivity in which and out of which everything
              (including the story of your life) appears and disappears. <em>That</em> is all there is. There can be the <em>thought</em>, the <em>imagination</em>,
              that "you" are a separate person, with "your mind" and "your body" and
              "your free will" or your "lack of free will." But look closely and see
              if this separation is really here. See if there is anything outside of
              awareneness. Investigate the source of your actions. Look right now to
              see what is looking. What do you find?<br> <br> Zoom in
              close enough, or back far enough, or turn attention to the source of
              seeing, or to the sense of presence or awareness itself, and you find
              nothing in particular that you can grasp, and yet, you find <em>everything</em>! You <em>know</em> that you (as presence-awareness) are here, and you know this with absolute doubtless certainty. But what <em>is</em> this awareness and this whole ever-changing appearance?<br> <br> No word can contain or describe what has been called the Unborn, the
              Absolute, the Tao, Pure Awareness, Oneness, Buddha-Nature, the Self,
              Truth, Totality, the One Mind -- the words are only pointers. They
              point beyond conceptualization, to what is utterly obvious and
              omnipresent. They point to here and now, the one eternal present moment.<br> <br> And <em>what</em> is that?<br> <br> Any attempt to grasp it ends in frustration. And yet, it's unavoidably
              right here. It is not something mystical and transcendental that you
              have to work very hard to see. It is this direct experiencing right
              now. It is <em>seemingly</em> obscured by the very effort to pin it down, grasp it mentally,
              conceptualize it. In that grasping and the ensuing frustration, we feel
              confused and separate. Waking up is simply relaxing that mental
              grasping. In the words of one Zen teacher, waking up is opening the
              hand of thought.<br> <br> Buddha-Nature (or the Self) is
              actually omnipresent---it never really leaves us, even in the midst of
              grasping and seeking, for even the grasping and seeking is an activity
              of the same indivisible boundlessness. But whenever attention becomes
              absorbed in thoughts (mental movies, worries, obsessions), then it <em>seems</em> that awareness is lost. It <em>seems</em> that "I" am a separate somebody struggling to regain "Oneness," as if
              that were an object apart from me that I need to find, grasp,
              understand, experience, merge with, identify with, or become. The
              mental mirage-world fills our attention and <em>seems</em> utterly
              real, all-pervasive and convincing. This is suffering. And ultimately,
              beliefs (such as, "It's all One," or "It's all perfect," or "This is
              it, too.") don't resolve this suffering. Direct seeing does.<br> <br> So, simply stop and see. Stop, look, listen. This is the essence of
              true meditation, and it requires no special location or posture or
              clothing. Tune into this present moment, just as it is. Alllow it all
              to be just as it is. Listen to the thoughts and memories and fantasies
              that bubble up out of nowhere, and notice how they create instant
              mental movies and the image of a separate "me." See how transparent it
              all is. These thoughts are simply secretions of the brain, conditioned
              habit patterns, mental weather -- there is nothing personal about them.
              There is no need to resist or vanquish them; simply see them for what
              they are.<br> <br> Clearly seeing the mirage-world of thoughts and mental movies for what
              it is gets ever more subtle. Being down on yourself for "thinking too
              much" is just more thinking! There is no "you" doing the thinking or
              the seeing; that "you" is only another thought, another mental image.
              Liberation isn't about <em>getting rid</em> of anything; it's about <em>seeing</em> that there is nothing separate from anything else. The "me" who wants
              to stop thinking is just another mental image, another thought, another
              movie character in another story.<br> <br> Reality is
              unavoidable. It is right here in the smell of rain, the song of a bird,
              the whoosh of traffic, sensations -- the nondual absolute. Totally
              alive. Ungraspable. No final result, no finish line, no Big Bang event,
              no you -- just what is, as it is. No need for exotic experiences.
              Nothing to be eliminated or held on to, and nothing to be acquired or
              understood. Nothing excluded. Nothing singled out. Freedom is utterly
              simple and uncomplicated. Notice that awareness is not separate from
              the content of awareness except conceptually, in thought. In actuality,
              in direct experiencing, there is no division. Form is emptiness;
              emptiness is form.<br> <br> Being apparently "lost in thought" (and lost in the story of "me" as a
              separate somebody in an alien world) is a very different <em>experience</em> from clear awareness. Different actions result. One is confusion and
              suffering and it generates confusion and suffering, the other is
              clarity and freedom and it generates clarity and freedom. In the
              absence of clear seeing, habitual and conditioned programs run their
              course. In the extremes of such entrancement, people torture and
              exterminate millions of other people because it seems like a good idea.
              Naturally, we want to wake up from such entrancement on both the
              personal and global levels. But there's a very subtle catch here.<br> <br> Wanting to be rid of suffering, trying to push it away, or chasing
              after some idea or ideal of freedom, is itself all part of the
              suffering, part of the confusion. That chase (or resistance) doesn't
              work because it is rooted in the illusion of separation, the illusion
              of an objective world "out there" that needs fixing -- the same
              illusion and confusion that generates the suffering. The end of
              suffering can only happen now. It begins with total presence here and
              now, allowing everything to be as it is. This allowing is what actually
              already <em>is</em>. Everything <em>is</em> allowed to be. And in stillness, the more deeply you look and listen,
              the more you discover emptiness, and this emptiness is vibrant
              aliveness, peace, joy, unconditional love. From here, whatever action
              (or non-action) arises comes out of clear seeing and is responsive to
              the whole situation.<br> <br> Pain may still be here
              (vibrations, sensations) and what we consider terrible things may still
              be occurring, but without the interpretive overlay, there is no
              suffering in the usual sense. Taking action (or non-action) to relieve
              pain, heal injury, or correct injustice arises naturally. The universe
              acts. Ultimately, what is healed will be broken down again. All form is
              impermanent; it never even exists in the way we <em>think</em> it does. True freedom is recognizing the emptiness (or boundlessness) that is unborn and undying.<br> <br> If the movie begins playing in which "you" are trying to "get" this
              recognition, and feeling badly when it appears that "you" have failed,
              then simply notice that this is yet another movie, another dream-like
              appearance in consciousness, another story about the imaginary
              character. Emptiness is already here. It can't be lost (or found).
              Awareness includes everything and sticks to nothing. Clouds appear.
              Contraction appears. Pain appears. Resistance and tension appear.
              Expansion and relaxation appear. Mental movies appear and disappear.
              Dreams come and go. Everything disappears in deep sleep and death and
              reappears again in waking life. It's all a boundless ebb and flow that
              includes absolutely <em>everything</em>, even contraction and distraction and resistance and the <em>appearance</em> of separation and encapsulation -- even so-called "evil." It all <em>is</em>.<br> <br> But that doesn't mean losing the ability to differentiate between
              clarity and confusion, or not working to correct injustice. Wholeness
              includes discernment and the ability to act. It includes the ability to
              notice errors and correct them. So awakening doesn't mean we have to
              sit back and do nothing about the holocaust or child abuse because we
              have the <em>idea</em> that everything is "okay" as it is. As my first Zen teacher told me:
              "You're perfect just as you are, and that doesn't mean there's no room
              for improvement." There's room for everything! But the source of any
              action is the totality, not the imaginary separate person. And whatever
              happens is a dream-like appearance. The last moment has already totally
              vanished into thin air! How real was it?<br> <br> There is no distance at all between samsara and nirvana. The <em>illusion</em> of distance is samsara, and nirvana is simply the realization that this
              distance, or separation, is imaginary. Liberation is not about "you"
              getting from samsara to nirvana. That is illusion. Liberation is the
              absence of that whole story of separation and lack.<br> <br> But as a belief, all this is meaningless. Liberation isn't about
              picking up a new belief system or a new set of answers (for example,
              that, "All is One," or "There is nothing to attain," or, "Consciousness
              is all there is," or, "There is no free will," or, "Everything is
              perfect."). Liberation is the aliveness and immediacy beyond belief.
              Liberation is when <em>all</em> the answers, explanations and positions disappear, and what remains is the open mind of not knowing.<br> <br> Thus it has been said, if you meet the Buddha, kill it. If you find the
              answer, drop it. Yesterday's answer is today's dead meat. Let it go.
              There is no enlightened person. There is only enlightened seeing,
              enlightened being, enlightened consciousness -- impersonal clarity.
              There is no unenlightened person either -- only confusion and
              entrancement, impersonal obscuration. <em>All</em> of this is like weather -- it comes and goes -- and <em>all</em> of it is an aspect of the undivided whole, inseparable from every other aspect. <em>All</em> of it is what is: the confusion, the clarity, the desire to wake up,
              the impulse to clarify and heal, the various forms of meditative
              inquiry and exploration, the practices, the waking up from practices --
              all of it is what is.<br> <br> If you try to make sense of
              all this and adopt some fixed position or view, sooner or later, the
              ground you imagine yourself standing on will be swept away. Liberation
              is not a matter of pinning down the "right" answer or the "correct"
              position. Reality cannot be pinned down or put into a box. Does waking
              up take effort or is it effortless? Is there a choice or is it
              choiceless? Is the world real or unreal? Does what happens matter or
              not matter? Will I still be here after death or not? Such questions
              defy answers because they are all rooted in trying to describe the
              indescribable, and/or they are rooted in conceptual fallacies, like
              flat-earth questions (What will happen to me if I fall off the edge of
              the earth? You and the edge are both imaginary; the question is based
              on a misconception).<br> <br> As soon as we have words like "Oneness" or "Emptiness" or "Awareness,"
              the word instantly creates the mirage-sense of an object. But that
              object isn't real, it is conceptual, and it isn't what these words are
              pointing to. Boundlessness is inconceivable, and yet it is visible
              everywhere, as everything.<br> <br> Undivided wholeness (emptiness, oneness, nonduality, unicity) does not
              mean that a bunch of separate pieces are now joined together. It
              doesn't mean that everything is made of one primal substance. It means
              that everything is equally insubstantial, that there are no separate
              "things" to be joined, that there is no substance to get hold of
              anywhere. And yet, that doesn't mean there is nothing. Emptiness does
              not mean voidness or formless nothingness. There is an old Zen story
              where a Master asks a student to grab emptiness. The student makes a
              gesture of grabbing a handful of empty space. The Master says, "That's
              nice, but there's an even better way to grab emptiness." He takes hold
              of the student's nose and twists it. Everything is emptiness! The
              sensations of nose twisting are emptiness. Your nose is emptiness. And
              emptiness is nothing other than your nose. Emptiness means everything
              (including your nose) is empty of solidity and permanence and
              separation. Form and emptiness cannot be teased apart except in
              thought. Truth is not something mysterious you need to search for. It
              is just <em>this</em> -- the computer screen, the shapes of these words, the roar of traffic,
              the gurgling stomach, the barking dog, your nose -- just this. No-thing
              at all!<br> <br> Ultimately, the universe is a fleeting
              dream, a bubble in a stream. Wipe your forehead and you've killed and
              maimed billions of micro-organisms. Horrible events and misfortunes are
              often the source of tremendous wisdom, insight, compassion, and
              awakening. Light and dark are two sides of the same coin, and there are
              no one-sided coins. Seeing this, there is more acceptance of life as it
              is. But that acceptance doesn't mean dissociation or lack of caring,
              for it is the realization that everything is myself. The dividing lines
              are all imaginary. Each baby duck in the park, each newly blossoming
              flower, each drop of dew, each snowflake, each piece of trash in the
              gutter is unique and precious, as is every human being, and it's all
              one whole being arising together all at once, marvelously diverse but
              utterly without separation. When we really <em>see</em> a flower, or an ant, or a bird, or a human being, or a stone, or a rug,
              or a plate of cheese, we see the whole universe, and that very seeing
              is unconditional love. Naturally, we care for all beings (including
              stones and rugs and plates). Not because we have taken some Bodhisattva
              vow, but because it is the natural action of clarity, the
              response-ability of life awake to itself.<br> <br>Awareness is another word for unconditional love -- a love so total that it accepts absolutely everything. <em>Whatever</em> appears -- whether it is confusion, resistance, pain, pleasure,
              efforting, bliss, boredom, me-stories, clear skies or thunderstorms -- <em>all</em> of it is allowed to be here. Awareness is like a mirror that reflects
              everything equally without judgment or preferences. It isn't that "you"
              have to "do" this acceptance. Rather, notice that everything already <em>is</em> allowed to be as it is, even judgments and preferences! It all <em>is</em>!<br> <br>If you're beginning to think that "awareness" is actually <em>something</em> (a Blank Screen, an Empty Container, or a Mirror), notice that these
              are all mental images, conceptual ideas, subtle imaginary objects.
              "Awareness" is a word that points to what remains when <em>everything</em> perceivable and conceivable falls away. Are you trying to see what that is? Can you see the joke in trying to do that?<br> <br>Don't
              think that everything perceivable and conceivable has to disappear. But
              how solid is anything perceivable or conceivable (any image, any idea,
              any memory, any sensation, any thought, any emotion, any event, any
              object, any experience)? Where is your childhood or yesterday or a
              minute ago or the last second? On close inspection, everything is
              insubstantial, ungraspable, vanishing. The mind keeps trying to get a
              grip. It wants answers, certainty, a place to stand. What is this whole
              thing? The mind wants to understand. Thought imagines that "you" can
              step back and take a look at yourself, at totality. But no matter how
              hard it tries, the eye cannot see itself.<br> <br> Experiences come and go. This is not about having a special experience,
              a big event, a final breakthrough, or a psychedelic vision of some
              kind. It is not about regaining any previous experience or achieving
              something you've read about or imagined. All of that is in the world of
              dream-like appearances.<br> <br> Simply notice that <em>everything</em> (mental movies, dreams, perceptions, thoughts, waking life, mirages,
              the I-illusion, apparent duality, time and space, chairs, tables,
              expansion, contraction, meditation retreats, traffic jams, <em>everything</em>)
              is without substance or continuity, and it all appears and disappears
              right here. Here is always here. It's always now. Even memories of the
              past, fantasies about the future, and thoughts of elsewhere can only
              appear here and now in the timeless, spaceless, no-thing-ness of
              present awareness. <em>This</em> is always here, whether it appears
              clear or "clouded" by thoughts. In deep sleep, the entire universe
              disappears. All words and ideas disappear. Even the <em>sense</em> of
              awareness or presence disappears. The whole quest for understanding and
              awakening disappears. You (as anything perceivable or conceivable)
              disappear. There is no "you" left to notice that "you" have
              disappeared! Nothing perceivable or conceivable remains. Out of this
              vast emptiness, dreams arise. The world appears, the movie of waking
              life. Wave after wave crashes on the shore, and the ocean remains,
              waving. People-ing is something that Being is doing, in the same way
              that the ocean is waving. There are no waves apart from the ocean. What
              is born and what dies? The boundless totality cannot be captured by the
              mind. <em>Something</em> is happening here, but it can't be grasped by thought. And it doesn't <em>need</em> to be grasped or explained! You can't <em>find</em> the totality because you <em>are</em> the totality. <em>Everything</em> is the totality. You contain the whole universe and the whole universe is showing up as you, as this moment.<br> <br> Awakening is never about achieving something that isn't right here, right now.<br> <br> Is the mind scanning for <em>something</em> that is here right now -- some special perception, some particular experience? If that effort lets go, what remains?<br> <br> There is no answer. Only the ungraspable actuality.<br> <br> Ordinary present awareness. The shape of these words, the hum of the
              computer, the sound of the traffic, the listening presence, the
              sensations that appear and disappear. Only thought divides it up and
              tries to figure it all out. And that very movement of thought is itself
              only energy and vibration, another appearance, mental weather. No-thing
              at all.<br> <br> So what to do? Effort or no effort, practice or no practice? The
              question is like a cloud floating across the sky. Practices may appear
              or disappear, efforts may happen or cease happening. Either way, there
              is only this one present moment, just as it is. So-called meditation
              (in the truest sense) is nothing other than a simplified space where
              everything can come to light and be seen for what it is. True
              meditation is not about going anywhere or achieving anything. It has
              nothing to do with special postures, techniques, results or
              experiences. It is simply effortless awareness, awake to what is. It
              can happen anywhere. It is the direct discovery that there is no
              meditator and no possibility of stepping in or out of the boundlessness
              of here and now. When that is seen, the whole concept of "meditation"
              falls away. What remains is not a new belief system, but rather, open
              wonder, the present moment.<br> <br> So, if you're feeling confused, trying to figure out whether or not you
              have free will, or whether or not you exist, or whether or not you
              should meditate or do nothing, or whether to believe this teacher or
              that teacher, simply wake up right now from these mental conundrums.
              Stop. Look. Listen. Hear the traffic, the birds, the wind. Feel the
              breathing. Nothing special. Just the extraordinary miracle of what
              actually is.<br> <br> All that (apparently) stands in the way is the story that this isn't
              it, that something more or less or different is needed. You can't make
              that story disappear because that very effort is part of the story, as
              is the "you" who longs to be free of the story. The stories and the
              illusion of encapsulation can only be seen for what they are, as they
              arise, here and now. If they are not seen through, then it may <em>appear</em> that "you" are lost or bound or in trouble. But is there <em>really</em> a "you" who is lost? Is the screen ever burned by the fire in the movie?<br> <br> Words and concepts are complicated; reality is utterly simple. You
              can't eat the menu or live in the map, and these words are an
              invitation to see through all beliefs and ideas, even the very subtle
              ones from Advaita or Zen or this text. Truth is not in the future, but
              now. Not hidden, but obvious and unavoidable. Not in the mind, but in
              the actuality, the suchness of this moment. When all that mental
              clutter of seeking and trying to figure everything out and trying to
              get somewhere is seen to be nothing at all (and nothing personal), when
              it is clear that you are beyond all appearances, and that all
              appearances are nothing but you, the One Mind, then there is no one
              left to awaken. This can be called liberation, but why call it anything?</p>
