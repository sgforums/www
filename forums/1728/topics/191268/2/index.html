            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by neutral_onliner:<br><strong>In Tibet, there is an additional factor to consider: due to the high altitude and harsh climate, there is little to eat besides ground barley, dairy products and meat. To stay alive, the people have to eat meat. [b]His Holiness the Dalai Lama has encouraged those Tibetans in exile, who now live in countries where vegetables and fruits are more plentiful, to refrain from eating meat whenever possible.</strong> Also, if a practitioner has severe problems with his/her health due to not eating meat, then the master may give permission to take it. Thus, each person must check his/her own level of practice and bodily requirements and eat accordingly.<br><br>The fact that there is such variety within the Buddhist doctrine attests to the BuddhaÂ’s skill in being able to guide people according to their dispositions and needs. It is extremely important not to be partial and sectarian, but to have respect for all the traditions and their practitioners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Agreed. Situations had change in the recent years. many Tibetan traditions are starting to take up vegetarian diet following china, as now vegetarian food can be obtain much easier than before due to modernization. And also due to modernization, more animal are being killed for food. so we Buddhist should become vegetarian now to reduce the common karma of the world.<br>from most Tibetan traditions vcd i watched, Urgyen Trinley Dorje (Da bao fa wang) had become vegetarian. He said he used to like eating meat, but He said He must stop, as He's supposed to practice compassion for beings.<br>His Eminence Drubwang Konchok Norbu Rinpoche had never eaten meat.<br><br><img src="http://www.kmspks.org/events/images/Rinpoche_D.jpg"><br>He said to eat meat is to eat your parent's meat, and there's karma, (if u see what happen to Tibet). He strongly encourage vegetarian to a person who are in the organisation of a Buddhist society to set good example. if not karma of propagation and common karma of killing will crash.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Peace!<br><br>Actually the focus should not be on the Lama right from the start. Because the Lama is still a person. Whatever enquiry should all be referenced directly from the Sutra and not individuals. The Buddha had already mentioned this to us more than 2500 year ago that we should strictly follow the authentic Dharma teachings and not any individual.<br><br>So, from Buddhist point of view, whether Lama should or should not eat meat. I think it is more approriate to let their community decide. This I think is more respectful. Whatever the consequences, be it wholesome or unwholesome, let the Karma dictates.<br><br>Not just about Lama, we must SHUI SHUN, but also individuals from different Schools, Faith, Race and belief-system, we must respect and SHUI SHUN.
