            <div class='col-md body'>In Tibet, there is an additional factor to consider: due to the high altitude and harsh climate, there is little to eat besides ground barley, dairy products and meat. To stay alive, the people have to eat meat. <strong>His Holiness the Dalai Lama has encouraged those Tibetans in exile, who now live in countries where vegetables and fruits are more plentiful, to refrain from eating meat whenever possible.</strong> Also, if a practitioner has severe problems with his/her health due to not eating meat, then the master may give permission to take it. Thus, each person must check his/her own level of practice and bodily requirements and eat accordingly.<br><br>The fact that there is such variety within the Buddhist doctrine attests to the BuddhaÂ’s skill in being able to guide people according to their dispositions and needs. It is extremely important not to be partial and sectarian, but to have respect for all the traditions and their practitioners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I do not generally have respect for Lamas, or even think they are religious monks at all. All thru history, Lamas are notoriously infamous for slavery, torture, sexual abuses and murder. 80% of the population in Tibet were slaves. They drink and eat meat... human skin drums and cups fashioned from human skulls takes the cake. They are also technically the ruling class in Tibet rule with an iron hand.<br><br>I'm not kidding.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Honestly, I do not generally have respect for Lamas, or even think they are religious monks at all.</blockquote>As mentioned above - <strong>not</strong> all lamas are monks. Lama simply means teacher. Some can be lay teachers.<br><br><blockquote>All thru history, Lamas are notoriously infamous for slavery, torture, sexual abuses and murder. 80% of the population in Tibet were slaves.</blockquote>Pls quote where you heard from... perhaps you may have read from Chinese propaganda sources that provides unsubstantiated garbage... lots of Chinese propaganda has been going on. See: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=186123" rel="nofollow">China's Panchen Lama steals show with Buddhists</a><br><br><blockquote>They drink and eat meat...</blockquote>Tibetan monks CAN eat meat - so do Theravada (thai/sri lankan monks). Buddha did not strictly forbid eating meat but only encouraged people to take up vegetarianism.<br><br>As for drinking? Pls quote...<br><br><blockquote>human skin drums and cups fashioned from human skulls takes the cake.</blockquote>I believe human skulls and human skin drums are used to remind one of impermanence - though it may be for other reasons. There is nothing wrong with that since they didnt murder to get those skulls.<br><br><blockquote>They are also technically the ruling class in Tibet rule with an iron hand.</blockquote>Yes the Lamas were the ruling class and were in charge of the politics of Tibet in the past. But I am not aware of lamas ruling Tibet with an iron fist..</div>
