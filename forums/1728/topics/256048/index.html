            <div class='col-md body'>...Just become intensely conscious of the present moment. This is a deeply satisfying thing to do. In this way, you draw consciousness away from mind activity and create a gap of no-mind in which you are highly alert and aware but not thinking. This is the essence of meditation. In your everyday life, you can practice this by taking any routine activity that normally is only a means to an end and giving it your fullest attention, so that it becomes an end in itself. For example, every time you walk up and down the stairs in your house or place of work, pay close attention to every step, every movement, even your breathing. Be totally present. Or when you wash your hands, pay attention to all the sense perceptions associated with the activity: the sound and feel of the water, the movement of your hands, the scent of the soap, and so on. Or when you get into your car, after you close the door, pause for a few seconds and observe the flow of your breath. Become aware of a silent but powerful sense of presence. There is one certain criterion by which you can measure your success in this practice: the degree of peace that you feel within....<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle, The Power of Now<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> Is everybody prepared to feel the Presence? Could you please explain a simple exercise, meditation or visualization for us to try to connect to the present moment?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> Everybody could probably feel the presence, but not everybody is interested. Many people are still in the grip of the ego and completely identified with their thoughts.<br><br>One way of becoming present is to feel the inner energy-field of your body. Feel the aliveness in your hands, arms, feet, legs, and then in the entire body. I call that awareness of the inner body. It takes your attention away from thinking and anchors you in the present moment. Another way is to become conscious of your breathing. This is one of the most ancient meditation methods. Follow your breath with your attention, all the way into the body and out again. When you are aware of the inner body or follow the breath with your attention, you are highly alert, but not thinking.<br><br>~ Eckhart Tolle, July 2007 Q&amp;A (<a href="http://www.eckharttolle.com/home.php?section=news&amp;show=NEWS%20-%20Current%20News" rel="nofollow">http://www.eckharttolle.com/home.php?section=news&amp;show=NEWS%20-%20Current%20News</a>)</div>
