              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 3.25pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; "> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">I support the principle of free speech and stand in
              solidarity with the French in the aftermath of yesterday’s terror attack. I am
              sure most all of you feel the same. But today I am not inclined to give myself
              over to expressions of outrage and defiance, which seem to me right now as
              little more than mere emotionalism and sloganeering. I have seen too many news
              reports of terror attacks in my years to be outraged. I am too weary to be
              defiant. Instead, I have questions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Flavia
              Pansieri articulated the questions in my mind rather well at the opening of the
              83rd session of The U. N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination
              last year in Geneva:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Where does the
              right of expression, which we all want to respect, stop and the need to
              sanction and prevent hate speech begin? What is the point in time when one
              right has to recognize that it cannot be exercised if it implies the violation
              of another one?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Does free speech go too far if it is harmful to
              others? It’s a rather old question, actually. It was debated by the U.S.
              Supreme Court nearly a hundred years ago in Schenck v. United States, (1919), a
              case that revolved around free speech during World War I. The court concluded
              that the defendant (Schenck) had no First Amendment right to express freedom of
              speech against the draft during the war. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.
              wrote the unanimous opinion that included this line, “The most stringent
              protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a
              theatre and causing a panic . . .”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Thus, it was Holmes who gave us the famous metaphor of
              “Shouting fire in a crowded theater.” I don’t get how he reasoned that to
              express one’s opinion on the morality of a wartime draft presented a “clear and
              present danger,” but that is another discussion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">In a free society, everyone should have a right to
              hold and express any opinion. Justice Holmes qualified his decision with the
              word “falsely.” So, one of the first questions we should ask ourselves is, does
              opinion need to have a factual basis? Usually, no. But that does not mean it is
              wise to offer opinions that are based solely on supposition, assuming facts not
              verified.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">The second question might be does the right to free
              speech include a right to offend a person’s religious sensibilities and
              beliefs? What we see in the West as relatively harmless satire is to many
              Muslims, even moderate ones, hate speech.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Yesterday’s attack was against </span><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Charlie Hebdo</em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">, a
              French satirical weekly newspaper. The cover of a 2011 issue depicted a cartoon
              of the Islamic prophet Muhammed and teachings based upon the Quran forbid the
              creation of visual images of Muhammad. This religious dictum does not justify
              the savage murder of 12 people. But it does provoke questions about whether
              journalists, even those engaged in the business of satire, should be more
              sensitive to religious beliefs. In the global public sphere, does the sacred
              dictum of the West that “nothing is sacred” trump Islam’s sacred dictum
              regarding images of the Prophet? Just because we have the right to free speech,
              is it always wise and/or proper to exercise it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Religion was often the target of </span><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Charlie Hebdo’s</em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;"> satire. Religion isn’t as popular these days as it once was. Even those of us
              who are “spiritual” may have little use for “religion.” In being dismissive,
              need we be disrespectful?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">As a Buddhist, I can’t help but wonder how we can
              strike the proper balance between free speech and “right speech,” an ideal
              found in the Buddha’s Eightfold Path: “And what is right speech? Abstaining
              from lying, from divisive speech, from abusive speech, and from idle chatter:
              This is called right speech.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">The </span><em style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Dasabhumaka Sutra</em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;"> says,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">“</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Whatever speech
              is unpleasant, whatever hurts one’s own nature or others, that is speech the
              bodhisattva avoids . . .”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">What hurts one’s own nature or others can take many
              forms, and can be born from misunderstanding and thoughtless as well as hate
              and prejudice. When I was younger, I would have been tempted to simply dismiss
              Muslims as thin-skinned, denounce their violence, and leave it at that.
              Nowadays, disgusted as I am, having been a witness to these unrelenting cycles
              of violence for so long, I am more interested in how concepts such as right
              speech and deep listening might be pathways to solutions. I am more interested
              in trying to understand the other side than I am in placing blame and demanding
              accountability.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Writing now, something else occurs to me, about to
              what extent religious sensibilities are used as political weapons? Muslims seem
              to be a devout people; yet many of them have no problem using their religion a
              propaganda tool. Arab Nations like to cast themselves as spiritual warriors
              righteously fighting a religious war against “infidels”, and they use this same
              ideology to agitate believers against the West. We do much the same thing, only
              we are the champions of democracy and free speech.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Where do we go from here? Do we encourage journalists
              to censor themselves? And if so, is it an act of tolerance, or is it just doing
              what the terrorists want us to do? Or, perhaps it is the outrage, the defiance,
              the condemnation exactly they want to see. Are we only displaying our wounds
              for their pleasure?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em style="line-height: 1.231; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Why do we never get an
              answer when we’re knocking at the door</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> <em>With a thousand million questions about hate and death and war?</em></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">I don’t have the answers. Just suggestions, what ifs.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em style="line-height: 1.231;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Je suis Charlie</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">.
              I, you, we are all Charlie but if the world is ever going to change at some
              point we must also be Abdul and Fareed and Rabiya. I wrote above that I wanted
              to avoid sloganeering. But here I go. <em>Not afraid</em>. Without a doubt, we
              should not be afraid in the face of terrorism, never forsake our liberty of
              expression. Fear, though, can be a double-edge sword. <em>Not afraid</em> should
              also mean not fearing to use our liberty to express right speech, kind speech,
              and to open our hearts to the concerns of others. Why is it that when
              responsible leaders suggest offering an olive branch of understanding to Islam
              and the Middle East they are vilified for it and labeled as weak? It seems to
              me that kindness and understanding and empathy are strategies that have not yet
              been employed in this long, long war between these two cultures. <em>Not afraid</em>?
              I wonder if that is true . . .</span></p>
