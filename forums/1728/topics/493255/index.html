              to Dalai Lama, Turns From Him Toward China</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">EDWARD WONG DEC. 30, 2016
              New York Times</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mongolia, whose rulers played a role in establishing the
              Dalai Lama centuries ago, no longer welcomes him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Remarks by its foreign minister this month were the latest
              sign that another country had withered under pressure from China over the
              contentious issue of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The minister, Tsend Munkh-Orgil, told the Onoodor newspaper
              that the government “feels sorry” for allowing the Dalai Lama to visit Mongolia
              in November and that the Dalai Lama “probably won’t be visiting Mongolia again
              during this administration,” according to Bloomberg News. The Foreign Ministry
              confirmed the remarks, according to The Associated Press.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The reaction by Mongolia surprised some scholars because of
              the country’s deep ties to the Dalai Lama, which date from the 1500s. Even the
              title alludes to those roots: Dalai means “ocean” in Mongolian.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Chinese government had objected to the visit by the Dalai
              Lama, which began on Nov. 18 and took place over four days, even though it was
              not made at the invitation of the Mongolian government and was religious in
              nature. China canceled meetings with senior Mongolian officials in response.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">China has long pressured countries, including Western ones, to
              ban visits from the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India. Chinese Communist
              Party leaders consider him to be an enemy who advocates Tibetan independence
              from China, although the Dalai Lama has said he seeks only greater autonomy for
              Tibetans.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In one sense, Mongolia’s reaction to China, a neighbor that
              has the world’s second-largest economy, was predictable. Mongolia is dealing
              with financial problems and is seeking a large loan from Beijing. Until a
              recent crash, the Mongolian economy had been growing fast, fueled by mineral
              extraction.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But, at the same time, Mongolia has tried to distance itself
              from China and Russia, and has become a United States military partner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is also a traditionally Buddhist country with ancient ties
              to Tibetan Buddhism and to the history of the Dalai Lamas, and the foreign
              minister’s remarks alarmed some historians and Tibet advocates.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“This is part of a near-global collapse in diplomatic
              capacity to handle certain kinds of pressure from China, which is, of course,
              far more acute for small, landlocked neighbors than major powers,” Robert J.
              Barnett, a historian of modern Tibet at Columbia University, said in an email.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">John Delury, a China historian at Yonsei University in Seoul,
              posted on Twitter last week that Mongolia’s reaction was “ironic given that it
              was a Mongolian Khan who invented Dalai Lamaness.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dalai Lamas arose from the actions of Altan Khan, a
              16th-century Mongolian leader who controlled a region next to northern China,
              which was ruled by the ethnic Han emperors of the Ming dynasty.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Three centuries earlier, Kublai Khan, the founding emperor of
              the Yuan dynasty, an era when Mongolians ruled China, had become interested in
              Tibetan Buddhism and had taken on a Tibetan teacher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But it was Altan Khan who made Tibetan Buddhism an official
              religion among Mongols. He did this when the head of the Gelug school of
              Tibetan Buddhism, also known as the Yellow Hat school, visited him in 1577. On
              that occasion, Altan Khan gave the spiritual leader the title of Dalai Lama. With
              Dalai meaning “ocean” in Mongolian and Lama being a Tibetan spiritual teacher,
              the title translates as “ocean of wisdom.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This bound the Mongols and Tibetans and established a
              relationship between Mongolian rulers and the Gelug school. Since then, the position
              of the Dalai Lama has been tied to complex politics in Asia. The two heads of
              the Gelug school preceding the one who visited Altan Khan were also given the
              Dalai Lama title retroactively.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Third Dalai Lama, Sonam Gyatso, the one who had received
              his title from Altan Khan, died in 1588 in the Mongolian region. A
              great-grandson of Altan Khan, Yonten Gyatso, was then named by senior Tibetan
              lamas as the Fourth Dalai Lama and the reincarnation of Sonam Gyatso. (Each
              Dalai Lama is considered a reincarnation of the previous one.) Yonten Gyatso
              has been the only Mongolian to be chosen as a Dalai Lama.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Dalai Lama’s Mongolia visit has raised another question.
              Many people have begun speculating over when and where the reincarnation of the
              current Dalai Lama, the 14th, will appear after he dies. The Dalai Lama, who is
              81, has said that he may be the last of the Dalai Lamas, while holding open the
              possibility of a reincarnation — including one outside Tibetan regions, where
              Communist leaders would no doubt try to control any designated reincarnation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Some people have said that the next Dalai Lama could be found
              in the Tawang region of northeastern India, home of the Sixth Dalai Lama.
              Tawang also happens to be a disputed region in the Himalayas that China claims
              as its territory.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But the Dalai Lama’s recent visit suggests to some scholars
              that Mongolia could be the place to watch, especially given the history of the
              Third and Fourth Dalai Lamas.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“The interesting thing about the Dalai Lama visit was that it
              may be a signal that his reincarnation could appear there,” Mr. Barnett said.
              He added that given China’s hostility, this is “something that would be
              potentially disastrous for Mongolia.”</span></p>
