              Academy have killed themselves following a suicide in July to protest Chinese
              authorities’ destruction of large parts of the Tibetan Buddhist study center,
              with the attempted suicide of yet another woman blocked by friends at the last
              minute, according to Tibetan sources.<br> <br> Tsering Dolma, aged about 20, hanged herself on Aug. 17 “when she could no
              longer bear the pain of seeing the destruction of Larung Gar,” a source living
              in the area told RFA’s Tibetan Service. “She left behind a note expressing her distress
              at the demolition and complaining that the Chinese will not let them live in
              peace.”<br> <br> A native of Mewa township in Marthang (in Chinese, Hongyuan) county in
              Sichuan’s Ngaba (Aba) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Dolma had been seen before
              her death to be “depressed and worried” over Chinese authorities’ destruction
              of thousands of dwellings at the academy, RFA’s source said, speaking on
              condition of anonymity.<br> <br> “So she hanged herself,” he said.<br> <br> A nun named Semga, a native of Dowa village in Ngaba’s Dzamthang (Rangtang)
              county, is also believed to have recently killed herself, though details on how
              and when she died were not immediately available, while a third nun attempted
              suicide “though others intervened in time and saved her,” the source said.<br> <br> The deaths follow the suicide on July 20 of Rinzin Dolma, a nun who hanged
              herself as Chinese work crews began to tear down monks’ and nuns’ houses to
              reduce what authorities have described as overcrowding at the Larung Gar
              academy in Ngaba's Serthar (Seda) county, sources said in earlier reports.<br> <br> Many thousands of Tibetans and Han Chinese study at the sprawling Larung Gar
              complex, which was founded in 1980 by the late religious teacher Khenpo Jigme
              Phuntsok and is one of the world’s largest and most important centers for the
              study of Tibetan Buddhism.<br> <br> <strong>Orders from higher-up</strong><br> <br> The order now to reduce the number of Larung Gar’s residents by about half to a
              maximum level of 5,000 is not a county plan “but comes from higher
              authorities,” with China’s president Xi Jinping taking a personal interest in
              the matter, sources told RFA in earlier reports.<br> <br> Chinese authorities have stationed armed security forces at the work site and
              are warning that attempts at protest or resistance will be punished by arrests
              and incarceration, one source said, adding that armed police have also been
              deployed to nearby areas.<br> <br> Informed by her friends of Dolma’s death, officials of Larung Gar’s
              government-appointed management committee said at first that they were
              unwilling to look into the case, but later came to try to claim the body, RFA’s
              source said.<br> <br> “They said that their duty according to official instructions was to be sure
              that the demolition goes ahead, though, and that they would not be held
              responsible for anyone’s death."<br> <br> Hearing this, the nuns “wailed in grief,” he said.<br> <br> Rights groups have slammed the government-ordered destruction at Larung Gar,
              with New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) saying that Beijing should allow
              the Tibetan people to decide for themselves how best to practice their
              religion.<br> <br> "If authorities somehow believe that the Larung Gar facilities are
              overcrowded, the answer is simple," HRW China director Sophie Richardson
              said in a statement in June.<br> <br> "Allow Tibetans and other Buddhists to build more monasteries."</span></p>
