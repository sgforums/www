              <p><br> i totally agree the example u give ,cloud and the sun.In fact
                  before huineng ,the dominant teaching in buddhism say that someone
                  may never become buddha, because they are bad in nature
                  .During huineng time ,he raise the concept ,that everyone have
                  buddha nature ,and everyone can become buddha,and it sound a little
                  bit unacceptable to mainstream buddhism.Of course now ppl agree

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes and what Hui-Neng said is in fact in accordance with the sutras that even icchantikas have buddha-nature.</p>
              <h1><a name="Daosheng"></a>Daosheng (Venerable) (360-434)</h1>
              <p>One of the foremost disciples of the Venerable Hwei Ywan (see entry), the
                  Venerable Dau Sheng was a great enlightened master who is best known for
                  his propagation of the teachings of the Mahayana and particularly the doctrine
                  of the universality of Buddha-nature, even in ['those of insufficient faith'].</p>
              <p>"At the time when only the first part of [the ] . . . had been translated
                  into Chinese, Dharma Master Dau Sheng was lecturing on it in Soochow Province
                  in JungGwo. When he came to the passage that said that lack the Buddha-nature,
                  he didn't explain it that way, but he said instead that they have the Buddha-nature.
                  His reasoning went like this:</p>
              <p>"'Why is it that have the Buddha-nature? It is because all living beings
                  have the Buddha-nature, and although have insufficient faith, they are
                  living beings. Therefore, how can one say they lack the Buddha-nature?'</p>
              <p>"He lectured on the question in a way opposite to the reading in the
                  first half of the Sutra, which outraged the other Dharma Masters of his
                  time. They protested, 'That's the talk of demonÄ kings! The Sutra
                  which the Buddha spoke plainly says that don't have the Buddha-nature,
                  yet he says they do. That's really messed up.' No one would have anything
                  to do with him after that, and when he lectured on the sutras, no one came.
                  The Dharma Masters ganged up and told all the disciples and good people
                  of faith, 'If Dau Sheng lectures, don't go. Anyone who listens to his Sutra
                  lectures will fall into the hells.'</p>
              <p>Since the whole reason the good men and women of faith were studying
                  the Buddhadharma was to avoid falling into the hells, when they heard they
                  would fall into the hells if they went to Dharma Master Dau Sheng's Sutra
                  lectures, they didn't dare go to listen.</p>
              <p>"Dharma Master Dau Sheng was not one to remain silent, but was determined
                  to deliver Sutra lectures. He said, 'Okay, you won't come to listen? Then
                  I'll go lecture to the rocks and see what they do.' And so he went of to
                  Hu Ch'iu Mountain and collected several hundred rocks from all over the
                  area. He set them up in front of him and said, 'I invite you to a Sutra
                  lecture. Be good rocks and sit there nice and still.' It turned out that
                  the rocks were very obedient. They didn't run off or roll away, but stayed
                  right where he put them. When he got to the passage about not having the
                  Buddha-nature, he said, 'That isn't correct. have the Buddha-nature too.
                  "Those with and without sentience identically perfect the wisdom of all
                  modes." will become Buddhas too. <span>I SAID DO HAVE THE BUDDHA
                  NATURE! DO YOU AGREE?'</span></p>
              <p>"What do you think the rocks did then? Probably, although they were
                  supposed to enter , they had not quite gotten into it and had not yet had
                  a chance to fall asleep. When the rocks heard the Dharma Master ask that
                  question, they all jumped to attention and started moving. This dull rock
                  nodded its head, and that dull stone nodded its head. They all nodded in
                  agreement, bumping into each other, because each would hit the rock in
                  front of it.</p>
              <p>"Someone might wonder who verified that really happened. It is not something
                  that the venerable Dau-sheng said himself. It was said by those who opposed
                  him. How did they end up saying such a thing? The reason people were against
                  him in the first place was that he lectured too well. His eloquence was
                  unobstructed, as if lotuses were blooming on his tongue. Almost everyone
                  was jealous of the way he could come up with explanations that never occurred
                  to anyone else, and of how he could make the sutras come alive, as it were.
                  That is the way people are. If someone is better than they are, they get
                  jealous, and if they are better than someone else, they look down on that
                  person. Living beings have that kind of knowledge and outlook. And so the
                  people of his time formed a faction in opposition to Dharma Master Dau
                  Sheng. When he went to the mountains to lecture to the rocks, some of them
                  followed him on the sly to see what he was doing. Then, when he lectured
                  there and all the rocks began to move, nodding their heads--without being
                  blown by the wind or splashed by the rain--the Dharma Masters who were
                  spying on him, those who believed in him and even those who were against
                  him, all saw what occurred. That is the origin of the saying,</p>
              <p><em><span>When the Venerable Dau Sheng spoke the Dharma,</span></em> <br><em><span>Dull rocks nodded their heads.</span></em></p>
              <p>"Afterwards, when the had been completely translated, it turned out
                  that the Sutra itself says that also have the Buddha-nature. That proved
                  that Dharma Master Dau Sheng had completely understood the doctrine without
                  having seen the entire Sutra; it showed the extent of his wisdom and insight.
                  Afterward this incident even those who had opposed him no longer did so
                  and came to bow to him.</p>
              <p>"The meaning of the dull rocks nodding their heads is that those who
                  had no faith in him were the dull rocks--otherwise how could they have
                  failed to believe in him? Yet in the end even those who had been jealous
                  and opposed him prostrated themselves before him." (WM 71-73)</p>

              <p>The meditator starts concentrating and knowing of mind in breathing air in and out from the nose.You realize the difficulites to put your mind in breathing in and out for long hour .Why? The mind don't want to stay in one nose state.The mind wil be diverted to outside thinking from the body.Oh..If he put the mind in breathing in and out, the mind don't want to stay .The mind is attached to outside other five sense door(eye,ear,tongue,body and thinking) frequently. After that , his lower body tell the mind my leg is painful due to no movement parts of the body during the meditation.You mind is diverted to painful leg.He realize he cannot control the state changes of mind and body.It happen by naturally in body and mind.He feel and concentrate  arising and perishing of changes of painfulness and mind in the body and mind.This is the beginning of Dhamma nature in the body and mind by meditation method.</p>

              <p>Actually not true. Intellectual ability is not related to Buddhahood at all, and being intellectual does not make one an inch closer to Buddhahood. There are lots of intellects who are far far away from enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Worse still, those with great intellect may abuse his intelligence in the wrong way -- creating nuclear bombs, causing mass destruction and harm for selfish benefits, and so on. This 'intellect' and 'cleverness' has nothing to do with the wisdom of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Finally Buddha-Nature cannot be compared with "more" and "less". Why? Because Buddha-Nature is Equal, it is the Universal Equality of all beings and all phenomenon. Nothing can be added or subtracted from Buddha Nature for its nature is empty and self-perfected in all beings. No human intellect or qualities add a single bit to buddha-nature -- likewise being an animal subtracts not a single bit of Buddha-Nature of it.</p>
              <p>As Heart Sutra also says -- not produced. Not destroyed, not defiled, not pure, and they neither increase nor diminish. If anyone sees that one's buddha nature is more than the other or the other's buddha nature is more than mine, he obviously do not know what is Buddha-Nature. One who realises Buddha Nature sees the same Buddha Nature in everyone -- he perceives all beings and all phenomenon as equal.</p>
              <p>p.s. I was reminded of Hui-Neng's story as well:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"><a href="http://sped2work.tripod.com/huineng.html">http://sped2work.tripod.com/huineng.html</a><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">His Holiness Hui Neng, who became the great Sixth Patriarch of Ch'an (Japanese Zen) was a poor 
                  illiterate peasant boy from Hsin Chou of Kwangtung. One day, after he had delivered firewood to a 
                  shop, he overheard a man reciting the following line from the "Diamond Sutra" - "Depending upon 
                  no-thing, you must find your own mind." Instantly, Hui Neng became Enlightened. The full verse 
                  said: "All Bodhisattvas (Compassionate Ones) should develop a pure mind which clings to no-thing 
                  whatsoever; and so he should establish it."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">The man who recited this sutra encouraged Hui Neng to 
                  meet the Fifth Zen Patriarch, Hung Jen, at the Tung Chian 
                  Monastery in the Huang Mei District of Chi Chou. Hui Neng 
                  said to the Fifth Patriarch: "I am a commoner from Hsin 
                  Chou Kwangtung (today, near Canton in the south of China). 
                  I have traveled far to pay you respect, and I ask for nothing 
                  but Buddhahood." "You are a native of Kwangtung, a 
                  barbarian? How can you expect to be a Buddha?" asked the 
                  Patriarch. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>"Although there are northern men and southern 
                  men, north and south make no difference to their Buddha 
                  Nature. A barbarian is different from Your Holiness 
                  physically, but there is no difference in our Buddha Nature."</strong></span> Master Hung Jen immediately accepted Hui Neng as his 
                  disciple, but he had to hide this fact from the very educated 
                  northern monks at the monastery. At the time of the Fifth 
                  Patriarch, Ch'an was still influenced by Indian Buddhism, 
                  which did not emphasize direct awakening, but the importance of study and metaphysical debates. 
                  To protect Hui Neng, the Patriarch sent him to the kitchen to split firewood and pound rice for 
                  eight months.</span></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Don't wish to add to more speculations of Buddha Nature.</p>
              <p>Just wanna stress that Buddha Nature cannot be intellectualised and conceptualised.</p>
              <p>Whatever that is intellectualised is within the realm of mental activities.</p>
              <p>If there is no initial experience of Buddha Nature, the mental realm will never be able to understand it. </p>
              <p>Also, equally important is that the initial first glimpse of it, will very quickly be miscontrued too. And therefore is also not synonymous to enlightenment. But it can be described as an initial awakening.</p>
              <p>Beyond the first glimpsed is a continuous series of refinements towards the ability to understand it better. This usually happens in a series of major insights or realisations plus countless cycles of mini-self recognitions (or pattern clearing). These can take years or even lifetimes.</p>

              <p>Wise people had not added a single bit to his Buddha Nature -- his Buddha Nature is non increasing and non decreasing. It is just that since the clouds obscuring the vast sky or the sun has been removed, it becomes revealed. One's Buddha-Nature then reveals itself when these obscuration and ignorance has been removed (i.e. the clouds obscuring the sky/sun has been removed to reveal the sun).</p>
              <p>In reality not a single bit of Buddha-Nature has been added -- the Sky has always been the Sky, it has always been infinite, vast, limitless and inconceivable, whether there are clouds or not. Not a bit of sky-ness can be added or subtracted. When clouds has dissipated to reveal the vast sky, in actuality nothing has been added -- just what is always so now becomes revealed. Similarly, our Buddha-Nature which is sky-like, in which all merits and wisdom is inherent, cannot increase nor decrease.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #666666; font-size: normal;">æœ¬ ä½“ è‡ª æ€§ å…· è¶³ ä¸€ åˆ‡ åŠŸ å¾·ï¼Œ åœ¨ åœ£ ä¸� å¢žï¼Œ åœ¨ å‡¡ ä¸� å‡� -- <a href="http://www.humanbliss.com.sg/blissful_articledetails.asp?articleNo=429">http://www.humanbliss.com.sg/blissful_articledetails.asp?articleNo=429</a><br></span></p>
              <p>In Buddhism, è¾©æ‰�æ— ç¢� is not because one is smart, but because one has realised one's true nature and thus cannot be obstructed by doubts and questions. One who realises his true nature will be able to answer a dharma question in ways that no others can do so. His dharma eye and wisdom eye will open, a.k.a the third eye between the eyebrow. He will be able to discern all dharma questions and works and react accordingly and know whether it is right or wrong. This is not through thinking and book knowledge, but through his Wisdom Eye. It is through this wisdom eye that his dharma teachings spontaneously flows out of his own nature into creative works, poems, speeches, etc. An enlightened person can not only explain all dharma texts in his own words -- he can also teach the dharma without refering to any texts but spontaneously out of his wisdom and experience. Without thinking, but through wisdom.</p>
              <p>One who realises his true nature will at once grasp the essence of every single sutra in the Tripitaka, not just one. That means even if he did not read any sutras, he will still be able to answer your questions on the sutras. Examples are like 6th Patriarch Hui-Neng, who could not read and only ever heard one verse from the Diamond Sutra and attained enlightenment. After his enlightenment, he was able to explain all questions posed by others on the various sutras. My Taiwanese Teacher as well -- he was also illiterate, the only sutra he read was the Diamond Sutra and he spent 4 years flipping through the dictionary in order to understand the words, but after his enlightenment he could explain very well every single sutra from questions posed by his students.</p>
              <p>Of course such a will be able to describe the dharma in his own words or poems because he had direct experience. Even if one reads all the sutras in the world, without enlightenment or direct experience, it is only intellectual/book knowledge.</p>
              <p>Also, there are dumb/stupid people who attain enlightenment. Which shows that enlightenment has nothing to do with human intellect.</p>

              <p>..."I think the genius of Buddhadharma is that it really provides a workable path to do
                          this inquiry through. Anybody can do it. Even if you can't memorize anything. It is a
                          do-it-yourself, liberating Dharma.</p>
              <p>One of my favorite stories is about the Arhat Chunda. He was quite stupid. When his
                          brother became a monk, Chunda just wanted to do what his brother did. So he went to
                          Ananda, Buddha's attendant. But holy Ananda said, "Sorry. You're too stupid."
                          Ananda thought this kid was too stupid to become a monk because he couldn't remember the
                          rules, the chants, the teachings. So the elder brother and his stupid little brother went
                          to the Buddha, for the Buddha was extremely wise, kind, and compassionate. He scanned the
                          past lives of this young, stupid boy, Chunda. He saw in there one tiny root of merit that
                          could help him get enlightened. He said it didn't matter how dull-minded he was. It didn't
                          matter that he couldn't memorize anything. It didn't matter if he could remember even one
                          rule. The Buddha said to Ananda, "Ananda, you're not the Buddha, so you couldn't see
                          that this kid can get enlightened. But I'm the Buddha and I'm going to ordain him because
                          he can get enlightened. He has one good root of merit from a past life. He can do it, too.
                          Watch over this little child." (This story always brings tears to my eyes.)</p>
              <p>So Buddha ordained the kid. The kid couldn't remember even one rule, or how to wear his
                          robes. You know, it's complicated to be a monk. All the monks were studying and
                          memorizing. There were a lot of teachings. There were 253 rules of monastic ordination.
                          But the stupid, youthful Chunda couldn't remember anything.</p>
              <p>Finally, the brethren gave him the job of cleaning off the sandals of the monks. Chunda
                          cleaned the sandals while the other monks were getting teachings. Since there weren't any
                          books in those days, 2500 years ago in India, nothing was written down; the monks had to
                          memorize the teachings. Chunda wanted to practice like the other monks, and get this
                          enlightenment thing he heard about every day. So he asked the Buddha how he could get this
                          enlightenment thing. The Buddha said, "When you're scraping mud and sweeping the
                          floors, just think, 'Now I am purifying all the obscurations of the mind.'" So he
                          gave him a little two-line verse. "With each cleaning of the sandals, I am cleaning
                          off the obscurations of the shining, perfect mind." The Buddha asked him to repeat
                          it. He repeated it. The Buddha said, "Can you remember that?" He said,
                          "Yes."</p>
              <p>Then dumb Chunda went out and tried to repeat the verse. "With each scraping of
                          the dirt, I am cleaning..." And he couldn't remember it. But he had good karma and
                          had gentle Ananda around to remind him of the verse. Still, Chunda forgot again. Then
                          Sariputra the learned came out, and Chunda asked him to remind him. Finally, the Buddha
                          came back and said to Chunda, "Are you cleaning the sandals?" He said,
                          "Yes." Buddha asked, "Are you cleaning the dust off the floor?" Chunda
                          said, "Yes." And Buddha asked, "Have you cleaned the obscurations off the
                          shining, perfect mind?" Suddenly Chunda was enlightened! He realized that the sandals
                          with the dirt are still the sandals. The floor even with the dust is still the floor.
                          Everything is just as it is. He became an arhat, a fully liberated sage.</p>
              <p>In those days, wherever the Buddha went, the people would always try to serve lunch,
                          the main meal of the day, to him and the arhats. They thought if they gave Buddha lunch
                          they would get the most merit, and if they gave the arhats lunch they would get almost as
                          much merit. But if they couldn't catch any arhats, they would feed the ordinary monks and
                          get a little less merit. Everyone knew how stupid Chunda was, and they didn't believe he
                          was an enlightened arhat. But wherever Buddha went, he saved a seat for Chunda, because he
                          said he was the purest-minded, least proud arhat. Purest-minded because he didn't know
                          anything. And least proud because he was so simple, so humble, so undemanding and easy to
                          be with.</p>
              <p><strong>Unfortunately, <em>we</em> are not that stupid. We know too much. Or should I say, we
                          think so much, we know so little. If we could just be ourselves, and take the path that is
                          genuinely for us, it would be so easy. Imagine if Chunda was trying to become a Buddhist
                          scholar, he never would have gotten enlightened. But he was content to clean the monks'
                          shoes because he loved his brother and Buddha and the other monks. And it had to be done,
                          so he did it. And he had a little teaching, a little verse that fit into that. That's why
                          Thich Nhat Hanh gives everybody a little verse. He has a little verse for eating, for
                          waking up, for toilet, for going to sleep, because one little verse can be enough to fully
                          awaken you to the fullness and richness of the present moment. </strong></p>

              <p>BTW, in reality there is no "your buddha nature" and "my buddha nature" -- Buddha-Nature is like the sky, in which divisions and boundaries such as "you", "me", "mine", and so on are absent.</p>
              <p>All perceived separations are just that -- perceptions, due to ignorance of our true nature.</p>

              <p>Hence any questions related to "my Buddha Nature" and "his Buddha Nature", "more", "less", "increase", "decrease", or "him", "me", "mine", are really irrelevant simply because such notions are false.</p>

              <p>Animals cannot practice in that lifetime, they cannot attain enlightenment within that lifetime, but their Buddha-Nature is not a single bit less than a fully enlightened being and thus they will attain enlightenment in future lifetimes as a human. Why? Their ignorance and whatever karmic obscurations are only Temporary clouds obscuring the sky. In reality the presence and clarity of Buddha Nature is complete and uninterrupted. "Your" Buddha-Nature is not a single bit less than Shakyamuni Buddha's Buddha-Nature. And when a person attains Buddhahood what does he see? The same self-perfected Buddha-Nature since beginningless beginning that was ever-present and has never left whether you were in hell, in animal realm, in human realm or the gods realm. It is as Heart Sutra described -- not produced, not destroyed, not
                                                              defiled, not pure, and they neither increase nor diminish. Its nature is luminosity/pure awareness and its essence is emptiness.</p>
              <p>If you have read my reply to rokkie, you'll understand why Buddha-Nature can never "increase", "decrease", or be "more", "less" etc. Buddha-Nature is like the infinite, limitless sky and our ignorance are like clouds temporarily blocking the sky. The sky (the Buddha Nature) is the same whether for the animal or for the Buddha. The Buddha simply no longer have that layer of clouds obscuring his full view.</p>
              <p>Furthermore there is no "my Buddha Nature", "your Buddha Nature", "me", "you", "mine", "yours" in Buddha-Nature -- Buddha-Nature is like the sky that is infinite -- no boundaries and divisions are possible -- that is our true nature. All notions of "me" and "you" are illusory -- Buddha Nature is vast luminous emptiness with completely no separation at all. All qualities, merits, wisdom are already inherent in Buddha Nature but temporarily obscured. Since in Buddha-Nature there is no "you" and "me", how can we compare one's Buddha-Nature with another? "I", "me", "mine", "you", "yours", are simply illusions. Reality is boundless -- no boundaries, empty, luminous.</p>
              <p>The emptiness and the absence of self is in fact Tathagathagarbha/Buddha-Nature. And there are many names we attribute to this sparking pure awareness known as Buddha-Nature/Tathagatha-garbha, etc. Padmasambhava says: <br> <br> 6.</p>
              <p>As for this sparkling awareness, which is called "mind,"<br> Even though one says that it exists, it does not actually exist.<br> (On the other hand) as a source, it is the origin of the diversity of all the bliss of Nirvana and all of the sorrow of Samsara.<br> And as for it¡¯s being something desirable; it is cherished alike in the Eleven Vehicles.<br> With respect to its having a name, the various names that are applied to it are inconceivable (in their numbers).<br> Some call it "the nature of the mind" or "mind itself."<br> Some Tirthikas call it by the name Atman or "the Self."<br> The Sravakas call it the doctrine of Anatman or "the absence of a self."<br> The Chittamatrins call it by the name Chitta or "the Mind."<br> Some call it the Prajnaparamita or "the Perfection of Wisdom."<br> Some call it the name Tathagata-garbha or "the embryo of Buddhahood."<br> Some call it by the name Mahamudra or "the Great Symbol."<br> Some call it by the name "the Unique Sphere."<br> Some call it by the name Dharmadhatu or "the dimension of Reality."<br> Some call it by the name Alaya or "the basis of everything."<br> And some simply call it by the name "ordinary awareness."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, the school of ç¥žç§€ doesn't really utilize koans to what I know. It is the tradition of Linji (Rinzai), the sudden awakening school, that emphasizes the use of koans.</p>

              <p>Your true nature is 
              something never lost to you even in moments of delusion, nor is it gained 
              at the moment of Enlightenment. It is the Nature of the Bhutatathata. In 
              it is neither delusion nor right understanding. It fills the Void everywhere 
              and is intrinsically of the substance of the One Mind.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Master (Huang Po) said to me: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All the Buddhas and all sentient beings are nothing 
                          but the One Mind, beside which nothing exists.</span> This Mind, which is without 
                          beginning, is unborn and indestructible.  It is not green nor yellow, and has 
                          neither form nor appearance.  It does not belong to the categories of things 
                          which exist or do not exist, nor can it be thought of in terms of new or old.  
                          It is neither long nor short, big nor small, for it transcends all limits, 
                          measure, names, traces and comparisons.  It is that which you see before you 
                          - begin to reason about it and you at once fall into error.  It is like the 
                          boundless void which cannot be fathomed or measured. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The One Mind alone is 
                          the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient 
                          things, but that sentient beings are attached to forms and so seek externally 
                          for Buddhahood.  By their very seeking they lose it, for that is using the 
                          Buddha to seek for the Buddha and using mind to grasp Mind.  Even though they 
                          do their utmost for a full aeon, they will not be able to attain it.  They do 
                          not know that, if they put a stop to conceptual thought and forget their 
                          anxiety, the Buddha will appear before them, for this Mind is the Buddha and 
                          the Buddha is all living beings.  It is not the less for being manifested in 
                          ordinary beings, nor is it greater for being manifest in the Buddhas.</span></span></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">If you are not absolutely convinced that the 
                          Mind is the Buddha, and if you are attached to forms, practices and 
                          meritorious performances, your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible 
                          with the Way.   The Mind <em>is</em> the Buddha, nor are there any other 
                          Buddhas or any other mind.  It is bright and spotless as the void, 
                          having nor form or appearance whatsoever.  To make use of your minds to 
                          think conceptually is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. 
                          Awake only to the One Mind, and there is nothing whatsoever to be attained.    </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">If you students of the Way do not awaken to 
                          this Mind substance, you will overlay Mind with conceptual thought, you will 
                          seek the Buddha outside of yourselves, and you will remain attached to forms, 
                          pious practices and so on, all of which are harmful and not at all the way to 
                          supreme knowledge. </span></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">Our original Buddha-Nature is, in highest 
                      truth, devoid of any atom of objectivity.  It is void, omnipresent, silent, 
                      pure; it is glorious and mysterious peaceful joy - and that is all.  Enter 
                      deeply into it by awakening to it yourself.   That which is before you 
                      is it, in all its fullness, utterly complete.  There is naught beside.  
                      Even if you go through all the stages of a Bodhisattva's progress towards 
                      Buddhahood, one by one; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>when at last, in a single flash, you attain to full 
                      realization, you will only be realizing the Buddha-Nature which has been with 
                      you all the time; and by the foregoing stages you will have added nothing to it 
                      at all.    You will come to look upon those aeons of work 
                      and achievement as no better than unreal actions performed in a dream.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">This is why the Tathagata said, "I truly 
                      attained nothing from complete, unexcelled enlightenment."  He also said: 
                      "This Dharma is absolutely without distinctions, neither high nor low, and its 
                      name is Bodhi."  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is pure Mind, which is the source of everything and 
                      which, whether appearing as sentient beings or Buddhas, or as the rivers and 
                      mountains of the world which has form, or as that which is formless, or penetrating 
                      the whole universe, is absolutely without distinctions, there being no such 
                      entities as selfness and otherness.  </strong></span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">This pure Mind, the source of everything, 
                  shines forever and on all with the brilliance of its own perfection.  But 
                  the people of this world do not awake to it, regarding only that which sees, 
                  hears feels and knows as mind.  Blinded by their own sight, hearing, 
                  feeling and knowing, they do not perceive the spiritual brilliance of the 
                  source-substance.   <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If they would only eliminate all conceptual 
                  thought in a flash, that source-substance would manifest itself like the sun 
                  ascending through the void and illuminating the whole universe without hindrance 
                  or bounds. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">Therefore, if you students of the way seek to 
                  progress through seeing, hearing, feeling and knowing, when you are deprived of 
                  your perceptions your way to Mind will be cut off and you will find nowhere to 
                  enter.  Only realize that, though real Mind is expressed in these 
                  perceptions, it neither forms part of them, nor is separate from them.   
                  You should not start reasoning from these perceptions, nor allow them to give 
                  rise to conceptual thought; yet nor should you seek the One Mind apart from them 
                  or abandon them in your pursuit of the Dharma.  Do not keep them, nor 
                  abandon them, nor dwell in them, nor cleave to them. Above, below and around 
                  you, all is spontaneously existing, for there is nowhere which is outside the 
                  Buddha-Mind.     </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">***</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">Suppose a warrior, forgetting he was already 
                  wearing his pearl on his forehead, were to seek for it elsewhere, he could 
                  travel the whole world without finding it.  But if someone who knew what 
                  was wrong were to point it out to him, the warrior would immediately realize 
                  that the pearl had been there all the time. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: medium;">So, if you students of the Way are mistaken 
                  about your own real Mind, not recognizing that it is the Buddha, you will 
                  consequently look for him elsewhere, indulging in various achievements and 
                  practices and expecting to attain realization through such graduated practices.   
                  But even after aeons of diligent searching, you will not be able to attain the 
                  Way. These methods cannot be compared to the sudden elimination of conceptual 
                  thought, in the certain knowledge that there is nothing at all which has 
                  absolute existence, nothing on which to lay hold, nothing on which to rely, 
                  nothing in which to abide, nothing subjective or objective.     </span></p>

              <p>Actually not really. It simply was that Shenxiu at that time has not awakened. But many people don't know, Shenxiu also attained enlightenment later on and was passed the Zen lineage.</p>
              <p>As for Theravada, Theravadins have the same realisation as Hui-Neng but express it in different ways. The approach is also different because Theravadin follow a more gradual method.</p>
              <p>BTW, contrary to popular misunderstandings, when Hui-Neng wrote the <span style="color: #cc0033;">è�©æ��æœ¬æ— æ ‘</span>ï¼Œ<span style="color: #cc0033;">æ˜Žé•œäº¦é�žå�°</span>ï¼Œ<span style="color: #cc0033;">æœ¬æ�¥æ— ä¸€ç‰©</span>ï¼Œ<span style="color: #cc0033;">ä½•å¤„æƒ¹å°˜åŸƒ</span>, he has not attained great awakening. He has glimpses of his true nature but has not yet attained great awakening.. much less understood the true meaning of Mahayana. What he experiences is the formlessness of buddha-nature but not the non-duality of emptiness and form.</p>
              <p>That is why the 5th patriarch rubbed that statement off with his shoe and says he is not there yet. He only attained the great awakening when meeting with the 5th patriarch later that night.</p>

              <p>the thing is like this ,huineng å�ªæ˜¯åœ¨ä»–ä»¬çš„å¯ºåº™é‡Œæ‰“æ�‚ï¼Œhe don't have enough reputation to become the succeding  patriarch .</p>
              <p>so when he write that poem,the fifth patriarch ,cannot praise him for awaken publicly.ä»–å�ªèƒ½ï¼Œæ™šä¸ŠæŠŠæƒ èƒ½å�«åˆ° ä»–çš„æˆ¿é—´ï¼ŒæŠŠè¡£é’µç»™ä»–ï¼Œyibo is redeems as the simbol to succeding patriarch .then the fitth patrarch ask huineng to run away,some how ,he tell huineng something in secret ,may help him improve his enlightenment.</p>
