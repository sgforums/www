              <p>Only sentient beings have buddha nature, otherwise its dharma nature. But they are essentially the same.</p>
              <p>The reason why it is called Buddha-Nature or the embryo of Buddhahood (Tathagathagarbha) for sentient beings is that we all have a potential to attain Buddhahood. Once Buddhahood is achieved/actualized, Tathagathagarbha turns into Dharmakaya (fa3 sheng1).</p>
              <p>Inanimate/non-sentient forms cannot attain Buddhahood, so they are called dharma nature. But it's essentially the same nature of no-nature of luminous-emptiness.</p>

              <p>Buddhahood is of course real, Shakyamuni Buddha attained Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>If you practice well you can attain various bhumis of Bodhisattvahood, you can attain enlightenment and realise your true nature, and I know many people who have become enlightened and are real enlightened Bodhisattvas living today.</p>
              <p>However they have not yet attained full Buddhahood which takes many many lifetimes of cultivation, wisdom and accumulating merits.</p>
              <p>But they already have been liberated from samsara and all sufferings.</p>

              <p>Hence we must plant deep conditions with the triple gems -- i.e. take refuge in the 3 treasures, practice the dharma well, associate with the wise and practitioners, follow an enlightened master, etc. When these seeds of dharma is deeply rooted in your mind, you can easily have the opportunity to encounter the dharma again in a future life.</p>
              <p>Practice so that you can gain enlightenment in this present life. If you do, then you will be not need to worry because you will not be able to retrogress that much from the path and will be on a certain path to full enlightenment. Even if you did not, the sincere practice will certainly plant a deep karmic affinity with the triple gems.</p>
