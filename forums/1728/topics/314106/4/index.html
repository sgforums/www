              <p>Thanks for the sharing... What do you mean by dropping the
              conscious awareness? My understanding is that its a sense of an
              inner watcher and constriction to the head looking outwards. When
              there is a release of conscious awareness from body/mind, awareness
              becomes expansive like space without subject/object duality. Here,
              awareness is naturally and spontaneously aware but not
              self-conscious. It seems like the universe Is without a center of
              experience or "self"... the scenery sees, but no seer, the sound
              hears, but no hearer.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;">At the beginning of
                                      Third Path, most practitioners think: “I’ll just complete more
                                      cycles of insight, like I did before, and this will do the trick.”
                                      They don’t tend to understand what it is they have attained all
                                      that well yet, nor its deeper implications. <strong>By the mature stage of
                                      Third Path, which can take months to years to show up, the
                                      practitioner is more and more able to see the emptiness, selfless,
                                      centerlessness, luminosity, etc. of phenomena in real-time, so much
                                      so that it can be very difficult to notice what artificial
                                      dualities remain.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;">As they cycle, they
                                      will enter new territory, possibly causing some uncertainty or
                                      instability, and with each Review phase<strong> they tend to really feel
                                      that they have done it until they begin to notice the limits of
                                      their practice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There can be this nagging something in the
                                      background that things aren’t done, and yet figuring out exactly
                                      what the problem is can be very slippery. It is a bit like being in
                                      the stages before stream entry, trying to figure out what exactly
                                      needs to be done.</span> They need to notice something that has nothing to
                                      do with the cycles, to finally untangle the knot of perception at
                                      its core, but doing this can be a real trick. It is a very strange
                                      place, as one seems to know the dharma all the way to the end and
                                      yet somehow it just isn’t quite enough. </strong>In that vein, it is
                                      interesting to note that I wrote the vast majority of this book
                                      while I was some sort of anagami, and on reflection I got just
                                      about everything right. My emphases are slightly different now, but
                                      the basics are all the same.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;">As things progress,
                                      anagamis begin to tire of the cycles to a small or large degree and
                                      begin to look to something outside of them or not related to them
                                      for the answer to the final question. Finally, the cycles of

                                      only when I had gotten so sick of the cycles and realized that they

                                      seem to blink initially. It may go through cycles of flashing open
                                      just after a Fruition and then slowly fading over a few hours (at
                                      least on retreat) as each round of physical sensations, then mental

                                      reality as it is. Review cycles may occur many times during each
                                      flash, but when the eye is open they seem rather irrelevant in
                                      comparison to keeping the level of clarity and acceptance high
                                      enough to keep the eye open. When the eye fades, the familiar
                                      insight cycles may seem like pure drudgery, with the focus being of
                                      practice initially lost in getting through the cycles and then
                                      gradually shifting again to getting clear enough to get the eye to
                                      open again. The themes that occupy center stage go through a cycle
                                      that is very much like a progress cycle.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;">Finally, the Wisdom
                                      Eye cycles and insight cycles all converge, and the thing stays
                                      open from then on, which is to say that at that point it all seems
                                      the same whether or not the eye is open, which it actually was.
                                      That being seen, nothing can erode or disturb the centerlessness of
                                      perspective. Done is what is to be done, and life goes on. That
                                      there are arahats who have opened the Wisdom Eye but had it fade
                                      and those who have opened it and had it stay open is rarely
                                      mentioned but worth knowing.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608; font-size: 100%;">For the arahat who
                                      has kept the thing open, there is nothing more to be gained on the
                                      ultimate front from insight practices, as “done is what is to be
                                      done”. That said, insight practices can still be of great benefit
                                      to them for a whole host of reasons, there is a ton they can learn
                                      just like everyone else about everything else there is to learn.
                                      They can grow, develop, change, work and participate in this
                                      strange human drama just like everyone else.</span></p>

              if it is not engaged for too long, the tension will self-release.
              This is what I meant as the experience of rising and falling waves.
              The body tension is also what give a person a kind of
              identification as the body. With the tension gone, there can be at

              Dan took about 1 year to progress from Stream Enterer to Once
              Returner to Anagami, but got stuck 7 years in the Anagami

              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">...Those of Third
              Path have shifted their understanding of what progress is from
              those of Second Path, and have been to see that it is about seeing
              the emptiness, selflessness, impermanence, etc. of sensations in
              daily life and begin to see that they have the ability to do this.
              This can be a long, developmental process from the first time they
              notice this to it becoming a nearly complete experience. Thus,
              Third Path tends to be a long path, though it doesn’t have to
              be.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">At the beginning of
              Third Path, most practitioners think: “I’ll just complete more
              cycles of insight, like I did before, and this will do the trick.”
              They don’t tend to understand what it is they have attained all
              that well yet, nor its deeper implications. <strong>By the mature
              stage of Third Path, which can take months to years to show up, the
              practitioner is more and more able to see the emptiness, selfless,
              centerlessness, luminosity, etc. of phenomena in real-time, so much
              so that it can be very difficult to notice what artificial
              dualities remain.</strong></span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">As they cycle, they
              will enter new territory, possibly causing some uncertainty or
              instability, and with each Review phase <strong>they tend to really
              feel that they have done it until they begin to notice the limits
              of their practice. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">There
              can be this nagging something in the background that things aren’t
              done, and yet figuring out exactly what the problem is can be very
              slippery. It is a bit like being in the stages before stream entry,
              trying to figure out what exactly needs to be done.</span> They
              need to notice something that has nothing to do with the cycles, to
              finally untangle the knot of perception at its core, but doing this
              can be a real trick. It is a very strange place, as one seems to
              know the dharma all the way to the end and yet somehow it just
              isn’t quite enough.</strong> In that vein, it is interesting to
              note that I wrote the vast majority of this book while I was some
              sort of anagami, and on reflection I got just about everything
              right. My emphases are slightly different now, but the basics are
              all the same.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">As things progress,
              anagamis begin to tire of the cycles to a small or large degree and
              begin to look to something outside of them or not related to them
              for the answer to the final question. Finally, the cycles of
              insight, the states of concentration, the powers, and all the other
              perks and prerogatives of their stage of awakening or concentration
              abilities (if they developed them) hold no appeal and only lead to
              more unsatisfying cycles.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">I completed around
              27 full, complete insight cycles with mind-blowing A&amp;P Events,
              Ass-kicking Dark Nights, Equanimity phases, and what seemed to be
              brand new, fresh Fruitions and Review phases between third and
              fourth path. There is nothing special about that number, as I
              mentioned previously in my descriptions of the problem that I call

              become integrated into this new, correct and direct perception of
              reality as it is. Review cycles may occur many times during each
              flash, but when the eye is open they seem rather irrelevant in
              comparison to keeping the level of clarity and acceptance high
              enough to keep the eye open. When the eye fades, the familiar
              insight cycles may seem like pure drudgery, with the focus being of
              practice initially lost in getting through the cycles and then
              gradually shifting again to getting clear enough to get the eye to
              open again. The themes that occupy center stage go through a cycle
              that is very much like a progress cycle.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">Finally, the Wisdom
              Eye cycles and insight cycles all converge, and the thing stays
              open from then on, which is to say that at that point it all seems
              the same whether or not the eye is open, which it actually was.
              That being seen, nothing can erode or disturb the centerlessness of
              perspective. Done is what is to be done, and life goes on. That
              there are arahats who have opened the Wisdom Eye but had it fade
              and those who have opened it and had it stay open is rarely
              mentioned but worth knowing.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 15pt; vertical-align: top; font-family: verdana;"><span style="color: #2c2608;">For the arahat who
              has kept the thing open, there is nothing more to be gained on the
              ultimate front from insight practices, as “done is what is to be
              done”. That said, insight practices can still be of great benefit
              to them for a whole host of reasons, there is a ton they can learn
              just like everyone else about everything else there is to learn.
              They can grow, develop, change, work and participate in this
              strange human drama just like everyone else.</span></p>

              <p>Fearlessness plays a large part.</p>
              <p>A person can stay in non-dual is partly due to the willingness to drop away defenses. The 'sense of self' strive to protect and preserve itself.</p>
              <p>Presence can 'intuit' that nothing gets harmed even amidst apparent pain and destruction. This is not the same as a separate object that is not harmed despite apparent destruction. The latter description is I AM level understanding. Non-dual is different in that there is no concept of a separate 'true self/I AM' that is unharmed.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Fearlessness and willingness to drop once sank sufficiently deep into our inmost consciousness will result in the wave like sensation as described below.</p>
              <blockquote><strong>I am beginning to experience the benefit of sustained non-duality and no-self. The mind automatically comes to a rest... be it walking, standing, sitting or any position. </strong>The rest and joy of no-self is not something that the un-enlightened can experience. Also, increasingly the egoic mind is losing its power to condition. When there is no subject-object split, the sense of suffering is greatly reduced... The egoic mind still can trick one into engaging into a 'fight with reality', but it is losing its power to sustain. When the egoic mind arouse a bodily tension and if it is not engaged for too long, the tension will self-release. This is what I meant as the experience of rising and falling waves. The body tension is also what give a person a kind of identification as the body. With the tension gone, there can be at times no sense of body. The process is certainly not complete... but I have entered a new phase... that is characterised by the egoic mind losing its charge. The strength of Presence and 'fearlessness in deconstruction' plays a crucial role </blockquote>
              <p>The wave is like spiritual tai-chi. A strength, a momentum of its own to auto-release whatever clingings. Once a practitioner experiences this 'wave like auto release', confident arises in the practitioner that there is the ability to substain non-dual clarity. Best go along with this phrase :</p>
              <p>All sensations, experiences though vividly clear is nothing ultimate -- empty of inherent essence. Nothing to cling to.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>This is not a very accurate description as it is conceptual here. But the experience roughly translated to this. Dropping can still have a kind of knowingness or it can fully drop the conscious awareness too. <strong>The more dropping the more shiok :)</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Dedicate enough time to meditate and sit with the willingness to completely drop even the 'conscious portion' to 'build' up this 'wave'. It is the strength that prevents one from falling back and it is due to the arising of this 'wave' that a practitioner is now 'willing' to drop that 'conscious portion' -- Psychological death overcome in due time. This is most important. :) However, a practitioner should not be over-confident at this junture...'attachment' will 'wear' out this 'wave'. Good Luck!</p>

              <p>Also, sensation are just that. All part of the experience of being a specific species... in our case .. being human. The sensations are specific to human being.</p>
              <p>By human, we tend to think in terms of physical form or entity. However, human is really an experience and there is no-self there. Just the experience conditioned by the karmic conditionings perculiar to the specie.

                  comprehend the truth. Yet people are always trying to think up a barrier to the flow, to use
                  thoughts to stop thinking. Thoughts are like wildcats. We would never use one wildcat to tame
                  another. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #222222; font-size: normal;">How then do we enter the state of non-thought? We understand the non-substantial nature of both
                  the one who thinks and the thought itself. We understand that in reality there is not even a single
                  tiny thought of a thought, or a thinker either. When we bear witness to this reality, our own
                  testimony liberates us from bondage of thoughts of having no thoughts. </span></p>

                  the body. It’s like a lamp. The Buddha Nature is this flame. But we may still be conscious of
                  shadows. As we progress we feel that the body is the universe itself and that our Buddha Self

              <p><em><strong><a id="n-10" name="n-10" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.049.than.html#t-10">10</a>.</strong> In other words, the act of searching for non-becoming — or annihilation
              — is also a type of becoming. Although the Buddhist path aims at the
              cessation of becoming </em><em>(bhava), it does not attempt this
              cessation by trying to annihilate the process of becoming. Instead, it
              does so by focusing on what has already come to be </em><em>(bhuta),
              developing dispassion for what has come to be and for the nutriment —
              the causes — of what has come to be. With no more passion, there is no
              clinging to or taking sustenance from the causes of what has come to
              be. And through this lack of clinging or sustenance comes release. On
              this point see <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.031.than.html">SN 12.31</a> and <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/iti/iti.2.028-049.than.html">Iti 49</a>.</em></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><strong>Q. <br> “If interdependent origination arises in emptiness. Then, how can this 
                be if there is no elaboration in emptiness?” </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><strong>A. <br> “Emptiness and interdependent origination are non-dual. They are one. Even 
                to say non-dual is to miss the mark, because that implies that there might have 
                been a duality that was overcome. From the beginningless beginning, they have 
                always been one. There is no difference between them. It is not like there are 
                two divisions. When you see emptiness and interdependent origination dualistically, 
                it is the extrapolation of samsara, cyclic existence. Overcome duality and you 
                see cause and effect at the same time. Then everything arises together. That 
                is complete, non-dual emptiness and interdependent origination. In the text, 
                many examples are used to illustrate this truth of the non-dual union of emptiness 
                and interdependent origination. Nevertheless, let us take, for example, this 
                cup. As a relative manifestation or appearance that be experienced by our perceptual 
                mechanisms, the cup is something that is composite. It is made of smaller particles. 
                Is it not? It is made of atoms and molecules that become particular substances: 
                earth, air, fire, and water. All of those things are combined in such a way 
                as to produce what we call a cup. Then it is decorated, painted, and carved. 
                That is something that is made in Tibetan we say ‘Dütshe’: composite, 
                something that has been created. Causes and conditions have been brought together 
                in such a way to create a relatively existent manifestation that we can use 
                and interact with and perceive as what we call a cup. However, from its own 
                side, independent of causes and conditions, there is no ‘cupness’. 
                There is nothing arising as the ‘cup’ in and of itself apart from 
                that entire process of causes and conditions coming together. It has no essence. 
                Its essence is empty. In the ‘Prajña Paramita Hydraya’ Sutra, 
                the ‘Heart Sutra’, it says “Form is emptiness, and emptiness 
                is form. Other than emptiness there is no form, other than form there is no 
                emptiness.” All phenomena have that exact same nature. Whatever is experienced 
                within either cyclic existence, or its transcendence, has that exact same nature. 
                Its essence is empty and it is experienced as a result of interdependent origination. 
                To perceive things as alternate visions of emptiness and interdependent origination 
                is to remain an ordinary sentient being. To overcome the dualistic vision, to 
                perceive things simultaneously as emptiness and interdependent origination, 
                is to be Buddha. The great Arya Nagarjuna said: “Cyclic existence and its 
                transcendence (samsara and nirvana) are not two. Understanding the nature of 
                cyclic existence in itself is transcendence.” </strong></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><strong>Q. <br> Unintelligible question from the audience. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><strong>A. <br> “We have to talk a little about emptiness. The teachings of emptiness in 
                no way claim that what we perceive does not exist absolutely. We are not saying 
                that things made of atoms and molecules and have material reality literally 
                do not exist, and in that sense, illusory. We are saying that they have no self-nature. 
                They have no inherent existence. They have no solid, substantial, reality that 
                corresponds to their mode of appearance. They seem to be inherently existent, 
                yet they are not. This is the teaching of the great Middle Way School, Madhyamika. 
                There a couple of different schools of thought here, the Mind-Only School (Cittimatra) 
                says that everything is mind. The only thing that truly exists is the mind itself 
                and everything else is a projection of the mind. Mahamudra teachings say that 
                the actual nature of reality is such that it transcends postulation of either 
                existence or non-existence, or both, or neither. This is called the ‘Four 
                Extremes’. The Mahamudra view transcends them. From our relative level 
                of truth in Tibetan they say ‘Kun-Zop Dempa’ which is a fascinating 
                phrase . ‘Dempa’ means truth. ‘Kun-Zop’ means completely 
                false. Therefore the ‘completely false truth’, the relative truth 
                is a result of our mistaken perception. We perceive things to have inherent 
                existence when they really do not. Our minds grasp at what we perceive as solid 
                and real. Because of that mental grasping, we reify that which is in fact empty. 
                That is a mistake. That is an error. All appearances are our experience. They 
                are experienced by and in our own minds. Other than that, there is no possibility 
                of experience. All external appearance is a mental projection in the sense that 
                it is experienced by the mind. It has no solid inherent existence from its own 
                side. That is a mistake in perception.” </strong></span></p>
