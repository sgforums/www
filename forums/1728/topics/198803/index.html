            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting site...<br><br>In most religions and mystical path, the dissolving of the 'Self' is necessary for the experience of the divine.  The 'self' is always experienced as the ultimate block that prevents one from experiencing the transcendental.  Glimpses of the beyond arise when we are able to go beyond labels and concepts.<br><br>I respect her experience but would just like to add some comments:<br><br>On the experience of Â“AMnessÂ”:<br>The key when the Â‘IÂ’ drops away lies in Â“fusing into everythingÂ”.  Without this experience, it is still resting in Â“I AMÂ”, there is no breakthrough.  Even with the experience of Â“fusing into all thingsÂ”, it remains as a stage having an entry and exit point.  To experience pathless that is without entry and exit point is where the doctrine of anatta and emptiness steps in.<br><br>On the unchanging self:<br><blockquote>It is strange that when people want to know their real self, they start looking at relative bunches of ever changing concepts. Reality is that which underlies relativity. Reality is unchanging.<br>We must ask ourselves: Â“What is the only unchanging reality of our life? What is the only phenomenon that has never changed since we were born?Â”<br>The answer can readily be experienced when we close our eyes and go introspective. It is our sense of BEING. Our I AM-ness. Everybody can always experience the sense that they exist. That inner sense never changes and is there if we are happy, angry, sad, drunk,- whatever. Further, it cannot be localized within any part of the body. It is limitless and experienced by everyone the same way. It is infinite REALITY!</blockquote>When observing moment to moment changes, it is almost natural to conclude this way.  There must be an unchanging observer observing change is a logical deduction.  It is the result of the lightning flash changes, logical deduction and memories that create the impression of an unchanging entity.  There is continuity, but continuity with an unchanging entity is not necessary.<br><br>On feeling lightness and experiencing Â‘astral travelingÂ’:<br><blockquote>My own experience is that the density of the body seems to change. Years ago I experienced the phenomena of Â‘astral traveling.Â’ During this experience you have the feeling of leaving the coarser body and floating. At some stage you have to return to the body, and the feeling is not very pleasant. You are going from a feeling of freedom and Â‘lightnessÂ’ back into what feels like cold, dense, clay. This Â‘clayÂ’ is the collective emotions, experiences, and holding of the body. After some AMness has fallen away, the body feels lighter and less dense. You just keep feeling lighter and freer.</blockquote>The Â“densityÂ” and Â“lightnessÂ” is the weight of Â“losing her identification with certain aspect of the selfÂ”.  The power of this Â“identificationÂ” cannot be underestimated.<br>Next is her experience of Â‘astral travelingÂ’, if she is in a stage of absorption and then out of a sudden awareness, the eyes of awareness may allow her to witness something that is altogether different from the physical place but this does not necessary mean that Â‘consciousnessÂ’ has left and re-enter the body.  Consciousness is propelled by causes and conditions.  According to her conditions of absorption and clarity, just IS.<br><br>But then everyone has their own experiences.  Just my 2 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yes... just now a thought came up from my mind after reading a private message by someone else, and I did a search 'enlightenment is not the end', and the second result seems to be an article written less than a week ago coming from someone I know...<br><br><a href="http://www.ezinearticles.com/?Enlightenment-is-Not-Just-One-State&amp;id=236283" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezinearticles.com/?Enlightenment-is-Not-Just-One-State&amp;id=236283</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Many people has the notion that enlightenment is one state. Many also believe that when it is attained, a person is forever in that state.<br><br>The following is not a definitive article on this subject. It is just an expression of my own thoughts.<br><br>My opinion is that enlightenment is not just one state but is a progressive and gradual establishing of states of consciousness.<br><br>I, myself have not reach the end of the road. But from years on a spiritual quest, I can safely say that enlightenment happens in a series or stages of self-realisations and self-discoveries.<br><br>Usually there is a difference between an initial awakening and a later stabilisation of that stage that happens through practice or experiences.<br><br>Almost all stages of enlightenment can be said to be associated with Presence. However, the enlightening Presence comes in various degrees of intensity and clarity. The degree of intensity is directly dependent on the level and depth of one's clarity as well as one's realisations/discoveries.<br><br>Also, as one progresses along, the relationship or connections of oneself to the universe and existence at large also becomes clearer.<br><br>Below very briefly illustrates the progressive and stage-based nature of enlightenment:<br><br>When one first begin meditating, one may first experience the all-pervading Presence. This Presence, is most often experienced when thoughts are momentarily suspended. This Presence which exists in the Eternal Present Moment is our true self.<br><br>However such an experience can only be classified as an awakening to the true self.. which is no-self. This is because, after the meditation, the Presence seems to have disappeared. One cannot understand and find the connection of presence to our everyday life. Therefore one will have difficulty re-acquiring the Presence. And it takes many stages and series of realisation to understand the relationship of Presence to our phenomenal world. It can be said that the prolonged sustaining of Presence is dependent on the stages and depth of realisation.<br><br>Also, during the earlier stages we may mistaken another state to be the pure presence. For example, we may mistaken 'I AM' for pure presence. This is because the thinking mind has created a reflective image of Pure Presence. This reflection of the absolute is 'I AM'.<br><br>Usually, in order to pass through the 'I AM' stage, the person must move unto even deeper understandings. These understandings may include realising that one's personality is not the doer of action. This stage may persist for a while before the person realises the illusion of subject-object division. This stage involves recognising the hypnotic impression of there being an observer and the being observed. Here is where one begins to see through the illusionary nature of our phenomenal world.<br><br>I cannot comment on the stages before me as they are beyond me. Nevertheless, one can still see from the above description that enlightenment is not so straight-forward after all.<br><br>For your necessary discernment. Thank you for reading.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*note: not related to the website posted by Longchen*<br><br>A lecture by Rev. Dr Sheng-yen (1977)<br><br><strong>What is Chan?</strong><br><br>I wish to start by telling you that Chan is not the same as knowledge, yet knowledge is not completely apart from Chan. Chan is not just religion, yet the achievements of religion can be reached through Chan. Chan is not philosophy, yet philosophy can in no way exceed the scope of Chan. Chan is not science, yet the spirit of emphasising reality and experience is also required in Chan. Therefore, please do not try to explore the content of Chan motivated by mere curiosity, for Chan is not something new brought here [USA] by Orientals; Chan is present everywhere, in space without limit and time without end. However before the Buddhism of the East was propagated in the western world, the people of the West never knew of the existence of Chan. The Chan taught by Orientals in the West is not, in fact, the real Chan. It is the method to realise Chan. Chan was first discovered by a prince named Siddhartha Gautama (called Sakyamuni after his enlightenment), who was born in India about 2500 years ago. After he became enlightened and was called a Buddha, he taught us the method to know Chan. This method was transmitted from India to China, and then to Japan. In India it was called dhyana, which is pronounced Chan in Chinese, and Zen in Japanese. Actually, all three are identical.<br><br>Chan has universal and eternal existence. It has no need of any teacher to transmit it; what is transmitted by teachers is just the method by which one can personally experience this Chan.<br><br>Some people mistakenly understand Chan to be some kind of mysterious experience; others think that one can attain supernatural powers through the experience of Chan. Of course, the process of practising Chan meditation may cause various kinds of strange occurrences on the level of mental and physical sensation; and also, through the practice of unifying body and mind, one may be able to attain the mental power to control or alter external things. But such phenomena, which are looked upon as mysteries of religion, are not the aim of Chan practice, because they can only satisfy ones curiosity or megalomania, and cannot solve the actual problems of peoples lives.<br><br>Chan starts from the root of the problem. It does not start with the idea of conquering the external social and material environments, but starts with gaining thorough knowledge of ones own self. The moment you know what your self is, this I that you now take to be yourself will simultaneously disappear. We call this new knowledge of the notion of self enlightenment, or seeing ones basic nature. This is the beginning of helping you to thoroughly solve real problems. In the end, you will discover that you, the individual, together with the whole of existence, are but one totality which cannot be divided.<br><br>Because you yourself have imperfections, you therefore feel the environment is imperfect. It is like a mirror with an uneven surface the images reflected in it are also distorted. Or, it is like the surface of water disturbed by ripples the moon reflected in it is irregular and unsettled. If the surface of the mirror is clear and smooth, or if the air on the surface of the water is still and the ripples calmed, then the reflection in the mirror and the moon in the water will be clear and exact. Therefore, from the point of view of Chan, the major cause of the pain and misfortune suffered by humanity is not the treacherous environment of the world in which we live, nor the dreadful society of humankind, but the fact that we have never been able to recognise our basic nature. So the method of Chan is not to direct us to evade reality, nor to shut our eyes like the Australian ostrich when enemies come, and bury our heads in the sand, thinking all problems are solved. Chan is not a self-hypnotising idealism.<br><br>By the practice of Chan one can eliminate the I; not only the selfish, small I, but also the large I, which in philosophy is called Truth or the Essence. Only then is there absolute freedom. Thus an accomplished Chan practitioner never feels that any responsibility is a burden, nor does he feel the pressure that the conditions of life exert on people. He only feels that he is perpetually bringing the vitality of life into full activity. This is the expression of absolute freedom. Therefore the life of Chan is inevitably normal and positive, happy and open. The reason for this is that the practice of Chan will continually provide you with a means to excavate your precious mine of wisdom. The deeper the excavation, the higher the wisdom that is attained, until eventually you obtain all the wisdom of the entire universe. At that time, there is not a single thing in all of time and space that is not contained within the scope of your wisdom. At that stage wisdom becomes absolute; and since it is absolute, the term wisdom serves no further purpose. To be sure, at that stage the I that motivated you to pursue such things as fame, wealth and power, or to escape from suffering and danger, has completely disappeared. What is more, even the wisdom which eliminated your I becomes an unnecessary concept to you.<br><br>Of course, from the viewpoint of sudden enlightenment it is very easy for a Chan practitioner to reach this stage; nevertheless before reaching the gate of sudden enlightenment one must exert a great deal of effort in the journey. Otherwise the methods of Chan would be useless.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Three Stages of Chan Meditation</strong><br><br>At present, the methods of meditation that I am teaching in the United States are divided into three stages.<br><br><strong>Stage 1: To balance the development of body and mind in order to attain mental and physical health</strong><br><br>With regard to the body, we stress the demonstration and correction of the postures of walking, standing, sitting and reclining. At the same time we teach various methods of physical exercise for walking, standing, sitting and reclining. They are unique exercise methods combining Indian Hatha Yoga and Chinese Tao-yin, and can bring physical health as well as results in meditation. Thus, one who practices Chan and has obtained good results will definitely have a strong body capable of enduring hardship. For the mind we emphasize the elimination of impatience, suspicion, anxiety, fear and frustration, so as to establish a state of self-confidence, determination, optimism, peace and stability.<br><br>A good student, after five or ten lessons here, will reach the first stage and be able to obtain results in the above two areas. One of our student's reports stated: This kind of Chan class is especially good for someone like myself who, by profession or habit, has been used to having the brain functioning just about every minute of the day. I often find this Chan sitting very helpful as rest or relief. So even for no greater purpose, this Chan class has been very useful and should be highly recommended [from Chan Magazine Vol.1; No.1]<br><br>In the first lesson of each class, I always ask each of the students individually his or her purpose in learning Chan whether he or she hoped to benefit the body, or sought help for the mind. The answers show that the latter were in the majority. This indicates that people living in American society today, under the strain and pressure of the present environment, suffer excessive tension, and many have lost their mental balance. Some are so severely tense that they have to consult a psychiatrist. Among those who come to learn Chan, I have one woman student, an outstanding lecturer in a well-known university, who asked me at the first meeting if I could help to relieve her from tense and uneasy moods. I told her that for a Chan practitioner this is a very simple matter. After five lessons she felt that Chan was a great blessing to her life.<br><br>The method of the first stage is very simple. Mainly it requires you to relax all the muscles and nerves of your entire body, and concentrate your attention on the method you have just learned. Because the tension of your muscles and nerves affects the activity of the brain, the key is therefore to reduce the burden on your brain. When your wandering thoughts and illusions decrease, your brain will gradually get a little rest. As its need of blood is reduced, more blood will circulate through the entire body. Meanwhile, because of the relaxation of the brain, all the muscles also relax; thus your blood vessels expand, you feel comfortable all over, your spirit feels fresh and alert, and your mental responses are naturally lighter and more lively.<br><br>If one's object of study is just to acquire physical and mental balance, and not to study meditation proper, then one will probably feel that the completion of the first stage is enough; but many students are not content with this, and indeed, some from the outset are looking for the goal of the second stage.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stage 2: From the sense of the small "I"</strong><br><br>The first stage only helps to bring concentration to your confused mind; but when you practice concentration, other scattered thoughts continue to appear in your mind - sometimes many, sometimes a few. The concept of your purpose in practising Chan is for mental and physical benefits. This is a stage where your concept is purely self-centred. There is no mention of philosophical ideals or religious experience. When you reach the second stage, it will enable you to liberate yourself from the narrow view of the "I". [In the second stage you begin to enter the stage of meditation. When you practise the method of cultivation taught by your teacher, <strong>you will enlarge the sphere of the outlook of the small "I" until it coincides with time and space. The small "I" merges into the entire universe, forming a unity. When you look inward, the depth is limitless; when you look outward, the breadth is limitless. Since you have joined and become one with universe, the world of your own body and mind no longer exists. What exists is the universe, which is infinite in depth and breadth. You yourself are not only a part of the universe, but also the totality of it.</strong><br><br>When you achieve this experience in your Chan sitting, you will then understand what is meant in philosophy <strong>by principle or basic substance, and also what phenomenal existence is. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All phenomena are the floating surface or perceptible layer of basic substance. From the shallow point of view, the phenomena have innumerable distinctions and each has different characteristics; in reality, the differences between the phenomena do not impair the totality of basic substance.</span></strong> For instance, on the planet on which we live, there are countless kinds of animals, plants, minerals, vapors, liquids and solids which incessantly arise, change and perish, constituting the phenomena of the earth. However, seen from another planet, the earth is just one body. When we have the opportunity to free ourselves from the bonds of self or subjective views, to assume the objective standpoint of the whole and observe all phenomena together, we can eliminate opposing and contradictory views. Take a tree as an example. From the standpoint of the individual leaves and branches, they are all distinct from one another, and can also be perceived to rub against one another. However, from the standpoint of the trunk and roots, all parts without exception are of one unified whole.<br><br>In the course of this second stage, you have realized that you not only have an independent individual existence, but you also have a universal existence together with this limitlessly deep and wide cosmos, and therefore the confrontation between you and the surrounding environment exists no more. Discontent, hatred, love, desire - in other words dispositions of rejecting and grasping disappear naturally, and you sense a feeling of peace and satisfaction. Because you have eliminated the selfish small "I", you are able to look upon all people and all things as if they were phenomena produced from your own substance, and so you will love all people and all things in the same way you loved and watched over your small "I". This is the mind of a great philosopher.<br><br><strong>Naturally, all great religious figures must have gone through the experiences of this second stage, where they free themselves from the confines of the small "I", and discover that their own basic substance is none other than the existence of the entire universe, and that there is no difference between themselves and everything in the universe.</strong> All phenomena are manifestations of their own nature. They have the duty to love and watch over all things, and also have the right to manage them; just as we have the duty to love our own children and the right to manage the property that belongs to us. <strong>This is the formation of the relationship between the deity and the multitude of things he created. Such people personify the basic substance of the universe which they experience through meditation, and create the belief in God. They substantiate this idea of a large "I" the self-love of God and formulate the mission of being a savior of the world or an emissary of God.</strong> They unify all phenomena and look upon them as objects that were created and are to be saved. Consequently, some religious figures think that the basic nature of their souls is the same as that of the deity, and that they are human incarnations of the deity. In this way, they consider themselves to be saviors of the world. Others think that although the basic nature of their souls is not identical to and inseparable from that of the deity, the phenomenon of their incarnation shows that they were sent to this world by God as messengers to promulgate God's intention.<br><br>Generally, when philosophers or religious figures reach the height of the second stage, they feel that their wisdom is unlimited, their power is infinite, and their lives are eternal. When the scope of the "I" enlarges, self-confidence accordingly gets stronger, but this stronger self-confidence is in fact merely the unlimited escalation of a sense of superiority and pride. It is therefore termed large "I", and does not mean that absolute freedom from vexations has been achieved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Stage 3: From the large "I" to no "I"</strong><br><br>When one reaches the height of the second stage, <strong>he realizes that the concept of the "I" does not exist. But he has only abandoned the small "I" and has not negated the concept of basic substance or the existence of God; you may call it Truth, the one and only God, the Almighty, the Unchanging Principle, or even the Buddha of Buddhism.</strong> If you think that it is real, then you are still in the realm of the big "I" and have not left the sphere of philosophy and religion.<br><br><strong>I must emphasize that the content of Chan does not appear until the third stage.</strong> Chan is unimaginable. It is neither a concept nor a feeling. It is impossible to describe it in any terms abstract or concrete. Though meditation is ordinarily the proper path leading to Chan, once you have arrived at the door of Chan, even the method of meditation is rendered useless. It is like using various means of transportation on a long journey. When you reach the final destination, you find a steep cliff standing right in front of you. It is so high you cannot see its top, and so wide that its side cannot be found. At this time a person who has been to the other side of the cliff comes to tell you that on the other side lies the world of Chan. When you scale it you will enter Chan. And yet, he tells you not to depend on any means of transportation to fly over, bypass, or penetrate through it, because it is infinity itself, and there is no way to scale it.<br><br>Even an outstanding Chan master able to bring his student to this place will find himself unable to help any more. Although he has been to the other side, he cannot take you there with him, just as a mother's own eating and drinking cannot take the hunger away from the child who refuses to eat or drink. At that time, the only help he can give you is to tell you to discard all your experiences, your knowledge, and all the things and ideas that you think are the most reliable, most magnificent, and most real, even including your hope to get to the world of Chan. It is as if you were entering a sacred building. Before you do so, the guard tells you that you must not carry any weapon, that you must take off all your clothes, and that not only must you be completely naked you also have to leave your body and soul behind. Then you can enter.<br><br>Because Chan is a world where there is no self, if there is still any attachment at all in your mind, there is no way you can harmonies with Chan. Therefore, Chan is the territory of the wise, and the territory of the brave. Not being wise, one would not believe that after he has abandoned all attachments another world could appear before him. Not being brave, one would find it very hard to discard everything he has accumulated in this life - ideals and knowledge, spiritual and material things.<br><br>You may ask what benefit we would get after making such great sacrifices to enter the world of Chan. Let me tell you that you cannot enter the world of Chan while this question is still with you. Looking for benefit, either for self or for others, is in the "I"-oriented stage. The sixth patriarch of the Chan sect in China taught people that the way to enter the enlightenment of the realm of Chan is: Neither think of good, nor think of evil. That is, you eliminate such opposing views as self and other, inner and outer, being and non-being, large and small, good and bad, vexation and Bodhi, illusion and enlightenment, false and true, or suffering of birth and death and joy of emancipation. Only then can the realm of Chan or enlightenment appear and bring you a new life.<br><br>This new life you have had all along, and yet you have never discovered it. In the Chan sect we call it your original face before you were born. This is not the small "I" of body and mind, nor the large "I" of the world and universe. This is absolute freedom, free from the misery of all vexations and bonds. To enter Chan as described above is not easy. Many people have studied and meditated for decades, and still have never gained entrance to the door of Chan. It will not be difficult, however, when your causes and conditions are mature, or if you happen to have a good Chan master who guides you with full attention. This Master may adopt various attitudes, actions and verbal expressions which may seem ridiculous to you, as indirect means of assisting you to achieve your goal speedily. And when the Master tells you that you have now entered the gate, you will suddenly realize that there is no gate to Chan. Before entering, you cannot see where the gate is, and after entering you find the gate non-existent. Otherwise there will be the distinction between inside and outside, the enlightened and the ignorant; and if there are such distinctions, then it is still not Chan.<br><br><strong>When you are in the second stage, although you feel that the "I" does not exist, the basic substance of the universe, or the Supreme Truth, still exists. Although you recognize that all the different phenomena are the extension of this basic substance or Supreme Truth, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">yet there still exists the opposition of basic substance versus external phenomena.</span> Not until the distinctions of all phenomena disappear, and everything goes back to truth or Heaven, will you have absolute peace and unity.</strong> As long as the world of phenomena is still active, you cannot do away with conflict, calamity, suffering and crime. Therefore, although philosophers and religious figures perceive the peace of the original substance, they still have no way to get rid of the confusion of phenomena.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">One who has entered Chan does not see basic substance and phenomena as two things standing in opposition to each other.</span></strong> They cannot even be illustrated as being the back and palm of a hand. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is because phenomena themselves are basic substance, and apart from phenomena there is no basic substance to be found.</span> The reality of basic substance exists right in the unreality of phenomena, which change ceaselessly and have no constant form. This is the Truth.</strong> When you experience that phenomena are unreal, you will then be free from the concept of self and other, right and wrong, and free from the vexations of greed, hatred, worry and pride. You will not need to search for peace and purity, and you will not need to detest evil vexations and impurity. Although you live in the world of phenomenal reality, to you, any environment is a Buddha's Pure Land. To an unenlightened person, you are but an ordinary person. To you, all ordinary people are identical with Buddha. You will feel that your own self-nature is the same as that of all Buddhas, and the self-nature of Buddhas is universal throughout time and space. You will spontaneously apply your wisdom and wealth, giving to all sentient beings everywhere, throughout all time and space.<br><br>What I have said reveals a small part of the feeling of one who has entered the enlightened realm of Chan, and is also the course which one follows in order to depart from the small "I" and arrive at the stage of no "I". Nevertheless, a newly enlightened person who has just entered the realm of Chan is still at the starting section of the entire passage of Chan. He is like one who has just had his first sip of port. He knows its taste now, but the wine will not remain in his mouth forever. The purpose of Chan is not just to let you take one sip, but to have your entire life merge with and dissolve in the wine, even, to the point that you forget the existence of yourself and the wine. After tasting the first sip of egolessness, how much farther must one travel?<br><br>What kinds of things remain to be seen?<br><br>I will tell you when I have the chance!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More on Stage 2:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Thusness:</div><div class="quote_body">This is an interesting topic and since it is allowed to discuss more about God in a Buddhism forum, I would like to talk a little more about the experience of 'AMness" in all things. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into nothingness.  When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the illusionary nature of the individuality, subject-object division does not take place.  A person experiencing Â“AMnessÂ” will find Â“AMness in everythingÂ”.  What is it like?<br><br>Being free individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness.  The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ residing anywhere, neither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take place.  Even the moment of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it can be.  We cannot lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-emerges from it.  The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going.  This "AMness" is Â“GodÂ”.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Stage 3: (by thusness, in this topic) -<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">When observing moment to moment changes, it is almost natural to conclude this way. There must be an unchanging observer observing change is a logical deduction. It is the result of the lightning flash changes, logical deduction and memories that create the impression of an unchanging entity. There is continuity, but continuity with an unchanging entity is not necessary.</span></strong></div>

Like Lao Tzu, he is anonymous and traceless <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I like how the layout of the entire website structure too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>A note though, first stage doesn't mean 'pratyekabuddha', a 'pratyekabuddha' is much higher. Rather the term 'pratyekabuddha' (usually mean an enlightened person who hasnt heard of the buddha) here really means 'mystics who hasnt heard the dharma'. But a true Pratyekabuddha, like Lao Tzu, is much more than that.<br><br><strong>THE FIVE DEGREES OF TOZAN</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/tozan.jpg"><br><br>The Five Degrees of Tozan, also known as the Five Ranks of Tozan, are different levels of Realization formulated by Zen master Tozan Ryokai, known as Tung-shan Liang-chieh in Chinese (806-869).<br><br><strong>* The Apparent within the Real:</strong><br>Coming within the Absolute<br>[sho-chu-hen]<br><br><strong>* The Real within the Apparent:</strong><br>Arriving within the Relative<br>[hen-chu-sho]<br><br><strong>* The Coming from within the Real:</strong><br>The Relative within the Absolute<br>[sho-chu-rai]<br><br><strong>* The Arrival at Mutual Integration:</strong><br>The Absolute within the Relative<br>[ken-chu-shi] (see)<br><br><strong>* Unity Attained:</strong><br>Arrival within Both at the Once<br>[ken-chu-to] (see)<br><br><strong>I. The Apparent within the Real:</strong><br><br>Coming within the Absolute [sho-chu-hen]<br><br>The rank of "The Apparent within the Real" denotes the rank of the Absolute, the rank in which one experiences the Great Death, shouts "KA!" sees Tao, and enters into the Principle. When the true practitioner, filled with power from his secret study, meritorious achievements, and hidden practices, suddenly bursts through into this rank, " the empty sky vanishes and the iron mountain crumbles." "Above, there is not a tile to cover his head; below, there is not an inch of ground for him to stand on." The delusive passions are non-existent, Enlightenment is non-existent, Samsara is non-existent, Nirvana is non-existent. This is the state of total empty solidity, without sound and without odor, like a bottomless clear pool. It is as if every fleck of cloud had been wiped from the vast sky. Too often the disciple, considering that his attainment of this rank is the end of the Great Matter and his discernment of the Buddha-way complete, clings to it to the death and will not let go of it. Such as this is called it stagnant water " Zen; such a man is called " an evil spirit who keeps watch over the corpse in the coffin." Even though he remains absorbed in this state for thirty or forty years, he will never get out of the cave of the self-complacency and inferior fruits of the Pratyeka-buddha. Therefore it is said: "He whose activity does not leave this rank sinks into the poisonous sea." He is the man that Shakyamuni Buddha called " the fool who gets his realization in the rank of the Real." Therefore, though as long as he remains in this hiding place of quietude, passivity and vacantness, inside and outside are transparent and his understanding perfectly clear, the moment the bright insight [he has thus far gained through his practice] comes into contact with differentiation's defiling conditions of turmoil and confusion, agitation and vexation, love and hate, he will find himself utterly helpless before them, and all the miseries of existence will press in upon him. It was in order to save him from this serious illness that the rank of " The Real within the Apparent " was established as an expedient.<br><br><strong>II. The Real within the Apparent:</strong><br><br>Arriving within the Relative [hen-chu-sho]<br><br>If the disciple had remained in the rank of "The Apparent within the Real," his judgment would always have been vacillating and his view prejudiced. Therefore, the bodhisattva of superior capacity invariably leads his daily life in the realm of the [six] dusts, the realm of all kinds of ever-changing differentiation. All the myriad phenomena before his eyes-the old and the young, the honorable and the base, halls and pavilions, verandahs and corridors, plants and trees, mountains and rivers-he regards as his own original, true, and pure aspect. It is just like looking into a bright mirror and seeing his own face in it. If he continues for a long time to observe everything everywhere with this radiant insight, all appearances of themselves become the jeweled mirror of his own house, and he becomes the jeweled mirror of their houses as well. Dogen Zenji has said: "The experiencing of the manifold dharmas through using oneself is delusion; the experiencing of oneself through the coming of the manifold dharmas is Satori." This is just what I have been saying. This is the state of " mind and body discarded, discarded mind and body." It is like two mirrors mutually reflecting one another without even the shadow of an image between. Mind and the objects of mind are one and the same; things and oneself are not two. " A white horse enters the reed flowers snow is piled up in a silver bowl." This is what is known as the jeweled-mirror Samadhi. This is what the Nirvana Sutra is speaking about when it says: "The Tathagata sees the Buddha-nature with his own eyes." When you have entered this samadhi," though you push the great white ox, he does not go away"; the Universal Nature Wisdom manifests itself before your very eyes. This is what is meant by the expressions, "There exists only one Vehicle," "the Middle Path," " the True Form," " the Supreme Truth." But, if the student, having reached this state, were to be satisfied with it, then, as before, he would be living in the deep pit of " fixation in a lesser rank of bodhisattvahood." Why is this so? Because he is neither conversant with the deportment of the bodhisattva, nor does he understand the causal conditions for a Buddha-land. Although he has a clear understanding of the Universal and True Wisdom, he cannot cause to shine forth the Marvelous Wisdom that comprehends the unobstructed interpenetration of the manifold dharmas. The patriarchs, in order to save him from this calamity, have provided the rank of "The Coming from within the Real."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued..)<br><br><strong>III. The Coming from within the Real:</strong><br><br>The Relative within the Absolute [sho-chu-rai]<br><br>In this rank, the Mahayana bodhisattva does not remain in the state of attainment that he has realized, but from the midst of the sea of effortlessness he lets his great uncaused compassion shine forth. Standing upon the Four Bodhisattva Vows, he lashes forward the Dharma-wheel of " seeking Bodhi above and saving sentient beings below." This is the so-called "coming-from within the going-to, the going-to within the coming-from." Moreover, he must know the moment of [the meeting of] the paired opposites, brightness and darkness. Therefore the rank of " The Arrival at Mutual Integration " has been set up.<br><br><strong>IV. The Arrival at Mutual Integration:</strong><br><br>The Absolute within the Relative [ken-chu-shi]<br><br>In this rank, the bodhisattva of indomitable spirit turns the Dharma-wheel of the non-duality of brightness and darkness, hence Dark Luminosity. He stands in the midst of the filth of the world, "his head covered with dust and his face streaked with dirt." He moves through the confusion of sound and sensual pleasure, buffeted this way and buffeted that. He is like the fire-blooming lotus, that, on encountering the flames, becomes still brighter in color and purer in fragrance. " He enters the market place with empty hands," yet others receive benefit from him. This is what is called to be on the road, yet not to have left the house; to have left the house, yet not to be on the road." Is he an ordinary man? Is he a sage? The evil ones and the heretics cannot discern him. Even the buddhas and the patriarchs cannot lay their hands upon him. Were anyone to try to indicate his mind, [it would be no more there than] the horns of a rabbit or the hairs of a tortoise that have gone beyond the farthest mountain. Still, he must not consider this state to be his final resting-place. Therefore it is said, "Such a man has in and of himself a heaven-soaring spirit." What must he do in the end? He must know that there is one more rank, the rank of " Unity Attained."<br><br>Caoshan (SÃ´zan Honjaku, also: Ts'ao Shan Pen Chi, 840-901) called the Relative the world of myriad forms and the Absolute the realm of emptiness; the relative is also called the phenomenal, and the absolute the principle. The Third Rank, Relative within the Absolute, is realization of the emptiness of mind, whereby all things are emptied - thus it is the relative absolute containing the absolute relative. The Absolute within the Relative, the Fourth Rank, is the mirror awareness which is revealed by cleaning and polishing the mind by cessation and emptiness; at this point, the focus of concentration can make anything fill the universe, or make the universe into one point of awareness. Relative and absolute depend on each other, so two elements make three, adding their mutual intermingling, the source of the two. The absolute is always being expressed in the relative - this is the true absolute, but it is not always seen. Perfect comprehension of the relative grounded on experience of the absolute culminates in simultaneous realization of knowledge and complete peace and calm. At this point, Dongshan (Dong Shan Liang Chieh, also: Tozan Ryokai, 806-869) said:<br><br>"One 'comes back to sit among the ashes/ living this life as a wayfarer, expressing one's solidarity with the world in the vow to realize perfect Enlightenment with all beings. The five flavored herb and diamond thunderbolt are images of five in one; these so-called ranks or positions, the set of five being the ultimate paradigm of dialectic and an illustration of meditational stages, are all from the same source, hence the association of five in one."<br><br>Above quotes translated by Thomas Cleary in Timeless Spring: A Soto Zen Anthology<br><br><strong>V. Unity Attained:</strong><br><br>Arrival within Both at the Once [ken-chu-to]<br><br>The Master's verse-comment says:<br><br>How many times has Tokuun, the idle old gimlet,<br>Not come down from the Marvelous Peak!<br>He hires foolish wise men to bring snow,<br>And he and they together fill up the well.<br><br>The student who wishes to pass through Tozan's rank of " Unity Attained " should first study this verse.<br><br>It is of the utmost importance to study and pass through the Five Ranks, to attain penetrating insight into them, and to be totally without fixation or hesitation. But, though your own personal study of the Five Ranks comes to an end, the Buddha-way stretches endlessly and there are no tarrying places on it. The Gates of Dharma are manifold.<br><br><strong>KEN-CHU-SHI &amp; KEN-CHU-TO: A MATTER OF DEGREES</strong><br><br>Ken means "both" -- meaning the indepth realization of how both sho and hen are NOT separate, but actually fully integrated-interdefused aspects of the same single, non-dual phenomenon. For example, albeit simply put, the interdefused non-dualism of say hot and cold. On the surface most people would argue that they are seemingly different, but in actuality, both are interrelated aspects of the same single non-dual temperature spectrum (i.e., both the freezing point of water and the boiling point of the same water can be shown on one single thermometer).<br><br>Thus then, it can be seen the replacement in use of the word ken, which is the realization of both hen and sho totally intermingling and interdiffused, in lieu of the word hen --- as say in ken-chu-shi rather than hen-chu-shi in the Fourth Degree --- carries within it's scope a much deeper meaning than merely a simple syntax variance or first letter change.<br><br>A fairly good example of that subtle letter change can be found in ZEN ENLIGHTENMENT: The Path Unfolds, wherein the Wanderling writes of his Mentor: "...ken-chu-shi was graciously accorded me by the person from which I sought guidence; he himself, having experienced full realization under the grace and light of Sri Ramana Maharshi some thirty-nine years earlier..." Notice his Mentor specifically selected ken-chu-shi over hen-chu-shi, meaning he felt in the nunances of it all a deeper level of understanding was attained than what hen-chu-shi offered. However, notice as well his Mentor DID NOT grace him with hen-chu-to, and most significantly NOT ken-chu-to, apparently indicating in both cases that although the Wanderling's attainment was deep, it was, at least at that time, not total.</div>

I recently read an article by Sheng<br>Yen entitled "into the depths of emptiness" (Buddhadarma magazine) where he suggests three stages that I think correspond with what An Eternal Now said.<br><br>1.

"Seeing the nature" - like a temporary glimpse of liberation that needs repeated many times.  "One realises that all phenomena are insubstantial and that the self has always been nonexistent.  At this time one is able to put down all attachments.  However, sooner or later, depending on the person and the depth of the experience, one's self-centeredness and attachments return.  Therefore it is extremely important to continue using methods of practice".<br><br>3. Liberation itself.</div>
