Gays and Lesbians?  Hindu Priests? Taoist Priests? Infertile couples, they can't reproduce too.  How about some of our female MPs.  They chose to stay Single.<br><br>Getting married now doesn't necessary mean that the couple would like to have children, given that the expenses are so high, and what if the children grew up and became good for nothing people, because the parents were too busy earning the basic livelihood?  I support the view that we shouldn't have children if we are not sure whether we can bring them up well, because of the negative influences from the peers and media, worse, kenna murder by them if we don't give them pocket money.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

TT Durai's earnings during his heir day can be up to millions a year, but do you think he worth more than a nurse?<br>A monk sets a good example to the disciples in practising the dharma, having good behaviour and refrain from doing bad deeds. Isn't it something that everyone should do?<br>of coz it can't be that everyone in the world become monk, we must have a balance, we can't have a world that everyone become doctor or everyone become soldier.<br><br>Obviously you are asking a question from materialistic point of view, but bear in mind buddhism is much beyond that.<br>If you don't believe in dharma like cause &amp; effect and reincarnation / rebirth, no point continue talking about that coz to you monk is the same as priest/father.</div>
