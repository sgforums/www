Which is why precepts and rules are necessary and lessen such cases. If a monk does not uphold precepts, he will also need to undergo bad consequences even such as having to disrobe and leave the sangha.<br><br><blockquote>And from the last part of your statement, we can see that rules don't always work as expected.</blockquote>You didn't get what it was saying?
