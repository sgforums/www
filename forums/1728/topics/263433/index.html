If the majority of the society renounce to be Buddhist monks or nuns, wouldn't this affect the material development and progress of the society?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The reality is that there are very few monks or nuns in this world.</span><br><br>THAT SHOULD not be the case. The people of the Western Pure-land are all monks or nuns. Think about it - the kind of happiness and the scientific and technological development, they are many times more advanced than our *Saha World. The Western Pure-land is filled with extreme happiness. Suffering exists in our world because of male and female forms. There is no gender amongst the Bodhisattvas of the Western Pure-land, and therefore they are all very happy. Since male and female forms do not exist therefore marriage also does not exist! There is also no such thing as renunciation to be monks or nuns! Emotions, love and desire arise amongst human beings due to the male and female forms; because of these forms, the world is a boundless sea of suffering. It is not easy to find even a few monks or nuns in this world. Let us not question if it is possible for all people to renounce and become monks or nuns. It is not meaningful to discuss such a question. As long as our mind is pure, that should be good enough.</div>

Now at that time approximately 500 of the brahman Kasi Bharadvaja's plows were yoked at the sowing time. Then, in the early morning, putting on his lower robe and taking his bowl &amp; robes, the Blessed One went to where Kasi Bharadvaja was working. Now at that time Kasi Bharadvaja's food-distribution was underway. so the Blessed One went to Kasi Bharadvaja's food-distribution and, on arrival, stood to one side. Kasi Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One standing for alms, and on seeing him, said to him, "I, contemplative, plow &amp; sow. Having plowed &amp; sown, I eat. You, too, contemplative, should plow &amp; sow. Having plowed &amp; sown, you (will) eat."<br><br>"I, too, brahman, plow &amp; sow. Having plowed &amp; sown, I eat."<br><br>"But, contemplative, I don't see the Master Gotama's yoke or plow, plowshare, goad, or oxen, and yet the Master Gotama says this: 'I, too, brahman, plow &amp; sow. Having plowed &amp; sown, I eat.'"<br><br>Then the Kasi Bharadvaja addressed the Blessed One with a verse:<br><br>You claim to be a plowman,<br>but I don't see your plowing.<br>Being asked, tell us about your plowing<br>so that we may know your plowing.<br><br>[The Buddha:]<br><br>Conviction is my seed,<br>austerity 	my rain,<br>discernment my yoke &amp; plow,<br>conscience 	my pole,<br>mind 		my yoke-tie,<br>mindfulness my plowshare &amp; goad.<br>Guarded in body,<br>guarded in speech,<br>restrained in terms of belly &amp; food,<br>I make truth a weeding-hook,<br>and composure my unyoking.<br>Persistence, my beast of burden,<br>bearing me toward rest from the yoke,<br>takes me, without turning back,<br>to where, having gone,<br>one doesn't grieve.<br>That's how my plowing is plowed.<br>It has<br>as its fruit<br>the deathless.<br>Having plowed this plowing<br>one is unyoked<br>from all suffering<br>&amp; stress.<br><br>Then Kasi Bharadvaja, having heaped up milk-rice in a large bronze serving bowl, offered it to the Blessed One, [saying,] "May Master Gotama eat [this] milk-rice. The master is a plowman, for the Master Gotama plows the plowing that has as its fruit the deathless."<br><br>What's been chanted over with verses<br>shouldn't be eaten by me.<br>That's not the nature, brahman,<br>of one who's seen rightly.<br>What's been chanted over with verses<br>Awakened Ones reject.<br>That being their nature, brahman,<br>this is their way of life.<br>Serve with other food &amp; drink<br>a fully-perfected great seer,<br>his fermentations 	ended,<br>his anxiety 		stilled,<br>for that is the field<br>for one looking for merit.<br><br>"Then to whom, Master Gotama, should I give this milk-rice?"<br><br>"Brahman, I don't see that person in this world Â— with its devas, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, in this generation with its royalty &amp; common people Â— by whom this milk-rice, having been eaten, would be rightly digested, aside from a Tathagata or a Tathagata's disciple. In that case, brahman, throw the milk-rice away in a place without vegetation, or dump it in water with no living beings."<br><br>So Kasi Bharadvaja dumped the milk-rice in water with no living beings. And the milk-rice, when dropped in the water, hissed &amp; sizzled, seethed &amp; steamed. Just as an iron ball heated all day, when tossed in the water, hisses &amp; sizzles, seethes &amp; steams, in the same way the milk-rice, when dropped in the water, hissed &amp; sizzled, seethed &amp; steamed.<br><br>Then Kasi Bharadvaja Â— in awe, his hair standing on end Â— went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, throwing himself down with his head at the Blessed One's feet, said to him, "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama Â— through many lines of reasoning Â— made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life. Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotama's presence, let me obtain admission."<br><br>Then the brahman Kasi Bharadvaja obtained the going forth in the Blessed One's presence, he obtained admission. And not long after his admission Â— dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute Â— he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the celibate life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here &amp; now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the celibate life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And so Ven. Bharadvaja became another one of the arahants.</div>

There are a variety of reasons for this, mostly it is a traditional norm. But the core reasons why it is still popular would i think are because bringing up children helps parents to develop good human qualities and that is valued in many levels of society.<br><br>Couples themselves would want kids for a variety of reasons, some considered less sound like too much pressure from families and people in their lives.

This one would be a much more positive way to consider childbearing and most couples i imagine would want it to be this way.<br><br>However both starts cannot guarantee a good child-rearing experience and even harder to say if the child will turn out as a good or bad person in society.<br><br>Looking at the idea that one would be responsible only if to have children for the perpetuation or even the good of of humankind, how is it different from the stress one gets from the first example? Not much i reckon.<br><br>Even if say one were to believe in such a responsibility, and enjoy fulfilling it, although it may agree with a national policy encouraging  one to have more children to prevent an ever-growing graying population, does it seem morally right to you? Bringing a human life into the world is a decision you make for that life. The value should be worth more than just using that innocent life to make a country more populous or youthful for the sake of material prosperity. That goes the same for the idea to perpetuate the existence of the human species.<br><br>A responsible being, i would imagine, considers many factors before deciding whether to have offspring. Factors pertaining to whether it is even good or safe for the child to be born at that time or place. Taking into consideration the wellbeing of this life that you can bring into this world should take precedence over even the biological desire of all beings to have offspring even if that desire gives very "good vibes". Humans are capable of such thought which allows for compassion and altrusim usually attributed to higher beings and holy saints.<br><br>We have the brain power and thinking capabilities to break old habits and develop ones that make life more worthwhile, meaningful. We can literally, think our way out of problems. As some would agree as it was through thinking in particular ways that problems seem to exist in the first place. It is easy to follow a popular idea/belief and many examples exist in traditions, cultures around the world. Not many seem to take the time to piece the jigsaw in life on their own, checking if each piece fits with another.<br><br>It is good to think but more important to look.
