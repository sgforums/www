              <h3 style="margin: 0px 0px 5px;">The Buddhist Channel, Oct 17, 2010</h3>
              </strong><p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="color: #333333;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Since the plead of the Buddhists in Arunachal Pradesh was highlighted recently on the Buddhist Channel,<span>  </span>a quite check on the internet finds that there are hardly any Buddhist organizations out there having programs offering some form of knowledge or expertise that can be used by the locals there and elsewhere, to defend their faith.<span>  </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This may be because Buddhism traditionally does not emphasize proselytizing of its faith and as such, expertise required to countered other religions converting its followers are low on their list of priority. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is about time, the various Buddhists organizations in individual country coming together, and pooling their resources to set up such centralized missionary institutions with the purpose of providing programs that imparts knowledge and expertise for the defend and propagate of the Buddhist teaching, not just to monks but also to Buddhist laymen as well. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Besides the Buddhist teachings, these institutions should include other useful subjects such as leadership skill, conflict resolution, crisis management and negotiation skill in its curriculum. These would allow for a more, well rounded individual able to handle all kind of situations independently. Such knowledge and skill would also come in useful when there is a need for these individuals to support humanitarian and other relief operations as well. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I believe if there are such missionary institutions existing now, for monks and aspiring laymen missionaries alike, others, from countries that do not have them, would be very interested to a part of its setup. </span></p>

              <p>There is no issue, if there is issue even if planet earth is flooded with institutions, it is still not able to provide helpful means for individual salvation, needless to mention, the institution. Establishing an institution is not intentionally, but based on ripen condition, and also to lead a gracious, modest and humble way of learning and cultivation so that living beings from all walks of life enter into the institution will feel or bring out at least a slightest bliss in them. In addition, those intentional or unconditional or altruistic contribution and donation to the institution would bear great fruit in future, such as achieving enlightenment in the next life or before end of his lifespan or bear prosperous, gracious and noble fruit in their next life :)</p>
              <p>Buddha Sakyamuni is individual salvation from a start. Besides, in the institution, there are quite many who learn and cultivate together, if they attained, the power of spread is remarkable and beyond words. What the Buddhist institution ard the world could do is assist to support one another with funds, more importantly is venerables to preside and teach in a form of dharma lecture and meditation, among others :D May Buddha dharma always sparkling shine to benefit all sentient beings of the ten direction.

Of course, the objective being to ensure that they are better prepared to further the causes of Buddhism for future generations of Buddhists and would be Buddhists alike. </span></p>

              <p>There are two points of approach, one involves the laying of groundwork or grassroots level, making Buddhism available to more people, eg. devotees and lay persons according their previous inclinations. </p>

              <p>Mr Aik TC ,</p>
              <p>i can understand your anxiety for some action to be taken .Before you start saying everyone is being passive and do not react or buddhist group dun do, have you asked yourself this question .How well do you know India ?</p>
              <p>There is alot of problem in India for a foreign charitable org to do missionary work and the bureaucracy is strong due to the multi-religious and racial situation in India.</p>
              <p>The problem of sending missionary there depends on how smooth missionary can goes in there without obstacle ,like clearance and government purview.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are posting here to initiate some actions , please dont.I suggest you go and do it urself and canvass for funding and we may support you .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The funding involved is great .unless you have such huge financial support , i wont think its easy to get it going and see some returns</p>
              <p>The Christian is more successful in canvass donation in this area , while i see Buddhist tends to be rather passive and most of us will hope to resolve this matter by seeking Buddha Power .</p>

              <p>Hi bohiruci,</p>
              <p>Going to India? Far from it. We don't even have a proper organisation for that purpose in the first place. Financial support? For now, it is looking at the feasibility and gauging the interest among the Buddhist community before you can start to look at anything else. By the way, it is not a one man show.   </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi Amitayus48</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My belief is that, critical supports have to come from the local Buddhist organizations here. Firstly, members in these organizations are the active Buddhists. For any Missionary Institution to be successful, it requires feedbacks, information, manpower and other logistical support services from these organizations. In turn, the Missionary institution is there to provide the necessary training for full and part time volunteers. When they have completed their training, these volunteers should then return back to their respective organization to carry on their missionary work. Of course, they becomes a potentially pool of people that can be mobilized when large scale activities are needed to be carried out. </span></p>

It is a good learning ground as other religions here have very innovative ways in carrying out their missionary activities which we need to know to be able to counter and also, to adapt for our own use. <span> </span></span></p>

              <p>Hi bohiruci,</p>
              <p>Going to India? Far from it. We don't even have a proper organisation for that purpose in the first place. Financial support? For now, it is looking at the feasibility and gauging the interest among the Buddhist community before you can start to look at anything else. By the way, it is not a one man show.   </p>

              <p>Trying new ways... like holding cell group meetings to discuss dharma and book sharing. It's still small now but growing. My mom is also entasked to start a book sharing group and invite her friends.</p>
              <p>My Buddhist organisation has grown steadily over the years, though nothing like some megachurches.</p>
              <p>If you want to spread Buddhism, you can't rely on one person, teacher, or organisation to do the work for you. That would be way too limiting. Go out, spread the message, maybe start your own cell group or something... In this way the message gets spread out much more effectively and to more social circles.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This is where some knowledge of the development and history of Buddhism is so important to have. Knowledge of the different interpretation of the doctrines from the different Buddhist school of thoughts that can cater to individual preference and disposition is also necessary. All this knowledge would come in useful as one can than recommend to the individual the right Buddhist organization to approach that can cater to their needs. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I have known of Christians previously, who even though they are knowledgeable about their faith, would not try to talk to you about it. What they would do is to make arrangement for interested individuals to meet up with some other member of their church; members, I believed are trained to answer questions and clear one’s doubt and also to explain the teachings in a way and at a level that the individual can grasps. I believe this are well organized churches. Of course there are also those that are not so well funded and carrying out proselytizing work may not be that well organized.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">That is where I believe, that if the Buddhist organizations here can come together, pool some of their resources and start some form of centralized training for interested ordinary laypersons in how to carry out proper handling and spreading of the Buddha’s words, it would certainly go a long way in helping to draw more non-believers to the Buddhist faith. </span></span></p>
