It takes an enlightened teacher to point the truth to the student directly.<br><br>There is really no need to be profound in word use. If it is profound, then probably, it is because the master wants the student to meditate on it, contemplate on it.<br><br><blockquote>yes i understand that heaven is not ur goal..<br>but safeguardin to ensure 'reborn' as human again.. is ur goal?<br>we r all even..in the 'cycle'<br>its either u r in..or u r out.</blockquote>Becoming Buddha is my goal. Therefore, in this lifetime, i need to cultivate, in the next lifetime, I also need to cultivate, so I still need to maintain a human form to cultivate.<br><br><blockquote>u mention first step to enlightenment is recognition of sufferin..<br>then what makes u recognise suffering in the first place when u din even undergo b4 wats sufferin is?<br>(do u see the catch?)<br>if one never been thru sufferin in the first place, then how to liberated from 'suffering' where there isnt any?</blockquote>It is more difficult but not impossible.<br><br>For example, if we dont have sufferings, but we can hear of the sufferings of others, this is also one way. Shakyamuni Buddha was once a prince. He lived a carefree life, free from sufferings. But through seeing the Four Sights - an old crippled man (old age), a diseased man (illness), a decaying corpse (death), and finally a monk. He deduced that Sufferings is indeed part of life, and after seeing the carefree monk, he had the will to find the way out of sufferings forever. He eventually attained Enlightenment.<br><br>But yes, those who have first hand experience of real sufferings, they are the ones who will truly appreciate the opportunity to practise.<br><br><blockquote>everyone yearn to rch 'highest bliss'...but how to experience happy when u dun experience wats 'highest sadness' is?</blockquote>There is no need to abuse drugs, to know the harm and sufferings drugs will cause.<br><br><blockquote>if one see only dharma..<br>one only follow..(not enlighten)<br><br>if one see beyond dharma<br>one will lead..(enlighten)</blockquote>One must practise the Dharma the Buddha taught. It is not follow. Buddhists do not follow blindly anyone including the Buddha, but become enlightened ourselves. The 84000 dharma doors taught by Buddha are meant as a raft, to bring us across the river to the other shore of liberation/enlightenment. It is like a medicine, to cure us of our afflictive mind illness.<br><br><blockquote>more simple in teachin<br>more it will hinder u to c the truth..</blockquote>Truth is simple, but our illusions prevent us from seeing it.<br><br>The more we complicate things, the harder it is to see the truth.<br><br><blockquote>physically one need to 'walk the path himself'...<br>spiritually he 'walks where u r walkin'.. </blockquote>Yes, he needs to walk the path, and also under the guidance of a 'Shan Zhi Shi' (someone who threaded the path before you) - so that you do not walk the wrong path. A teacher is important.<br><br><blockquote>read with open heart.<br>thank you.<br></blockquote>Yup, I always will.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The happiness that Buddhism talks about, is not the opposite of sufferings. There is no worldly dualism in Nirvana (remember non-dual by _wanderer_?). It trasncends worldly happiness. Even Heavenly happiness is still considered Dukkha in Buddhism, being conditioned, impermanent, Sufferings.<br><br>Nirvana is beyond all mental states and conditionings, that is constantly fluctuating. It is UNconditioned bliss <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It is beyond Time and Space. Therefore, Highest Bliss, uncomparable, nothing to compare with.<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=171090" rel="nofollow">The Pursuit of Happiness, Bliss and understanding Sufferings</a><br><br>Exerpt:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sometimes we have a success and feel very satisfied with our own performance. However, <strong>this satisfaction itself is again Dukkha , simply because it does not stay forever</strong>. In a higher stage of meditation practice, you do not feel any mental annoyance at all. It is very calm and peaceful. It is called Sukha - happiness. Again, this happiness is Dukkha, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not because it causes unhappiness or suffering at that moment but because it does not stay forever. It changes. It starts and finishes. So it is Dukkha</span>. You see Dukkha does not cover only the negative side of life but the positive one as well.</span><br><br>When we understand this, we will know why even the heavens in the six realms cannot escape this (dukkha), and it is only by the honest cultivation of the Dharma will we be able to be freed from sufferings and attain the Highest Bliss. After all, <strong>all the tripitaka and twelve divisions</strong> (teachings Buddha expounded) all point humanity towards true Bliss. Therefore I say Dukkha is perhaps one of the most misunderstood concept - the reason why Buddhism is sometimes seen as pessimistic. <strong>But the concept of Dukkha is not pessimistic.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by simplified:<br>when buddha becum buddha<br>he did not set to be buddha<br><br>when one seek to be buddha<br>he is not even near buddha</blockquote>Shakyamuni Buddha practised for 3 Aeons as a Bodhisattva before attaining Buddhahood. Likewise, practitioners must cultivate for a long time before attaining Buddhahood.<br><br>Back in India, Buddha did not just become Buddha by chance. He spent 6 years trying to find the Truth, and all other methods failed, he sat down under the Bodhi tree for 49 days in deep meditation before attaining enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>its not the 'will' tat keep him to find the way out of sufferings forever..<br>rather its d buddha nature in him - compassion/love that keep him goin..and from compassion/love , other like forgiveness ,will , determination etc comes along. bcos of compassion, he c others mistake as his, others sufferin as his..its bcoz of compassion that he walk 'the way' and eventually wisdom gain thru every suffering. it is that hes able to 'c' everyting everyone as one , in equanity, which makes him gain unlimited wisdom. he simply dun exist bcos he exist everywhere..</blockquote>The Buddha Nature is with us since immemorable times, following us to hell and heaven, everywhere. Yet we have not realised it, because of our ignorance, our illusions, that have covered it up. Like just a clear bright mirror covered by a layer of dust. By Cultivating dharma, we slowly purify our minds and uncover our pristine Buddha Nature. The qualities of Compassion, Wisdom, are all within our Buddha Nature, as we slowly uncover it.<br><br>In order to attain Buddhahood, one must cultivate and perfect the 10 Paramitas lifetime after lifetime as a Bodhisattva.<br><br><blockquote>its not abt the action done...but rather the intention behind it.<br>its not the goal..but rather what makes one move the first step ...eventually he will c the 'goal' which dont even exist in the first place..</blockquote>Yes, our intentions must be virtuous, but more importantly we must cultivate until Action is Non-action (wu wei), as Lao Tzu taught in Tao Te Ching. To act in non-action is to abide in our natural Awareness/Buddha Nature/Tao.<br><br>Spontaneous in living, our qualities of Buddha Nature reveal, as we cultivate the 10 Paramitas, yet unmoved in mind.<br><br>Meaning,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lao Tsu taught that all straining, all striving are not only vain but counterproductive. One should endeavor to do nothing (wu-wei). But what does this mean? It means not to literally do nothing, but to discern and follow the natural forces -- to follow and shape the flow of events and not to pit oneself against the natural order of things. First and foremost to be spontaneous in ones actions.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Tao abides in non-action,<br>Yet nothing is left undone.<br>If kings and lords observed this,<br>The ten thousand things would develop naturally.<br>If they still desired to act,<br>They would return to the simplicity of formless substance.<br>Without form there is no desire.<br>Without desire there is tranquillity.<br>In this way all things would be at peace. - Lao Tzu</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Action &amp; Non-Action</strong><br><br>The non-action of the wise man is not inaction.<br>It is not studied. It is not shaken by anything.<br>The sage is quiet because he is not moved,<br>Not because he wills to be quiet.<br>Still water is like glass.<br>You can look in it and see the bristles on your chin.<br>It is a perfect level,<br>How much more the spirit of man?<br>The heart of the wise man is tranquil.<br>It is the mirror of heaven and earth ~<br>the glass of everything.<br>Emptiness, stillness, tranquillity, tastelessness,<br>Silence, non-action: this is the level of heaven and earth.<br>This is the perfect tao.<br>Wise men find here their resting place.<br>Resting, they are empty.<br>From emptiness comes the unconditioned.<br>From this, the conditioned, the individual things.<br>So from the sage's emptiness, stillness arises:<br>From stillness, action. From action, attainment.<br>From their stillness comes their non-action, which is also action<br>And is, therefore, their attainment.<br>For stillness is joy. Joy is free from care<br>Fruitful in long years.<br>Joy does all things without concern:<br>For emptiness, stillness, tranquillity, tastelessness,<br>Silence and non-action<br>Are the root of all things.<br><br>~ Chuang Tzu</span><br><br><blockquote>when one reali 'walk his way', he can naturally come up with the 5 Precepts<br>when one reali 'walk his way', he can come up with his own dharma , for dharma dnt exist at all.</blockquote>What is dharma? Dharma means phenomena. What is Buddhadharma? It means truths taught by Buddha. All Dharmas taught by Buddha are used as medicines to treat the human mind.<br><br>I imagine that in Western Pure Land, there is no need for 5 Precepts, because everyone does not commit crimes in Pure Land. So what are 5 precepts for? They are meant for Sentient Beings unenlightened mind. Precepts is only one part of Buddhism, the next step is to cultivate Samadhi and Wisdom.<br><br>Although dharma is empty in its nature, but for unenlightened people, we still have to rely on a dharma, a raft, to reach the other shore.<br><br>And only the dharma of Enlightenment (Buddhadharma) shall lead us to the gate of Enlightenment.<br><br>Gate Gate Paragate Parasamgate Bodhi Svaha!<br><br><blockquote>when theres no pain...one will not 'gain'.<br>but what makes one to go thru pain even when one know d pain exist??<br>isnt it simple and direct?<br><br>one need a guide..but isnt all of us has it ..within? juz that he chose not to follow..[/b]</blockquote>The sentient mind is not the guide. It is full of its own egocentric ideas, impure thoughts, ignorant perceptions.<br><br>The inner guide is our Buddha Nature, without it there is no chance for Awakening, yet, for sentient beings, we still need an external guide in order to find our Buddha Nature.</div>

The accounts of 500 lifetimes of Buddha prior to his Buddhahood is also inspiring.<br><br><blockquote>we respect buddha not bcoz of wat he has undergo..but why he has to undergo these...wats makes him to make the very first step..</blockquote>His very first step, that is his aspiration to attain the highest Bodhi. And indeed that is really respectable. But what he has undergone, are also respectable. And finally, his Buddhahood is also respectable. So I feel there are more than one things respectable about Buddha, truly what one should learn from.<br><br><blockquote>is raft important? r u sure?<br>is the oppostite shore impt? r u sure?</blockquote>Yes, raft is important, because we are sentient beings struggling in the sea of samsara. If we were to reach the shore, we have to rely on a raft.<br><br><blockquote>u take the raft not to r rch the opposite..<br>to rch the opposite is not takin the raft..</blockquote>Sorry, I don't quite get you. Perhaps you can explain?<br><br><blockquote>do u know wat is important?????????<br><br>its the reason what makes u leave ur orginal shore intially...juz tat simple and direct...and u will 'auto' rch the opposite with ur 'own-make' raft..</blockquote>What makes you leave the original shore - the aspiration to achieve the highest Bodhi, the vows, is important. However, if if our aspirations and vows remains only in the mind, it only remains as a wish, or just a passing dream.<br><br><blockquote>one way to noe whether u r on the rite track..<br>let mi cast u a scenario:<br><br>imagine a naked baby born ...<br>his clothes r spread along the way to his mother..(as theres a distance between) them..<br>his mother hand cant rch him to help him get dress up..<br>the baby has to find his way there..<br>he may get lost ..but its ok..as he will go back to the orginal start point..<br>he try again another path ..fail again..he try and try and fail and fail..<br>finally he find a way..<br>and as he walk he can feel the happiness, calmness, so he proceed..<br>still rem the clothes lyin on the path??<br>he will pick up clothes and put in on...<br>and by the time he rch the arm of mother..he is fully dressed up.<br>( i can write in a super detail cover everyting but it will b super long</blockquote>Yes you can say so <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote>but i wan to drive to a point :<br>whenever one progress in the spiritual way...if he is on the right track , he will bound to pick up some spiritual ability(clothes) coz he has rch the stage. if he cont on the right way he will pick up again another one.</blockquote>I think rather than 'spiritual ability', in Buddhism we stress on 'spiritual insights'.<br><br><blockquote>let mi ask u .<br><br>do u 'travel' in another realm?<br>do u 'see' beyond ?<br>do u 'see' past?<br>do u 'see' dark in the head?<br>do u have some spiritual experiences?<br><br>dun hav to ans to mi..kp it to urslf(not supposed to tell)<br><br>if yes<br>i sincerely apologise and i will eat back all my postin..<br><br>if no<br>then y r u still seeing what u see?</blockquote>You're right, it is unwise to discuss about spiritual achievements. First of all, I do not see how that is going to help someone else, unless if the other person has similar relevant experiences then perhaps sharing of such experiences is worthwhile and fruitful. Secondly, even if I say I have attained this and this, not everyone is going to believe you. Thirdly, it may confuse some people.<br><br>Another thing is, perhaps you have mistaken, in Buddhism we do not practise for the intentions of gaining Supernatural Powers. We do not cultivate because we want to be a super-being, a god, or gain lots of powers... because this is of no use to the gaining of Wisdom, Liberation, Bliss, Enlightenment. Although it is true that Buddha have such powers, Buddhists should not have the wrong focus. Many people put their focus on attaining powers, these people cannot attain enlightenment. We cultivate to attain wisdom, not powers. I have actually posted a lot about this the past few days in our forum... see <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=184150" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=184150</a> and <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183053" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=183053</a><br><br>Another thing is, I am far from enlightened, I am only a learner. Seriously there are many people in the forum who is much wiser than me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And also, could you explain what you mean by 'seeing what u see?' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><blockquote>my suggestion:<br><br>walk a few rounds of life,death,sickness,aged, separate etc best is all kinds of sufferin with buddha nature(one tat see with compassion)..then cum back to 'dharma'..<br>let ur buddha nature 'see' first</blockquote>You may not have known, but for immemorable time you have already walked the rounds of Life, Death, Sickness, Ageing, for uncountable times. We have already reborn and suffered in Samsara for so long. Buddha remembered 96 aeons of previous lifetimes.<br><br>That is why if we dont appreciate our opportunity this lifetime, having heard the dharma, to cultivate our minds, then when we will ever be liberated?<br><br><blockquote>the 'guide' i mention above refer to the buddha nature and not the mind. the word 'mind' never cross when im typin..</blockquote>That's good... I get what you mean. However, it is also very easy to mistake our Buddha Nature with our illusions. It is not Buddha Nature's fault, but because our karmic tendencies, illusions, strong bondage and attachment has prevented us from seeing the Buddha... even if one wishes to rely on the inner-Buddha, we still need an external teacher, someone who has threaded the path before you (shan zhi shi), to guide us and correct us.<br><br><blockquote>ya..im interested in tis.<br>can i hav the relevant site or article?<br><br>thank you very much.</blockquote>Below are 11 pages which should answer your question, each image is clickable, click on it to enlarge. Although it's 11 pages, it's not very long, because the words are big.<br><br><a href="http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs75&amp;d=06143&amp;f=ksl_p1.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://xs75.xs.to/pics/06143/ksl_p1.jpg.xs.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs75&amp;d=06143&amp;f=ksl_p2-3.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://xs75.xs.to/pics/06143/ksl_p2-3.jpg.xs.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs75&amp;d=06143&amp;f=ksl_p4_p5.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://xs75.xs.to/pics/06143/ksl_p4_p5.jpg.xs.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs75&amp;d=06143&amp;f=ksl_p6_p7.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://xs75.xs.to/pics/06143/ksl_p6_p7.jpg.xs.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs75&amp;d=06143&amp;f=ksl_p8_p9.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://xs75.xs.to/pics/06143/ksl_p8_p9.jpg.xs.jpg"></a><br><a href="http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs75&amp;d=06143&amp;f=ksl_p10_p11.jpg" rel="nofollow"><img src="http://xs75.xs.to/pics/06143/ksl_p10_p11.jpg.xs.jpg"></a><br><br>Actually, in Buddhism, there are a lot of teachings on Liberation.

Shakyamuni Buddha was once a prince. He lived a carefree life, free from sufferings. But through seeing the Four Sights - an old crippled man (old age), a diseased man (illness), a decaying corpse (death), and finally a monk. He deduced that Sufferings is indeed part of life, and after seeing the carefree monk, he had the will to find the way out of sufferings forever. He eventually attained Enlightenment.</blockquote>Can Heaven beings learn dharma? Yes. They can, and they can even attain various stages of Sainthood (Arhantship), although they will not attain Arhantship until another lifetime. (with exception of the 5 Pure Abodes in the 4th jhana heaven, where non-returners and arhants live before they pass away and enter nirvana. <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html</a>) Although it is more difficult for celestial beings to learn and practise the dharma because their life is too comfortable, some of them are wise enough to accept the dharma. There are bodhisattvas teaching in the celestial realm, one famous one being Maitreya Buddha, who currently resides in Tush_ita heaven, teaching the celestial beings there until the time is ripe for him to attain Buddhahood on Earth.<br><br>Why Maitreya Bodhisattva chose to teach the heavens first? Because the heavenly beings have greater blessings to receive teachings from him. When the time has come, all the celestial beings will be reborn with Maitreya Bodhisattva on earth, and they will become his disciples and aid him in propagating the dharma here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
