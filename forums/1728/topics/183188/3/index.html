They can, and they can even attain various stages of Sainthood (Arhantship), although they will not attain Arhantship until another lifetime. (with exception of the 5 Pure Abodes in the 4th jhana heaven, where non-returners and arhants live before they pass away and enter nirvana. <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html</a>) Although it is more difficult for celestial beings to learn and practise the dharma because their life is too comfortable, some of them are wise enough to accept the dharma. There are bodhisattvas teaching in the celestial realm, one famous one being Maitreya Buddha, who currently resides in Tush_ita heaven, teaching the celestial beings there until the time is ripe for him to attain Buddhahood on Earth.<br><br>Why Maitreya Bodhisattva chose to teach the heavens first? Because the heavenly beings have greater blessings to receive teachings from him. When the time has come, all the celestial beings will be reborn with Maitreya Bodhisattva on earth, and they will become his disciples and aid him in propagating the dharma here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> wonderful.....<br><br></div>
