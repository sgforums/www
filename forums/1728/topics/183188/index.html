Buddha told us we should respect our ancestors, etc. (although we do not worship them) Regardless where your ancestor went, it's good to pay respect and remembrance to them.<br><br>The only real way to help the dead is to dedicate merits to them. If you are really filial to your parents, then you should do what Buddha advised during the Ullambana Dharma period every year, make offerings to the sangha and attend the Ullambana Dharma/Ksitigarbha bodhisattva pujas and dedicate merits.

It is Ullabanadharma.. neither is it time for celebration.. so why 'Festival'?<br><br><blockquote>another question :<br><br>i read that one death and reborn r immdiate within the next 49days, is this correct?</blockquote>Correct. Do read: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=157941" rel="nofollow">The Intermediate Stage After Death (article)</a><br><br>and also <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">Returning to the Quintessence of Buddha</a><br><br><blockquote>if one has been reborn into the lower 3 level..can it still b possible to communicate with their descendant ?<br><br>so that means to say thru offerings to the sangha and attend the Ullabanadharma/Ksitigarbha bodhisattva pujas is the only way to liberate  them?</blockquote>Correct again. And yes due to affinity they may be able to receive your message to them. Do ask them to attend the Ullabanadharma puja so they may be present at the time of dedication of merits.<br><br><blockquote>liberate only reduce suffering...anytin to free them ..totally? does attendin the 7mth15 festival every year help?</blockquote>It is even possible if with enough merits, that the deceased will liberate from that lower realm and reborn in higher realm like the human realm. Otherwise, it will shorten their time in the realm.<br><br>It helps - but its not a festival. We do not burn paper money either... that doesnt help.</div>

That is a form of superstition. Sorry for being very direct here. We do not deal with spirits in this way.<br><br>Instead of communicating with spirits, Buddhists do have practises of offering food to the hungry ghosts. This is not a very easy thing to do - because if you make just the slightest mistake, for example during visualisation a wandering thought pops up in the mind, and you think of your shirt button instead of the food, then the hungry ghosts will end up eating buttons and he will find you tonight  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

This is very important in learning <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>A university professor went to visit a famous Zen master. While the master quietly served tea, the professor talked about Zen. The master poured the visitor's cup to the brim, and then kept pouring. The professor watched the overflowing cup until he could no longer restrain himself. "It's overfull! No more will go in!" the professor blurted. "You are like this cup," the master replied, "How can I show you Zen unless you first empty your cup."</strong><br><br><blockquote>is there any diff whether one is from the human, animal, spirit realm...since all of us r below buddha..?</blockquote>There are 6 realms in Buddhism, known as Liu Dao in Chinese, or Liu Dao Lun Hui, refering to the samsaric cycle in 6 realms.<br><br>The Three Higher Realms are:<br><br>Heaven<br>Humans<br>Asuras<br><br>Three Lower Realms:<br><br>Animals<br>Spirits<br>Hell<br><br>By abiding by the 5 Precepts, 10 Virtuous Deeds, we can be assured we will not be comitting karma that leads us into the three lower realms. That is why precepts are important. Even if you cannot attain enlightenment this life, at least, you have the opportunity to continue practising next life in the human. If you cannot even keep the precepts, then who knows what awaits you in the afterlife?<br><br>Buddha has transcended all six realms, he is freed from the samsaric cycle. That why he can be a teacher of sentient beings.<br><br>However, do not think that Buddhahood is not achievable. Although so far since Shakyamuni Buddha has attained enlightenment on planet earth (the next Buddha will be Maitreya Buddha), there is no other Buddhas, there are uncountable Buddhas in this universe and beyond, even in our planet Earth, since Buddha entered parinirvana there are uncountable men who has attained enlightenment, even now. I am glad to have met and learnt from many enlightened teachers, who are living Bodhisattvas (Pu Sa). In fact, there are highly enlightened people who do post in our forum. These enlightened men has already surpassed even the state of the Celestial/heaven realms. Exclude me, I am just a learner.<br><br><blockquote>as long as theres life ,soul exist..every move that they made is a step to so-call 'enlightenment' ..be it juz a small step..even if tats a wrong step taken..</blockquote>Not every step is a step towards enlightenment, we may even have several set-backs. But because our innate nature is Buddha Nature, this 'Buddha' being itself our innate Pure Awareness, we will be able to awaken from our mistakes, and walk the Buddha Path. The Buddha Nature has never left us, even while we are in hell, or we are in heaven. The Buddha Nature doesn't even increase when you attain enlightenment! It always IS, only our illusions prevent us from seeing, as a layer of dust cover up a pristine clear mirror.<br><br><blockquote>arent there many doors to enlightenment? shorter route to enlightment doesnt mean longer route to enlightment is wrong..<br><br>everyone of us take a separate path.. </blockquote>Only through cultivating the Buddhadharma can we attain enlightenment. All other worldly acts, practises, attachments, cannot lead to enlightenment.<br><br>Even if a person practises a virtuous Religion that teaches people to go to heaven, as can be seen in many religions that teaches God, the highest attainment is rebirth in heaven. But, rebirth in heaven is not ultimate, it doesn't even make a person any closer to enlightenment or Buddhahood. (human realm is in fact the best realm for cultivation!) And Heaven is Temporary.<br><br>That is why I have said, <blockquote>What other religions practise can be considered 'virtues', 'wholesome deeds', but not merits. Such a person can attain rebirth as human or celestial beings. Merits is different can only come by liberation, from dharmakaya.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</span></blockquote><blockquote>arent we supposed to b fair to everyone ..everyting?</blockquote>Correct. We must treat all sentient beings with equality/equanimity.<br><br><blockquote>arent all the realms considered students of buddha?</blockquote>If you're talking about spirit mediumship, it is advised that we shouldn't create such kinds of affinity with these beings. We certainly do not want to end up among them in the next life. I have known of a medium who at death, sees many of those spirit-deities waiting for him to join them. We certainly do not want that to happen. Spirits also have different kinds. The ones with better karma, are even worshipped in temples, they may have spiritual powers, read minds, know many things because of their spiritual circle. These better-karma spirits are known as 'Spirit-Deities', Gui Shen. However, these spirits would get angry easily and develop hatred when their wishes are not fulfilled. A True Buddhist is not concerned about these superstitions, why in the first place do we have to rely on these spirits? Humans are the ones who can truly cultivate and attain Great Wisdom, it is better instead that we cultivate the dharma.<br><br>Even spirits, spirit-deities, some of them do listen to the Dharma teachings by the Buddha. Although spirits cannot attain enlightenment in that lifetime, similarly, animals cannot attain enlightenment in his lifetime, they will most likely be reborn as a human next lifetime and have the opportunity to cultivate and attain enlightenment. Another thing is, if you have affinity with these spirits, you should practise and after enlightenment, you can benefit these spirits, and teach dharma to them, even.<br><br>I have a friend who used to practised a little bit of Tangki, and he even has the ability to see spirits everywhere. I brought him to my dharma centre, my dharma teacher already knew that there is something about this person. I brought two new people along, then my mother told my dharma teacher that someone could see these spirits, before she was told who the person was she immediately pointed out the correct person and asked "is it him?" He could see these things because his 'Yin Qi' is stronger. His affinity with the spirits is also strong. My dharma teacher advised, since his affinity with these spirits/spirit-deities is strong, he could cultivate even more, attain enlightenment, and therefore help these spirits. This person occasionally posts in our forum but I will not disclose his identity.<br><br><blockquote>if lines has to b drawn ...y The Great Compassion still a Bodhisattva?</blockquote>Until you become like Great Compassionate Guan Yin Pu Sa, who can manifests in ANY forms - whether as kings or ministers, as gods, as mundane men, or monks, etc, (see <a href="http://www.buddhistdoor.com/resources/sutras/lotus/sources/lotus25.htm" rel="nofollow">Lotus Sutra Chapter 25</a>) or even <strong>King of Spirit/Ghosts</strong>, to save sentient beings, it is advisable not to deal with spirits as seen in many cultures and practises.<br><br>For now, my suggestion to you is honestly, earnestly, cultivate the dharma, the path that leads to brightness, wisdom, and bliss.

Pls be more precise and elaborate... I am not very intelligent. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><blockquote>is it affinity....or the word karma should b used?<br><br>eg.do ppl has a choice not to born with any physical defects?<br>(u shld ask ur fren abt the tangki..)</blockquote>Yes definitely, it is an affinity. However, even if we have affinity with spirits, we should avoid continuing that kind of karmic affinity.<br><br>And also, ask my friend about the tangki about what?<br><br><blockquote>does keepin a pet or being a spiritmedium makes one fall into the lower realm?</blockquote>Keeping a pet, I presume you mean an animal, does not make one fall into the lower realm. But nevertheless my master discourages it, because you will create an 'Ignorant Affinity'. Who knows, if your pet is very attached to you, the next child you have may be your pet from last life.<br><br>We should be very careful who we have karmic affinity with. For example, if we have a social circle full of vices, people who commit crimes, cheat money, that is very bad, and may influence you in the future also. Another thing is, some people like to gamble... so definitely he will have a lot of gambling ka kis right? There comes the danger... in the future, in his next lifetime, he will have a lot of friends who likes to cheat his money, cheat him in whatever way, cunning. Because they all have the same kind of mindset.<br><br>Therefore Buddha taught a lot of choosing wise friends, friends who you can truly learn from. You can see that in Dhammapada.<br><br><blockquote>even if one has done a misdeed and fall into the lower...one is still movin a step to enlightenment..<br>( i c some contradiction regardin eternal postin in this point)</blockquote>If you move a step forward, you can also move two steps backward.<br><br>Precisely because of this, we MUST be mindful and aware of our Mind, Speech, Action.

We can all start breaking 5 precepts, committing crimes, because according to your view, everything we do is a step towards enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>one see 6 realms..<br>i see 1 sam cycle..<br><br>since tat is a cycle..<br>where is the start,where is the end, where is the upper and where is the lower?</blockquote>Originally, there is no cycle.<br><br>Ignorance creates the cycle, the samsara.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Originally, sentient beings and the quintessence of Buddha were the same in pureness and brightness. However, when the conditions for the initiation of ignorance begin to fan like the wind, it eventually produces ignorance. The ignorance becomes more serious as it gathers momentum and leads to the transmigration in the Six Realms. Ignorance, just like the wind, is invisible and one may not be able to touch them, yet it packs with power so immense that it can destroy houses and uproot trees.<br><br>In the beginning when sentient beings started to transmigrate in the Six Realms, they were in the realm of Heaven. Then, they descended to the Human realm. Human beings have seven types of emotion and six types of lust and because of these they continually commit negative karma. These led them to descend to the realm of Asura. Why is the realm of Asura considered to be a good realm? It is because even heavenly beings can be inflicted by ignorance, causing them to fight among themselves. The more aggressive fighters eventually descend to the realm of Asura....</span><br><br>And then later, gradually, the 3 lower realms are also formed.<br><br><blockquote>when theres isnt upper and lower and separation of the 6realms..<br>then one can 'treat all sentient beings with equality/equanimity.'</blockquote>Upper and lower realms are just a conventional way of explaining the destination of WHOLESOME and UNWHOLESOME karma. If you are a good man who does virtuous deeds, you will live in the 3 higher realm. If you are a bad person who is unvirtuous and does unwholesome deeds, then you are sure to descend to the 3 lower realms. We cannot escape karma. If we are evil, then greater sufferings will surely come upon us.<br><br>From <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=153935&amp;page=3" rel="nofollow">Curious - Any Christian-turned-Buddhist converts here?</a><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by _wanderer_:<br><br>Some people may have already replied you... but I haven't got time to finish reading all their posts.<br><br>Indeed the Buddha is not a God. However, the Buddha is the <strong>teacher of gods and men</strong>. He has perfected wisdom and compassion (methods) and is able to help himself and others to attain Nirvana - a state of Enlightenment that is beyond the <strong>pain of dualism</strong>.<br><br>What is dualism? It is the fixated concepts of good/bad, high/low; it is fixation, rigidity, grasping, attachment.<br><br>"Heaven is good/desirable and hell is bad/scary." These are dualistic notions, which the Buddha has seen their nature as impermanent, dissatisfactory and painful. Whether one is born in heaven, hell or any other realm, one's existence ensures that one will experience the dukkha of birth, old age, sickness, death and so forth.<br><br>Gods are not of higher rank than the Buddha and cannot be, for Gods, like us, are tied by the ignorance of dualism. They are still happy about existence, about getting what they want, and scared about death, angry/unhappy when they don't get what they want. They are swayed by changing conditions and hence are not free. [P/S: Look at how the Christian God describes himself to be a Jealous God; and the stories of how local Chinese deities get angry over their devotees...]<br><br>The Buddha, on the other hand, is beyond dualism, beyond birth and death, beyond the 6 realms of rebirth, beyond happiness/sadness, beyond good/bad. Thus, attaining Buddhahood is the ultimate liberation and is beyond comparison.
