              Khet Mar for RFA’s Myanmar Service</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In an interview
              with reporter Khet Mar of RFA’s Myanmar Service, Ashin Wirathu of the Committee
              for the Protection of Nationality and Religion (Ma Ba Tha), outlines his
              Buddhist nationalist group's views on Aung San Suu Kyi’s opposition National
              League for Democracy (NLD) after meeting with senior party official Tin Oo, as
              well as on other political parties ahead of Myanmar’s Nov. 8 general elections.</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"><br> <br> <strong>RFA: What did you discuss when you met with Tin Oo of the NLD?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: I told him that Ma Ba Tha generally agrees with NLD policies. We
              agree with the NLD’s goal of eliminating the constitutional clause which gives
              [25 percent of parliamentary] seats to the military, but we don’t agree with
              amending Article 59(f) [which includes eligibility requirements that
              effectively bar Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming president], because it is like a
              national fortress for the country. <br> <br> <strong>RFA: People say that Ma Ba Tha shares the same goals as the [ruling] Union
              Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). What is your response to these
              comments?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: Yes, we share the same goals not only with the USDP, but also
              with other smaller parties. We adhere to these principles because they are
              necessary to protect the country.<br> <br> <strong>RFA: According to recent reports, Ma Ba Tha members have distributed
              pamphlets calling on the public not to vote for the NLD. What is your response
              to these claims and what is your opinion on the NLD?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: Some people distributed these brochures while we held a Ma Ba
              Tha conference. As soon as we realized this we stopped them and released a
              statement the following day, saying that Ma Ba Tha didn't endorse them.
              However, they continued distributing them in other places. While there might be
              someone from Ma Ba Tha involved in this, the organization never asked them to
              do it—that is not our policy. They likely acted on their own beliefs.<br> <br> My opinion on the NLD is that our organization agrees with part of their name,
              as we are acting in the interest of democracy. But the NLD is weak when it
              comes to nationalism, and we can’t depend on them to stand up for the country.
              We’d rather refer to them simply as the "League for Democracy."<br> <br> <strong>RFA: You said you share the same goals as the USDP. What is the nature of Ma
              Ba Tha’s involvement with the USDP? And which party do you want to win the
              election?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: I have no involvement with the USDP, and the party exerts no
              control over our organization. However, we share the same attitude on
              nationalism, as the USDP’s leaders are former members of the military. I have
              been working in the interest of nationalism … since before the USDP was even
              formed. I don’t fully trust either party [the NLD or the USDP]. We have been
              calling for a multiparty system since 1988. I will be pleased if candidates
              from a variety of different parties win in the election, as long as they
              deserve to be in parliament.<br> <strong><br> RFA: Ma Ba Tha has been asking people not to vote for non-Buddhist candidates.
              Everybody knows about Ma Ba Tha’s anti-Muslim stance, but there will also be
              candidates who are not Buddhists, including Christians and Hindus. As you have
              spoken out about non-Buddhists, does this mean that Ma Ba Tha is against
              Christians and Hindus as well?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: No, we are not against them. We are only afraid of the danger
              Muslims pose, as Islam has been destroying the world. We have no problem with Hindu
              and Christian people, who are our brothers and sisters. Many Christian people
              have been helping us—supporting Ma Ba Tha. We even have Christians in our
              organization. We feel that all 135 ethnic groups [officially recognized in
              Myanmar] are our brothers and sisters. We feel the same even about the ethnic
              Kamans, who are Muslim.<br> <br> <strong>RFA: A few weeks ago, a mob attacked a Christian church, which is against
              the law. We haven’t seen any statement about this issue from Ma Ba Tha. What is
              your response to the incident?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: We don’t accept that kind of attack at all. The Ma Ba Tha group
              in that area has a responsibility to do something about it. It appears they
              were derelict in their duties.<br> <br> <strong>RFA: Monks from two famous monasteries—Masoeyein and Maha Gandayon—have
              released statements saying they have no connection to Ma Ba Tha and are not
              supporters of the organization. Other groups and individuals that offer alms to
              monks have announced that they will no longer make offerings to Ma Ba Tha monks
              because they believe the organization’s activities harm unity within the Sangha
              [monastic community], as well as the relations between monks and laypeople. Do
              you see Ma Ba Tha’s activities as disrupting the peaceful nature of Buddhism?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: These are monks and individuals who are egotists. They make
              their decisions based on their passions and concern for political gain. They
              have launched a personal attack against us because they think we are harming
              them. But actually, we give no priority to passion—we are working to protect
              the nation and our religion for the people of Myanmar.<br> <br> <strong>RFA: So you believe that Ma Ba Tha’s activities are in line with Buddha’s
              teachings and do not go against the peaceful nature of Buddhism?</strong><br> <br> ASHIN WIRATHU: I do. Ma Ba Tha is acting according to Buddha’s teachings. If
              someone believes otherwise, he or she should point out how that is so. If we
              are wrong, we are ready to apologize.</span><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"></span></p>

              <p>Myanmar has gone through a lot of political changes along with its neighbour India. Like India it was a British colony. Now because of the British that's why today we can discourse and anal-yse Buddhism in English as a common language. While the Chinese made Buddhism popularised thousands of years ago, and also invaded north Myanmar-ish areas and even till recent years you still can see Kuomintang veterans living as refugees there, historically Myanmar brought all the vehicles of Buddhism to Temasek. Sooner or later their political changes will affect Singapore, yet in which direction it is difficult predicting since few may have imagined the Americans losing the Vietnam War while the Korean War remains a bitter stalemate.</p>
              <p>Over decades, the Americans and the West only dare to use South East Asia as an adhoc stage for their globalised presences. If Christianity seeks a presence in East Asia, it learned the hard way in shinto and buddhist Japan alone. If you over-militarise and over-evangelise Japan they start a war and kill your grandchildren with your own inventions and ideas. If you leave them alone, they play their own ballparks and annoy themselves and their neighbours including Korea and China. That leaves the West all the time to waste since the Cold War, even till today in Syria the Russia - [sic] yes Mother Russia  - still seeks a differing stance from the West despite once-Aryanised Germany being unified.</p>
              <p>The Aryans and the Vedics have got their own histories and influences of lineages since timeless beginnings. If you need to read up on the above topic  further, try skipping Mcdonalds' beef patties and you will understand what the aryans and the vedics understand.</p>
              <p>If anybody needs a pun, the HBO miniseries Bang of Brothers may have came up with its own koan.</p>
              <p>Maybe I got it wrong, "The Buddhists don't hate the Christians, they just hate their Mcdonalds' beef patties!"</p>
              <p>Or maybe, "The Christians in the UK, Australia and USA won't understand why they are forbidden from eating beef patties in Asia because Jesus Christ never spoke English either!"</p>
