              whose Awakening experience at age seventeen --- as described by him
              ---transpired almost entirely through offerings of the internet. What
              he presents within the contents of the paper offers interesting
              insights into the overall modern Enlightenment experience, and thus
              then perhaps, will be of interest to ALL seekers along the path, but
              especially so those whose computers are a personal choice for garnering
              information on Zen, spirituality, and the Awakening process. In that
              the author has since taken the page down from general internet access,
              through courtesy to him, within what is offered here, he will remain
              anonymous. All personal references have thus been removed.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Although
              not widely known, Enlightenment through similar means as cited above
              and presented in full below is not totally unheard of. Many, many years
              before the advancement of computers and the invention of the internet
              there was an American of great spiritual Attainment by the name of <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/pulyan.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alfred Pulyan</span></strong></a> that
              reached a great number of people almost exclusively through a mail
              order following. People that came to hear about him would write hoping
              for insight into what one could do to Awaken to the Absolute, and
              Pulyan would respond, asking for no more than a stamped self-addressed
              envelope. He claimed to have a 70% success rate, more than ten times
              higher than the ancient Zen masters --- and all done through mail
              order.  </span></p>

                      Childhood Years</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">I was born in a small town in
                      1983. My parents divorced when I was two years old,
                      but thankfully, both my parents were sensible enough people who
                      were able to communicate at a civilized level and they
                      agreed to share custody. Since I never knew any
                      alternative to this, it never really bothered me. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Although my family was not religious (though not atheist
                      either), I had always had a spiritual 'touch', in the
                      sense that ever since I was a small child I had a
                      desire to look for 'that which was greater than me.' That 'looking'
                       manifested itself in a great love for nature, while
                      also stirring up a nearly unquenchable interest in the supernatural and
                      mysterious. I always had the feeling that I was different
                      in the sense that I felt where others might think
                       pursuing spiritual and mystical matters with their
                      heart and soul was an intriguing 'idea', this was
                      something that I considered a very real opportunity in my
                      life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Other than that continuing feeling that
                      there somehow had to be more to life, I had an ordinary happy childhood. I surely wasn't
                      dissatisfied with my life in any way, I just wanted to go
                      deeper. I had always believed that there had to be some
                      ultimate reality that could be realized.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">When I was 14 years old I discovered
                      Buddhism for the very first time. The appeal was instant.
                      Here was someone, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/buddha.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shakyamuni Buddha</span></strong></a>, whom I felt must have penetrated to true
                      understanding and had found real inner peace. And they, the Buddha's followers,
                      had laid out a path for others to follow. Buddhism seemed
                      reasonable in every way regarding its approach to the
                      world, and yet deeply mystical, beyond the ordinary world
                      so to speak. Particularly the Tibetan Masters appealed to
                      me, as I saw their supernatural powers called <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/siddhi.html"><strong>Siddhis</strong></a> as an expression
                      of having found true Enlightenment. After a few weeks of
                      intense study of Buddhism I was pouring through a book
                      about Buddhism in general when I came across a small
                      section about a Japanese branch of Buddhism called <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/awakening101/fivetypes.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Zen</span></strong></a>,
                      where monks had to face inhumane hard labour every day,
                      and when not working they would be meditating at least
                      six hours a day. Furthermore, there was no seeming logic
                      in the Zen philosophy.  Zen masters were known to
                      harass their students to the extreme, hitting them
                      completely unexpected and were generally not above making
                      their students' lives a living hell. This might not sound
                      very appealing, but I was intrigued. What little
                      impression I had of Zen was as a mysterious and arcane
                      monk order (the name alone was incredibly alluring!).
                      Unlike the somewhat failed attempts among new-agers to
                      resurrect arcane and ancient traditions, this was a
                      tradition that had actually stayed alive throughout the
                      millennia. Thus I concluded that this would not be
                      possible if there wasn't something to it. Zen, I felt,
                      transcended all logic and thus they had to have found
                      something beyond. I felt assured that if someone had
                      somehow discovered ultimate truth, it had to be a Zen
                      Master. I was convinced that Zen was the right way for
                      me.</span></p>

                      Quest Begins</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">It was not until about a year-and-a-half
                      later, at the age of sixteen, that I actually did
                      anything about it. My mother had recently got internet access at home. One day, I
                      decided to search for a Zen newsgroup and subsribed to
                      one. As I begun to explore Zen through interaction with
                      other Zennists (I still didn't understand Zen, nor do I
                      think those I talked with did), after just four days of
                      posting to the newsgroup, I had my first insight
                      experience. Although the insight in itself was rather
                      insignificant (I had simply realized that all things are
                      interdependedly connected - cause and effect) it proved
                      to me that there was indeed something to Zen. From that
                      point on, I never had any doubt that I would one day be
                      Enlightened, which was unquestionably a factor that
                      contributed much to my eventual Awakening. This was the
                      first major turning point in my spiritual search. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">I had many small insight experiences
                      after that, none of which I can remember now, and
                      generally just tried to practise as openly and honestly
                      as possible. I was never much good at meditating. I tried
                      at times, my posture was good and rarely caused me
                      problems, but I never managed to establish a regular
                      habit of sitting and thus never managed to make my mind
                      one-pointed in meditation either. The closest thing I
                      ever came to establishing actual concentration was when
                      meditating upon <a href="http://sped2work.tripod.com/4emotions.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>metta</em></span></strong></a> (lovingkindness/compassion), which is something I still
                      have a fondness for. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">One could very well say that I am a child
                      of the Cyber-Sangha. I have never actually
                      met another Buddhist or spiritual seeker in my real life
                      (at least not that I am aware of), but fortunately I have
                      met many on the internet. Some were Enlightened, some
                      were not, but all of them helped me in one way or
                      another. Looking back, I can see just how tremendously
                      beneficial it was to have friends on the path, to spur me
                      onwards, and to help me look deeper into myself and what
                      I considered to be 'me'. The newsgroups I subscribed to
                      enabled me to engage in conversations about the path and
                      to challenge my own views, uprooting many attachments to
                      my own ideas and beliefs. It was not always beneficial
                      (there were many times I was being misguided), but the
                      friends I have gained from posting to these newsgroups
                      are all people who have contributed much to my progress
                      and whom I am deeply grateful for meeting, as I have
                      gained much from their experience. The internet was also
                      my prime source for reading, as my local library only had
                      very few books on Buddhism. Thus I was fortunate that so
                      many Buddhist teachings existed on the internet.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">The second turning point came over a year
                      later, around October 2000, when I had a small insight
                      into the nature of perception or (mental) images. This
                      insight gradually expanded over the next month until I
                      saw the nature of perception quite clearly. This insight
                      was much clearer than anything else before that, and
                      moreover, it was something I could actually use in my
                      daily practise. Over the next couple of months I would be
                      aware of my own attachment to perception in almost any
                      daily situation. Whether it was regarding my own feelings
                      towards things in my life, or something as simple as
                      drying myself with the towel, I found attachment to self,
                      I was clinging to an image, even if it were something as
                      trivial as the habitual image of drying myself with a
                      towel. That particular insight had become like a sword
                      with which I would sever attachments of all kinds in my
                      life. It was this insight, and the cultivation born of
                      it, that set me on a path which could only go one way and
                      would eventually trigger my awakening four months later.
                      Around December, I also discovered the <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/platform-sutra.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Platform Sutra</span></strong></a> of <a href="http://sped2work.tripod.com/huineng.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hui Neng</span></strong></a> the Sixth Patriarch
              of Zen. The first time I read it, I
                      was alarmed, as the teachings it contained didn't accord
                      with my own understanding at all. I chose to disregard my
                      own understanding though and read it again. During those
                      months, I read it very often and grew more and more fond
                      of it. I did not try to understand the scripture
                      conceptually, but studying that scripture helped my

              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">After months of letting go of so many
                      attachments to images of myself and others, it finally
                      triggered what I would say was the strongest insight
                      experience I had ever had, as it hit me with surprising
                      impact and clarity, which could be said to be my third
                      turning point on the path. It happened just before the
                      new year. I was merely washing the dishes when I realized
                      that everything I experienced was mind. There was no 'out
                      there' to be experienced; only mind. It was all mind, and
                      mind was vaster than the sky itself. It felt as if I was
                      walking around in an infinite bubble that expanded in all
                      directions. I still clung to the dualistic notions
                      between 'me' and mind. It was as if there was mind all
                      around me, and me experiencing that mind. Nonetheless, it
                      was a good incentive to be more aware as I got a real
                      kick out of perceiving a mind vaster than the sky. I felt
                      that Enlightenment could not be far away. It wasn't.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Sometime around mid-February I began to
                      realize that true realization couldn't be found in the
                      world of cause and effect, that I had to somehow
                      transcend conditioned existence before I make progress.
                      It was as if I was stuck in between. Everything around me
                      seemed absolutely futile. I wasn't really depressed, but
                      rather left with the impression of total futility of the
                      world. It didn't matter what I did or what I practised.
                      It was all bound by conditioned existence, yet I knew
                      that I had to go beyond all conditioned existence. Yet
                      how do you make the transition between conditioned and
                      unconditioned existence? I felt out of tune with myself
                      and everything around me. Yet I knew that this true mind
                      I was searching for could never be found apart from
                      conditioned existence; that this life was all there was.
                      It couldn't be found in conditioned existence, yet not
                      apart from it either. I had realized completely was
                      Enlightenment was not, yet my mind was not yet ready to
                      harvest the fruits of true Enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">On February the 25th, I broke through the
                      barrier. I was walking home alongside a lake as usually,
                      when I discovered my true self, and that it had always
                      been with me. Because it had always been with me, it
                      didn't really change anything. In fact nothing changed.
                      Because nothing changed, there was no reason to respond
                      to anything, and I walked on as if nothing had happened,
                      entirely undisturbed by what had just been revealed to
                      me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">I cannot pinpoint anything concrete that
                      could have triggered this event. Rather, it was a sudden
                      consequence of something that had happened gradually over
                      a long period of time, namely the falling away of my
                      attachments to 'me' and everything that comes along with
                      that, such as views, concepts, beliefs etc.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"><strong>The
                      Discovery</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">I will now try to describe
                      as accurately as possible that which I discovered on that
                      day and which became much clearer to me in the months
                      that followed. Basically, what I discovered cannot be
                      said to be anything. There is absolutely nothing that can
                      distinguish it any way, so trying to describe it is
                      useless really. It is forever indescribable.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Nonetheless, there is a
                      conditioned existence which can be distinguished and when
                      one puts It in relation to this conditioned existence, it
                      is possible to give a description of what it is <em>not</em>.
                      It is not possible to give a positive description of it,
                      yet the <em>via negativia </em>description is not true
                      either. It should be understood that it is not an actual
                      description, but rather a negation in relation to
                      conditioned existence.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">I discovered that nothing
                      that can be distinguished as being anything is really me.
                      Everything that is conditioned, subjected to cause and
                      effect and thus impermanent, is not who I really am. That
                      all the thoughts, feelings and views that we harbour have
                      nothing to do with me. Even my body is not really me.
                      There is no 'I'. No one to feel, no one to think or act.
                      All of this happens independently of me, yet not apart
                      from me. The 'I' as such is nothing more than a set of
                      ideas, thoughts and views which are being continuously
                      sustained by dwelling on them and holding on to them as
                      real. Once the false 'I' is seen through, the true self
                      manifests.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">My true self is awareness
                      or consciousness, but not as you think of it. What I
                      discovered was that my awareness is not bound by anything
                      at all. I call it the Unconditioned or Essence of Mind.
                      What I mean by Essence of Mind is that when you take
                      everything in the mind and strip away, then there is just
                      this, the essence, left.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">It is not bound by space,
                      so it could be called infinite, yet this is not really
                      true as it cannot really be said to have any spatial
                      limits even if this limit is infinity. Thus my true self
                      expands everywhere in all directions, yet it is nowhere
                      to be found.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">It is not bound by time,
                      so it could be called eternal, yet this is not really
                      true either, as it is utterly beyond any time limits even
                      if this limit is eternity. My true self was never born,
                      never ages and never dies. Yet to say that I will live
                      for eternity is not true either, as it is utterly beyond
                      time. Perhaps the closest thing would be to say that
                      there is just this utterly unchanging moment, yet this
                      also fails to hit the mark as it could imply that it is
                      static which it is not. It is beyond static and moving.
                      Thus before the world was, <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/whoami.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I AM</span></strong></a>. Not before the world, I <em>was</em>,
                      but before the world, I AM.  See <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/dharmadhatu.html"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dharmadhatu</span></strong></a>.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">It is not bound by any
                      conditioned phenomena (which constitutes all of existence
                      - the entire universe). Since all conditioned phenomena
                      are in a constant state of flux, the Unconditioned could
                      be said to be unmoving, yet this is not really true since
                      it implies something static. Let it be understood that it
                      merely does not participate in the flux of conditioned
                      existence, and this absence of flux is called unmoving.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Since it is not bound by
                      any phenomena, it is not bound by the senses either.
                      There are no sounds in the Unconditioned, so it could be
                      said to be silent, yet this isn't really true either.
                      Rather, it is the absence of sound and silence. It cannot
                      be seen, heard, smelled, felt, tasted or cognised about
                      in any way. Rather, your true self is that which
                      cognises, smells, tastes, feels, hears and sees. Yet this
                      is not entirely true either as this could imply that
                      there is a self experiencing this, and thus bound by the
                      senses. Rather, there is just this awareness of the
                      senses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">It is not dual in any way.
                      Thus it could be said to be non-dual, yet this isn't
                      really true either. Rather, it is neither dual nor
                      non-dual. In actuality, the only thing that creates
                      dualistic notions such as good/bad, here/there and
                      subject/object is your thoughts. Thoughts <em>is that
                      which separates</em>. Thus whenever you are bound by
                      thoughts, you are separated from <em>that which is</em>,
                      and true freedom cannot be found. Thus thoughts will
                      never be able to capture your true self. True freedom
                      means that everything merely <em>is as it is</em>. There
                      is no trying to add or take anything, indulgence or
                      rejection, or perhaps more accurately: There is no
                      'should'. Only when you are capable of giving up all
                      ideas of anything that 'should' be in any way, including
                      the tendency to think 'should', only then can you truly
                      be free. Even the thought that 'should' should not be
                      there means you are bound. True non-'shouldness' means
                      taking in both 'should' and the absence of 'should' and
                      let everything, even your 'shoulds', be as it is. As long
                      as you are bound by any mental state whatsoever, your
                      true Unconditioned awareness cannot manifest. If your
                      true self can be said to be any mental state, it is the
                      state of no state at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Since it is not bound by
                      time or movement it any way, it is always present. Even
                      though you may not realise it, and you are constantly
                      pulled around by your thoughts and views, your true self
                      remains utterly unmoving. Nothing can affect it.
                      Therefore, once you discover your true self, nothing
                      changes at all. If anything changes it is merely that you
                      are now aware of the fact that things <em>are as they are</em>,
                      and that it has always been so. There is nothing to be
                      realised.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Since it is this true
                      ground of reality and there is nothing further beyond
                      this, it could be said to be 'ultimate'. But since it is
                      always present in all things (and always has been), it
                      would mean that everything is ultimate. Since there is
                      nothing for which the ultimate can stand in
                      contradistinction against, what is the point of labeling
                      it such?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Some people may perceive
                      all of this as something deeply mysterious beyond the
                      scope of their own capacities. It is not. It is simple
                      and plain living, and nothing mysterious about it. Do not
                      imagine that this unconditioned awareness is somehow
                      apart from the world and daily life. On the contrary, it
                      could be said that one is even more closer to life than
                      ever before, because there is no separation between you
                      and the world. When caught up in dualism, one creates the
                      illusion of someone being aware (subject) and something
                      to be aware of (object). Yet there is just this
                      awareness, there is nothing to be aware of. Conditioned
                      phenomena are not apart from awareness in any way, yet
                      they not really awareness either.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Perhaps the best way to
                      describe this is to use the analogy of a mirror, the
                      unconditioned awareness being the mirror and conditioned
                      phenomena beings images reflected in the mirror. The
                      mirror doesn't change because reflections arise. It does
                      not dwell upon the reflections, yet the reflections
                      exists nowhere apart from the mirror. The <em>are</em> the mirror, yet the mirror isn't the reflections.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">This is as exact as I can
                      possibly describe this discovery, yet it still misses the
                      mark. The only way to truly know is to experience it for
                      yourself. I hope you do someday.</span></p>

              <span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"><strong>What
                      Happened Afterwards</strong></span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">In the first months just
                      after the Awakening I struggled with a lot of my past
                      views and concepts as they conflicted with the reality of
                      being, mainly my concepts of what I had thought
                      Enlightenment was previously. Especially for the first
                      few weeks, I kept thinking things like "I am
                      Enlightened now. I should know this!", whenever I
                      came across ignorance or delusion. What was even worse
                      was that I had attached to my Awakening and turned it
                      into an object, when in fact it is a continual living
                      experience. I looked only at the understanding derived
                      from this awakening and felt that this was it. Little did
                      I know that understanding truth is useless if you are not
                      actually <em>being</em> truth, being your understanding,
                      rather than turning it into an object and thus separating
                      truth from yourself. I stopped practising for the first
                      couple of weeks and made no attempts to do anything
                      spiritually at all. I had found 'It' and in my pride I
                      figured that this was all that was needed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">As time progressed, it
                      became obvious to me that I wasn't omniscient and that I
                      still needed to practise, even though it had now become a
                      'non-practise' so to speak. Realizing Enlightenment was
                      one thing: <em>Being</em> Enlightenment is another.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">My daily spiritual
                      practise basically changed from being aware to <em>being
                      awareness</em>. To be aware implies that there is
                      something to be aware of (object) and someone being aware
                      (subject) Since there is intrinsically no 'I' to be
                      aware, what is the point of being aware? Rather it is
                      about just being who you really are, just being
                      awareness. What I meant when I said 'non-practise' means
                      simply not doing anything at all, although it should be
                      noted that this does not mean abstaining from doing and
                      just being a useless block. Whenever one takes part
                      actively with the conditioned, one creates volition and
                      sustains the mental baggage one is carrying around.
                      Instead, it is to simply be your unconditioned awareness,
                      and let the process of conditioning take care of itself.
                      Thoughts arise and thoughts are liberated as they arise,
                      simply because one allows all things to be as they are,
                      without any 'should' involved; no giving or taking, no
                      indulgence or rejection, nor abstaining from
                      giving/taking and indulgence/rejection. Everything is
                      allowed to be as it is. Since one does not abstain from
                      the thought process, it is still functional living, as
                      one is more than capable of interacting with the world
                      around you. Probably even more functionally than before
                      since one does not get caught up in the thought process,
                      nor the external circumstances to which the thoughts
                      responds. Both happen and arise, yet since there is no
                      thinker, the thoughts simply arise in response to
                      external circumstances and fall away when there is no
                      longer anything externally to cause the reactionary
                      thought.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">Up to this point (and it
                      still is), my practise has revolved mostly around
                      settling in the Enlightenment. Firstly, since that
                      initial Awakening, the insight derived from this has
                      become a lot clearer and settled as past concepts and
                      views has simply fallen away, thus letting the insight
                      penetrate into more and more aspects of being so to
                      speak. The other aspect, which cannot really be separated
                      from the first, is to integrate your awareness more and
                      more into life, growing accustomed to just being your
                      true self. The reason that this cannot be separated from
                      the first is that this is also just letting your true
                      self, which is truth itself, integrate more and more into
                      the various aspects of being. When I say aspects of
                      being, I am talking about division, which are divisions
                      created from my own mental formations, thus it simply
                      means allowing the divisions that we have created for
                      ourselves to fall away so that truth itself can penetrate
                      and liberate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">It is exactly because we
                      have created and nurtured such divisions over such a long
                      period of time, that Enlightenment does not instantly
                      pervade your whole being and all obstructions
                      instantaneously fall away. Thus there are still many
                      delusions, defilements and sufferings left after
                      Awakening. Once Enlightened, I had seen what truth really
                      is, yet I still have to integrate this into my whole life
                      and being and let those divisions fall away, before there
                      can be true unconditional unending freedom. It has always
                      been there with me, it is just a question of uncovering
                      it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Geneva,Arial,Helvetica,san-serif; font-size: medium;">In early June 2001, I
                      decided to help a good friend of mine on the path of
                      truth, after not having spoken with him for many months.
                      He needed guidance on the path, and since I had
                      discovered the way myself, I figured that I might help
                      him, by pointing him in the right direction. He accepts
                      my guidance and I talk with him often, giving him
                      pointers on the path. I talked with my own teacher
                      and he told me that at my current stage, guiding others
                      would be highly beneficial. I can see what he means, but
                      I am no teacher. At the moment, I am still involved in
                      the process of 'settling' and that is really all that I
                      would want to concern myself at the moment. It's not that
                      I mind at all, I am more than happy to help out a friend
                      who needs it, but this is very much the exception to the
                      rule (not that I mind helping others on the path either.
                      I just have no interest in teaching them). Maybe one day
                      I will begin teaching (some ten or twenty years from
                      now), but not now. <strong>The Awakening I had was only simply an
                      initial one, not total and complete insight into the
                      nature of all reality.<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/cyber-sangha.html#N1">[2]</a></strong> I still have much to learn, most
                      importantly, learning to settle in just being. And that
                      is all I am really doing at the moment.</span></p>
