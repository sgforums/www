              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Three times as many Buddhists as Communists in China: Dalai
              Lama’s Tibet wish may require rapprochement with former adversaries</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">01/16/2018 Martin Desai Huffpost</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Whilst China technically remains a communist country, it has
              over the last two or three decades relaxed draconian Mao-era rules, for example
              by opening the door to private sector capitalism and by allowing individuals to
              practice a religion of their choice, so long as it is not to be perceived as a
              potential threat to the stability of the state or of the Communist Party. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are now almost three times as many Buddhists in China
              as there are Party members. An official communiqué released in July this year
              estimated the membership of the Communist Party of China at just under 90
              million. Meanwhile, the State Bureau of Religious Affairs estimates there are
              some 250 million Buddhists in China, more or less evenly split between Tibetan
              Buddhism and Han Buddhism, and 200,000 registered Buddhist monks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chinese authorities monitor religious adherence closely, and
              are extremely sensitive to any challenge, real or imagined, that certain
              religions may represent. While the Chinese regime’s approach to Buddhism has
              been liberal – for example, no bans have been issued and open religious
              expression is permitted – it clearly takes the religion’s influence seriously,
              given its importance in Chinese society. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Above all the regime fears religious divisions or unrest, as
              evidenced by the swift outlawing of the Falun Gong movement and imprisonment of
              its leaders after a series of demonstrations by Falun Gong members prompted
              fears that the group’s swelling support could one day rival the Party. The
              regime is also acutely sensitive to the possibility of what it sees as external
              interference – especially on the delicate subject of Tibet and Tibetan
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A particularly divisive issue for the Buddhist community,
              both within Tibet and abroad is the devotion to the Dorje Shugden deity, a
              400-year old practice that began in the 17th century and has become a major
              practice in Tibetan Buddhism. Critics of Shugden devotion say worship of the
              deity promotes divisions among the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, all
              of which share the same fundamental philosophy, and whose differences lie in
              their interpretation of the extensive collection of Buddhist scriptures and the
              emphasis they place on various aspects of Buddhist philosophy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At the origin of the controversy lie a number of ambiguous
              declarations from the current (14th) Dalai Lama. On the one hand, he has
              appealed for non-sectarian cooperation among all branches of Tibet’s religions.
              However, he has also effectively excluded Shugden practitioners from such
              cooperation despite once regarding Dorje Shugden as an enlightened being and
              authoring one of the most popular liturgies to this deity. Some Shugden
              devotees have claimed that these ambiguous declarations amount to a de facto
              ban on their practice and this exclusion is tantamount to being exiled in their
              own communities. The Shugden de facto exclusion has already existed for two
              decades since it was initiated by the current Dalai Lama and has slowly stirred
              disunity in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) of China and among the exiled Tibetan
              communities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 2014 the Washington-based International Campaign for
              Tibet, which is chaired by the actor Richard Gere, said it had obtained a
              ‘directive’ from the Communist Party Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region
              (TAR) in China in February 2014 whose title translates as, “Some opinions on
              dealing correctly with the ‘Gyalchen Shugden’ issue”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The International Campaign for Tibet’s evaluation of the
              directive accuses China of seeking to gain a political advantage from the
              controversy. Entitled “China’s new directive on (the) controversial Shugden
              spirit in Tibet in (a) further bid to discredit Dalai Lama”[2], even the title
              of the critique dispels any expectation of objectivity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While the Chinese position is that the authorities are aiming
              to guarantee the right of all Tibetans to choose who and how they worship, the
              directive issued by the Communist Party Committee of TAR is couched in rather
              divisive language. It calls the Shugden controversy “an important front in our
              struggle with the Dalai clique” and “a deceitful ploy by the 14th Dalai’s
              clique to split the country…”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Chinese directive was made in response to the de facto
              religious ban implemented by the Dalai Lama and Tibetan Government in Exile,
              and to their suspected destabilizing activities inside the TAR. The directive
              proposes educational and law enforcement measures to be implemented inside the
              TAR to mitigate the risk of division and unrest that the controversy may cause.
              Tashi Tadchen, a representative of the European Dorje Shugden Society which was
              set up to create awareness of the supposed ban, says that following the exiled
              Tibetan leadership’s edict against the Shugden practice, there have been
              frequent clashes which at times have led to loss of lives between those who
              feel obliged to follow the Dalai Lama’s decree and adherents of the Shugden
              practice. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The directive mirrors Chinese fear of discord within Tibetan
              Buddhism and Buddhism in general. What it does not do, despite the
              International Campaign for Tibet’s claims, is take a specific position on
              Shugden devotion outside the TAR. In spite of the content of the directive, the
              Exiled Tibetan Government and related NGOs around the World have repeatedly
              used it as evidence to attest that Shugden practitioners are “spies of the
              Chinese Communist Party.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A late 2015 report from the news agency Reuters looking into
              the Shugden controversy relied heavily on the Communist Party Committee of TAR
              directive, and especially the International Campaign for Tibet’s interpretation
              of it, as solid evidence that China is financing various Shugden groups in the
              West, in particular the The International Shugden Community (ISC) which has
              seen strong support from individual members of the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT)
              and Tibetans living in the West. The NKT has meditation centres around the
              world and has been vocal in its public opposition to the Dalai Lama’s position.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even so, no concrete evidence has ever been supplied.
              However, whilst the intended objective is unclear, the Dalai Lama’s Shugden
              exclusion has created unrest amongst Tibetans inside the TAR. This is precisely
              what China fears. China sustains a “One China” policy to maintain stability and
              prosperity of the state. Any divisive conflict in the TAR such as the Shugden
              split, does not augur well for it’s objectives. This is not an objective the
              exile Tibetan Government necessarily shares and its ability to influence
              affairs in the TAR is one of its key bargaining chips.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What we have, in effect, is both sides calling for unity
              while at the same time continuing to bicker. The Communist Party of TAR has
              certainly sought to politicise the rift, as the Dalai Lama and his supporters
              also appear to have done. The Dalai Lama’s comments have served to alienate
              Shugden devotees from other Tibetan Buddhists, and are somewhat jarring when
              considered alongside his calls for unity in the Tibetan diaspora. Shugden
              adherents have insisted that if indeed the exiled Tibetan leadership believes
              that the Communist Party of China is leveraging this issue, then a simple
              pronouncement by the Dalai Lama declaring an end to the de facto ban would have
              the effect of rendering it harmless. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Could the time now be ripe to call for closure of
              hostilities? The Dalai Lama has recently expressed a desire to return to his
              Tibetan homeland, a wish that would have no chance of fulfilment without a
              significant thawing of China’s attitude towards Tibet’s spiritual leader. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Harmony among Tibetan Buddhists is in the interests of both
              sides. Moreover, having said in November 2017 that “Tibetans want to stay with
              China” and that he would return to Tibet at once, if China agrees, the Dalai
              Lama has flagged a willingness to try and overcome the longstanding political
              impasse. In addition, a high ranking emissary of the Dalai Lama, Prof. Samdhong
              Rinpoche - former Prime Minister of the Tibetan exile Government - was
              nominated in the autumn as the Dalai Lama’s envoy for talks with the Chinese
              authorities and is believed to have held secret meetings with senior Communist
              party leaders.</span></p>
              <p><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: "Calibri",sans-serif;         '>Given that one of His Holiness’ early reasons
              for his criticism of Shugden worship – that it “harms the life of the Dalai
              Lama” – no longer seems justified given his longevity and continuing fair
              health, a rapprochement with Shugden acolytes may be a good starting point if
              his desired return to Tibet is to be anything more than a pipe dream.</span></p>
