              widens Thailand’s dangerous divides</span></h1>
              <p><span style="color: #4a4a4a; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; font-weight: normal; line-height: 20.55pt;">JUST
              north of Bangkok, the Thai capital, stands an enormous golden stupa designed to
              last 1,000 years. Its gleaming exterior is made not from smooth tiles but from
              300,000 tightly-packed statues of the Buddha; 700,000 more are hidden inside.
              Just as staggering is the vast apron surrounding the stupa, able to hold 1m
              worshippers. Worakate, a guide dressed in white, explains that followers of the
              Theravada school of Buddhism—dominant in Thailand and elsewhere in South-East Asia—have
              never had a gathering place as large as Mecca or the Vatican. She thinks the
              monument can be a meeting point for adherents from around the world.</span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 2.3rem; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>The stupa is the centrepiece of a sprawling religious complex,
              not all of it quite so bling, inhabited by the Dhammakaya movement. An
              influential if controversial Buddhist sect, it was founded by a handful of
              monks in the 1970s and now claims more than 3m followers in some 30 countries.
              As many as 10,000 mainly middle-class Thais flock to its Sunday ceremonies. One
              of the temple’s senior monks, Phra Somchai Thannavuddho, says that slick modern
              management has helped. But a big draw, he says, is the purity and clarity of
              its practices, qualities which many other temples have left behind.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>The
              movement’s opponents are numerous and vocal, and tell a different tale.
              Conservative worrywarts have long warned that the sect is more like a cult,
              beholden to its septuagenarian abbot, Phra Dhammachayo (who is almost always
              seen in signature shades). They say that the conventional Buddhist teachings it
              issues to newcomers conceal wacky theologies unveiled to adherents once they
              rise in the temple’s ranks. And they allege that the temple has grown wealthy
              by intimating that religious merit may be bought with fistfuls of cash.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 20.55pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>The
              controversy over the Dhammayaka temple is one of several tearing at Thailand’s
              Buddhist establishment. At heart is a battle over who should be the next
              Supreme Patriarch, the country’s chief monk and the leader of its two Theravada
              Buddhist orders, Maha Nikaya and Dhammayuttika Nikaya. The previous incumbent
              was 100 years old when he died in 2013; he was cremated in December. Following
              tradition, the Sangha council—in effect, Thai Buddhism’s governing
              body—announced that the next-most-senior clergyman, Somdet Chuang, should
              succeed him. But under pressure from dissenters, the junta that has ruled
              Thailand since a coup in 2014 has declined to submit the nomination to the
              royal palace for approval—thereby putting the process on hold.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 2.3rem; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>In part, the monks and lay people who oppose the nomination see
              an opportunity to push through an overhaul of Thai Buddhism’s stuffy governance
              that they say is long overdue. They accuse the Sangha council, hierarchical and
              gerontocratic, of failing to tackle rising materialism among the clergy, which
              has lately led to a string of embarrassing revelations involving wayward monks.
              Somdet Chuang is himself under investigation: police say he accepted as a gift
              a vintage Mercedes Benz that had been imported without paying the proper dues
              (his lawyer says he has done nothing wrong). Critics also accuse the council of
              being unhelpfully silent on contentious modern issues such as homosexuality and
              female ordination.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 2.3rem; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>But their opposition also has much to do with the Dhammakaya
              temple, which they say the council has sheltered from investigations into its
              finances and beliefs. Critics also foster the perception that the temple’s top
              brass are sympathetic to the cause of Thaksin Shinawatra, a populist former
              prime minister, detested by Thailand’s elites, whose parties have won every
              general election since 2001 but who now lives in self-imposed exile. The
              insinuation is that the Sangha council and Thai Buddhism more broadly have been
              captured by Thaksinite forces and must now be liberated.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 2.3rem; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>The temple says this is all nonsense, and that among its
              visitors and donors are politicians of every hue. The Sangha council is
              defending itself too. But the brawl is dangerous for the junta, whatever the
              truth. Lacking a democratic mandate, it would gain a huge boost from the monks’
              blessing. Instead it finds itself caught between two embittered factions,
              neither of which it can ignore. The council’s opponents include Buddha Issara,
              a former soldier who is now a firebrand monk. He was influential in the
              royalist protests that helped to bring the junta to power and is now one of its
              most outspoken supporters.</span></p>

              long run…</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 2.3rem; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>Meanwhile, Somdet Chuang’s backers include members of an
              ultranationalist group, the Buddhist Protection Centre of Thailand. In February
              it helped organise a rally at which monks were filmed scuffling with soldiers
              (the same day troops also loitered outside Dhammakaya temple, lest any of its
              clergy were tempted to join the fray). Some clergy warn that the furore over
              the nomination actually conceals an attempt by monks from the smaller
              Dhammayuttika Nikiya, traditionally patronised by the elites, to keep down
              clergy from the larger Maha Nikaya.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 14.05pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 2.3rem; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: 1.5rem;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4a4a4a;'>The spat is uncomfortable for the junta, but perhaps it can be
              managed. Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a scholar of law and Buddhism at Bristol
              University, reckons that Thailand’s government may try to spin out the present
              stalemate for as long as possible. It might, in other words, be years before a
              new Supreme Patriarch is appointed. Whether the present nominee, who is now 90
              years old, will be available for the job is another matter.</span></p>
