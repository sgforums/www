              <p>Sirs,</p>
              <p>After reading some books on Buddhist philosophy,I am very much attracted by this philosphy.Few questions from me to know more of Buddhism, please not everything is a serious question. I am hoping someone with more knowledge/wisdom can answer them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Is Mahaparinirvana(state Buddha) achieved the final stage in spiritual evolution?</li>
              <li>What happens to the soul in this condition?Is it in another state/planet and not in earth?</li>
              <li>Why did Buddha have difficulties(pain,sickness etc) even after achieveing this state?</li>
              <li>Is it possible for anyone to achieve this state after 40 days of continous meditation?As Buddha who had no teacher or experience in meditiation could?</li>
              <li>By following the current practises(clothes,non veg food etc) all Buddhist followers too reach this state?</li>
              <li>I understand sufferings are caused by past actions,so pleasures should also be the result of good actions as well. How can misery/pain really have an effect on the soul which is not affected by our mind or body?</li>
              <li>What is the necessity of creation? Why couldn't all be as it was before time and stay as it is?Instead of life forms to be created(souls start a journey) and finally attains liberation and merges with ultimate?By this premise the samsara as it is called is the prime cause isn't it?</li>
              <li>Whay was Gautama the Buddha? Was he destined to be or he was the first guy who meditated 40 days straight? If he was destined why was he?</li>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buddhism is a teaching of ‘no soul doctrine’. Your question of what happened to an individual who have attained arahantship can be equate with the simile of, where does a fire goes when the fuel is expanded? The question where he has gone does not apply anymore. <span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><em><span style="color: red; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Why did Buddha have difficulties (pain,sickness etc) even after achieveing this state?</span></span></em></p>

In his case, has achieved a state of mind which the Buddhist termed ‘neither-pain nor not-pain’ condition. It means he is no more affected by such conditions.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><em><span style="color: red; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>Is it possible for anyone to achieve this state after 40 days of continous meditation?As Buddha who had no teacher or experience in meditiation could?</span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><span style="font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is not just being able to continuously meditate for 40 days and one is able to achieve that state. It involves for most, a lifelong practice of the purification of one’s morality, the mind with the help of meditation and the perfection of Wisdom. This is in the context of the Theravada tradition. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><em><span style="color: red; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By following the current practises(clothes,non veg food etc) all Buddhist followers too reach this state?</span></span></em></p>

One has to go much further than that to attain Nibanna. <span> </span></span></span></p>

We do not believe such thing as a soul existed. It is the grasping of the mistaken ‘I’ that is causing all this pain and misery. </span></span></p>

This is something that Buddhist teaching of non-self is trying to teach us. It is to get out of all this 'self' creation. By the way, attaining liberation does not mean a merger with an ultimate. That is the teaching of the Advaita Vedanta and also some other similar schools of thoughts. In Buddhism liberation does not in any way means merger with a higher Being. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;  "><em><span style="color: red; font-size: 13pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Whay was Gautama the Buddha?

Buddhism is not about thing such as fate or destiny. He is supposed to have cultivated for many lifetimes before he was able to attain to the state he was in his last life. <span> </span></span></span></p>

                      did Buddha have difficulties (pain,sickness etc) even after
                      achieveing this state?<br><br></span></span></em>Buddha still had old karmas to experience. In other words, all Buddhas and arahants, although no longer creating new karma for new rebirth, are still experiencing the effects of their previous karmic action (mostly from past lives). They will experience them until Parinirvana when they no longer take new samsaric births. As for the rest of us, we just cycle in the 6 realms again and again, until we too attain Nirvana (the termination of afflictions, the end of passion, aggression and delusion).<br><br>That being said, a Buddha does not experience mental suffering and anguish in the face of physical pain. The Buddha does not experience the second dart (<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.006.nypo.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn36/sn36.006.nypo.html</a>)</p>

              <li><em>Whay was Gautama the Buddha? Was he destined to be or he was
                      the first guy who meditated 40 days straight? If he was destined
                      why was he?</em></li>
              </ul>
              <p><br><br>It does not come due to 'destiny' but due to his great effort and hard work in practice. He practiced for three aeons as a bodhisattva perfecting all his virtues and qualities before he could attain Buddhahood. This does not mean to attain enlightenment and liberation we all have to practice three aeons, as we can attain awakening and liberation in this very lifetime by following the Buddha's teachings. But in order to become a supreme Nirmanakaya Buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings, according to the Jataka tales it takes a long way of practice. If you merely what to become a liberated arahant then one life is enough. Also one can become an awakened bodhisattva in one life according to Mahayana Buddhism but not a full-fledged Buddha (Vajrayana may disagree). <br><br>Nevertheless it is an undisputed fact that countless practitioners since the Buddha has attained awakening and liberation, so we too should strive for awakening and liberation ourselves.<br><br>What is the difference between a Buddha and a liberated arahant? A Buddha is also a liberated arahant, but he is more than that. As Buddha himself said:<br><br><em><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.058.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.058.than.html</a><br> </em></p>
              <p><em>The Blessed One said, "The Tathagata — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — is the one who gives rise to the path (previously) unarisen, who engenders the path (previously) unengendered, who points out the path (previously)
                       not pointed out. He knows the path, is expert in the path, is adept at 
                      the path. And his disciples now keep following the path and afterwards 
                      become endowed with the path.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em>"This is the difference, this the distinction, this the 
                      distinguishing between one rightly self-awakened and a monk 
                      discernment-released."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>

              <li><em>What is the necessity of creation? Why couldn't all be as it

                      the prime cause isn't it?</em><br></li>

              <p><br><br>There is no creation nor is there a God. <em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>The world exists only when we think about it; creation stories are for children. In reality the world is created every moment. ~ Jean Klein<br></em><br>As for transmigration, there is no beginning point, and no creation. There is no point in which "souls start a journey" (other than the point that Buddhism does not accept the doctrine of a soul as Aik TC already pointed out), there is no starting point.<br><br>This is what Buddha taught:<br><br><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn15/sn15.013.than.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn15/sn15.013.than.html</a></p>
              <p><br><br><br><em>Is it possible for anyone to achieve this state after 40 days
                      of continous meditation?</em><br><br><br><br>Yes it is definitely possible to attain liberation in 49 days of meditation, in fact 7 days is also possible, some people attain liberation in 1 day or upon meeting the Buddha at the first time.<br><br>For most people however, it takes years of practice. But it is definitely achievable and one should not think of it is as a very difficult endeavor. The problem with most people is not that they cannot attain enlightenment but they aren't interested enough to really go deeply into this. It's just like playing piano, if you are serious about it there is no reason why you cannot master it in some years time.</p>

              <p>Sir <a style="font-size: 14.5px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 8.5px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/297129">jlowbog</a>, I agree with you there on intellectual knowledge vs experienced knowledge. But having an ejaculation is something achievable in few minutes(for a normal person). It seems many people follow Buddhism but no one is guaranteed Nirvana even following all these practises.But given a chance of Nirvan provided you follow Noble Path.</p>
              <p>When some one do something bad to us, what is adviced in Buddhism? It could be a balance of Karma or creation of new karma.Any way to differentiate?Many Buddhist texts speak of Monks knowing their time and way of death to balance their karma.Eg: death by fire because he burned some animals by fire etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also how can Karma affect anything?Everything is just a mechanical action.Saying bad thing/Beating some one is just some action of muscles. Some one could do this to a rock and have no ill effect but to a person, it could?So the action doesn't matter but the result?</p>
              <p>And what is action?if i could afford to do nothing in life, just exist and reduce contact with world?This would reduce the creation of Karma, wouldn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: May be it sounds silly,but its really to know.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: small;">Continuing
                consciousness after                         death is, in most 
              religions, a matter of  revealed truth. In                         
              Buddhism, the evidence comes from the  contemplative experience of      
                                 people who are certainly not ordinary but who  are 
              sufficiently                         numerous that what they say about 
              it is worth  taking seriously into                         account. 
              Indeed, such testimonies begin with  those of the Buddha                
                       himself.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Nevertheless,
                it’s important to                         understand that what’s 
              called reincarnation in  Buddhism has nothing                         to
               do with the transmigration of some ‘entity’  or other. It’s not a      
                                 process of metempsychosis because there is no  
              ‘soul’. As long as                         one thinks in terms of 
              entities rather than  function and                         continuity, 
              it’s impossible to understand the  Buddhist concept of                  
                     rebirth. As it’s said, ‘There is no thread  passing through the  
                                     beads of the necklace of rebirths.’ Over  
              successive rebirths, what                         is maintained is not 
              the identity of a ‘person’,  but the                         
              conditioning of a stream of consciousness.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">Additionally,
                Buddhism speaks of                         successive states of 
              existence; in other words,  everything isn’t                         
              limited to just one lifetime. We’ve experienced  other states of        
                               existence before our birth in this lifetime, and  we’ll
               experience                         others after death. This, of course,
               leads to a  fundamental                         question: is there a 
              nonmaterial consciousness  distinct from the                         
              body? It would be virtually impossible to talk  about reincarnation     
                                  without first examining the relationship between  
              body and mind.                         Moreover, since Buddhism denies 
              the existence of  any self that                         could be seen as
               a separate entity capable of  transmigrating from                      
                 one existence to another by passing from one  body to another, one   
                                    might well wonder what it could be that links  
              those successive                         states of existence together.</span><br> <br> <span style="font-size: small;">One
               could  possibly understand it                         better by 
              considering it as a continuum, a  stream of consciousness               
                        that continues to flow without there being any  fixed or 
              autonomous                         entity running through it… Rather it 
              could be  likened to a river                         without a boat, or 
              to a lamp flame that lights a  second lamp, which                       
                in-turn lights a third lamp, and so on and so  forth; the flame at    
                                   the end of the process is neither the same flame  
              as at the outset,                         nor a completely different 
              one…</span></p>

              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddhist law of <em>kamma</em> is about the working of cause and effect, of action and reaction of intentional action. It also points to the negation of a self. It does not affirm the existence of a permanent self or a permanent soul. In fact, kamma and a permanent self or soul are quite conflicting. <span> </span>When we talk about kamma, it is about change, movement, flux, impermanence, about operating on dependent conditioning. It is a process. On the other hand, the soul or a permanent self is taken as an unchanging, everlasting, indestructible absolute entity. Buddhist no-soul or non-self doctrine looks at all living beings as a process. Life, death and rebirths are just significant events and doors through which this whole process takes place.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #1f497d; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Also how can Karma affect anything? Everything is just a mechanical action. Saying bad thing/Beating someone is just some action of muscles. Someone could do this to a rock and have no ill effect but to a person, it could?</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">When we talks about mechanical action, it is a reference to instinctive action, actions that are pre-dominant of the Animal kingdom rather than the human realm. But when human goes around saying bad things or beating up someone or even a rock, it is not just about action of one’s muscles. An intention is present in most instances before such actions are executed. That intention is more important than whether it is a living being or an inanimate object that you are beating up.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As pointed in early posting, actions can be wholesome or unwholesome cumulating in good or bad results or neutral where no result arises. Results does not necessary have to appear immediately or in this life itself.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #1f497d; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So the action doesn't matter but the result?</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Here we are referencing kamma which is about intentional action. Intentional action good, bad or neutral comes about due to each individual personality, moral, ethical, religious values etc and in Buddhism how far one has progress on our path of purification. </span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Of course, there are actions that are unintentional or instinctive. These kinds of actions also do at time bring about some form of reaction as well, especially if it is carried out on another living being. Good or bad consequences and fruits occurring from all actions performed by individuals are just the products that one has to bear now or in future.</span></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #1f497d; "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And what is action?if i could afford to do nothing in life, just exist and reduce contact with world?This would reduce the creation of Karma, wouldn't it?</span></span></em></p>
              <p style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even if you can afford to do nothing in life and live in a cave on solitary confinement, reduce your wholesome or unwholesome intentional actions, you will still not be able to escape the potential fruitions of other past kamma committed in this and other previous existence. In other word, you can try and run away but you certainly cannot hide forever. </span></p>

              <p>I have understood your replies as:In Buddhism there is no soul but a self which has to be negated. And when this is done, it's Nirvana in Buddhism. There are consequences of intention which can come later(this life or next).</p>

                                    is conventionally called water. Hydrogen and oxygen 
                  are not                         attributes of an entity "water" (no such

              <p><br> Self view is the held position that there is a self. Self truly exists. 
                  Self may be seen as                         attributeless (as some 
                  attributeless pure consciousness as in                         advaita),
                   or a self that owns or contains attributes, or an agent                
                           that manifests, owns, observes, or controls, its aggregates. 
                  The precise view of self varies from eternal, partially eternal, to 
                  nihilistic (for a lengthy discourse by Buddha on the numerous "thicket 
                  of views", refer to <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.01.0.bodh.html</a>).
                   From an eternalist perspective, the self remains unchanged despite the 
                  changes in life. It remains unchanged even after bodily death. It is 
                  either seen as the unchanging self [as an individual soul], or the Self 
                  [as an infinite Self or Presence] that is unaffected by the passing 
                  aggregates or phenomena.<br> <br> <strong>Nihilism</strong></p>

              <p><br> Co-dependently arisen five aggregates are empty of self, but is         
                                  conventionally called self. Seeing is not a self seeing,
                   but is                         simply the experience being seen. 
                  Volition is not via a doer, but                         is simply 
                  action-activity-process, co-dependently arisen.                         
                  Consciousness is not a self, it is simply auditory consciousness        
                                   manifested dependent on ear, sound and attention, so on
                   and so                         forth. Taste of chocolate has nothing to
                   do with a taster but is simply the process or seamless activity of 
                  biting, tongue touching chocolate, consciousness of taste, etc. 
                  Ultimately, whatever dependently originates is also empty of any true 
                  existence (five aggregates are also empty) - but appearances are not 
                  denied.<br> <br> <br> <br> Now replace "water" or "self" with anything - mind, matter,             
                              Buddha-nature, Truth, awareness, cars, houses, atoms, 
                  universe,                         etc. All applies the same way.<br> <br> Diamond Sutra: "Subhuti, all dharmas are spoken of as no dharmas.                         Therefore they are called dharmas."<br> <br> Anuradha Sutta: "And so, Anuradha — when you can't pin down the         
                                  Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life
                   — is it                         proper for you to declare, 'Friends, 
                  the Tathagata — the supreme                         man, the superlative
                   man, attainer of the superlative attainment —                         
                  being described, is described otherwise than with these four            
                               positions: The Tathagata exists after death, does not exist
                   after                         death, both does &amp; does not exist 
                  after death, neither exists                         nor does not exist 
                  after death'?"<br> <br> Ted Biringer: "...According to Dogen, this “oceanic-body” does not      
                                     contain the myriad forms, nor is it made up of myriad
                   forms – it is                         the myriad forms themselves. The 
                  same instruction is provided at                         the beginning of
                   Shobogenzo, Gabyo (pictured rice-cakes) where, he                      
                     asserts that, “as all Buddhas are enlightenment” (sho, or honsho),   
                                        so too, “all dharmas are enlightenment” which he 
                  says does not mean                         they are simply “one” nature 
                  or mind."<br> <br> Thusness (2008): The key is in "emptiness" so that there is complete non
                   abiding and                         (non-)staying (thus avoiding 
                  eternalism) and "luminosity" so that there is aliveness and clarity     
                                      without falling into nihilism. <br> <br> <br> Note: does that mean that conventionally self truly exists? No.         
                                  Conventional truths are not in fact true nor existing 
                  but are                         merely deluded projections as a result 
                  of ignorance. Five                         aggregates are deludedly 
                  conceived as a self. Such a self may                         
                  conventionally be considered true, yet there is actually no truth       
                                    to it. It is merely a false name used by the 
                  enlightened for                         pragmatic purpose, but taken to 
                  be true and existing by the                         ignorant. Nagarjuna:
                   "Since the Jina proclaims that nirvana                         alone is
                   true, what wise person would not reject the rest as                    
                       false?"<br> <br> The diagrams are inspired by Julian Baggini's speech on Ted talk: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html</a></p>

Just like fire burning on grass is grassfire, fire burning on wood is woodfire etc... it should be based on dependent origination.<br><br>for ignorance i think, is like a baby that doesn't know how to walk yet... so yeah... everyone is born with ignorance... <br><br>my views for now <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p></div>
