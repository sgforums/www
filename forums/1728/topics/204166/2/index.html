            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thirty-Eighth Teacher: The Night Goddess Power of Vows </strong><br>Next Sudhana went to the night goddess Saving All Beings with the Power of Vows.<br>He saw her sitting in that same assembly on a seat of jewels reflecting the abodes of all beings. Her body was covered with a network of jewels reflecting the truths of the cosmos. Her body showed reflections of all moons, suns, stars, and planets.<br>The night goddess appeared to sentient being according to their mentalities. She took on forms like those of other living beings. Her body manifested infinitely varied appearances and appeared to be present everywhere. Her body appeared to sentient beings everywhere to bring them to maturity.<br>The night goddess had come from the indestructible realm of the buddhas' Body of Reality. Her body was a pure embodiment of the true nature of things Â– inherently undefiled, naturally free from affliction, empowered by the realization of truth.<br>Sudhana bowed his head when he saw the night goddess and prostrated himself on the ground, remembering countless ways in which he had seen her before.<br>Sudhana arose from the ground, and as he gazed at the night goddess, he thought of the spiritual benefactors bringing him all aspects of enlightenment.<br>At this Sudhana attained a communion of shared awareness with the night goddess and with all the countless bodhisattvas.<br>He shared in their wisdom, in their course of action, in their enlightenment, in their purity, and in their understanding of the true nature of things.<br>He shared in their power, in their expertise with methods of clarifying mind, in their energy in pursuing the practice of bodhisattvas throughout the ages.<br>He shared in their eloquence, in their power of virtue, in their devotion to truth, in their practice.<br>He shared in their great kindness and entered with them into the ocean of compassion.<br>He shared in their service to all the buddhas, and he shared in leading beings to development.<br>He shared in their understanding all methods of teaching sentient beings.<br>He shared in their attainment of all methods of concentration, and their ability to pervade all worlds.<br>In this way, while gazing at the night goddess, Sudhana shared in the infinitely varied pure perception of the spiritual benefactors.<br>Sudhana asked the night goddess what her liberation was called, how long ago she had set out for enlightenment, and when she would reach it.<br>The night goddess replied:<br>"This liberation is called Made of Roots of Goodness Fostering the Development of All Beings. I manifest different bodies, of many appearances, appearing to be visible everywhere, appearing to be the same as all beings."<br>The night goddess then told Sudhana of the various ways she appears to sentient beings Â– embodying all the virtues of enlightenment, demonstrating tranquility and restraint, radiating lights and manifesting miraculous scenes. All this is to help all beings develop roots of goodness and get them to the point where they will not retreat from the quest for enlightenment.<br>The night goddess reminded Sudhana that the question of how long ago she set out for supreme perfect enlightenment is something in the sphere of the knowledge of bodhisattvas, which is outside the net of conceptualization.<br>Notions of past and future ages and duration of time are relevant to bodhisattvas only in the context of developing sentient beings. The bodhisattvas enter into time to do their enlightening work, but their practice is not within concepts of duration of time and succession of ages.<br>The night goddess then told Sudhana she would tell her story by the power of the Buddha, to increase the power of the vows of the bodhisattvas of the future.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Night Goddess's Story</strong><br>In the remote past there was a world called Jewel Light. It was an epoch called Beautiful Light. The first of the ten thousand buddhas who would appear in that age was on the scene.<br>In those days in that world there were many people set in evil ways Â– killing, stealing, raping, lying, giving free rein to greed and malice. The Buddha sat at his site of enlightenment for a full thousand years teaching various bodhisattvas and people who had served past buddhas, in order to bring to maturity their existing roots of goodness.<br>At that time in the capital city Array of Delights, there was a King who had imprisoned hundreds of thousands of evildoers.<br>The King's son heard the cries of those in prison, and was moved with compassion. The Prince went into the prison to visit the prisoners. He saw them shackled and chained, thrown together in the darkness, hungry and thirsty, emaciated and filthy, being subjected to various tortures.<br>The Prince assured the prisoners he would deliver them from their bonds. He went to the King and pleaded for their release.<br>The King summoned his ministers, who told him that the prisoners were people who had attacked the King, and anyone wanting to save them was guilty of a crime against the King.<br>The Prince secured the release of the prisoners by surrendering himself, his retinue of followers, and all his wealth as a guarantee for their good behavior.<br>The royal ministers were outraged and went to the King to demand he punish his son the Prince. The King intended to kill his son, along with all the prisoners who had been released.<br>The Queen went to the King weeping and wailing and begged him to set the Prince free. The King turned to the Prince and demanded he give up the criminals, or else he would die for their sake.<br>Facing death, the Prince was unfazed, since he was focused on total knowledge and guided by great compassion.<br>The Queen asked the King to allow a two-week reprieve: "Let the Prince give the people whatever they need for a fortnight, then do whatever you want with him."<br>North of the city was a large park that had been laid out in the past as a ceremonial ground. The Prince went there and gave anyone who asked whatever they needed Â– food, clothing, tools, equipment.<br>Then, on the last day of the fortnight, the whole population gathered Â– the King, his ministers, his court ladies, the grandees, the landlords, the townspeople, all the religious impostors.<br>The Buddha knew this would be an opportune time to teach a lesson, so he went to the ceremonial ground.<br>The whole crowd of people, and the Prince too, saw the Buddha coming from afar. He was serene, pleasant to see, calm and self-controlled, shining with the magnificence of a buddha, increasing the flow of joy in all beings.<br>Seeing the Buddha this way, everyone's mind became clear and serene.<br>The Prince and the people went out to meet the Buddha and welcome him. The Prince pointed out a place of honor and invited the Buddha to sit down.<br>Then the Buddha, knowing that those people had become capable of receiving the Teaching, gave them a systematic talk, and expounded to them a scripture called Illumination of the Multitude of Causes that included all elements of the Teaching.<br>Many people in the audience attained a dispassionate, pure, objective vision of things. Many were led to the Great Vehicle, and introduced to the way of fulfilling the vows of the bodhisattva Univeral Good.<br>As for the Prince, he attained this enlightening liberation made of roots of goodness fostering the perfection of all beings according to their mentalities.<br>The night goddess then told Sudhana that she was that Prince, who had given up his body and life, his wealth and retinue, in order to liberate those people from bondage.<br>The evildoers in the story, who were imprisoned by the King and released by the Prince, became the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the current age.<br>The Prince later gave up his great wealth and family and went to study with the Buddha. Over thousands of years after that he perfected thousands of forms of concentration, of mental command, of mystic knowledge, of momentum toward all-knowledge, of tolerance. He entered thousands of doors to the knowledge of bodhisattvas, and produced thousands of ways to transcendent wisdom.<br>With these realizations, the Prince in each moment of thought remembered thousands of buddhas of the past and future.<br>The Prince saw myriads of sentient beings in all worlds in all stages of life, developed and undeveloped, happy and sad. He understood how the lives of sentient beings come to be, and how they pass awy, how their minds function, the continuity of their thoughts, the variety of their inclinations, and the proper timing needed to develop and guide them.<br>The night goddess then told Sudhana of her past lives as the reborn Prince serving many buddhas. She had been a king, a celestial chief, a householder, a government minister, a tree spirit, a caravan leader, a city spirit, a god of riches, a celestial musician.<br>The night goddess said:<br>"As I went to each buddha, I attained various concentrations, various forms of mental command, various types of specialized knowledge, various perspectives on truth, various perceptions of the totality of visions of Buddha. I have retained all their teachings, and it was from all of those buddhas that I received this enlightening liberation."<br>The night goddess continued:<br>"I only know this enlightening liberation born of roots of goodness aiding the development of all beings according to their mentalities. How can I know the practice of the bodhisattvas, who ceaselesly develop and guide all sentient beings?<br>"In the Lumbini Grove, here on this continent, there lives a goddess of the grove named Full Wondrous Virtue. Go ask her how to be born in the family of the buddhas and how to carry on the practice of bodhisattvas forever without wearying."<br>Sudhana then paid his respects to the night goddess Saving All Beings with the Power of Vows and departed.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Thirty-Ninth Teacher: Goddess of the Grove</strong><br>Remembering the instructions of the night goddess Saving All Beings with the Power of Vows, Sudhana made his way to the Lumbini Grove.<br>Sudhana circled the grove, looking for the goddess Full Wondrous Virtue. Finally he saw her sitting in a tower circled with jeweled tree branches. She was surrounded by countless woodland goddesses, teaching them from a scripture called The Ocean of Lives of All Enlightening Beings, increasing the flood of the ocean of virtues of the bodhisattvas.<br>Sudhana went up to her, paid his respects, and told her of his purpose. He asked her how to be born in the family of the buddhas, and how to bring light to sentient beings by carrying out the practice of the bodhisattvas.<br>The goddess told Sudhana there are ten kinds of birth by which bodhisattvas are born in the family of the buddhas.<br>Â• Being born as a child of the vow to serve all the enlightened ones<br>Â• Being born as a child of all elements of the determination for enlightenment coming together<br>Â• Being born as a child of meditation on the principles of the Teaching, and entering into the means of realizing all methods of cultivation and meditation<br>Â• Being born as a child of purification of intent over past, present, and future, so their minds are firm and they are determined to practice and perfect all the qualities of bodhisattvas<br>Â• Being born as a child of the light of universal awareness, relinquishing all attachments, becoming self-controlled, tolerant, energetic, released through meditation, and radiant with transcendent wisdom<br>Â• Being born as a child of the family of all the ones who have come from Thusness, becoming one body with all the buddhas<br>Â• Being born as a child of the array of lights of the manifestation of the buddhas' powers, knowing all worlds are like dreams, and becoming masters of emanations<br>Â• Being born as a child of the consummation of contemplation of the way to all-knowledge<br>Â• Being born as a child of the manifestations of the buddhas' emanations throughout the cosmos, and becoming skilled in devising an infinite variety of means for guiding sentient beings<br>Â• Being born as a child of the momentum of entering the stage of the enlightened, and being initiated into the realm of the oneness of all the buddhas of all times<br>The goddess told Sudhana that by these ten forms of birth, bodisattvas are born in the family of the buddhas and bring light to sentient beings.<br>Sudhana asked the goddess about the scope of her liberation.<br>The goddess said:<br>"I have perfected a vow to be present at all manifestations of birth by enlightening beings. I have entered into the ocean of births of Vairocana. Perceiving that the Buddha would be born here, I appeared here in the Lumbini Grove.<br>"When Lady Maya (soon to give birth to the Buddha) went out of the city of Kapilavastu, there were omens of light here in the Lumbini Grvoe, showing all the stages of the bodhisattva path.<br>"As Lady Maya leaned against a tree to give birth, all the gods and goddesses and other beings who had gathered there to make offerings to the enlightening being were bathed in the glorious radiance of Lady Maya's body.<br>"Then everything in the universe was seen reflected in the abdomen of Lady Maya, and at the same time a vision of Lady Maya in the Lumbini Grove appeared in all the worlds in the universe.<br>"Then from every one of Lady Maya's pores came forth visions of the Buddha in past lives, serving other buddhas, carrying out the work of bodhisattvas, carrying out enlightening practices.<br>"All the people he associated with, all he spiritual benefactors he followed, all the embodiments he took on, all the lands in which he lived, all his hard work and difficult sacrifices Â– all this appeared in the visions emanating from the pores of Lady Maya.<br>"Then countless numbers of bodhisattvas emerged from Lady Maya's abdomen, all with the appearance and radiant aura of Vairocana Buddha.<br>"Then as Lady Maya was about to give birth, a great jewel lotus appeared, surrounded by an array of supernatural protectors. At that point, the Buddha emerged from Lady Maya's body, sending forth an inconceivable light, like the sun coming over the horizon.<br>The goddess continued:<br>"Thus did I perceive the oceans of miracles attending the birth of the blessed Vairocana as I sojourned here in the Lumbini Grove. In the same way, I perceived the ocean of miracles attending the birth of Vairocana Buddha in all worlds in all universes."<br>The goddess continued:<br>"I only know this enlightening liberation of seeing the miracles of the births of enlightening beings in all objects over countless ages. How can I know the practice of the bodhisattvas, whose minds are the source of all eons from moment to moment of consciousness?<br>"In the city of Kapilavastu lives a girl of the Shakya clan named Gopa. Go ask her how a bodhisattva should live in the world for enlightening development."<br>Sudhana then paid his respects and left the goddess of the Lumbini Grove.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fortieth Teacher: The Shakya Girl Gopa</strong><br>Then Sudhana left the goddess of the Lumbini Grove and went to the city of Kapilavastu, the capital of the kingdom ruled by the Shakya clan, and the hometown of the historical buddha Shakyamuni.<br>Sudhana made his way to the meeting hall of the bodhisattvas, which shone with the light of the Realm of Reality.<br>There he was welcomed by a goddess of the hall called No Sorrow, along with ten thousand other goddesses. The goddess praised Sudhana for his dedication, and predicted that before long he would see into the profound liberation of the buddhas.<br>The myriad goddesses showered Sudhana with flower garlands and sang verses of praise as he entered the hall.<br>Sudhana went into the hall, which shown with reflections of the cosmos, wanting to see the Shakya girl Gopa. He saw her in the middle of the hall on a throne of jewels reflecting the abodes of all enlightening beings.<br>Gopa was surrounded by an immense number of maidens of royal lineage who were completely absorbed in the common purpose of achieving complete knowledge of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and who were guided by great compassion. These maidens acted as positive emanations of the buddhas' Body of Reality, dedicated to leading all beings to perfection.<br>Then Sudhana went up to Gopa, paid his respects, and told her of his purpose, to achieve perfect enlightenment in order to benefit all living beings. He asked her how bodhisattvas act in the midst of the mundane world without getting stained by its ills. He asked her how to realize that all phenomena are unreal, without giving up the effort to serve all the buddhas and perform good deeds.<br>Gopa told Sudhana there are ten things which bodhisattvas carry out to fulfill this kind of enlightening practice, the light of total knowledge:<br>Â• They associate with superior spiritual friends.<br>Â• They attain great devotion.<br>Â• They act with pure high-minded good will.<br>Â• Their state of mind is founded on oceanic virtue and knowledge.<br>Â• They heed the teaching of the buddhas.<br>Â• Their thoughts are devoted to the buddhas of the past, present, and future.<br>Â• They follow equally all the practices of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• They gain the empowerment of all the buddhas.<br>Â• Their intent is pure and full of great compassion.<br>Â• They attain the basic power of the mind to put a stop to all vicious cycles.<br>Then Gopa told Sudhana she had attained an enlightening liberation whose sphere is observing the ocean of concentrations of all enlightening beings. Sudhana asked her what it was like. Gopa told him:<br>"Having attained this liberation, I penetrate into all the eras of this world, and I know all the beings in all conditions of existence in all eras. I know their actions and the results of their actions.<br>"I know the ocean of names of all the buddhas in those ages, and all their work developing and guiding sentient beings.<br>"I also know the oceans of bodhisattvas surrounding those buddhas, and all that they did and practiced as they progressed through the stages of enlightening beings. I also know the oceans of concentration they attained in each mental moment, their discoveries of the range of omniscience, and their plunges into all-knowledge.<br>"Just as I penetrate into the oceans of ages past in this world, I also know the unbroken succession of ages in the future. I know all the worlds within this world, all the neighboring worlds in all directions, and all the worlds in the radiant world-system of Vairocana Buddha, and in the neighboring world-systems. I know all the worlds in the oceans of worlds in this universe, and also in all universes of the endless cosmos throughout space.<br>"In all these worlds, in all these universes, I know and recall the past vows of Vairocana, his oceans of past efforts, his perseverence in enlightening practices throughout infinite ages, and all the means he used to purify his practice of universal good and guide sentient beings.<br>"Just as I comprehend the oceans of enlightening practice of Vairocana Buddha in this whole cosmos, I comprehend the indivisible oceans of enlightening practice undertaken by all buddhas in all oceans of worlds in all universes.<br>"This is the scope of the enlightening liberation whose sphere is observing the ocean of concentrations of all enlightening beings.<br>"Having attained this, I know the patterns of mental behavior of all beings, how much goodness they have accumulated, how to get rid of their defilements, the variety of their actions. I know the ocean of ways of liberation of all the bodhisattvas and buddhas."<br>Sudhana asked Gopa how long ago she attained this liberation.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Gopa's Story </strong><br>Gopa then described to Sudhana a splendid world that existed eons ago. The cities of that world were prosperous and wealthy, with hundreds of thousands of happy people living in them, along with hundreds of thousands of earth spirits.<br>In the capital city there was a king called Lord of Wealth, the ruler of the region, who lived with his courtiers and his ladies and his warrior sons. Foremost among all his women was his queen Lotus Born. She had a son named Lord of Glory.<br>Accompanied by a magnificent entourage, the Prince Lord of Glory set out to visit one of the parks of the city. He travelled on a wide level road, lined on both sides with jewel buildings from which all sorts of supplies were distributed to those in need.<br>At that time there was an elegant courtesan in the capital city, with whom the King consorted. She had a daughter who was versed in all the arts and science, clever and diligent, dignified and serene, always pleasant to be with.<br>The courtesan's daughter fell in love with the Prince, and longed to be his woman. Her mother warned her that as courtesans, they gave pleasure to everyone, and did not belong to one man Â– she told her daughter that her love for the Prince was in vain.<br>In that world at that time there was a buddha named Supreme Sun who had just attained enlightenment. He was at a site of enlightenment in the park that the Prince was going to visit.<br>The courtesan's daughter saw that buddha in a dream. When she woke up, a goddess who had been a relative of hers in a past life told her that the buddha was in a park in his first week of enlightenment.<br>The courtesan's daughter went to the park and met the Prince there. Emboldened by seeing the buddha, the young woman addressed the Prince in verse:<br>Hundreds of men, thousands of men<br>Look at me with lust<br>But I have no desire<br>For people of the world<br>I bear them no ill-will<br>But they do not please me<br>I have neither anger nor hatred<br>I delight in the welfare of all<br>When I saw you, young man,<br>Excellent in form, endowed with virtue<br>All my senses were delighted<br>Immense joy arose in me<br>I offer myself to you<br>Please take me in<br>Then the Prince said to the young woman: "Whose daughter are you? To whom do you belong? I cannot make someone mine who belongs to someone else."<br>The Prince asked the young woman about herself: Does she love and respect her relatives, her friends, her elders? Is she kind to the helpless and the lost? Is she happy to see the success of others? Does she rely on wisdom to make her indifferent to those who annoy her? Does she seek supreme enlightenment?<br>The courtesan then told the Prince that her daughter was born in auspicious circumstances, as the fruition of good actions in the past. She is pure in conduct and fair in form, with the finest fragrance and a heavenly voice.<br>This treasure of a woman should not be abandoned<br>To the control of vulgar people<br>No one but you is worthy of being her husband<br>Please accept this young woman<br>Respecting spiritual benefactors<br>She wants always to see you<br>She is far-seeing and uncorrupted, a lady of pure mind<br>Stable as a mountain<br>Adorned always with her own virtues<br>She has no enemies<br>She is peerless in knowledge<br>She is fit to be your bride, O Prince<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Prince then explained to the young woman that his mind was set on the bodhisattva path, for which he would have to give everything up. If he were her husband, this would cause her much pain and resentment. The time would come when he would leave her to go forth to study with a buddha, and she would be unhappy.<br>The young woman replied to the Prince: "Let it be as you wish. I will act in harmony with you."<br>Now I have seen the Buddha in a dream<br>And I have seen you, the ideal man<br>My wish is fulfilled, and I am happy<br>With you I will honor the supreme stage, the Buddha<br>This is how the Prince got the news that the Buddha Supreme Sun had appeared in his world. He was filled with joy, and showered jewels on the young woman, honoring her. She accepted this without emotion, and just gazed steadily at the Prince.<br>The Prince and the young woman went to the site of enlightenment where the Buddha was to see him and pay their respects.<br>The Prince road his magnificent vehicle as far as a vehicle would go, then he got down and approached the Buddha on foot.<br>When he saw the Buddha, the Prince's mind became settled, and with a clear mind he developed the great joy and sense of well-being and the energy that derives from seeing a buddha. Then the Prince and the young woman and their whole entourage made offerings to the Buddha.<br>Then the Buddha expounded a scripture called Lamp at the Door of the Universal Eye. Hearing the Buddha's teaching, the Prince attained ten oceans of concentration and absorbed all the principles of the Teaching. The young woman attained a meditation called Filled with the Ocean of Invincible Knowledge, and reached the stage where there is no turning back from progress toward supreme perfect enlightenment.<br>The Prince left the presence of the Buddha and the young woman and the rest of the group and went back to the city to bring his father the King the news that a buddha had appeared in the world. The father felt as if he has found a rare jewel. He thought of the Buddha as a liberator from all the sufferings of the mundane whirl.<br>The King gathered together all his warriors, priests, officials, governors, and courtiers, and abdicated the throne in favor of his son, the Prince Lord of Glory. Then he left with his retinue to join the assembly of the Buddha.<br>The Prince Lord of Glory now became king. Under his just rule, the earth was free from war, free from evil, free from calamity. The earth was prosperous, peaceful, pleasant, and well-populated. As king he invited the Buddha Supreme Sun to come into all the cities of his realm and develop and guide the people.<br>The Shakya girl Gopa then told Sudhana that the Prince Lord of Glory was none other than Shakyamuni Buddha, the buddha of the present age. Her own mother was the courtesan, and she herself, Gopa, was the courtesan's daughter.<br>Gopa then told Sudhana that she and the Prince Lord of Glory had attended on the Buddha Supreme Sun as long as he lived. After that, the two of them served a long line of buddhas, providing them with food and clothing and medicine and equipment.<br>Finally, upon hearing the teaching of one of these buddhas, whose name was Energy Born of Great Zeal for Truth, Gopa attained this liberation whose sphere is observing the ocean of concentrations of all enlightening beings.<br>After that she cultivated this liberation for countless eons, carrying out the bodhisattva practice with the enlightening being Vairocana. Yet during all that time, she did not know the size of Vairocana's body or what it looked like, nor did she know the range of his knowledge.<br>She served countless buddhas over the eons, but she still did not enter the universally good liberation of the bodhisattvas. Why? Because the ways of liberation of the universally good bodhisattvas are infinite as space, infinite as the thoughts of all sentient beings, infinite as the ocean of time over past, present, and future, infinite as the ocean of structures in the universe.<br>For eons she gazed at the enlightening being Vairocana, with the intensity of a lover, until in every moment of consciousness she could perceive coming from the pores of Vairocana infinite oceans of buddhas and teaching activities, along with infinite oceans of beings with various physical bodies, various physical environments, various actions and efforts.<br>In the pores of Vairocana she perceived oceans of universal love for all beings, infinite oceans of the great joy of bodhisattvas, infinite oceans of their varied undertakings to take care of living beings.<br>Gopa continued:<br>"I only know this enlightening liberation whose sphere is observing the ocean of concentrations of all enlightening beings. How can I know the practice of the bodhisattvas, who deliberatly appear in the same physical forms as all beings, who appear to act in accord with the mentalities of all beings, who roam freely in the ocean of liberation of all truths?<br>"Go to the Lady Maya, the mother of the enlightening being, who is sitting on a jewel lotus seat near the blessed Vairocana. Go ask her how bodhisattvas carry out the practice of enlightening beings undefiled by the taint of worldly things, how they come into the presence of the buddhas and do not stop their efforts to care for all beings."<br>Sudhana then paid his respects and took leave of Gopa.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Forty-First Teacher: Lady Maya, the Mother of the Buddha</strong><br>Then Sudhana turned to go to Lady Maya, thinking to himself that he must continue to meet with spiritual benefactors who are beyond all attachments and do not abide anywhere.<br>As Sudhana was engaged in such thoughts, a city goddess named Jewel Eyes showed herself in the sky, surrounded by a group of sky goddesses. She held a basket of celestial flowers of many shapes and colors, and these she scattered before Sudhana as she spoke to him:<br>"You should cleanse the city of mind by getting rid of jealousy, envy, and guile.<br>"You should expand the city of mind, by increasing the flow of great energy in preparing for all-knowledge.<br>"You should protect the dwellings, storehouses, and facilities of the city of mind, by taking command of the vast spiritual citadel of all the forms of concentration, meditation, and liberation.<br>"You should irrigate the city of mind, by feeling great compassion for all beings. You should observe the illusory nature of the city of mind, by going to the spiritual city of all-knowledge."<br>Then a goddess named Spiritual Lotus came forth from the site of enlightenment surrounded by innumerable goddesses, all praising the Lady Maya. The goddesses stopped in the sky in front of Sudhana, emanating webs of light of many colors: soothing colors, energizing color, cooling colors.<br>These lights showed Sudhana the forms of all buddhas everywhere. Then the lights circled the whole world and descended into Sudhana's head.<br>As soon as the rays of light from the goddesses touched Sudhana, he acquired the eye to see the essence of all beings, the eye to see the essence of all phenomena and all lands, the eye to see the Reality Body of those who arrive at Thusness, the eye to see the formation and disintegration of all worlds in the universe, the eye to see the infinite variety of mystic powers used by the buddhas to guide sentient beings.<br>Then a supernatural being Fine Eye appeared Â– he was the doorkeeper of the bodhisattvas' assembly hall. He told Sudhana what is needed to approach spiritual friends: a pure mind free from guile and deceit, great compassion taking in all living beings, clear perception of the pure essence of all things, meditation on the oceans of all realms, meditation on the multitudes of buddhas appearing in all realms.<br>Now Sudhana saw a great jewel lotus spring up from the ground in front of him. In the heart of the lotus was a tower made of gold and jewels, and inside the tower was a throne made of wish-fulfilling jewels. The throne was arrayed with jewels reflecting all the buddhas of the past, present, and future, and emanating the auras of light of all the buddhas.<br>Sudhana saw Lady Maya sitting on that throne. Having gone beyond all states of being, she was facing all living beings, appearing to them according to their mentalities, unstained by any world.<br>Pervading the cosmos in each instant, infinite, dwelling in all worlds without defilement, measureless, transcending all verbal expressions, with no set form, appearing magically in the body of a living being, Lady Maya did not really exist, but was made by the magic of aspiration.<br>In this form Sudhana saw Lady Maya, manifesting a physical body that was not a form, but a reflection of form, not a feeling, but a cessation of all painful feelings, outside the thoughts of all beings, but appearing in their thoughts.<br>At that moment Suddha was emptied of his notions of the forms of all beings, and penetrated the minds of other beings. He saw Lady Maya in the minds of all beings, her virtue sustaining all beings.<br>Lady Maya had perfected the vow to guide all beings to ultimate liberation. She had the energy to produce all the miracles of the bodhisattvas. She had purified the supreme spiritual body and manifested infinite physical bodies.<br>Acting boldly and decisively, she planned and carried out all the undertakings of bodhisattvas. She was engaged in protecting all beings, having undertaken to be the mother of all bodhisattvas and buddhas.<br>Sudhana then beheld Lady Maya in countless numbers of embodiments. He magically made his own body as extensive as Lady Maya's, and with his omnipresent body he bowed to the omnipresent Lady Maya.<br>As Sudhana was bowing to Lady Maya, an infinite variety of concentrations entered into him. Sudhana mastered all these contemplations, and fixed them in his mind.<br>Then Sudhana arose from his concentration and circled around Lady Maya and her retinue and her abode. He stood respectfully before her and said:<br>"Manjushri inspired me to seek supreme perfect enlightenment and directed me to attend on spiritual benefactors. Please tell me, noble one, how a bodhisattva can achieve all-knowledge while carrying out the work of the enlightening beings."<br>Lady Maya told Sudhana she had attained an enlightening liberation called Magical Knowledge of Great Vows, through which she is the mother of all the enlightening beings. Here too in the city of Kapilavastu, she became the mother of the enlightening being Siddhartha Â– the prince who was to become the historical buddha Shakyamuni.<br>Lady Maya told Sudhana of the visionary experience of Buddha's incarnation in her womb. She saw visions of all the other buddhas appearing in the world and teaching. She saw countless bodhisattvas in the congregations of all buddhas in all worlds enter her belly, yet her belly was not enlarged, nor did her body become any more than a human body.<br>Lady Maya told Sudhana that just as she received the bodhisattvas in her belly in this world, she did the same in all worlds in the billion-world universe, with the same miraculous manifestation. She told Sudhana that her body is neither one nor many, neither multiple nor singular.<br>"Just as I was the mother of this buddha, Vairocana, so I was the mother of infinite numbers of buddhas before him.<br>"Just as I was the mother of this buddha in this world, so will I be the mother of all the buddhas of this eon.<br>"Just as I will be the mother of the future buddha Maitreya in this world, in the endless billions of eons in all the worlds in all the world-systems of this Flower Treasury ocean of worlds, I will be the mother of all the buddhas of the future."<br>Lady Maya continued:<br>"I only know this enlightening liberation Magical Knowledge of Great Vows. How can I know the practice of the bodhisattvas, who are able to display projections of the miracles of all buddhas from every pore?<br>"In the thirty-three-fold heaven of this world there is a goddess named Surendrabha, who is the daughter of a god named Mindfulness. Go ask her how to carry out the practice of enlightening beings."<br>Sudhana then paid his respects and took leave of Lady Maya.<br></div>

He paid his respects to the goddess, stood before her, and asked her how to carry out the practice of the bodhisattvas.<br>Surendrabha told Sudhana that she had attained an enlightening liberation called Pure Manifestation of Unimpeded Recollection. She told Sudhana how in ages past she had served countless numbers of buddhas.<br>"In this way, I remember countless eons during which I was always with the buddhas. I heard of this enlightening liberation called Pure Manifestation of Unimpeded Recollection from the buddhas, and practiced it as they told me.

I hear that you give instruction to bodhisattvas, so please tell me how to learn and carry out the practice of bodhisattvas."<br>Friend of All said:<br>"I learned the science of how the bodhisattvas use language from a young enlightening being named Knower of All Arts.

He asked them to teach him how to learn and carry out the practice of bodhisattvas.<br>They said to Sudhana:<br>"We have attained and experienced an enlightening liberation called Illusory. Having realized this liberation, we see all worlds as illusory, being produced by illusory causes and conditions.<br>"We see all worldly people as illusory, born from the illusions of ignorant craving for existence.<br>"We see all phenomena as illusory, arising from the illusion of mutual conditioning.<br>"We see all sentient beings as illusory, born of the illusions of false ideas.<br>"We see all the literal-minded followers of the Teaching as illusory, born of the illusion of knowledge and effort.<br>"We see all the practices, vows, and teaching and guiding work of bodhisattvas as illusory, being essentially illusions of action and teaching created from illusion.<br>"We see the circle of all the buddhas and bodhisattvas as illusory, being essentially illusions of the inconceivable realm, produced by the illusions of vows and knowledge.<br>"We know this enlightening liberation of illusoriness. How can we know the practices of the bodhisattvas, who follow the extensive network of the endless illusion of action?"<br>Then the boy and girl showered Sudhana with an inconceivable stream of virtue and told him of their own sphere of liberation.

There is a park there called Great Array, and in the park is a great tower called the Chamber of Adornments of Vairocana, which was created by the thoughts and vows and mystic knowledge and skill in means of the bodhisattvas.<br>"A great enlightening being named Maitreya lives there for the purpose of developing people in the ways of bodhisattvas.<br>"Maitreya develops the roots of goodness of other beings according to their states. He shows them how to develop the bodhisattvas' universal compassion, and how to become aware of the state of bodhisattvas, which is detached from all abodes and locations. He shows them how to appear to live in all states of existence while being ultimately unattached.<br>"Go to Maitreya and ask him how to seek the practice of the bodhisattvas, how to carry out the studies of bodhisattvas, how to purify the aspiration for enlightenment, and how to accomplish the vows of bodhisattvas."<br>Then the boy Shrisambhava and the girl Shrimati told Sudhana more about Maitreya and why he can help Sudhana learn how to be a bodhisattva:<br>Maitreya has entered into all the practices of bodhisattvas, and has reached the goal of all their aspirations. He has comprehended the actions of all beings, and taken on the task of developing them. He has been through all the stages of bodhisattvas: he has attained their tolerance and their certainty. He has roamed in all the liberations of enlightening beings, and had held the empowerments of all the buddhas.<br>The boy and the girl told Sudhana that he should not be content just to develop one form of virtue, or follow one form of practice, or fulfill one vow. Rather, he should assemble infinite provisions for enlightenment and learn infinite truths. He should extinguish the afflictions of infinite numbers of beings and penetrate the minds of infinite numbers of beings. He must show infinite adaptations to the world.<br>The boy and the girl told Sudhana that he must clarify infinite powers of mindfulness and purify infinite powers of concentration and arouse infinite powers of wisdom. He must enter infinite realms of truth, collect infinite spiritual medicines, cultivate infinite powers of universal love and compassion, and comprehend infinite differences in the minds of living beings.<br>"In short, the practice of bodhisattvas is to perfect all sentient beings, to live in all ages, to awaken to knowledge of all times past, present, and future, to practice all truths, to fulfill all vows, to provide for all buddhas, to be at one with all enlightening beings in purpose, to attain rapport with all spiritual friends."<br>The boy and the girl then told Sudhana that it is from spiritual benefactors that bodhisattvas learn the practice of bodhisattvas. All the attainments of bodhisattvas are developed under the guidance of spiritual benefactors.<br>"What is the reason? Spiritual benefactors are those who clear away obstructions, restrain us from evil, rescue us from folly, dispel our ignorance, break the bonds of our subjective perceptions, cut off our attachments to the world, strengthen our determination for enlightenment, and foster universal compassion.<br>"Think of yourself as a traveller, and think of spiritual benefactors as guides. Think of their instructions as the road, and think of the practices as getting to your destination.<br>"Think of yourself as a son, and think of spiritual benefactors as parents. Think of their instructions as the family business, and think of the practices as perpetuating the family business."<br>Hearing about the virtues and qualities of spiritual benefactors, and about the infinity of practice of bodhisattvas and the vastness of the Teaching, Sudhana felt exultation and delight. He then paid his respects to the boy Shrisambhava and the girl Shrimati and took his leave.<br></div>

His attentiveness to teachings of the bodhisattvas had given him a purity of sense and a clarity of mind. He could perceive that he was present in the abodes of all the buddhas.<br>Full of respect for the determination and the purity of all bodhisattvas, aware of the miracles of buddhas and bodhisattvas everywhere, Sudhana prostrated himself in front of the door of a great tower, which was the Chamber of the Adornments of Vairocana Buddha, the Illuminator.<br>By the power that had come to him by fulfilling his vows, Sudhana projected himself continuously into the presence of all the buddhas and likewise into the presence of all enlightening beings. He projected himself continuously into the presence of all beings, by entering into the totality of the body of knowledge. And just as he prostrated himself before the great tower of the chamber of Vairocana, he prostrated himself before all beings throughout the cosmos.<br>Sudhana had total equanimity toward the omnipresent absolute reality, the equanimity that comes from the absence of false concepts in those who realize Thusness. He had total equanimity toward all the thoughts and mental constructs of all beings in all worlds, seeing them like dreams and reflections.<br>Sudhana prostrated himself for a long while, and his whole being was flooded by the energy of inconceivable roots of goodness. With his body and mind refreshed, he rose from the threshold of the tower, and gazed directly at the great tower containing the adornments of Vairocana.<br>With deep respect, he began to circle the tower, voicing these thoughts:<br>"This is the abode of those who dwell in the state of the unity of the cosmos, the state of nonattachment to all worlds.<br>"This is the abode of those who do not rely on worldly things, those who have shed everything and are independent of all supports, those who dwell in the essence of all things, those who dwell in the state of freedom from false imaginings.<br>"This is the abode of those capable of penetrating the Realm of Reality in all its aspects, those who dwell in a state of wisdom free from all arbitrary views, cravings, and conceits. This is the abode of those who dwell in a state of freedom arising from a higher knowledge of all meditations, liberations, concentrations, and spiritual attainments.<br>"This is the abode of those who have dropped all attachments to the world but appear in the abodes of all beings in order to develop them to maturity. This is the abode of those who are in the presence of the buddhas while free from attachment to the concept of buddha.<br>"This is the abode of those who dwell in the abodes of all delusive demons while being detached from passion, who comprehend all ideas while their minds are clear of all ideas, who adapt to all beings with no duality between self and other, who are physically present in all mundane realms without being cut off from the Realm of Reality."<br>Sudhana offered many verses of praise to the bodhisattvas dwelling in the great tower of the Chamber of Adornments of Vairocana. He stood at the foot of the tower, wishing to see the great bodhisattva Maitreya.<br>Then Sudhana saw Maitreya outside the tower, coming from somewhere else, followed by a great number of beings, coming toward the great tower of the Chamber of Adornments of Vairocana.<br>Sudhan was overjoyed to see Maitreya, and prostrated himself before him from afar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Maitreya Welcomes Sudhana</strong><br>Maitreya saw Sudhana and pointed him out to the group accompanying him, and praised him for the virtuous qualities he had put into practice.<br><br>Welcome, pure of heart, tireless in mind<br>Welcome, calm eyes, do not slacken in your practice<br>Rejoice, Sudhana, for you will illuminate all aspects of Reality<br>You will illuminate all aspects of the world<br>And reach the goal of all aspects of truth<br>You will see all buddhas soon, you will soon go to all lands<br>You will soon know all truths Â– so much good you have done on your own<br>You will preserve the lineage of the enlightened ones<br>And purify the lineage of the Teaching<br>You will support the spiritual community<br>And become a source of treasures<br>You will see the full extent of the Realm of Reality<br>You will go to the farthest reaches of all the worlds<br>You will see all buddhas of all times<br>So rejoice, Sudhana<br>The practice of bodhisattvas is like an ocean<br>Enlightened knowledge is like space<br>The ocean of vows is equally vast<br>Be happy with all of this<br>The Friends are tireless, firm in will, sure in application<br>Those who follow such Friends as these will become guides themselves<br>All buddhas are your parents<br>All bodhisattvas are your brothers and sisters<br>The elements of enlightenment are your family<br>You are nobly born yourself, a child of the buddhas<br>You will attain buddhahood soon, so be happy, Sudhana, and full of joy<br>Soon you will receive the supreme coronation of all the buddhas<br>And become equal to the peerless heirs of the Victors<br>You have served the Friends with the highest aim<br>Growing like a lotus in water<br>Intent on achieving rapport with all spiritual friends and all buddhas<br>Intent on seeking out all truths<br>Arise now, stay disciplined, and do not weary<br>You have honored me with such perfect devotion<br>Soon you will come into the presence of the assemblies of all the buddhas<br>Maitreya then told Sudhana to return to Manjushri, the bodhisattva who had originally sent him on his journey to seek enlightened teachers. Maitreya told Sudhana that Manjushri will initiate him into the highest practice of good.<br>Hearing all this, Sudhana was flooded with joy and sighed with delight. He got up and paid his respects to Maitreya.<br>Then, by the mental powers of Manjushri, beautiful garlands of flowers and jewels appeared in Sudhana's hands, produced by the vows of the bodhisattvas. These Sudhana showered on Maitreya.<br>Then Maitreya patted Sudhana on the head and said: "It is good that you are so tireless, Sudhana. You will be a vessel of virtues, like Manjushri and me."<br>Sudhana then stood respectfully before Maitreya and said:<br>"Noble one, I have set out for supreme perfect enlightenment, but I do not know how a bodhisattva learns and carries out the practice of bodhisattvas.<br>"All the buddhas have predicted that the noble Maitreya will reach supreme perfect enlightenment in one lifetime, having taken on the empowerment of all buddhas and embraced the enlightenment of all buddhas.<br>"So please tell me, noble one, how a bodhisattva is to learn and carry out the practice of bodhisattvas."<br>Then the bodhisattva Maitreya looked out over the whole crowd there with him and praised the aspiration and achievements of Sudhana, his tireless dedication and readiness to learn from spiritual benefactors. Maitreya reminded them how rare it is to find people who aspire to supreme true enlightenment, and who set out to master the teachings of the buddhas with diligent application.<br>Many who heard Maitreya's praise for Sudhana's true virtues were strengthened in their own determination for enlightenment.<br>Maitreya said to Sudhana:<br>"It is good that you have set your mind on enlightenment for the welfare and happiness of all worlds, for the salvation of all beings, for the attainment of all enlightened qualities. You live a good life among living beings, and you are fulfilling the purpose for which the enlightened ones come forth in the world.<br>"You have met the benefactor Manjushri and you have made yourself a worthy vessel of truth. You have purified your high resolve and your good intent. By this intent of yours you have developed the determination for supreme perfect enlightenment.<br>"The determination for enlightenment is the seed of all the elements of buddhahood. It is like a road, leading to the city of all-knowledge. It is like a door leading into all the practices of bodhisattvas. It is like the root of life, sustaining the universal compassion of all enlightening beings. It is like a savior, not abandoning any who take refuge in it. It is like a motivating force, because it draws you toward your aim. It is like a treasury, preserving all enlightened qualities. It is like a monument for the world.<br>"Why? Because it is the source of all the practices of bodhisattvas, and from it come all the buddhas of the past, present, and future. If you arouse the determination for enlightenment, you become absorbed in the will for all-knowledge.<br>"The will for all-knowledge is like a medicine that cures all illnesses. It protects you against the fire of passions, the poison of objects, the weapons of affliction. It frees you from fear, and makes you invulnerable to all delusions opposing you. It takes all the barbs of hatred, delusion, and false views out of your mind. It heals the wounds you inflict on yourself with your misguided actions. The will for all-knowledge produces physical and mental health in enlightening beings.<br>"Just as a person must be alive to act, a bodhisattva must have the aspiration for enlightenment in order to absorb the buddhas' teachings.<br>"Just as a diamond does not decompose in water, the diamond of the determination for all-knowledge does not decompose even if it remains in the water of karmic affliction for all ages."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sudhana's Vision in the Tower</strong><br>Maitreya then said to Sudhana:<br>"You ask how to learn and carry out the practice of bodhisattvas. Go into this great tower containing the adornments of Vairocana and look around. Then you will know how to learn the practice of bodhisattvas."<br>Then Sudhana said:<br>"Please open the door of the tower, and I will enter."<br>Maitreya went up to the door and snapped his fingers. The door of the great tower opened, and Maitreya told Sudhana to go in.<br>With a sense of great wonderment, Sudhana went into the tower. As soon as he had entered, the door closed behind him.<br>Once inside, Sudhana saw that the tower was immensely vast and wide, as measureless as the sky, as vast as all of space. It was adorned with countless canopies, banners, pennants, arrays of jewels, garlands of pearls and gems, nets of gold and jewels, nets of bells and chimes, with flowers showering down and beautiful fragrances in the air.<br>Inside the great tower Sudhana saw hundreds of thousands of other towers similarly adorned. He saw those towers as infinitely vast as space, evenly arrayed in all directions, yet all distinct from each other and not interfering with each other. Each tower appears reflected in each and every object within all the other towers.<br>Seeing the inconceivable realm of the great tower, Sudhana was filled with joy. His mind was cleared of all concepts and freed of all obstructions. He was freed from all scattering of attention, and his intellect followed the unobstructed eye of liberation. His body tranquil, seeing all things without hindrance, he bowed in all directions with his whole body.<br>The instant he bowed, by the power of Maitreya, Sudhana perceived himself in all those towers, and in all those towers he saw various inconceivable scenes.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw the place where the enlightening being Maitreya first aspired to supreme perfect enlightenment. Sudhana perceived the lifespans of the sentient beings and the buddha of that time, and he saw himself in the presence of that buddha, and he saw all that buddha's works.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw where Maitreya first attained absorption in love, from which he got his name Â– Maitreya means "The Loving One." In another tower he saw where Maitreya carried out spiritual practice. In another tower he saw where Maitreya fulfilled the ways of transcendence. In another tower he saw where Maitreya attained the acceptance of all things as unborn and unreal.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw Maitreya as a sovereign ruler directing people to virtuous action. In another tower he saw Maitreya as a world-guardian bestowing well-being and happiness on the world. In other towers he saw Maitreya in the forms of all sorts of beings helping sentient beings living on all planes of existence toward enlightenment.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw Maitreya expounding the Teaching to would-be bodhisattvas who had just set their minds on enlightenment. In another tower he saw Maitreya praising the stages of the bodhisattva path to those who had undertaken practice. In other towers he saw Maitreya explaining the Teaching to bodhisattvas at various stages of development.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw Maitreya speaking of the infinity of fulfilling transcendent ways. In another tower he saw Maitreya speaking of impartiality in approaching and entering into all studies.<br>In another tower he saw Maitreya speaking of the breadth of entry into concentration, and in another, of the depth of liberation. In another tower he saw Maitreya speaking of pervading the realm of higher knowledge with quiescent meditation, concentration, and trance. In another tower he saw Maitreya speaking of methods of guidance in bodhisattva practice.<br>In another tower Sudhana saw Maitreya with a group of bodhisattvas engaged in the same practice as he engages in, speaking of the varios arts and sciences to be employed for the benefit of the world.<br>In different towers Sudhana saw Maitreya engaged in various practices Â– walking meditation, recitation, contemplation of theoretical structures, teaching and explaining, recording the Teaching in writing.<br>In different towers he saw Maitreya absorbed in concentration on universal love, absorbed in all sorts of meditation and immeasurable states, absorbed in the totalizing points, absorbed in the liberations. In another tower he saw Maitreya absorbed in the practice of bringing forth the higher knowledge of enlightening beings.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw bodhisattvas absorbed in an enlightening concentration in which phantoms of all kinds of beings emanated from their pores Â– supernatural beings, human beings of all ranks and conditions, people following the Teaching at various levels. He saw multitudes of buddha-bodies and countless multitudes of phantom sentient beings emerge. Sudhana heard various aspects of the Teaching being broadcast from the pores of some of these bodhisattvas.<br>In another tower Sudhana saw all the audiences of the buddhas gathering together. He saw the differences among those buddhas, the differences in the lands and eras in which they worked, the variety of their teachings, and the variety of the outwardness of their projected manifestations. He saw the different lengths of time the True Teaching endured in the various settings, and the differences in the audiences listening to the buddhas.<br>Then, in the middle of the great tower containing the adornments of Vairocana, amidst the hundreds of thousands of other towers, Sudhana saw one tower that was bigger than the others, and arrayed with adornments surpassing all the others.<br>In that tower Sudhana saw a billion-world universe. He saw the landscape of each world, and in each world he saw Maitreya being born and going through all the stages of the quest for enlightenment, awakening to enlightenment, and then going forth to teach, using various manifestations of the Teaching. And everywhere in all these worlds Sudhana perceived himself at Maitreya's feet.<br>As he looked upon all those assemblies being taught by Maitreya in all those worlds, and all the works Maitreya was carrying out with them, Sudhana heard a vast multitude of voices pouring forth from all the objects and all the living beings, retelling the stories of countless numbers of quests for enlightenment, in different worlds at different times, carried out in different ways.<br>By listening to all those voices Sudhana heard all facets of the Teaching, and his mind was flooded with joy.<br>Sudhana also saw measureless arrays of images, reflections of the assemblies of the buddhas, circles of bodhisattvas, congregations of believers and followers. He saw all sorts of lands and worlds and planes of existence. He saw countless bodhisattvas engaged in various activities, working for the good of all.<br>Sudhana saw webs of jewel lights coming from the pillars Â– some sapphire, some topaz, some ruby, some crystal, some golden, some emerald, some diamond, some rainbow of light. The vision was delightful to the body and the mind, and supremely pleasant to the eye.<br>Sudhana saw figurines made of jewels, holding myriads of flowers, garlands, parasols, banners, strings of jewels, ornaments. Some of the figures were bowing, crowned with jewels, with a steady gaze and palms joined in a gesture of respect.<br>Sudhana also saw pearl necklaces giving forth delicate clouds of pure water transmitting all fragrances. He saw long streams flowing from webs of strings of bluegreen jewels. He saw the inner chamber adorned with jewel bells and sets of chimes, silk streamers, heaps of varios gems. He saw countless superb lotuses of all colors and sizes growing in lotus ponds. He saw arrays of various figures Â– women and men, boys and girls, Indra and Brahma, gods and dragons, goblins and titans, all sorts of saints and sages and enlightening beings Â– all joining their palms and bowing in a gesture of respect.<br>Sudhana also saw figures of buddhas adorned with their special marks of greatness sitting in the lotus posture.<br>Sudhana saw the surface of the ground was covered with a mosaic of precious stones. In each inlaid stone he saw inconceivable reflections of lands and buddhas and all the adornments in all the towers.<br>Sudhana looked at the flowers, fruits, and buds of the jewel trees surrounding him and saw figures of all kinds of beings Â– buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods and dragons, emperors and princes, grandees and government ministers, women and men, boys and girls, monks and nuns and male and female believers.<br>Some were holding garlands of flowers, some strings of jewels, some other kinds of ornaments. Some were bowing with palms joined and a steady gaze, paying their respects. Some were singing hymns of praise. Some were in a trance. Some had a golden luster, some a silver luster, some a frosty luster, some a sapphire luster. Some were shining with the colors of all jewels, some were shining like bodies of light.<br>From the crescents adorning the towers, Sudhana saw the reflections of countless suns and stars shining in all directions.<br>Sudhana saw that the walls of the towers were covered with mosaics of jewels. In each jewel he saw Maitreya carrying out the practices of bodhisattvas, sacrificing himself for the good of others, giving people the things they needed, teaching in all sorts of ways.<br>In this way Sudhana saw in each facet of the mosaic walls Maitreya's practice of generosity, discipline, tolerance, energy, meditation, and wisdom over countless eons.<br>In one tower Sudhana saw magical arrays of all the spiritual benefactors with whom Maitreya had studied, and he perceived himself also to be in the presence of all those benefactors, who made him welcome and told him not to weary, but to behold the wonder of the bodhisattva Maitreya.<br>In this way Sudhana saw all these magnificent scenes projected from each of the towers, and every object in towers. He saw all this by the power of unwavering mindfulness, by all-encompassing purity of vision, by standing on the ground of knowledge that flows from the perception of bodhisattvas.<br>It was like when a person dreams of all sorts of pleasant scenes with all attachments removed and feels joy Â– it may seem to last a day, a week, a year, a century, even longer, but when the person awakes, he remembers it all.<br>In the same way, Sudhana saw the whole supernal manifestation of the tower of Vairocana, was perfectly aware of it, understood it, contemplatated it, used it as a means, and saw himself within it Â– by the knowledge of the collection of dreams that constitutes the world, abiding in the vast unobstructed perception of bodhisattvas, his intellect having entered into the inconceivable wisdom of bodhisattvas.<br>Though the whole experience only took a short time, in that short time, with th perception of a bodhisattva, by the power of Maitreya, Sudhana had the sense of billions of eons of time passing.<br>Sudhana saw all those miraculous displays by the inconceivable direction of the magic of the Maitreya's enlightening knowledge, and by bringing forth the magic of the knowledge of truth, and by the power of the mystic knowledge mastered by a bodhisattva.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Sudhana Emerges from the Vision</strong><br>Then the bodhisattva Maitreya entered the tower where Sudhana was and relaxed his magical force. He snapped his fingers and said to Sudhana:<br>"Arise. This is the nature of things, to have no set identity. All things are stabilized by the knowledge of the enlightening beings. They are inherently unreal, like illusions, dreams, and reflections."<br>At the snap of Maitreya's fingers, Sudhana emerged from the trance.<br>Maitreya asked him if he had seen the miraculous display of the practices and attainments of bodhisattvas, and their inconeivable liberation. Sudhana said that empowered by Maitreya, he had seen it.<br>Maitreya told Sudhana this liberation he had witnessed in his trance is called the inner sanctum of supernal manifestation of clear recollection entering into the knowledge of all objects of the past, present, and future. He told Sudhana that a bodhisattva attains untold liberations like this.<br>Sudhana asked: "Where has that magnificent display gone to?"<br>Maitreya answered: "Where it came from."<br>Sudhana asked: "Where did it come from?"<br>Maitreya answered:<br>"It came from the power of the knowledge of bodhisattvas taking effect, and it resides in that power. It does not go or come at all, it is not something put together or accumulated, it is not located in any one place, it is not internal or external. These supernal arrays appear by properly learning the knowledge of enlightening beings."<br>Sudhana then asked Maitreya how far away he came from.<br>Maitreya answered:<br>"The state of bodhisattvas is the state of neither motion nor stillness, the state without support or abode, the state of no passing away or rebirth, the state of no concern or attachement.<br>"Great compassion is the state of bodhisattvas, as they attend to those sentient beings who can be guided. Wisdom and skill in means is the state of bodhisattvas, as they adapt to sentient beings.<br>"You ask how far away I came from Â– I came here from th village of Kuti in the territories of the Malada people, the land of my birth. There is a gentleman there named Gopalaka who guides people toward the teaching of enlightenment according to their capacities."<br>Sudhana asked Maitreya: "What are the native lands of the bodhisattvas?"<br>Maitreya told him there are ten:<br>Â• Arouding the aspiration for enlightenment is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Strong will is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• The ten stages of the bodhisattva path are a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Carrying out vows is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Universal compassion is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Profound contemplation is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• The Great Vehicle is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Educating sentient beings is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Knowledge and skill in means is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Â• Practicing and realizing all truths is a native land of the bodhisattvas.<br>Maitreya then told Sudhana:<br>"Transcendent wisdom is the mother of the bodhisattvas. Skill in means is the father of the bodhisattvas. Tranacendent generosity is the mother's milk of the bodhisattvas, and transcendent discipline is their nurse. Transcendent tolerance is their adornment, and transcendent vigor is what makes them grow. Transcendent meditation purifies their practice, spiritual friends teach them, the elements of enlightenment are their companions. All the bodhisattvas are their brothers and sisters, and the determination for enlightenment is their family.<br>"Bodhisattvas who have succeeded in being born in this family do not shrink back from existence in any world, because they realize that all things are like reflections. They are tireless in guiding and perfecting all beings, because they are aware that nothing has a real self."<br>Maitreya then told Sudhana:<br>"With a body existing in all worlds, taking on forms like those of all living beings, speaking their languages, adapting to their customary norms, I pervade all universes.<br>"I arrived here in the south, in the village of Kuta in the Malada region, to developed those who followed the same practices as me in the past, but who lost the aspiration for enlightenment. I live in this tower containing the adornments of Vairocana.<br>"When I have passed away here, I will manifest birth in Tushita, a celestial abode of happiness and contentment, and then I will appear to descend from that heaven and be born on earth, to enlighten those inspired by Shakyamuni Buddha when their time comes to be guided further.<br>"At that time I will realize all-knowledge and fulfill my aspiration. When I have attained enlightenment, you will see me again, with the spiritual benefactor Manjushri."<br>Maitreya concluded:<br>"Now go back to Manjushri and ask him how an enlightening being is to learn and carry out the practice of bodhisattvas. He will show you the real benefactor.<br>"Why should you go to Manjushri? Manjushri sees all things according to their true significance. Manjushri has ranged far into all the modes of liberation. He is immersed in the practice of universally good enlightening beings.<br>"All the spiritual benefactors you have seen, all the modes of liberation you have entered, all the vows you have plunged into, should all be looked upon as the empowerment given you by Manjushri. And Manjushri has reached the supreme perfection."<br>Then Sudhana paid his respects to the bodhisattva Maitreya and went on.<br></div>

He stayed there, wishing to see and meet with Manjushri.<br>Then, from hundreds of miles away, Manjushri extended his hand and laid it on the head of Sudhana, who was in the city of Sumanamukha.<br>Manjushri said to Sudhana:<br>"No one can penetrate this true nature, this inner truth, this sphere, this abode, unless they have faith and make continuous efforts, and are in the care of spiritual benefactors."<br>By means of his spiritual talk, Manjushri imbued Sudhana with countless facets of truth, illuminated him with the great light of infinite knowledge, and plunged him into the sphere of the practice of universal good, the realm of the bodhisattva Universally Good.<br>Have established Sudhana on his own, Manjushri then left the presence of Sudhana.<br>Then Sudhana stood contemplating the realm of the bodhisattva Universally Good.<br>Sudhana had acted on the instructions of all his spiritual advisors with correct understanding. His mind was equally attentive to them all, and his intellect was in harmony with all spiritual friends without emotion. He was filled with universal compassion, illumining all beings with universal love.

He comprehended the succession of all the buddhas of the past, present, and future, and was awake to the principles of all enlightening teachings. He was set to carry out enlightening practice through the ages, abiding at peace in the liberation of the bodhisattvas that contains the universal Realm of Reality, empowered by the buddhas.<br>Sudhana was eager to see the bodhisattva Universally Good, knowing of his excellence and expertise in progressing through the stages of the bodhisattva path.<br>Sudhana sat on a lotus seat of jewels facing the lion throne of the Buddha on the enlightenment site there. The enlightenment site was filled with oceans of diamonds.<br>Sudhana's mind was vast as space and free from all attachments, having transcended all barriers and all forms of clinging. His mind was unobstructed in the midst of all things, pervading everywhere without hindrance. His mind was pure, well-ordered, broad and vast, pervading all realms of living beings to guide them to perfection. He had an infinite mind reflected in the circles of all buddhas.<br>Prefiguring his imminent vision of the bodhisattva Universally Good, Sudhana saw all buddha-lands purified by the sentient beings within these lands becoming benevolent to each other and becoming consciously absorbed in mindfulness of Buddha.<br>At that, every atom in every world emanated lights in hundreds of thousands of colors that pervaded the cosmos. Circles of flames, like those that surround the buddhas, emanated from every atom in every world and filled the cosmos.<br>Multitudes of light beams in the form of all the bodies of all the buddhas emanated from every atom in every world, pervading the cosmos and showing the basic vows of all the enlightened ones.<br>Then from all the worlds in the cosmos, from each point in every world, oceans of reflections emanated forth, reflections of bodhisattvas in all forms, fulfilling the needs of all beings.<br>These lights prefigured the manifestation of Universally Good.<br>Having seen all these signs, supported by the power of his own roots of goodness, and empowered by all the buddhas, Sudhana had the opportunity to see the bodhisattva Universally Good.<br></div>

He was in the presence of the realm of all the buddhas. His senses were directed toward a vision of the Universally Good Â– now he was flooded with the great energy of the vision of the bodhisattva Universally Good.<br>Sudhana's mind was directed toward all the buddhas and aware of the bodhisattva Universally Good in the presence of all the buddhas.<br>Inwardly he was perceiving Universally Good in all objects. With the eye of knowledge he beheld the path of Universally Good. With his mind as vast as space, Sudhana had a powerful resolve supported by indestructible universal compassion, vowing to accompany the bodhisattva Universally Good through all time.<br>Sudhana saw the bodhisattva Universally Good sitting on a lion seat in a great jewel lotus in front of Vairocana Buddha, the perfectly enlightened one, in an ocean of bodhisattvas.<br>Universally Good stood out in the whole asembly, looking out over all the bodhisattvas, his knowledge endless, his range total, his sphere of awareness inconceivable.

He saw the succession of ages in each world, and he saw the succession of past and future eras in all worlds in all galaxies in all directions.<br>Sudhana saw the succesion of ages in all worlds throughout space in the physical body of the bodhisattva Universally Good, all in perfect order, not mixed up with each other.<br>And just as Sudhana saw the bodhisattva Universally Good sitting before Vairocana Buddha here in this world emanating this miraculous display, he saw the bodhisattva Universally Good sitting in the presence of all buddhas in all worlds everywhere displaying the same miraculous visions.<br>Then from each individual body of the bodhisattva Universally Good, Sudhana saw all things past, present, and future appearing like reflected images Â– he saw all lands, all beings, all the enlightened ones emerging, all the congregations of bodhisattvas Â– he saw them all appearing as reflections.<br>Sudhana heard the voices of all beings, and the voices of all the enlightened ones teaching them and presenting to them the attainments of the bodhisattvas and the mystic powers of the buddhas.<br>Having witnessed this inconceivable vision communicated from the bodhisattva Universally Good, Sudhana attained a ten-fold consummation of knowledge:<br>Â• Physically pervading all buddha-lands in a moment of thought<br>Â• Holistic knowledge arriving in the presence of all buddhas<br>Â• Having his questions about the Teaching answered by every buddha<br>Â• Meditation on the cycles of teaching of all buddhas<br>Â• Knowledge of the inconceivable miracles of buddhas<br>Â• Knowing how to expound one consistent truth forever by means of the inexhaustible specific knowledge of all particular truths<br>Â• Direct knowledge of the oceans of all truths<br>Â• Knowledge of all true patterns of the Realm of Reality<br>Â• Knowing how to live together with the thoughts of all beings<br>Â• Instantaneous direct witnessing of the practice of the bodhisattva Universally Good<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then Universally Good extended his right hand to Sudhana, who had attained this consummation of knowledge, and laid it on his head.<br>With the hand of Universally Good on his head, countless concentrations entered into Sudhana Â– each concentration let him enter into countless oceans of worlds, and countless provisions for omniscience he had not seen before became visible to him.<br>Sudhana entered into countless oceans of vows and went forth on countless liberating paths of all-knowledge. He engaged in the work of bodhisattvas in countless ways. He was energized by immeasurable floods of omniscience and illuminated by countless lights of all the buddhas' knowledge.<br>Just as in this world, in the presence of Vairocana Buddha, the bodhisattva Universally Good extended his right hand and laid it on Sudhana's head, in the same way, sitting at the feet of all buddhas in all worlds, the bodhisattva Universally Good extended his right hand and laid it on Sudhana's head.<br>And just as facets of truth entered Sudhana as he was touched by the hand of Universally Good at the feet of Vairocana Buddha, likewise, facets of truth entered Sudhana in various ways as he was touched by the multitude of hands extended from the all the bodies of Universally Good.<br>Then the great bodhisattva Universally Good said to Sudhana: "Did you see my mystical projection?"<br>Sudhana said: "I saw, noble one, but only a buddha could understand such an inconceivable mystic projection."<br>Then the great bodhisattva Universally Good told Sudhana about his past practice seeking the mind of all-knowledge, his association with untold numbers of buddhas, his sacrifices over the eons, his ceaseless efforts to keep to the bodhisattva path and stay true to his aspiration for enlightenment. Just to tell the story would take eons.<br>Universally Good told Sudhana:<br>"I attained the ultimately pure body of reality which is continuous and unfragmented throughout past, present, and future Â– by the power of preparing correctly and bringing together the correct factors, by the power of being resolute, by the power of contemplating things as they are, by the power of the eye of wisdom, by the power of buddha, by the power of great compassion, by the power of the care of spiritual benefactors.<br>"I also purified a physical body that appears to all beings according to their mentalities, and is omnipresent in all buddha-lands, abiding everywhere, showing all kinds of mystical projections, visible in every world.<br>"Look at this body I have achieved. Those who have not planted roots of goodness cannot even hear of me, much less see me.<br>"Some beings become irreversible on the path to enlightenment just by hearing my name, or by seeing me, or by coming into contact with me, or by following me, or by seeing me in a dream, or by hearing my name in a dream.<br>"Some beings become mature by remembering me for a day and a night, or a week, or a month, or a year. Some beings become mature by remembering me for a century, or an eon, or many eons. Some beings become mature by remembering me for one lifetime, or a hundred lifetimes, or countless lifetimes.<br>"Some beings become mature by seeing my radiance, or by seeing me send out light beams, or by seeing my physical form, or by feeling me encouraging them.<br>"In these ways, through countless different means, these sentient beings become irreversible on the path toward supreme perfect enlightenment.<br>"Whoever hears of the purity of my buddha-land will be born in pure buddha-lands, and whoever sees the purity of my body will be born in my body."<br>Then Universally Good said to Sudhana:<br>"Look at my body."<br>Sudhana looked again at the body of the enlightening being Universally Good.<br>In every pore he saw untold numbers of buddha-lands filled with buddhas.<br>In each buddha-land he saw the buddhas surrounded by assemblies of bodhisattvas. He saw all the different landscapes of the lands.<br>He saw various buddhas appearing, announcing various cycles of the Teaching. He saw the projected bodies of buddhas numberless as all the atoms in all worlds emerging and filling all worlds in all directions, developing sentient beings toward supreme perfect enlightenment.<br>Then Sudhana entered into all the worlds within the body of the enlightening being Universally Good, and worked to develop living beings in those worlds toward their full potential.<br>Sudhana saw that all the roots of goodness he had accumulated by seeing countless numbers of spiritual benefactors was not even a miniscule fraction of the roots of goodness that came with seeing Universally Good.<br>Sudhana entered countless successive oceans of buddha-lands in every single pore of the body of Univerally Good in each moment of thought.<br>In each moment of thought he passed through untold numbers of worlds, in every step he passed through the worlds of countless eons.<br>Still Sudhana did not come to the end of the oceans of lands or the oceans of buddhas or the oceans of congregations of bodhisattvas. He did not come to the end of the entrances to the realms of sentient beings, to the entrances to instantaneous knowledge of the faculties of sentient beings. He did not come to the end of developing and guiding sentient beings. He did not come to the end of the mystic powers of the bodhisattvas.<br>In each moment of consciousness Sudhana entered infinite oceans of lands and developed sentient beings toward supreme perfect enlightenment.<br>This continued as Sudhana gradually reached equality with the bodhisattva Universally Good.<br>He reached equality with all the buddhas, equality in pervading all lands, equality in fulfilling all practices, equality in turning the wheel of the Teaching, equality in universal love and compassion, equality in the spiritual powers of the inconceivable liberation of bodhisattvas.<br>Then the bodhisattva Universally Good went on to make a vow to honor and serve all the buddhas in all lands of the past, present, and future, and to present the Teaching to all living beings.<br><br>I will travel the paths of the world<br>Free from compulsion, affliction, and delusion<br>I will always be in communion<br>With those who share my practice<br>I will always be with my spiritual benefactors<br>Who teach me the practice of good<br>I will always be face to face with the buddhas<br>Illuminating the practice of enlightenment<br>I will act in all eons within a single instant<br>I will see all the buddhas of all times in one instant<br>I will fulfill the vows of enlightening practice<br>Of all the buddhas of past, present, and future<br>As long as the earth exists<br>As long as all living beings exist<br>As long as their actions and afflictions exist<br>My vow will remain<br><br>May all living beings be happy!<br>Om Mani Padme Hum</div>
