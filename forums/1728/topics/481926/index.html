              <p>More than 10 years ago, I attended a fellowship session led by 
              teacher Shi’an. The discussion happened to be based on a chapter in 
              Shantideva’s ‘Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of Life’. References were 
              also made to Venerable Thubten Chodron’s book ‘Working with Anger’. It 
              was a short session, but packed with practical tips. In 2013, teacher 
              Shi’an expanded the short session into the 4-session Project Patience 
              course which I signed up for. I confess that when I signed up, I was 
              wondering how he could expand the contents into a full course. That was 
              just my ignorance as there was so much to cover that the 4 sessions were
               constantly fast-paced, and never with a dull moment. He filled the 
              course with examples that one could relate to for application to daily 
              life. It was certainly not mere theory or textbook teaching.</p>
              <p>A friend was somewhat surprised to see me at the course, remarking 
              that I don’t seem to have anger issues. Though I probably appear patient
               to some, personally, I feel that this is a course suitable for all of 
              us, Buddhist or non-Buddhist, good-tempered or ill-tempered. Who doesn’t
               have this feeling of anger, or its more ‘refined’ version of irritation
               arising in our hearts, even if it’s for only a thought moment, which 
              often lasts longer? And how often do we feel that our anger is 
              justified? The training of patience is a lifelong project (which usually
               spans many lives). Until we have perfected our patience, we all need to
               learn, and of course, practise it. <strong>- Joyce</strong></p>
              <p>Hi Bro. Shi’an! Yes, I really did benefit much from your lessons! 
              Thank you very much! What you shared was truly wise and I do see myself 
              in some scenarios you mentioned.. Really want to improve my 
              relationships with family and friends. *Guilty of having unnecessary 
              quarrels with family :p* Really grateful to you for sharing and am doing
               my best to be a good student to practise what you taught. Sincerely 
              hope to be a better person with patience, especially not easily angered.
               *Heartfelt thanks* Will share and encourage family and friends to 
              attend such beneficial courses too. – <strong>Camilly</strong></p>
              <p>Dear teacher Shi’an, I find your class very useful and interesting 
              because you use a lot of everyday examples and meaningful quotes in your
               lessons. I will try to apply what I have learned in your class in my 
              daily life. Thank you very much for conducting this meaningful course. 
              Jia You. With warmest regards, <strong>Vicky</strong></p>
              <p>How I have benefited… Excellent examples of how we can utilise the 
              teachings in real life, which enables me to connect to my situations… 
              The course was delivered and shared in a light-hearted manner which does
               not stress me out, and I look forward to every session. – <strong>Adeline</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you once again for the course. I benefited alot and I will 
              learn to be more patient after attending these lessons. Amituofo, <strong>Albert</strong></p>
              <p>My patience was put to test soon after I attended lesson 2 of your 
              class. Well, I should be glad that the opportunity came for me to put 
              into practice what I have learnt. Honestly, at that moment, I was unable
               to dissolve my anger immediately. But I was mindful of it and knew that
               I had to do something about it. I quickly reminded myself of the 
              techniques you shared with us in class. I was pleasantly surprised at 
              how soon I managed to overcome my negative emotions and realised how 
              foolish it was of me to get angry. Thanks, Bro. Shi’an, for starting 
              this course. I truly benefited from it and am sure it will be of benefit
               to others too… Thank you for your tireless efforts in propagating the 
              Dhamma. Hope to have the opportunity to attend more of your classes. 
              With metta, <strong>Ivy<br> </strong></p>
