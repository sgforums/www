I am a healthy adult male mind you, its just that pretty ladies are too often too self-concious. They are only too aware of their own beauty and expects others to stare and be captivated by them.

"In<br>the Heaven of the Four Kings and the Trayastrimsha, desire is<br>carried out through embracing." They conduct sexual affairs the<br>same way people do. "In the Suyama Heaven they hold hands; in<br>the Tusita they smile." The beings in the Suyama Heaven unite in<br>mind, but not physically. All they have to do to fulfill their sexual<br>longing is to hold hands. In the Tusita Heaven, they smile. There's<br>no physical contact involved. "In the Bliss by Transformation, they<br>gaze. In the Comfort from Others', a glance will do." Men and<br>women in the Bliss by Transformation Heaven need only look at<br>one another Â­ they don't even have to smile. They stare at each other for maybe three minutes or five minutes; that's how their<br>sexual intercourse is completed. In the next heaven a brief glance is<br>sufficient. An instant is all it takes. The higher the heaven, the<br>lighter the thoughts of sexual desire.<br>This is a true principle; you should understand it clearly. Once<br>you do, you'll be able to genuinely understand the Buddhadharma,<br>for you will know that sexual desire is tremendously harmful. Do<br>you remember the earlier passage in the Sutra that says Bodhisat-<br>tvas look upon sexual desire as they would a poisonous snake?<br>They know they will be bitten to death. People's ordinary flesh-<br>eyes cannot see how fierce it is. That's why they spend all their<br>time, day and night, thinking about this nasty thing. They can't put<br>it down. If you really understood, I think you wouldn't be so<br>confused and upside down about it.</strong><br><br>more detail commentry by lated Master Hsuan Hua in:<br><a href="http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/ps.ss.02.v7.020526.screen.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://online.sfsu.edu/~rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/ps.ss.02.v7.020526.screen.pdf</a><br><br>/\<br></div>
