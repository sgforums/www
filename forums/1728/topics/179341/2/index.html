Pure Love, True Love, untainted by attachments and illusions. Incidently I have posted somewhere a few days ago, to a person who's friend started dissocialising because of his cultivation. I said it is wrong way. The problem for most of us is that we are restricted to our attachments and ego, our love is also restricted to our attachments and ego. When our love ones passed away, great suffering comes. Be a Bodhisattva and treat all sentient beings with equality and compassion, like in Diamond sutra, harbouring no ideas of 'self', 'others', etc. Including your family. (p.s my dharma teacher is also a lay practitioner and is concerned for family, although not in an attached manner. many enlightened ppl are know also have their family <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is important not to be attached to family and friends, but detachment is not dissocialising with them. Detachment means one doesnt get caught up in relationships, feelings, affections, to the point where one person has to depart from you (anyone will, eventually), you cannot get over with it, and make your life miserable.<br><br>It is good that you said 'your ego has left', and you get joy from helping others, which is great. Therefore, non-ego, detachment, is not a form of pessimism. But it is needed to realise true love and compassion for everyone, without discriminations and attachments.<br><br><strong>"A human being is part of a whole, called by us the "Universe," a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separated from the rest--a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circles of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." - Albert Einstein</strong></span><br><br><blockquote>are there people in this world who are cultivating and still fall into lust? why is lust difficult to control for some people while it is easy for some others? (attachments?) able to control lust means cultivation is strong and stable? if cannot control lust means cultivation not good enough?</blockquote>When a person is able to 'control' himself, it means he has a higher level of Ding4 Li4 (samadhi). His mind is not easily moved.<br><br>But still, the highest stage is 'Wu2 Ren3 Ke2 Ren3'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> What is there to control, when all are empty? Lu shi guan... guan zi zai.<br><br><blockquote>after all we are humans.....</blockquote>Humans all must learn to Chao1 Fan2 Ru4 Sheng4 (transcend worldliness - entering sainthood). Being Buddhists, we must learn to be like Buddha.<br><br><blockquote>and i wanna add on is that.... indeed the human realm is the most challenging realm to cultivate and train to attain enlightenment that i believe the devas and lower realms respect and long to be in human realms as well.</blockquote>Indeed!

Buddhists have prejudices just like non-Buddhists. However, so far as Buddhism itself is concerned, one's sexual orientation has nothing to do with anything - not directly anyway. How one chooses to exercise or express that sexuality is more important by far. Actually, when it comes right down to it, it really has more to do with how one views one's own sexuality.<br><br>In any case, most practicing Buddhists do not care about a person's sexual orientation. Like I said, we all have hang ups - Buddhist or not. But I think it's safe to say that most Buddhists recognize that such <span style="text-decoration: underline;">problems lie with the beholder and not the subject of prejudice.</span><br><br>For your info, in California, there are special sanghas which composed solely of Gay people<br><br>We can express our view on behaviors and our expression is generally tied to our level of development in the BuddhaDhamma.
