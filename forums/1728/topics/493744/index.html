              of Chinese Buddhists with Vegetarian Diets on Greenhouse Gas Emissions</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">According
              to a recent study published in the Journal of Contemporary Buddhism, Buddhists
              in China who have adopted vegetarian diets are offsetting almost 40 million
              tonnes of greenhouse gas emission each year. Professor Ampera A. Tseng, a
              researcher from Arizona State University (ASU), revealed the findings about the
              environmental benefits of vegetarian diets after investigating the impact on
              greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs) in China.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“The
              results indicate that Chinese Buddhists with vegetarian diets account for the
              equivalent GHGE reduction of 39.68 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent,
              which is a sizable amount and is equal to 7.2 and 9.2 per cent of the GHGEs
              from [the] United Kingdom and France in 2012, respectively,” Tseng noted in the
              introduction to his research paper. (Taylor &amp; Francis Online)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">A
              professor in ASU’s Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering since
              1996, Prof. Tseng was previously a professor of mechanical engineering at
              Drexel University in Pensylvania for more than 10 years. He has conducted
              research in various countries, including China, the Czech Republic, Japan, and
              Taiwan, and has published more than 200 technical papers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“In
              modern times, the vegetarian practice[s] of Chinese Buddhism should attract
              more Buddhists or lay people to follow, if the additional environmental and
              health benefits of vegetarianism could be emphasised.” Tseng stated. (Taylor
              &amp; Francis Online)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">While
              the broad variety of delicious cuisines originating in China are well known
              throughout the world, according to a report by Australia’s ABC News, meat
              consumption has risen rapidly in line with the country’s economic growth. But
              Buddhist practitioners represent a growing segment of Chinese society that is
              keen to encourage vegetarianism. As a result there are an increasing number of
              vegetarian restaurants in many cities—some of which are inspired by the spirit
              of Buddhism, while others are simply promoting a meat-free lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">An
              estimated 50 million Chinese are believed to be vegetarian—just under 4 per
              cent of the country’s total population of 1.4 billion. Zhang Xiuyan, 67, who is
              unable to eat meat for health reasons, is well accustomed to the difficulty of
              finding restaurants in China that understand the need for meat-free dishes.
              Public awareness of the requirements of vegetarians is long overdue, she
              emphasized.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“With
              more people becoming vegetarians, restaurants are making changes,” said Zhang.
              “They have to stay in business by catering to the increasing number of non-meat
              eaters. So these days when I go out to restaurants, there are still some
              problems, but it's not anywhere as bad as it used to be.” (ABC News)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Indeed,
              vegetarian diets are becoming increasingly popular around the world. The
              American Dietetic Association holds the position that “appropriately planned
              vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful,
              nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and
              treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate
              for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy,
              lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.” (NCBI)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              Prof. Tseng’s view, by raising awareness of the environmental benefits of
              vegetarian diet, “the resultant impact for the equivalent reduction of GHGEs
              could be even larger and the human-induced global warming problem could be
              further alleviated.”</span></p>
