Another way of expressing this is,<span style="color: darkred;"> "Abandon negative action; create perfect virtue; subdue your own mind. This is the teaching of the Buddha."</span> By abandoning negative actions (killing, etc) and destructive motivations (anger, attachment, close-mindedness, etc.), we stop harming ourselves and others. <span class="large"><strong>By creating perfect virtue, we develop beneficial attitudes, like impartial love and compassion, and do actions motivated by these thoughts. By subduing our mind, we cut away all false projections, thus making ourselves calm and peaceful by understanding reality</strong></span>.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Every TRUE Buddhist MUST KNOW</span></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">THE FIVE PRECEPTS</span><br><br><span style="color: green;">1. Do not kill </span><br><br>Aware of the suffering caused by the destruction of life, I vow to cultivate compassion and to learn the ways of protecting the lives of people, animals and plants. <span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">I am determined not to kill, not to let others kill, and not to condone any act of killing in the world, in my thinking, and in my way of life</span></span></span>.<br><br><span style="color: green;">2. Do not steal </span><br><br>Aware of the suffering caused by exploitation, social injustice, stealing and oppression, I vow to cultivate loving-kindness and learn ways to work for the well-being of people, animals and plants. I vow to practice generosity by sharing my time, energy, and material resources with those who are in real need. <span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">I am determined not to steal and not to possess anything that should belong to others</span></span></span>. I will respect the property of others, but I will do everything in my power to prevent others from human suffering of other species.<br><br><span style="color: green;">3. Do not indulge in sexual misconduct </span><br><br>Aware of the suffering caused by sexual misconduct, I vow to cultivate my responsibility and learn ways to protect the safety and integrity of individuals, couples, families and society.<span class="large"> <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">I am determined not to engage in sexual relations without love and long-term commitment</span></span></span>. To preserve the happiness of myself and others, I am determined to respect my commitments and the commitments of others. I will do everything in my power to protect children from sexual abuse and to protect families from being broken by sexual misconduct.<br><br><span style="color: green;">4. Do not make false speech </span><br><br>Aware of suffering caused by unmindful speech and the inability to listen to the suffering of others, I vow to cultivate loving speech and deep listening in order to bring joy and happiness to others and relieve others of their suffering. Knowing that words can create happiness or bring suffering, I vow to learn to speak truthfully, with words that can inspire self confidence, joy and hope. <span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">I am determined not to spread news that I do not know to be certain, and not to criticize or condemn things I am not sure of </span></span></span>. I will refrain from uttering words that can cause division or discord, or that can cause the family or the community to break. I willmake every effort to reconcile and resolve all conflicts, even small.<br><br><span style="color: green;">5. Do not take intoxicants</span><br><br>Aware of the suffering caused by unmindful consumption, I vow to cultivate good health, both physical and mental, for myself, my family, and my society by practicing mindful eating, drinking, and consuming. I vow to ingest only items that preserve peace, well-being and joy in my body, in my consciousness, and in the collective body and consciousness of my family and society. <span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;">I am determined not to use alcohol or any other intoxicants, or to ingest foods or other items that contain toxins, such as certain T.V. programs, magazines, books, films and conversations</span></span></span>. I am aware that to damage my body and my consciousness with these poisons is to betray my ancestors, my pafrents, my society, and future generations. I will work to transform violence, fear, anger, and confusion by practicing a diet for myself and for society. I understand that a proper diet is crucial for self-transformation, and for the transformation of society.<br><br></div>
