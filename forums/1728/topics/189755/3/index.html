            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt, Buddha set an example by being a man of peace, and Buddhism holds the best track record of being a peaceful religion, however, as other forummers have wrote, there were "violence" committed by buddhists (which has resulted in deaths of innocent people). I can see no difference between this "violence" committed by buddhists and war committed by people in the name of God, becoz any death resulted from "violence" is also bloodshed. It does not mean those who committed violence are any better than those who shed blood in the name of god. And I disagree that God-centred religions are any less humanistic than Buddhism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by neutral_onliner:<br><strong><br><br>Ok pls let me make tis clear [b]God-centred religions </strong>are founded on the God idea.Insofar as they place God first, they cannot really give the highest priority to life. A religion that teaches that God created man, can at best claim by that fact that human life is precious above all else.Whereas for <span style="color: darkblue;">buddhism</span> is <span style="color: darkblue;">life-centred religion</span>.A truly humanistic religion, one that really cares for mankind and the world.Indeed, only a life-centred religion can be truly environment-friendly and compassionate to all beings.Only a life-centred religion can be truly tolerant of others.<br><br>since you ask so do let me cite a different <strong>attitude between christianity and buddhism towards wars</strong><br><br>The Bible tells us that there is a time for hate and a time for war (Ex 3:8 and it is widely recognized today that those great evils depend upon each other. As we have seen, God is quite capable of hatred and, not surprisingly is therefore often involved in war.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Lord is a man of war (Ex 15:3). </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Lord your God is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory (Zeph 3:17). </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Lord goes forth like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his fury, he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against the enemy (Is 42:13). </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">When I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me. I will make my arrows drunk with blood while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders (Deut 32:41-42).<br><br>For centuries Christians have been inspired by these Bible passages, which encourage and even glorify war, to use violence to spread their religion. Even today there is a distinctly militaristic flavour about Christianity. The Salvation Army with its motto "Blood and Fire"; the hymns that speak about "Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war"; the saying "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition", etc. The Bible contains dozens of examples of God helping his devotees to capture cities, slaughter civilian populations and defeat armies (for example Num 21:1-3, Num 31:1-12, Deut 2:32-34, Deut 3:3-7, Josh 11:6-11, etc.). Concerning captives in war God says:<br><br>And you shall destroy all the peoples that the Lord your God gives over to you, your eye shall not pity them (')eat 7:16).<br><br>When the Lord your God gives them over to you and you defeat them you must utterly destroy them and show no mercy to them (Deut 7:2). </span><br><br>What was the Buddha's attitude to war? There is <span class="large"><strong>no example </strong></span>of the Buddha ever praising war, encouraging war, or going to war himself. On the contrary, <span style="color: darkblue;">he urged all to live in peace and harmony</span> and is described in this way:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Re is a reconciler of those who are in conflict and an encourager of those who are already united, rejoicing in peace, loving peace, delighting in peace, he is one who speaks in praise of peace (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.1). </span><br><br>He set an example by being a man of peace<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Abandoning killing, the monk Gotarna lives refraining from killing, he is without stick or sword, he lives with care, compassion and sympathy for others (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.1). </span><br><br>The Buddha was not content with merely speaking in favour of peace or with being peaceful himself. He actively promoted peace by trying to stop war. When hi relatives were about to go to war over the waters of the Rohini River, the Buddha did not take sides, urge them on, give them advice on tactics, or tell them to show no mercy to their adversaries, as God would have done. Instead he stood between the two factions and said, <span style="color: darkblue;">"What is more valuable, blood or water?"</span> The soldier replied, "Blood is more valuable, sir." Then the Buddha said, <span style="color: darkblue;">"Then is it not unbecoming to spill blood for water?" </span>Both sides dropped their weapons and peace was restored <span style="color: darkblue;">(Dhammapada Atthakata Book l5,l). </span><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;">The Buddha had put aside hatred and filled his mind with love and compassion, so approving of war was impossible for him.</span> </span><br><br><span class="large">"<span style="color: green;">Though in their ignorance many will curse and<br>abuse us and beat us with swords and staves; we will endure it all</span>."<br>--Lotus Sutra: 13<br><br>"<span style="color: green;">Repeatedly shall we be driven out and exiled afar from our monasteries. Such evils will be our ills for remembering the Buddha's command, but we will endure all these things." </span><br>--Lotus Sutra: 13 </span><br><br>May they know what they did were wrong<br>May they be truly awakened to loving-kindness &amp; compassion one day<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the best of my knowledge, I never said that Christianity is Â“badÂ”. I am just questioning the propriety of the god-centered ethics set out in the religion. Christianity clearly has its merits, but it also has its share of ethical problems, and these ethical problems are independent of the practitioners of Christianity.<br><br>Can people who practice a religion turn out to be good if the teachings of that religion are bad?<br><br>John Rabe was a Nazi. Adherents of the Nazi ideology held that the Aryan race was superior to other races, and they promoted Germanic racial supremacy to the extent of Â“cleansingÂ” the world of lesser races. Yet, at great personal risk to himself, Rabe saved countless Chinese from being slaughtered during the Nanjing Massacre in WW2.<br><br>So the answer to your question is: yes, people who practice a religion can turn out to be good even if the teachings of that religion are bad, and vice-versa. Also, the only reason I am only harassed and not persecuted, is that we live in a modern secular world, and therefore are direct beneficiaries to the separation of the state and church doctrine, not to mention also the protection accorded to me by the State, who goes out of its way to ensure racial and religious harmony in a country with a such a multi-cultural, multi-racial demographics like Singapore.<br><br>Â… and no lah, I donÂ’t expect you to apologize on behalf of your co-religionists. I never believed in accountability by proxy in religion anywayÂ… though it will be nice if Christians can refrain from lambasting all other religions all the timeÂ… I know this probably wonÂ’t happen, since it is in the core Christian teaching for followers to Â“bear fruitÂ” for their Lord... speaking of which, my HOD sincerely "advised" me to enrol my children in Bible studies just yesterday  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">And if I am not wrong, Buddhism forum promote ecumenism between religions, regardless whether they are monotheistic/life-centered/watever.

If you read my other posts, I also express doubts on certain aspects of BuddhismÂ….<br><br>...But it will be nice too if the rest of the Christians can agree with you about proclaimning the superiority of one's religion as egoism.<br><br>Lastly, Â…..No lahÂ… I am not a teacherÂ… Â“inkÂ” not enuf, and my England oso not powderful enuf.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...i think there is some misunderstanding here.ok so let me do some clarification here.Let me repeat my point that a truly humanistic religion, one that really <strong>cares for mankind and the world</strong>(<span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">all living beings</span></span>), is a life-centred religion. Our global society now realizes that human life,<span style="color: blue;">indeed all life and nature, are interdependent</span>. This is called<span style="color: blue;"> interbeing</span>, a word coined by <strong>Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk living in France</strong>.<span class="large"><span style="color: blue;">What we do ultimately affects the whole universe around us</span>.</span><br><br>Indeed, only a life-centred religion can be truly environment-friendly and compassionate to <span style="color: blue;">all beings</span>(<span class="large"><span style="color: green;">not only human but all beings</span></span>).<strong>A religion that teaches that God created man, can at best claim by that fact that human life is precious above all else</strong><br><br>Another example,pples do good becos their gods say so becos of the reward of something in return (eg heaven)or becos they will be punished(eg to hell)they place God first, they cannot really give the highest priority to life.<br><br>whereas in buddhism We do good not because we can use this as a bargain to go to heaven. We do good not because we are afraid of being punished to hell. We do good because this is what we are. We do good because we are happy to do so We do good because we have loving-kindness and Compassion This is what we really are and this is wat Buddha has made us realise.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laoda99:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm...my argument is .....if the teachings of a religion is bad....can pple who practice that religion turn out good?<br><br>As I have said, there are good and bad hats in a religion. It is unfortunate u are harrassed by " my co-religionists ". Should I apologize on their behalf? And persecution, is too strong a word to be used for the " harassment " u face from these people. " My co-religionists " will never be able to convert u if u do not wish to.<br>Are u a teacher btw?<br>And if I am not wrong, Buddhism forum promote ecumenism between religions, regardless whether they are monotheistic/life-centered/watever. And I think clinging to the fact that a religion is more humanistic than the others is in fact egoism, and is contrary to teachings of Gautama Buddha. We all have some things in life which we must reflect upon ourselves. </div></blockquote>As i have said a <span class="large"><span style="color: green;">good christian is a good buddhist </span></span>vice versa<br>so let us not judge a religion by those who fail to practise it.<br><br>May all be happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

After this, European armies spread throughout the world forcing their religion on the people they conquered. In most conquered countries (e.g. Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Taiwan and parts of India) laws were passed banning all non-Christian religions. By the late 19th century brute force was no longer used to enforce belief but, under the influence of the missionaries, colonial administrators tried to hinder non-Christian religions as much as possible. Today the spread of Christianity is supported by lavish financial assistance which missionaries get largely from the U.S.A. So Christianity has spread not because of its inherent superiority but because of violence in the past and wealth today.<br><br>Buddhism has always been less aggressive  than Christianity. This has meant that its influence on society has been subtle, less noticeable and even perhaps less dynamic than it should have been. On the other hand it has also meant that the witch hunts against heretics, the persecution of non-believers, and the bloody religious wars which have marred Christian history have been rare or absent in Buddhism.</div>
