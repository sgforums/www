And perfection is synonymous with happiness. to the Buddha, <span style="color: darkred;">man is not an experiment in life created by somebody which can be done away with when unwanted </span><br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">To depend on others for salvation is negative, but to depend on oneself is positive. Dependence on others means surrendering one's intelligence and efforts</span>. </span><br><br>Everything which has improved and uplifted humanity has been done by man himself.

Man <span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">should not be a slave</span> </span>even to the great forces of nature because even though he is crushed by them he remains superior by virtue of his understanding of them. Buddhism carries the Truth further: it shows that by <strong>means of understanding, man can also control his environment and circumstances</strong>. He can cease to be crushed by them and use their power to raise himself to great heights of spirituality and nobility.<br><br>Buddhism gives due credit to man's intelligence and effort for his achievements rather than to supernatural beings. <span style="color: darkred;">True religion means faith in the good of man rather than faith in unknown forces</span>.

What does Buddhist scriptures say abt war or the scenarios u mention below?<br></div></blockquote>Ok pls let me make tis clear <strong>God-centred religions </strong>are founded on the God idea.Insofar as they place God first, they cannot really give the highest priority to life. A religion that teaches that God created man, can at best claim by that fact that human life is precious above all else.Whereas for <span style="color: darkblue;">buddhism</span> is <span style="color: darkblue;">life-centred religion</span>.A truly humanistic religion, one that really cares for mankind and the world.Indeed, only a life-centred religion can be truly environment-friendly and compassionate to all beings.Only a life-centred religion can be truly tolerant of others.<br><br>since you ask so do let me cite a different <strong>attitude between christianity and buddhism towards wars</strong><br><br>The Bible tells us that there is a time for hate and a time for war (Ex 3:8 and it is widely recognized today that those great evils depend upon each other. As we have seen, God is quite capable of hatred and, not surprisingly is therefore often involved in war.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Lord is a man of war (Ex 15:3). </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Lord your God is in your midst, a warrior who gives victory (Zeph 3:17). </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">The Lord goes forth like a mighty man, like a man of war he stirs up his fury, he cries out, he shouts aloud, he shows himself mighty against the enemy (Is 42:13). </span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">When I sharpen my flashing sword and my hand grasps it in judgment, I will take vengeance on my adversaries and repay those who hate me. I will make my arrows drunk with blood while my sword devours flesh: the blood of the slain and the captives, the heads of the enemy leaders (Deut 32:41-42).<br><br>For centuries Christians have been inspired by these Bible passages, which encourage and even glorify war, to use violence to spread their religion. Even today there is a distinctly militaristic flavour about Christianity. The Salvation Army with its motto "Blood and Fire"; the hymns that speak about "Onward Christian soldiers marching as to war"; the saying "Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition", etc. The Bible contains dozens of examples of God helping his devotees to capture cities, slaughter civilian populations and defeat armies (for example Num 21:1-3, Num 31:1-12, Deut 2:32-34, Deut 3:3-7, Josh 11:6-11, etc.). Concerning captives in war God says:<br><br>And you shall destroy all the peoples that the Lord your God gives over to you, your eye shall not pity them (')eat 7:16).<br><br>When the Lord your God gives them over to you and you defeat them you must utterly destroy them and show no mercy to them (Deut 7:2). </span><br><br>What was the Buddha's attitude to war? There is <span class="large"><strong>no example </strong></span>of the Buddha ever praising war, encouraging war, or going to war himself. On the contrary, <span style="color: darkblue;">he urged all to live in peace and harmony</span> and is described in this way:<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Re is a reconciler of those who are in conflict and an encourager of those who are already united, rejoicing in peace, loving peace, delighting in peace, he is one who speaks in praise of peace (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.1). </span><br><br>He set an example by being a man of peace<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Abandoning killing, the monk Gotarna lives refraining from killing, he is without stick or sword, he lives with care, compassion and sympathy for others (Digha Nikaya, Sutta No.1). </span><br><br>The Buddha was not content with merely speaking in favour of peace or with being peaceful himself. He actively promoted peace by trying to stop war. When hi relatives were about to go to war over the waters of the Rohini River, the Buddha did not take sides, urge them on, give them advice on tactics, or tell them to show no mercy to their adversaries, as God would have done. Instead he stood between the two factions and said, <span style="color: darkblue;">"What is more valuable, blood or water?"</span> The soldier replied, "Blood is more valuable, sir." Then the Buddha said, <span style="color: darkblue;">"Then is it not unbecoming to spill blood for water?" </span>Both sides dropped their weapons and peace was restored <span style="color: darkblue;">(Dhammapada Atthakata Book l5,l). </span><span class="large"><span style="color: darkblue;">The Buddha had put aside hatred and filled his mind with love and compassion, so approving of war was impossible for him.</span> </span><br><br><span class="large">"<span style="color: green;">Though in their ignorance many will curse and<br>abuse us and beat us with swords and staves; we will endure it all</span>."<br>--Lotus Sutra: 13<br><br>"<span style="color: green;">Repeatedly shall we be driven out and exiled afar from our monasteries. Such evils will be our ills for remembering the Buddha's command, but we will endure all these things." </span><br>--Lotus Sutra: 13 </span><br><br>May they know what they did were wrong<br>May they be truly awakened to loving-kindness &amp; compassion one day<br><br></div>
