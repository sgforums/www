              <p><span class="txt">In 2003, the late founder of Namdroling Monastery, His Holiness Penor Rinpoche, established Namdroling Tsepal Tobkyed Hospital to provide necessary medical care for the community of monks, nuns, and refugees, as well as for the residents of Bylakuppe and villages surounding the monastery. <br> </span></p>
              <p><span class="txt">Tsepal Tobkyed Hospital widely known as "TT Hospital," is the healthcare center of Namdroling Monastery established by the late His Holiness Penor Rinpoche in the year 2003. It is located across the street from Namdroling Monastery. His Holiness' hope in founding the hospital was that it might serve the health needs of the monks and nuns at Namdroling Monastery, and the people of Bylakuppe and the surrounding villages. The initial vision was that the hospital would have the potential to cater to a much bigger area, from Kushalnagar (4 km away, pop 35,000) to Periyapatna (18 km away). The total population living within a 50 km radius is about 160,000. He foresaw a large modern western hospital many facilities, which would also have a mission to cater to the poor. </span></p>

              </span></p><p class="txt">With the help of sponsors, so far the monastery has been able to renovate the hospital and as a result, the hospital now looks fresh and new. In addition, the monastery has also fully computerized the consultation room, pharmacy, accounts section, main office and laboratory making it easier to work and to maintain transparency. Standard quality beds for inpatients were purchased and installation of one RO (Reverse Osmosis) Plant for dialysis unit was also done.</p>
