After finishing his basic schooling, he spent three years as a novice before returning to lay life to help his parents on the farm. At the age of twenty, however, he decided to resume monastic life, and on April 26, 1939 he received upasampada (bhikkhu ordination). Ajahn Chah's early monastic life followed a traditional pattern, of studying Buddhist teachings and the Pali scriptural language. In his fifth year his father fell seriously ill and died, a blunt reminder of the frailty and precariousness of human life. It caused him to think deeply about life's real purpose, for although he had studied extensively and gained some proficiency in Pali, he seemed no nearer to a personal understanding of the end of suffering. Feelings of disenchantment set in, and finally (in 1946) he abandoned his studies and set off on mendicant pilgrimage.<br>He walked some 400 km to Central Thailand, sleeping in forests and gathering almsfood in the villages on the way. He took up residence in a monastery where the vinaya (monastic discipline) was carefully studied and practiced. While there he was told about Venerable Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto, a most highly respected Meditation Master. Keen to meet such an accomplished teacher, Ajahn Chah set off on foot for the Northeast in search of him.<br>At this time Ajahn Chah was wrestling with a crucial problem. He had studied the teachings on morality, meditation and wisdom, which the texts presented in minute and refined detail, but he could not see how they could actually be put into practice. Ajahn Mun told him that although the teachings are indeed extensive, at their heart they are very simple. With mindfulness established, if it is seen that everything arises in the heart-mind. ..right there is the true path of practice. This succinct and direct teaching was a revelation for Ajahn Chah, and transformed his approach to practice. The Way was clear.<br>For the next seven years Ajahn Chah practiced in the style of the austere Forest Tradition, wandering through the countryside in quest of quiet and secluded places for developing meditation. He lived in tiger and cobra infested jungles, using reflections on death to penetrate to the true meaning of life. On one occasion he practiced in a cremation ground, to challenge and eventually overcome his fear of death. Then, as he sat cold and drenched in a rainstorm, he faced the utter desolation and loneliness of a homeless monk.<br>In 1954, after years of wandering, he was invited back to his home village. He settled close by, in a fever ridden, haunted forest called 'Pah Pong'. Despite the hardships of malaria, poor shelter and sparse food, disciples gathered around him in increasing numbers. The monastery, which is now known as Wat Pah Pong began there, and eventually branch monasteries were also, established elsewhere.<br>In 1967 an American monk came to stay at Wat Pah Pong. The newly ordained Venerable Sumedho had just spent his first vassa ('Rains' retreat) practicing intensive meditation at a monastery near the Laotian border. Although his efforts had borne some fruit, Venerable Sumedho realized that he needed a teacher who could train him in all aspects of monastic life. By chance, one of Ajahn Chah's monks, one who happened to speak a little English visited the monastery where Venerable Sumedho was staying. Upon hearing about Ajahn Chah, he asked to take leave of his preceptor, and went back to Wat Pah Pong with the monk. Ajahn Chah willingly accepted the new disciple, but insisted that he receive no special allowances for being a Westerner. He would have to eat the same simple almsfood and practice in the same way as any other monk at Wat Pah Pong. The training there was quite harsh and forbidding. Ajahn Chah often pushed his monks to their limits, to test their powers of endurance so that they would develop patience and resolution. He sometimes initiated long and seemingly pointless work projects, in order to frustrate their attachment to tranquility. The emphasis was always on surrender to the way things are, and great stress was placed upon strict observance of the vinaya.<br>In the course of events, other Westerners came through Wat Pah Pong. By the time Venerable Sumedho was a bhikkhu of five vassas, and Ajahn Chah considered him competent enough to teach, some of these new monks had also decided to stay on and train there. In the hot season of 1975, Venerable Sumedho and a handful of Western bhikkhus spent some time living in a forest not far from Wat Pah Pong. The local villagers there asked them to stay on, and Ajahn Chah consented. The Wat Pah Nanachat ('International Forest Monastery') came into being, and Venerable Sumedho became the abbot of the first monastery in Thailand to be run by and for English-speaking monks.<br>In 1977, Ajahn Chah was invited to visit Britain by the English Sangha Trust, a charity with the aim of establishing a locally-resident Buddhist Sangha. He took Venerable Sumedho and Venerable Khemadhammo along, and seeing the serious interest there, left them in London at the Hampstead Vihara (with two of his other Western disciples who were then visiting Europe). He returned to Britain in 1979, at which time the monks were leaving London to begin Chithurst Buddhist Monastery in Sussex. He then went on to America and Canada to visit and teach. After this trip, and again in 1981, Ajahn Chah spent the 'Rains' away from Wat Pah Pong, since his health was failing due to the debilitating effects of diabetes. As his illness worsened, he would use his body as a teaching, a living example of the impermanence of all things. He constantly reminded people to endeavor to find a true refuge within themselves, since he would not be able to teach for very much longer. Before the end of the 'Rains' of 1981, he was taken to Bangkok for an operation; it, however, did little to improve his condition. Within a few months he stopped talking, and gradually he lost control of his limbs until he was virtually paralyzed and bed-ridden. From then on, he was diligently and lovingly nursed and attended by devoted disciples, grateful for the occasion to offer service to the teacher who so patiently and compassionately showed the Way to so many.</div>

I listened to his CD before, finding happiness in life and he is witty and his talk is interesting as he is a native speaker of english.<br><br>He was a physicist and a scientist before he renounced. Before he started on the topic, he said it was not really relevant to the tenet teachings of Buddhism, but wanted to explore from Buddhism point of view, something like that.<br><br>He started off by saying the big bang was a fits of big bangs,  ie many big bangs at the same time in the universe.<br><br>Then he touched on evolution and creator. Evolution happens as a result of cravings and desires and creator is ourselves, not the almighty god or allah, who claimed to create us and everything else. He said there is nothing that is left to chance and that it is ourselves, we are the creator of our life.<br><br>Will talk about this tommorrow as it is getting quite late now.<br>I will be going to PKS again tommorrow, what happens after death, will keep you updated.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The venerable uses foibles and real life examples to illustrate what he is talking about, which is brilliant by its account.<br><br>The Q &amp; A are also interesting as the venerable elaborate on the questioner's questions and his answers are witty too. He also gave brief introduction to early christianity that accepted reincarnation before it was booted out 2:1 at the council and there are a few versions of bible as well. He was well verse in christianity as he was brought up as a christian before renouncing, so he should know what he is talking about.<br><br>He mentioned that Australia was part of India before seismic movements separated the two many years ago and i heard it from my Indian lecturer talked about it before, as he was trained in geophysicist, which is an interesting topic. Remember your geography lesson on pangea, a mass of continents enjoined before splitting into the various continents.<br><br>He talked about evolution and gave an example to reinforce the concept of evolutuion. There was a mine field which the UK government decided to stop the mining activities and was thus a deserted wasteland for dumping. Alot of people, who have pets they do not want, especially cats, dumped them into this mine shaft, which is dunno how deep from the surface. About 98 percent of cat abandonment perished, only about 2 % survived the throw from the shaft. Years later, the mine field was reopened and they discovered the cats that survived the fall from the shaft has a difference from domestic cats. Their ears are a few times larger than normal cats. The reason being in the dark shaft, the cat need ears than eyes to go about as it was pitch dark inside the shaft. Venerable said it was willed by the cat so that it can rely on its ears and so, we are the master of our self and nobody else. In the same sense, it was craving and desire that caused the ear to enlarge by itself. The design was actually caused by craving and desire.<br><br>I watched discovery channel recently that millions of years or so ago, snakes have legs initially, but they find that moving around with legs is cumbersome, so they mutate and do away with the legs altogether so that moving around is easier than having legs.<br><br></div>
