Since this world is created by superstition, or conceptuality [Tib: nam-tog], if we eradicate the creator, superstition, we can attain liberation. The Buddha said that it is superstition that causes us to fall into the ocean of samsara. Therefore, that which is to be avoided is superstition, but the emptiness of superstition, which is like the sky, like empty space, is that which is to be practiced. By achieving this, we will be able to see the absolute nature of existence. Therefore, the bodhisattvasÂ’ practice is to avoid superstition and thus to achieve the non-superstitious mind. Through the various different means of logicÂ—by realizing the emptiness of the produced and of inherent existenceÂ—we can avoid superstition and achieve the wisdom of shunyata. </blockquote>Commentary on "A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment"<br>Khunu Lama Rinpoche<br><a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/khunu/commentary.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/khunu/commentary.shtml</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

A coconut is hollowed out and<br>attached by a rope to a tree or stake in the ground. At the bottom of the<br>coconut a small slit is made and some sweet food is placed inside. The<br>hole on the bottom of the coconut is just big enough for the monkey to<br>slide in his open hand, but does not allow for a closed fist to passed out.<br>The monkey smells the sweets, reaches in with his hand to grasp the food<br>and is then unable to withdraw it. The clenched fist won't pass through<br>the opening. When the hunters come, the monkey becomes frantic but cannot<br>get away. There is no one keeping that monkey captive, except the force of<br>its own attachment. All that it has to do is to open the hand.
