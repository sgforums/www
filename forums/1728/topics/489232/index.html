              <p class="MsoNormal"><span class="date"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>July 17, 2015 Eagle Reporters </span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> German
                  Catholic Church has dragged Italian Footballer; Luca Toni to court over his
                  €1.7m income tax. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Luca Toni had played for German giants Bayern Munich
                  football club between 2007 and 2009 is presently facing Court cases for failing
                  to pay 8-9% income tax levied on all Catholics, Protestants and Jews faithful
                  living in Germany.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Church taxes are payable elsewhere in Europe. In
                  Italy, citizens choose which religious institution they wish to pay a
                  compulsory income tax of 0.8%. The tax can be paid to various institutions,
                  including Christian churches, Buddhist and Hindu unions or the Italian state.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The striker, who is a Catholic, is now suing the city
                  of Munich and his former tax advisors for compensation after claiming that he
                  was misled following his transfer to Munich from Italian side Fiorentina in
                  2007, German media reported.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The case highlights the religious levies operating in
                  Germany, which generate billions for religious institutions and have led to
                  waves of Christians renouncing their church membership in protest.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Toni, a World Cup winner in 2006, returned to Munich
                  yesterday for a second appeal hearing following a first appearance in the
                  regional High Court in March. However, yesterday’s hearing produced no
                  conclusive result and the case appears to have been kicked further down the
                  road.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bayern have supported their former player, now with
                  Serie A side Verona, who earned a monthly salary of €500,000 while with the
                  German champions. The striker reportedly earned a total of €43m during the
                  period when he was playing for Bayern.<br> The tax is a percentage of the income tax paid, so an tax bill of €100 would
                  result in a church tax of €8, bringing the total to €108.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Toni has said he was not given a description of the
                  documents he was signing by government authorities when he arrived in Munich in
                  2007.<br> “I did not know that you have to pay so much money to be Catholic here,” said
                  Toni, according to local newspaper Tageszeitung.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He added that he told his advisors to rush through the
                  process of signing the documents so he would be able to start playing. “I had
                  many documents laid in front of me, so I simply signed. We players talk about
                  everything, but not about taxes,” said Toni.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The religious levy was first introduced in the 19th
                  century to compensate for the nationalisation of religious property. According
                  to German law, anyone baptised as a child is automatically a member of the
                  church and is liable to pay the tax unless they make a formal renunciation of
                  their faith.</span></span></p>
