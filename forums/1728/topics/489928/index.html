                      heard daily. “In the mind of the public” is a phrase also used a great deal.</span></p>

                      still a mystery. The “I” who identifies himself as Charles is one of the
                      effects of being conscious, or of possession of consciousness, for “my”

Begin with the
                      simplest definition of consciousness: “the awareness of being aware.” Or, from
                      Funk and Wagnalls, “the awareness of oneself.” Descartes said it succinctly: <em>cogito,
                      ergo sum.</em> “I think, therefore I am.”</span></p>

You feel, or you think, that yourself and your
                      existence are “real.” Also, you “have consciousness” of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being</span>. These are
                      key ingredients of a conscious human mind.  </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif";    ' lang="EN">You know you live. You know you are mortal, you will one day die, if you
                      are an adult human. You know what you need to keep the body alive. These are
                      some parts of being human common to us all.</span></p>

You know the
                      fact of being in relationship with other people. Other humans reflect our
                      consciousness back to us.</span></p>

                      human that babies can die for lack of love. I can say from experience that I
                      feel a great difference in my being when I am in love and in a special
                      relationship with one person, and when I am not. The consciousness of being in
                      such a special “I love, and I am loved” relationship, is an ingredient of mind that
                      in my opinion affects many, many spheres of one’s life on a daily basis.</span></p>

                       How is a single self merged into a collective mind? Bees and ants have
                      hive minds; it is genetically programmed into those species, all of which
                      possess one queen ruling over the communication net that connects all the
                      members. For this, the human species has no analog. We are not telepathic. I
                      rather enjoy that fact.</span></p>

                      conscious or unconscious are two others. Drunken impairment is a state of
                      consciousness, being altered in one’s consciousness by a drug is another. These
                      are the easy words and phrases we use colloquially about being conscious. There
                      are no arguments about what the words mean.</span></p>

Now the ease of
                      understanding one another’s terms ends, when we start to compare and judge <em>levels</em> <em>of</em> <em>consciousness</em>. The masters of meditation in India have a
                      vocabulary for states of consciousness that is not employed nor understood in
                      Western neuroscience. This is a “grey area” for mind.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif";    ' lang="EN">It is commonplace to hear people judge one another’s consciousness levels,
                      as in, “what a huge ego that man has -- he’s not a very conscious person,” or
                      “imagine the level of consciousness in such a materialistic person.” Another
                      favourite polarity is “enlightened or not enlightened.” These comparisons are
                      merely a way of establishing hierarchy; these are not labels helpful to
                      understanding. (But the labels are a common type of commentary among people I
                      know in Nelson.) Such phrases are evidence of a vocabulary for understanding
                      that consciousness is a quality people have in different degrees. In poetic
                      language, some minds are like clay, some are like lightning; there is no
                      objective scale of measurement for describing the qualities of people’s minds,
                      because consciousness is not a synonym for intelligence and is not weighed in
                      IQ points. To judge another’s state by comparison with one’s own seems to me of
                      little worth.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-family: "Cambria","serif";    ' lang="EN">There is an enormous literature on the subject of states of consciousness
                      in the individual and in an entire society, and it is an important corpus of
                      research. Some thinkers hypothesize that a coherent, tight-knit society bound
                      together in a distinct culture and small geographic space, might be able to
                      manifest their political leadership and governing structures in a manner that
                      mass, urban, socially-stratified people cannot accomplish. That seems
                      intuitively sensible; perhaps ancient Celt or Israelite lords, American
                      aboriginals and their leaders, or Tibetans with their Buddhist lamas, have
                      ordered themselves in ways not accessible to Canadians in 2015. Therefore the relevance
                      of studies of those societies to my question about a Canadian public mind, and
                      its impact on choice of government in our electoral democracy, is not great.</span></p>

                      large body of writing about the human species evolving its consciousness over
                      long epochs of time, attempting to assign descriptive labels to the stages of
                      our consciousness in (pre)history. Primordial humans, hunter-gatherers, nomad
                      pastoralists, agriculturalists, urban dwellers, are assumed to have possessed
                      different kinds or stages of consciousness as their conditions of life and
                      subsistence were altered. I have written at more length about this in several
                      past columns, and named the foremost writers in the field: Ken Wilber, W. I.
                      Thompson., Jean Gebser, Aurobindo, Don Beck, J. Rifkin. T. de Chardin.</span></p>

                      historical discourse need to be noted, because they offer theories about what
                      makes a collective or mass possess some unity in the mentality or psychology of
                      the people of an historical period. The theories differ (each of the writers I
                      named above put forward different theories) but all of them are evidence that
                      scholarly observers of humanity possess a consensus: we can write and speak as
                      if “collective, mass consciousness” has a meaningful application.</span></p>

                      major tradition – The West, China, India, Islam, Judaism, pre-Columbian America
                      – there are categories for their peculiar consciousness. The West has a blend
                      of the Hellenic (Greco-Roman) and the Semitic (Abrahamic/Mesopotamian) mindsets
                      or mentalities, with large fractions from the Teutonic-Celtic northern world,
                      in its consciousness. It is a loosely-used phrase, and it is not exact in
                      meaning, yet the notion that there is a “Western consciousness” needs to be
                      noted.</span></p>

                      human mind with words like classical, medieval, modern, and post-modern, and
                      write books describing a “mind” of the Middle Ages, or the Victorian age, or
                      the age of the scientific revolution. Historians of ideas and culture, social
                      historians and historical sociologists, have a community of understanding about
                      public, mass, collective consciousness in a society: <strong>it</strong> <strong>exists</strong>.
                      The basic hypothesis for all such writers is that human societies can
                      meaningfully be said to possess within their culture, their civilization, an
                      encompassing collective mind among all.</span></p>

                      academic researchers and scientists, an enormously-significant factor in the
                      formation of human consciousness. The Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis is a prime example
                      of research in this field.</span></p>

                      would insist on adding that <em>social class</em> is extremely significant in
                      determining which type of consciousness any particular individual in a society
                      might possess. I am still sufficiently Marxian in my thinking about politics to
                      agree with the latter: there is one consciousness for the ruling strata of any
                      society, the elite culture, and another one underlying it among people who accept
                      the elite’s rule but have a different consciousness of politics.</span></p>

                      regard – and I have reason to know they are not – this type of  personal
                      consciousness will not have an impact on how Canadians choose governments. My

                      possible to over-do this perspective: “the over-examined life is not worth

                      affluent, educated, multicultural, pluralistic societies like Canada’s in 2015
                      are famously resistant to dissection into overarching narratives. There is no

                      about what describes our common humanity, however. It is an hypothesis about
                      our common <em>political</em> behaviour. It is an hypothesis about why we
                      manifest the people who will be our governors, how we accept the institutions
                      and laws we obey as legitimate, and the language we use to talk and think about
                      government. The hypothesized public mind of Canadians voters is a general
                      statement about our society, our economy, our culture and our ideology as
                      ingredients of “constructed reality.” A constructed reality is not the same as
                      the reality that materialist sciences (physics, chemistry, biology for example)
                      describe. It is the reality we make by a “contract” to understand things in the

                      Revolution, and the evolution of rationalism and utilitarianism as the dominant
                      modes of thinking about politics. That was the age of the Western

                      Life and liberty seem self-evident in meaning, but what is pursuit – not

                      Jefferson may not have meant to prescribe how to pursue happiness. In practice
                      it came to mean pursuit of security and comfort through material means, and by

                      supply of food and water for our needs; hungry years like the 1930’s will never
                      come again for Canada. We will always have the most-modern and scientific
                      methods of medicine, and we will always have access to enormous amounts of
                      information in our media and in our educational systems. We will always have

                      happiness” and “what does it profit a person who gains the world but loses
