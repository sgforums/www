              <p>My thoughts: would be helpful to some, but please learn the teachings of Buddhism first. If so called 'Buddhists' don't know what Buddhism is, of course 
              conversion will happen as one will be 'bought over'.</p>

              <p>Hey great contribution</p>
              <p>Sadhu, Sadhu, Sadhu!!!</p>
              <p>The scenario conversation was very real. I believe almost everyone has such an encounter in one way or another.</p>
              <p>I remember when I was at my ex-churchmate wedding, a active friend also tried to convert me. He said that his relative was also a Buddhist but in the end accept Christ etc. Hence I ask him, what make you think that he is a Buddhist? He reply because he take joss stick and pray to Guan Yin. So I ask him has he taken refuge in the triple gem. He was dumbfound. I told him, there are a lot of so called Buddhist out there who has the same misconception as you. I thank him and left the wedding.</p>
              <p>I think as a Buddhist, we should know our stuff well. Sometime due to profoundity of the Sutra sometimes we do not studies them with a dose of understanding. Whereas Christian are faithful in their Bible studies and interpretation (of course interpretation is sound within their circle).</p>
              <p>Beside, we need to care and keep a lookout for our Buddhist brethen. Being geniune interested in your bro's well being. Most of us goes to temple because we have unspoken needs. It can be family, social, spiritual and etc. As Buddha tender to the disciples who was down with boils. We need to learn to translate the Buddha teaching into care and concern action.</p>

              <p>i wonder if this is such a good idea... esp with the newspaper article, whether it wld polarise society further thru religion differences... anyway, the book shd focus on Buddhism itself, not on how to handle proselytising... if Buddhism knowledge is clearly known, then automatically conversion by others is not so easily done...</p>

              <p>The book compiled by the two Buddhist organisations is a good effort. We can complement such efforts by continuing to share with fellow Buddhists how we can be firm but yet cordial when being drawn into conversations with the purpose of religious conversion by others. What are some of those phrases we can say or use in certain scenarios? We cannot claim to cover all scenarios but if we continue to share, we will stand to benefit individually at our own pace, in collective and cumulative wisdom.</p>
              <p>When we share our own personal experiences of how we were firm but cordial when approached or challenged by members of other faith at any point in time, we are directly and indirectly providing good reference sources of behaviour to adopt or not to adopt for various life scenarios.</p>
              <p>No one can really say that his or her own experience is the only one that should be used (as circumstances vary from time to time), but that shouldn't stop us from sharing freely with those who really wish to know how to handle strong or subtle but very regular religious approaches by members of other faiths.</p>
