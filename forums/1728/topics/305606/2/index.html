              <p>Precisely so and well experienced!<br> <br> Non-dual brings u out of the mental loop, directly experiencing
              whatever touched, sensed, seen as IT.   Before perception
              intervenes, it is thoroughly experienced.  Non-dual eliminates
              the constant need of falling back to a source and see manifestation
              as source.<br>  <br> However in a practical world, there is no way we can avoid dirtying
              our hands and remain free from conceptualization; we have to face
              'thinking'.  It seems that whenever thinking steps in, the
              'sense of self' surfaces and division is again experienced. 
              The ‘background’, the ‘ultimate source’ will arise and there is no
              way of getting rid of this split for this is the nature of
              dualism.  Ever time we recall or think there will always be a
              division; the background, the source will surface.  And as
              long as our fundamental way of analyzing and thinking rest on a
              subject-object paradigm, there will always be a mismatched between
              non-dual experience and the 'views' for a non-dualist.<br> <br> Although non-dual insight eliminates the split between the observer
              and observed experientially, it does not dissolve the deeply rooted
              dualistic framework.  We continue to analyze and think and
              analyze using a subject/object dichotomy.  Even tough there is
              sufficient non-dual experiences, when attempting to orientate in
              terms of ‘views’, a non-dualist can still be confused himself and
              at times appears incoherent.  This is the de-synchronization
              between views and meditative experiences.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate
              ourselves non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of
              Emptiness.  It is a raft but it is the antidote for the
              conventional mind to orientate itself in a non-dual and non-local
              context.  It also led to the amazing insight that ‘duality’ is
              really the result of seeing and taking things ‘inherently’ (You may
              want to the take up the challenge of re-engaging in thoughts
              penetrating this viewless view of Emptiness and thoroughly
              understand how this affect us into seeing things
              dualistically  ).<br> <br> At present, we experience our world through the lens of seeing
              things as existing dualistically and inherently.  We deeply
              believe that entity possesses certain form of attributes. 
              Deep in us we believe that ‘redness’ belongs to the flower and
              ‘blueness’ belongs to the sky.  We were trained to see things
              not only dualistically but also objects consisting of attributes
              and functions.  But in truth, there is no such ‘redness’ that
              belongs to the ‘flower’.  There is no the ‘redness’ outside,
              nor inside us.  There is no properties 'inherently' attached
              or attributed to any objects. The formation of the 'center' and the
              tendency to grasp is not just the problem of seeing things
              'dualistically' but also 'inherently'.  When we see in this
              way, all 'letting go' are mere illusions; For we are really
              'holding' in our deep most consciousness and so the letting go' is
              only superficial.  When we see things inherently, whatever
              state, whatever experience, no matter how profound, how blissful,
              how vivid, how mystical, will be objectify into an object for
              seeking; the tendency operates subtly.  It is similar to how
              the experience of the Source "I AM" is distorted and later non-dual
              insight that sees the fundamental problem of the source.<br> <br> Lastly, as stated in the Bahiya Sutta,<br> <br> In seeing, (there is always) just the seen.<br> In hearing, (there is always) just sound.<br> <br> The seen, sound are the non-dual luminous experience; but direct
              experience of non-dual luminosity is not suffcient.  Though
              perfectly clear and vividly present as in non-dual experience, the
              'seen' is radically different from the 'sound' -- this is its
              emptiness nature.  This viewless view must be fused into our
              non-dual insight.  When views are firmly established and
              non-dual experience thoroughly authenticated, a practitioner will
              see everything as Awareness without conflict in both views and
              experiences.  Not bounded within an inherent and dualistic
              paradigm, he will not be confused.  When the real cause and
              the empty nature of our pristine awareness are understood, this
              ‘Emptiness’ view too must be discarded.<br> <br> Happy CNY!</p>

              <p>The reply to Longchen may sound confusing but it is a reflection of the journey I have gone through. <br><br>After
                  the experience of anatta, there is a period of desync between what
                  experienced and the existing paradigm we used to orientate the world.
                  That is, a practitioner will find great difficulties when trying to
                  express the experience based on a subject/object dichotomy. It can be
                  quite frustrating and the practitioner may get himself confused during
                  the process.<br><br>It is not uncommon to find practitioners totally
                  giving up this attempt to synchronize "views" and experience and
                  conclude that it is an absolute futile endeavor to do that. They prefer
                  to rest fully in naked awareness.<br><br>By doing so, the practitioner will miss something valuable -- the insight of the importance of "non inherent existence". <br><br>In
                  fact, dualistic view is merely a subset of seeing things 'inherently'.
                  Further understanding will also reveal that the bad habit of
                  'searching' is the result of seeing things 'inherently'. Our inability
                  to sustain a non-dual experience is also the result of it. The
                  formation of a 'center' that we are so unwilling to give up is merely a
                  natural phenomenon of our deeply held 'inherent' views.<br><br>When the
                  view and experience are harmonized, the practitioner can then progress
                  further. He rest neither in concepts nor non-conceptuality. He frees
                  himself from erroneous views like "I am You and You are me". He sees
                  “Everything as Awareness” but that is because in the world of Empty
                  Luminosity, the practitioner is not bounded in a subject/object or
                  object/attributes paradigm. “Awareness as Everything” should never be
                  understood from a dualistic perspective. <br><br>Lastly whatever said is really “already is”.<br><em><br>In seeing, there is always only the seen.  In hearing there is always only the sound.  Never was there a seer or hearer.<br></em><br>All “already is”.  Anatta is truly a seal.  How amazing! <br><br>Homage to Buddha. <br><br>PS: Modified a lil from Bahiya Sutta</p>

              <p>Precisely so and well experienced!<br> <br> Non-dual brings u out of the mental loop, directly experiencing
                  whatever touched, sensed, seen as IT.   Before perception
                  intervenes, it is thoroughly experienced.  Non-dual eliminates
                  the constant need of falling back to a source and see manifestation
                  as source.<br>  <br> However in a practical world, there is no way we can avoid dirtying
                  our hands and remain free from conceptualization; we have to face
                  'thinking'.  It seems that whenever thinking steps in, the
                  'sense of self' surfaces and division is again experienced. 
                  The ‘background’, the ‘ultimate source’ will arise and there is no
                  way of getting rid of this split for this is the nature of
                  dualism.  Ever time we recall or think there will always be a
                  division; the background, the source will surface.  And as
                  long as our fundamental way of analyzing and thinking rest on a
                  subject-object paradigm, there will always be a mismatched between
                  non-dual experience and the 'views' for a non-dualist.<br> <br> Although non-dual insight eliminates the split between the observer
                  and observed experientially, it does not dissolve the deeply rooted
                  dualistic framework.  We continue to analyze and think and
                  analyze using a subject/object dichotomy.  Even tough there is
                  sufficient non-dual experiences, when attempting to orientate in
                  terms of ‘views’, a non-dualist can still be confused himself and
                  at times appears incoherent.  This is the de-synchronization
                  between views and meditative experiences.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate
                  ourselves non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of
                  Emptiness.  It is a raft but it is the antidote for the
                  conventional mind to orientate itself in a non-dual and non-local
                  context.  It also led to the amazing insight that ‘duality’ is
                  really the result of seeing and taking things ‘inherently’ (You may
                  want to the take up the challenge of re-engaging in thoughts
                  penetrating this viewless view of Emptiness and thoroughly
                  understand how this affect us into seeing things
                  dualistically  ).<br> <br> At present, we experience our world through the lens of seeing
                  things as existing dualistically and inherently.  We deeply
                  believe that entity possesses certain form of attributes. 
                  Deep in us we believe that ‘redness’ belongs to the flower and
                  ‘blueness’ belongs to the sky.  We were trained to see things
                  not only dualistically but also objects consisting of attributes
                  and functions.  But in truth, there is no such ‘redness’ that
                  belongs to the ‘flower’.  There is no the ‘redness’ outside,
                  nor inside us.  There is no properties 'inherently' attached
                  or attributed to any objects. The formation of the 'center' and the
                  tendency to grasp is not just the problem of seeing things
                  'dualistically' but also 'inherently'.  When we see in this
                  way, all 'letting go' are mere illusions; For we are really
                  'holding' in our deep most consciousness and so the letting go' is
                  only superficial.  When we see things inherently, whatever
                  state, whatever experience, no matter how profound, how blissful,
                  how vivid, how mystical, will be objectify into an object for
                  seeking; the tendency operates subtly.  It is similar to how
                  the experience of the Source "I AM" is distorted and later non-dual
                  insight that sees the fundamental problem of the source.<br> <br> Lastly, as stated in the Bahiya Sutta,<br> <br> In seeing, (there is always) just the seen.<br> In hearing, (there is always) just sound.<br> <br> The seen, sound are the non-dual luminous experience; but direct
                  experience of non-dual luminosity is not suffcient.  Though
                  perfectly clear and vividly present as in non-dual experience, the
                  'seen' is radically different from the 'sound' -- this is its
                  emptiness nature.  This viewless view must be fused into our
                  non-dual insight.  When views are firmly established and
                  non-dual experience thoroughly authenticated, a practitioner will
                  see everything as Awareness without conflict in both views and
                  experiences.  Not bounded within an inherent and dualistic
                  paradigm, he will not be confused.  When the real cause and
                  the empty nature of our pristine awareness are understood, this
                  ‘Emptiness’ view too must be discarded.<br> <br> Happy CNY!</p>

              <p>Tashi Delek! I hope that for you everything is filled with 
                          auspiciousness, happiness, and excellence. To meet you all here makes 
                          me very happy. Gyatrul Rinpoche is a great friend of mine and I have heard 
                          a lot about his monastery here. Today, to actually come and be able to 
                          see it, to see what a secluded and beautiful place it is, makes me very 
                          happy.<br> <br> I would like to explain to you a supplication that was composed by Guru 
                          Rinpoche, a supplication that all thoughts be self-liberated. Guru Rinpoche 
                          composed seven chapters of supplications for students to recite to him, 
                          and this one comes from a chapter that he taught to the monk whose name 
                          was Namkha'i Nyingpo.<br> <br> Before listening to this teaching, please give rise to the supreme motivation 
                          of bodhichitta. When we give rise to bodhichitta, it means that for the 
                          benefit of all sentient beings, limitless in number as the sky is vast 
                          in its extent, we aim to bring our love and compassion to their ultimate 
                          perfection, and to bring our wisdom realizing emptiness to its ultimate 
                          perfection. We know that in order to do this we must listen to, reflect 
                          upon and meditate on the teachings of the genuine Dharma with all the 
                          enthusiasm we can muster in our hearts.<br> <br> The first verse of the supplication<sup>1</sup> is:<br> <br> <em>All these forms that appear to eyes that see,<br> All things on the outside and the inside,<br> The environment and its inhabitants<br> Appear, but let them rest where no self's found;<br> Perceiver and perceived when purified<br> Are the body of the deity, clear emptiness—<br> To the guru for whom desire frees itself,<br> To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.</em><br> <br> What appears to the eyes are forms, which are made up of shapes and colors. 
                          Everything that is a shape and color is included in the source of consciousness 
                          (Sanskrit: <em>ayatana</em>) that is called form. The shapes and colors 
                          that appear to the eyes are found in all of the aspects of the environment 
                          in which we live, as well as in all of the sentient beings who inhabit 
                          this environment. What is the true nature of the appearances of shapes 
                          and colors of the environment and sentient beings? It is that they are 
                          dependently arisen mere appearances, which do not exist in essence. The 
                          forms that appear do not truly exist. In the abiding nature of reality, 
                          their nature is emptiness. They appear while being empty; while empty, 
                          they appear. They are appearance-emptiness like rainbows, water-moons, 
                          and reflections. All of the objects that appear to the eyes are appearance-emptiness 
                          undifferentiable.<br> <br> As the protector Nagarjuna writes in his <em>Fundamental Wisdom of the 
                          Middle Way</em><sup>2</sup>:<br> <br> <em>Like a dream, like an illusion<br> Like a city of gandharvas, <br> That's how birth, and that's how living,<br> That's how dying are taught to be.</em><br> <br> The meaning of this verse and the one from Guru Rinpoche's supplication 
                          are exactly the same.<br> <br> This is the actual way forms are. They are appearance-emptiness undifferentiable, 
                          but sentient beings do not see this because they think things truly exist, 
                          and their thoughts that cling to the true existence of appearances obscure 
                          the appearance-emptiness that is their true nature. That is why we practice 
                          the Dharma—to cleanse ourselves of this clinging to appearances 
                          as truly existent so that we can realize appearances' true nature is appearance-emptiness 
                          undifferentiable.<br> <br> It is like when you dream and you do not know that you are dreaming. The 
                          appearances in the dream are appearance-emptiness, but your thought that 
                          they truly exist prevents you from seeing that. Even though the dream 
                          appearances are appearance-emptiness and have no inherent nature, they 
                          seem to be real when you do not know that you are dreaming. You think 
                          that they are real and you have experiences that seem to confirm your 
                          belief that they are real.<br> <br> But however much you cling to the appearances in a dream, that does not 
                          change what the appearances are from their own side. The essential nature 
                          of these appearances is unchanging appearance-emptiness. It never moves 
                          from being just that. When you dream and you know you are dreaming, you 
                          are free of the thoughts that fixate on the appearances as being truly 
                          existent. You are free from that obscuration so you can experience the 
                          appearances just as they are: as appearance-emptiness. That enables you 
                          to do wonderful things like fly in the sky, move unobstructedly through 
                          rock mountains, and travel to pure realms. All that is possible when you 
                          recognize a dream for what it is, and in that way, not be blocked by thinking 
                          that the appearances truly exist.<br> <br> In our waking life, even though the environment and sentient beings appear 
                          to us, the supplication says "let them rest where no self's found." 
                          The environment and sentient beings appear, but let them rest without 
                          clinging to them as truly existent. Let them rest in their natural state 
                          of appearance-emptiness without fixating on them as being real. When we 
                          let the appearances rest without fixating on them as being real, all of 
                          the thoughts of there being an actual object out there to perceive and 
                          an actual distinct subject perceiving it just dissolve. The thoughts that 
                          take the duality of perceived object and perceiving subject to be real 
                          dissolve. They are purified.<br> <br> When that happens, everything shines as luminous emptiness, clarity-emptiness. 
                          At this point, you are ready to meditate on the deity, because the deity's 
                          enlightened body is also appearance-emptiness. It appears while it is 
                          empty; it is empty while it appears—it is like a rainbow. When you 
                          meditate on the deity, everything appears as the body of the deity—appearance-emptiness.<br> <br> When all of the appearances of the physical environment shine as the appearance-emptiness 
                          immeasurable palace of the deity, and all the sentient beings in the environment 
                          shine as the appearance-emptiness enlightened bodies of the deities themselves, 
                          then all desire is free in its own place. It is self-liberated. Thoughts 
                          of desire do not come from anywhere and they do not go anywhere. They 
                          do not arise, so they do not cease. Since they are free from coming and 
                          going, and free from arising and ceasing, thoughts of desire are self-liberated. 
                          For this reason the verse says, "To the guru for whom desire frees 
                          itself, To Orgyen Pema Jungnay, I supplicate."<br> <br> The second verse of the supplication is:<br> <br> <em>All these sounds that appear for ears that hear,<br> Taken as agreeable or not,<br> Let them rest in the realm of sound and emptiness<br> Past all thought, beyond imagination;<br> Sounds are empty, unarisen and unceasing,<br> These are what make up the Victor's teaching—<br> To the teachings of the Victor, sound and emptiness,<br> To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.<br> </em><br> What appear to the ears are sounds. What is the nature of this source 
                          of consciousness that is sound? In fact, the sounds we hear are like sounds 
                          in a dream. Their basic nature is that they are always appearance-emptiness—they 
                          appear while being empty, and while being empty they appear.<br> <br> The two main kinds of sounds we hear are those that we find pleasing and 
                          those we do not. Both kinds of sounds, however, are equally appearance-emptiness, 
                          sound-emptiness, just as the sounds in a dream are sound-emptiness. If 
                          we know this and meditate on the mandala of the deities, then all sounds 
                          manifest as the natural sounds of the deity's mantra: sound and emptiness.<br> <br> From among the eight worldly dharmas,<sup>3</sup> four of them are related 
                          to sound—sounds that are pleasing, sounds that are displeasing, 
                          sounds of praise, and sounds of criticism. We need to give up attachment 
                          to the eight worldly dharmas—the four that we like and the four 
                          that we do not. To do that, we can see that we need to realize that sounds 
                          are sound-emptiness. Then we will not be attached to sounds that are pleasant 
                          and sounds of praise, and we will not be averse to sounds of criticism 
                          and unpleasant sounds.<br> <br> In a dream, all sounds of praise and all sounds of criticism, all sounds 
                          we like and all sounds we do not, are equally sound-emptiness. They have 
                          no inherent nature at all. But when we do not know that we are dreaming, 
                          we think these sounds truly exist, and we have experiences of happiness 
                          and suffering based on sounds of praise and blame, sounds that we like, 
                          and sounds that we do not; all because we do not recognize sounds' basic 
                          nature is sound-emptiness. Guru Rinpoche instructs: "Let them rest 
                          in the realm of sound and emptiness/Past all thought, beyond imagination." 
                          This is an instruction to rest free of clinging to sounds as being truly 
                          existent, free of clinging to them as being real. In their basic nature 
                          that is sound and emptiness, just let go and relax. Settle into your own 
                          basic nature within the nature of sound that is sound and emptiness. <br> <br> Since the enlightened body of the Buddha is appearance-emptiness, then 
                          the sound of the Buddha's speech is also emptiness. It is sound-emptiness 
                          undifferentiable. When you know that all sound lacks inherent nature in 
                          the same way, then all sound is like the sound of the Buddha's teachings 
                          and all sound manifests as the resonance-emptiness sound of the Buddha's 
                          speech. The last line of the supplication reads, "To Orgyen Pema 
                          Jungnay I supplicate." Here Orgyen Pema Jungnay represents the Buddha's 
                          speech that is the sound-emptiness abiding reality of all the sound there 
                          is. To this Orgyen Pema Jungnay, we supplicate.<br> <br> At the beginning of this twenty-first century, everywhere we go there 
                          are radios playing, tape recorders playing, the sound of movies and televisions—the 
                          world is filled with sound. At this time, then, it is quite important 
                          to know that all sounds have no inherent nature. They are sound-emptiness. 
                          These days, moment by moment, sounds can be carried across the globe and 
                          change so many people's feelings all at once—from happiness to suffering, 
                          from suffering to happiness. Just on the basis of hearing a few sounds, 
                          millions of people's feelings can change. Also these days it is easy to 
                          realize that sounds are sound-emptiness, because if you pick up the phone 
                          in America at noon and you call somebody in another country, then for 
                          some people it will be midnight, and for some people in other countries 
                          it will be morning. So at what time is this sound really being made? In 
                          this way, we can easily recognize sound-emptiness. If somebody in America 
                          calls someone in India and talks to them on the phone, in America it is 
                          noon, in India it is midnight. A daytime mouth is talking to a nighttime 
                          ear—at the same time! If sounds were truly existent, that would 
                          be impossible. It would be a contradiction for sound made during the day 
                          to be heard simultaneously at night. But it is not a contradiction when 
                          we know that it is just sound-emptiness. Thinking about things in this 
                          way, during these times it is much easier to understand how sound is sound-emptiness.<br> <br> Also, these days a famous person can give a speech that is broadcast all 
                          over the world. The people who like that person will hear that speech 
                          as something very pleasant and beautiful. The people who do not like that 
                          person will find it repulsive to listen to. The people who have no opinion 
                          do not have any reaction to that sound one way or the other. If we ask, 
                          "What is that sound, really? Is it good or bad?" again we see 
                          that the true nature of sound is inexpressible. These days, sounds beam 
                          down from empty space. They come from empty buildings and even empty cars. 
                          It is important for us to be able to examine these sounds and their sources 
                          to see that they are sound-emptiness, because most of the suffering we 
                          experience comes from hearing sounds. We need to train in the understanding 
                          of sound as it is taught in the Middle Way, which is that in genuine reality, 
                          sounds are empty of any essence. In apparent reality, they are dependently 
                          arisen mere appearances.<br> <br> As the glorious Chandrakirti wrote,<br> <br> <em>Things do not arise causelessly, nor from Ishvara,<br> Nor from self, nor other, nor both;<br> Therefore, it is clear that things arise<br> Perfectly in dependence upon their causes and conditions.</em><br> <br> Things do not arise from any of the four possible extremes: from self, 
                          other, both or without cause, and there's no fifth possibility. Therefore, 
                          things do not truly arise—they do not come into existence; they 
                          do not actually happen. Then what is the appearance of them happening? 
                          It is just like the appearance of things happening in a dream; like the 
                          appearance of a moon shining on a pool of water; and like the appearance 
                          of an illusion. It is dependently arisen mere appearance. In this way, 
                          since sounds do not exist in genuine reality, and since in relative reality 
                          they are just dependently arisen mere appearances, all sounds are simply 
                          sound-emptiness. When you recite mantras, then mantras are also sound-emptiness.<br> <br> We supplicate Guru Rinpoche at the end of the verse, because even though 
                          we know that sounds are sound and emptiness, we are obscured from realizing 
                          that directly by our thoughts that cling to sounds as being truly existent. 
                          We supplicate for Guru Rinpoche's blessing so that these thoughts that 
                          sounds truly exist may dissolve, and when they dissolve, that we will 
                          recognize the true nature of sound is sound-emptiness.<br> <br> The third verse of the supplication is:<br> <br> <em>All these movements of mind towards its objects,<br> These thoughts that make five poisons and afflictions,<br> Leave thinking mind to rest without contrivances,<br> Do not review the past nor guess the future;<br> If you let such movement rest in its own place,<br> It liberates into the dharmakaya—<br> To the guru for whom awareness frees itself,<br> To Orgyen Pema Jungnay I supplicate.<br> </em><br> For ordinary beings, mind is discursive. It moves. It moves towards objects. 
                          It moves towards the three times. It is constantly thinking about one 
                          thing or another. Mind is moved by thoughts of the five poisons. When 
                          mind encounters an object it likes, it moves towards that object with 
                          thoughts of attachment. When mind encounters an object it does not like, 
                          it moves towards that object with thoughts of aversion, thoughts of anger. 
                          When mind judges something incorrectly, it moves towards that object with 
                          bewilderment. When one's mind believes that one has qualities that one 
                          does not have, it moves towards oneself with thoughts of arrogance. When 
                          mind looks at somebody else and sees things that it does not have, it 
                          moves towards that person with thoughts of jealously. In this way, thoughts 
                          of the five poisons constantly move the mind. "Leave thinking mind 
                          to rest without contrivances." When thoughts of the five poisons 
                          are moving the mind, just let mind rest without trying to fix anything, 
                          without trying to change anything, without reviewing the past <em>kleshas</em> (disturbing mental states) or wondering what happened to them; and without 
                          anticipating what types of disturbing states of mind one might experience 
                          in the future. Do not review the past, do not guess the future. Just let 
                          mind relax as it is right now.<br> <br> We do not need to try to prevent thoughts of desire from arising. We do 
                          not need to try to stop thoughts of anger or jealously once they have 
                          arisen. Do not try to prevent anything; do not try to stop or change anything; 
                          just simply do not take any of those movements of mind to be truly existent. 
                          That is the instruction because we could not stop the thoughts of the 
                          five poisons from arising, even if we wanted to! We could not do that, 
                          but we do not have to. All we have to do is recognize that these thoughts 
                          lack any essence.<br> <br> How do we do this? Whatever thought arises, look straight at it with your 
                          eye of wisdom and settle into its basic nature. When you do that, all 
                          thoughts and all disturbing states of mind are liberated within the dharmakaya. 
                          They are self-liberated. The whole collection of thoughts is free just 
                          as it is. This is awareness, and this awareness is awareness-emptiness. 
                          Since this awareness-emptiness is pure in nature, whatever obscurations 
                          there may be have no essence. Awareness itself is self-liberated. It is 
                          free just as it is.<br> <br> Then we supplicate the guru whose awareness is self-liberated. This is 
                          Guru Rinpoche. For Guru Rinpoche, awareness frees itself. We supplicate 
                          you Orgyen Pema Jungnay for your blessings so that we may realize, as 
                          you do, the self-liberation of awareness.<br> <br> The Lord of Yogis Milarepa sang in his vajra song of realization called 
                          "The Three Nails"<sup>4</sup>:<br> <br> <em>To describe the nails of meditation, the three<br> All thoughts in being dharmakaya are free<br> Awareness is luminous, in its depths is bliss<br> And resting without contrivance is equipoise</em><br> <br> All thoughts are dharmakaya in their nature. Thoughts are free all by 
                          themselves, without having to do anything to them, stop them, or change 
                          them in any way. They are naturally dharmakaya. What is dharmakaya like? 
                          It is luminous. It is awareness. It is bliss. How do we experience this 
                          dharmakaya in meditation? Rest without contrivance. Rest without artifice. 
                          This is equipoise. This is the experience of dharmakaya. The verses of 
                          Milarepa and Guru Rinpoche have the same meaning.<br> <br> What is awareness-emptiness like? Milarepa described it in the following 
                          way in the song "The Ten Things it is Like"<sup>5</sup>:<br> <em><br> When you know the true nature of everything to be known<br> The wisdom that's aware of the true nature's like a cloud-free sky</em><br> <br> With these two lines, Milarepa tells us the emptiness aspect of awareness 
                          is like the sky completely free of clouds. Then he sings:<br> <br> <em>When the mud settles down and mind's river is crystal clear<br> Self-arisen awareness is like a polished mirror's shine</em><br> <br> Milarepa illustrates the luminous, bright, vivid aspect of awareness with 
                          the example of a perfectly polished mirror's sparkling shine. In this 
                          way, we see what emptiness is like, we see what awareness is like, and 
                          then we can understand that the two are undifferentiable.<br> <br> The great pandit Shakya Chokden described the noble Asanga's explanation 
                          of genuine reality as follows:<br> <br> <em>Clarity-emptiness, mere awareness, empty of the duality of perceived 
                          and<br>      perceiver is all phenomena's abiding reality.<br> Knowing this and combining it with a limitless accumulation of merit, 
                          the <br>      spontaneously present three kayas will manifest.<br> This is Asanga's tradition.</em><br> <br> In this way, Asanga presents the true nature of reality of all phenomena 
                          as nondual luminous emptiness, nondual awareness-emptiness. The explanation 
                          that the true nature of reality is emptiness beyond all concept of what 
                          it might be is the presentation of the Middle Way Consequence School (<em>Prasangika 
                          Madhyamaka</em>). The presentation of the true nature of reality as awareness-emptiness, 
                          luminous clarity, is the presentation of the <em>Shentong Madhyamaka</em>, 
                          the Empty of Other Middle Way School, and also the presentation of the 
                          Mahamudra and Dzogchen traditions. What does the term "empty of other" 
                          or <em>shentong</em> mean? This is described in the text called the <em>Gyu 
                          Lama</em>, the <em>Treatise on Buddha Nature:</em><br> <br> <em>The element is empty of that which is separable from it, all fleeting 
                          stains.<br> But it is not empty of that which is inseparable from it, its own unsurpassable 
                          qualities.</em><br> <br> "Empty of other" means that the buddha nature, the true nature 
                          of mind, luminous clarity, awareness, is empty of that which is different 
                          from it: stains and flaws. It is empty of those. But it is not empty of 
                          the spontaneously present qualities, the naturally present qualities of 
                          enlightenment. These unsurpassable qualities are totally inseparable from 
                          the true nature of mind.<br> <br> In short, this supplication is a supplication that we will manifest our 
                          own basic nature. We supplicate the guru to bless us so that we can manifest 
                          the awareness-emptiness that is the true nature of mind. It is a supplication 
                          that all appearances will be self-liberated as the enlightened body of 
                          the deity, all sounds will be self-liberated as the enlightened speech 
                          of the deity, and all thoughts will be self-liberated as essential reality 
                          itself.<br> <br> The last verse of the supplication sums it all up:<br> <br> <em>Grant your blessing that purifies appearance <br> Of objects perceived as being outside;<br> Grant your blessing that liberates perceiving mind,<br> The mental operation seeming inside;<br> Grant your blessing that between the two of these<br> Clear light will come to recognize its own face;<br> In your compassion, sugatas of all three times,<br> Please bless me that a mind like mine be freed.</em><br> <br> Grant your blessings that all clinging to objects on the outside as truly 
                          existent will be self-liberated. Grant your blessings that all thoughts 
                          on the inside will be self-liberated. Grant your blessings that in between, 
                          luminous clarity, Dzogchen, will recognize its own face. In your compassion, 
                          realized buddhas of all three times, grant your blessings that I and all 
                          sentient beings may be freed from clinging to characteristics. Grant your 
                          blessings that I and all sentient beings may be freed from the bondage 
                          of samsara. Grant your blessings that I and all sentient beings may be 
                          freed from the bondage of believing that duality truly exists. Grant your 
                          blessing that all of our concepts of duality will be self-liberated.<br> <br> My departing prayer is that Gyatrul Rinpoche be healthy, that he live 
                          a long life, and that his activity for the benefit of all sentient beings 
                          flourish. And I pray that all of you, his students, bring your activities 
                          of listening to, reflecting on and meditating on the teachings of the 
                          genuine Dharma to their perfection and that, through this, you are of 
                          great benefit to all of the limitless number of sentient beings. And especially

              <p>Make appropriate analysis but not add anything 'extra'. If let's say you have a prejudiced mindset that a certain group of people are stupid, or have some bad qualities, then that is being conditioned. You should make judgement only based on their perfomance, abilities, and not be conditioned by certain beliefs.</p>

              <p>Learn proper Buddhist meditations. And do not seek some special experiences.</p>
              <p>The purpose of Buddhist meditation is not to induce special experiences, there are lots of "special experiences" that may be experienced but they are all side effects -- out of body experiences, seeing visions, etc.  Even memories of past lives. One should never be mesmerised by them.</p>
              <p>The purpose of meditation is to develope calmness and insights. Through the practice of meditation we become more aware of our mind and the nature of our mind, or the nature of reality.</p>
              <p>"Awareness" is the most important element in Buddhist meditations. Buddhist meditation does not just tell you to concentrate, that is not what Buddhist meditation is about. As I posted earlier, something by my master:</p>

              <p>And something by Venerable Gunaratana:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe1-4.html<br> <br> Within the Judeo-Christian tradition we find two overlapping 
                                        practices called prayer and contemplation. Prayer is a direct 
                                        address to some spiritual entity. Contemplation in a prolonged 
                                        period of conscious thought about some specific topic, usually 
                                        a religious ideal or scriptural passage. From the standpoint 
                                        of mental culture, both of these activities are exercises in 
                                        concentration. The normal deluge of conscious thought is restricted, 
                                        and the mind is brought to one conscious area of operation. 
                                        The results are those you find in any concentrative practice: 
                                        deep calm, a physiological slowing of the metabolism and a sense 
                                        of peace and well-being.<br> <br> Out of the Hindu tradition comes Yogic meditation, which is 
                                        also purely concentrative. The traditional basic exercises consist 
                                        of focusing the mind on a single object a stone, a candle flame, 
                                        a syllable or whatever, and not allowing it to wander. Having 
                                        acquired the basic skill, the Yogi proceeds to expand his practice 
                                        by taking on more complex objects of meditation chants, colorful 
                                        religious images, energy channels in the body and so forth. 
                                        Still, no matter how complex the object of meditation, the meditation 
                                        itself remains purely an exercise in concentration.<br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Within the Buddhist tradition, concentration is also highly 
                                        valued. But a new element is added and more highly stressed. 
                                        That element is awareness. All Buddhist meditation aims at the 
                                        development of awareness, using concentration as a tool. </span></strong></span>The 
                                        Buddhist tradition is very wide, however, and there are several 
                                        diverse routes to this goal. Zen meditation uses two separate 
                                        tacks. The first is the direct plunge into awareness by sheer 
                                        force of will. You sit down and you just sit, meaning that you 
                                        toss out of your mind everything except pure awareness of sitting. 
                                        This sounds very simple. It is not. A brief trial will demonstrate 
                                        just how difficult it really is. The second Zen approach used 
                                        in the Rinzai school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious 
                                        thought and into pure awareness. This is done by giving the 
                                        student an unsolvable riddle which he must solve anyway, and 
                                        by placing him in a horrendous training situation. Since he 
                                        cannot flee from the pain of the situation, he must flee into 
                                        a pure experience of the moment. There is nowhere else to go. 
                                        Zen is tough. It is effective for many people, but it is really 
                                        tough.<br> <br> Another stratagem, Tantric Buddhism, is nearly the reverse. 
                                        Conscious thought, at least the way we usually do it, is the 
                                        manifestation of ego, the you that you usually think that you 
                                        are. Conscious thought is tightly connected with self-concept. 
                                        The self-concept or ego is nothing more than a set of reactions 
                                        and mental images which are artificially pasted to the flowing 
                                        process of pure awareness. Tantra seeks to obtain pure awareness 
                                        by destroying this ego image. This is accomplished by a process 
                                        of visualization. The student is given a particular religious 
                                        image to meditate upon, for example, one of the deities from 
                                        the Tantric pantheon. He does this in so thorough a fashion 
                                        that he becomes that entity. He takes off his own identity and 
                                        puts on another. This takes a while, as you might imagine, but 
                                        it works. During the process, he is able to watch the way that 
                                        the ego is constructed and put in place. He comes to recognize 
                                        the arbitrary nature of all egos, including his own, and he 
                                        escapes from bondage to the ego. He is left in a state where 
                                        he may have an ego if he so chooses, either his own or whichever 
                                        other he might wish, or he can do without one. Result: pure 
                                        awareness. Tantra is not exactly a game of patty cake either.<br> <br> Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. The 
                                        method comes directly from the Sitipatthana Sutta, a discourse 
                                        attributed to Buddha himself. Vipassana is a direct and gradual 
                                        cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by 
                                        piece over a period of years. The student's attention is carefully 
                                        directed to an intense examination of certain aspects of his 
                                        own existence. The meditator is trained to notice more and more 
                                        of his own flowing life experience. Vipassana is a gentle technique. 
                                        But it also is very , very thorough. It is an ancient and codified 
                                        system of sensitivity training, a set of exercises dedicated 
                                        to becoming more and more receptive to your own life experience. 
                                        It is attentive listening, total seeing and careful testing. 
                                        We learn to smell acutely, to touch fully and really pay attention 
                                        to what we feel. We learn to listen to our own thoughts without 
                                        being caught up in them.<br> <br> The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to pay attention. 
                                        We think we are doing this already, but that is an illusion. 
                                        It comes from the fact that we are paying so little attention 
                                        to the ongoing surge of our own life experiences that we might 
                                        just as well be asleep. We are simply not paying enough attention 
                                        to notice that we are not paying attention. It is another Catch-22. </span></p>

                                      gradually reveal itself, and all its qualities are uncovered. This
                                      is Vipassyana practise... Vipassyana...is to see clearly, to have
                                      insight into mind's nature and clear vision of its basic state.<br> <br> ...there are differences between the approaches of Shamatha and
                                      Vipassyana. Shamatha uses an object or reference, although a subtle
                                      one, upon which the mind meditates; a dualistic relationship is
                                      established between the mind and its object. In Vipassyana,
                                      however, mind and object are essentially one, not two, and remain
                                      this way.<br> <br> ...In Vipassyana, many thoughts go through the mind, but they are
                                      niether suppressed or followed. They arise and pass away without
                                      our having to interfere..Vipassyana...consists of letting go of
                                      thoughts, letting them be pacified and liberated by them

              <p>Some more about the difference between Samatha/Shamatha
                                      (Concentration) and Vipassana/Vipasshyana (Insight):<br> <br> ...There is a lot of confusion on the differences between
                                      concentration practices and insight practices. This may be caused
                                      in part by the Â“Mushroom Factor,Â” or may be due in part to other
                                      factors, such as concentration practice being easier than insight
                                      practices and distinctly more pleasant most of the time.
                                      Concentration practices (samatha or samadhi practices) are
                                      meditation on a concept, an aggregate of many transient sensations,
                                      whereas insight practice is meditation on the many transient
                                      sensations just as they are. When doing concentration practices,
                                      one purposefully tries to fix or freeze the mind in a specific
                                      state, called an Â“absorption,Â” Â“jhanaÂ” or Â“dyana.Â” While reality
                                      cannot be frozen in this way, the illusion of solidity and
                                      stability certainly can be cultivated, and this is concentration
                                      practice.<br> <br> Insight practices are designed to penetrate the Three Illusions of
                                      permanence, satisfactoriness and separate self so as to attain
                                      freedom. (N.B., the illusion of satisfactoriness has to do with the
                                      false sense that continuing to mentally create the illusion of a
                                      separate, permanent self will be satisfactory or helpful, and is
                                      not referring to some oppressive and fun-denying angst trip).
                                      Insight practices (various types of vipassana, dzogchen, zazen,
                                      etc.) lead to the progressive stages of the progress of insight.
                                      Insight practices tend to be difficult and somewhat disconcerting,
                                      as they are designed to deconstruct our deluded and much cherished
                                      views of the world and ourselves, though they can sometimes be
                                      outrageously blissful for frustratingly short periods....<br> <br> ~ Dharma Dan</p>

              <h3 class="h4">Difference in Terms of Reflexive Deep Awareness <br></h3>
              <ul>
              <li>The non-dzogchen systems, particularly Gelug, differentiate object clear light (<em>yul</em>) from cognitive (<em>yul-can</em>, subject) clear light. Object clear light is the actual void nature (<em>chos-nyid</em>)
                  of clear light, while cognitive clear light is clear light mental
                  activity itself, a phenomenon that has object clear light as its nature
                  (<em>chos-can</em>). <br> <br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clear light mental activity is not
                  necessarily aware of its own void nature, for example the clear light
                  mind experienced at the moment of ordinary death. Even when the
                  fifteenth-century Gelug master Kaydrub Norzang-gyatso (<em>mKhas-grub Nor-bzang rgya-mtsho</em>)
                  explains that clear light mental activity naturally gives rise to a
                  cognitive appearance resembling that which arises in nonconceptual
                  cognition of voidness, still it does not automatically arise with an
                  understanding of voidness, also as in ordinary death. Moreover, even
                  when reflexive deep awareness (<em>rang-rig ye-shes</em>) of its own
                  void nature is presented as a natural quality of clear light, as in the
                  Sakya and Kagyu systems, still it is not always operational, also as in
                  ordinary death. Therefore, anuttarayoga practice aims at achieving, in
                  meditation, cognitive clear light that is fully aware of its own object
                  clear light nature. </strong></span><br> <br> </li>
              <li>Rigpa, on the other hand,
                  is innately aware of its own void nature. When we access it, it
                  automatically is fully aware of its own nature. In dzogchen terms, it
                  knows its own face (<em>rang-ngo shes-pa</em>). </li>

              enlightenment, however, clear light mental activity is not devoid of
              the habits of grasping for true existence, which may be imputed or
              labeled on it. Nevertheless, when clear light is manifest, these habits
              do not cause clear light activity to make discordant (dual) appearances
              of true existence (<em>gnyis-snang</em>), nor do they prevent it from
              cognizing the two truths simultaneously (appearances and voidness),

              <p>Clear

              <p>On the path, we try to recognize two types of rigpa: first, effulgent rigpa (<em>rtsal-gyi rig-pa</em>) and then, essence rigpa (<em>ngo-bo’i rig-pa</em>) underlying it.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p><em>Effulgent rigpa</em> is the aspect of rigpa actively giving rise to cognitive appearances.</p>

              </ol>
              <p>Both

                      Differences between Rigpa and Clear Light</h2>
              <p>Further, rigpa is not an exact equivalent of clear light.
                      Rather, it is a subdivision of it.</p>
              <h3><a id="n7" rel="nofollow" name="n7"></a>Different
                      Degrees of Being Unstained</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>The clear light level of mind is naturally devoid of grosser
                      levels of mental activity, which are the levels at which conceptual
                      cognition and the fleeting stains of disturbing emotions and
                      attitudes occur. Before enlightenment, however, clear light mental
                      activity is not devoid of the habits of grasping for true
                      existence, which may be imputed or labeled on it. Nevertheless,
                      when clear light is manifest, these habits do not cause clear light
                      activity to make discordant (dual) appearances of true existence
                      (<em>gnyis-snang</em>), nor do they prevent it from cognizing the
                      two truths simultaneously (appearances and voidness), which they do
                      when grosser levels of mind are active.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>Rigpa, on the other hand, is devoid of even the habits of
                      grasping for true existence. It is the totally unstained natural
                      state of the mind.</p>

              <h3><a id="n8" rel="nofollow" name="n8"></a>Difference in
                      Terms of Recognizability</h3>
              <p>Clear light mental activity and rigpa are similar in the sense
                      that when each is operating, grosser levels of mental activity are
                      not functioning simultaneously.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>To access and recognize clear light mind requires actively
                      stopping the grosser levels of mental activity, through dissolving
                      the energy-winds that support those levels.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>
              <p>Rigpa is recognizable without actively stopping the grosser
                      levels of mental activity and of energy-wind as the method to
                      recognize it. When recognized and accessed, however, the grosser
                      levels automatically stop functioning.</p>

                      and Essence Rigpa</h2>
              <p>On the path, we try to recognize two types of rigpa: first,
                      effulgent rigpa (<em>rtsal-gyi rig-pa</em>) and then, essence rigpa
                      (<em>ngo-bo’i rig-pa</em>) underlying it.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p><em>Effulgent rigpa</em> is the aspect of rigpa actively giving
                      rise to cognitive appearances.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><em>Essence rigpa</em> is the cognitive open space
                      (<em>klong</em>) or cognitive sphere (<em>dbyings</em>) that
                      underlies and allows for actively producing and actively cognizing
                      cognitive appearances.</p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Both types of rigpa are still rigpa, meaning that both are
                      mental activities: the naturally pure, unstained awareness of
                      something.</p>

              <p>Hmmm... I think putting informations about differences between clear light and rigpa may confuse people even more.</p>
              <p>I feel that these informations are useful more for people who have certain experiences with Presence. Before that, the conceptual understanding of these experience is not helpful and may even be misunderstood.</p>
              <p>If someone reads it and fall into a conceptual trap by interpreting the information 'mentally' (which is the the normal mode of cognition), he can be stuck with a false understanding that can dangerously replace authentic experiences.</p>

              <p>Hi souldivine, my main goal for both present and future is to explain Buddhist teachings and concepts in ways that are easily accepted by layman, Buddhists or not. It's ok if they don't understand completely, even if this is true for their entire lifetime. Able to accept a bit, is better than totally rejecting or worse, slandering.</p>
              <p>The more theories that are introduced to explain a main concept, the more easily our minds get attached to these theories.</p>
              <p>So for beginners or for any layman with or without any beliefs, it's best not to reveal certain truths, even though they are the Truth. For not every man has the aptitude and/or perseverance to want to understand the ultimate reality of non-self and emptiness of a fixed nature.</p>

              <p>No need for difficult concepts especially for beginners. The reason why I asked Thusness was because I am not very clear myself. Some of these things are confusing and it would be much more beneficial to study more basic and practical dharma and apply it.</p>
              <p>You are right we should throw out concepts especially when practicing. Any concepts should be seen and dropped at once... not to entertain these concepts while we are practicing. Of course during daily life situations it is unavoidable we will need to use the conceptual framework. We just need to be mindful/aware so that we do not become attached to our thoughts.</p>

              <h3><strong>Sem and Rigpa</strong></h3>
              <p>The Nyingma dzogchen system differentiates two types of mental activity for experiencing things:</p>
              <ol>
              <li><em>sem</em> (<em>sems</em>, limited awareness), </li>
              <li><em>rigpa</em> (<em>rig-pa</em>, pure awareness). </li>
              </ol>
              <p>Roughly speaking, rigpa corresponds to the second division of clear light mental activity: clear light that knows its own two-truth nature.<br><br>Sem corresponds to all levels of mind that do not know this two-truth nature. Thus, sem includes:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>clear light mental activity that does not know its own two-truth nature, such as the ordinary clear light awareness of death, </li>
              <li>the nonconceptual milliseconds of seeing and hearing appearances of non-true existence, while not knowing the totality of everything in the state beyond concepts, and not cognizing voidness beyond concepts, </li>
              <li>imagining or verbally thinking appearances of true existence, while not knowing that they are false, and also not cognizing voidness beyond concepts.<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p>Clear light mental activity, then, that does not know its own two-truth nature, even though it cognizes the two truths simultaneously, is not rigpa. It is sem.<br><br>All sem are fleeting, whereas rigpa is unstained by fleeting limited mental activity. Moreover, rigpa is complete with all good qualities (<em>yon-tan</em>), which means that rigpa not only cognizes pure appearances and voidness beyond concepts simultaneously, it knows its own two-truth nature. That knowing is called:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>reflexive deep awareness (<em>rang-rig ye-shes</em>), </li>
              <li>self-arising deep awareness (<em>rang-byung ye-shes</em>), </li>
              <li>awareness of its own face (<em>rang-ngo shes-pa</em>). </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Although rigpa cognizes and knows its own two-truth nature, the two truths may or may not be equally prominent. The two are not equally prominent while still on the path; they are only equally prominent as a Buddha.</p>
              <h3><a id="n11" title="n11" name="n11"></a>Three Aspects of Rigpa</h3>
              <p>Rigpa has three naturally inseparable (<em>rang-bzhin</em> <em>dbyer-med</em>) aspects. The three simultaneously arise (<em>lhan-skyes</em>) and have the same essential nature (<em>ngo-bo gcig</em>) - they are referring to the same phenomenon from different mental points of view. Nevertheless, they may be differentiated from each other and specified as different conceptually isolated items (<em>ldog-pa</em>).</p>
              <p> [See: <a href="http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/archives/advanced/tantra/level4_advanced_points/relationship_2_obj_anuttarayoga.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Relationships between Two Objects in Anuttarayoga Tantra</span></span></a>.]</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Rigpa is a <em>primally pure</em> <em>awareness</em> (<em>ka-dag</em>), unstained, in the sense of both self-voidness (<em>rang-stong</em>) and other-voidness (<em>gzhan-stong</em>). This aspect derives from logically isolating one truth about rigpa, its voidness.<br><br>
              <ul>
              <li>Rigpa is <em>self-void</em> in the sense that it is beyond or devoid of existing as anything that would correspond to concepts or words. </li>
              <li>It is <em>other-void</em> in the sense of being an awareness that not only has that void nature, but that also cognizes that void nature, and which is thus devoid of all fleeting levels of “other” mental activity (sem).<br></li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Rigpa is an <em>awareness that spontaneously establishes pure appearances</em> (<em>lhun-grub</em>). This aspect derives from logically isolating the second truth about rigpa: its appearance-making aspect.<br></li>
              <li>Rigpa is a <em>responsive awareness</em> (<em>thugs-rje</em>). It is compassionate, which implies compassionate communication or responsiveness. This aspect derives from logically isolating a subtler aspect of appearance-making: the responsiveness of appearance-making to other beings and to the environment. </li>
              </ol>
              <h3><a id="n12" title="n12" name="n12"></a>The Three Types of Rigpa</h3>
              <p>There are three types of rigpa:</p>

              <li><em>Basis rigpa</em> (<em>gzhi'i rig-pa</em>) is the working basis that we all have. Although it pervades all moments of sem, like sesame oil pervades a sesame seed, we normally do not recognize it. The next two are the two aspects of rigpa that we recognize on the path.<br></li>
              <li>First, we recognize <em>effulgent rigpa</em> (<em>rtsal-gyi rig-pa</em>). It is rigpa in its aspect of actively giving rise to and cognizing pure appearances in response to things. Although it has all three aspects of rigpa, the spontaneous establishing aspect is more prominent.<br><br></li>
              <li>Then, we recognize <em>essence rigpa</em> (<em>ngo-bo'i rig-pa</em>) as what underlies effulgent rigpa. It is rigpa in its aspect of being the cognitive space (<em>klong</em>, spacious awareness) - referring to other-voidness - that allows for the arising and cognizing of pure appearances in response to things. Although it too has all three aspects of rigpa, the primal purity aspect is more prominent. </li>
