              <p>I am <strong>Ian Stevenson</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I died recently</span>. I discovered a fascinating experience.</p>
              <p>When I died, I am young again, I am feeling great.</p>
              <p>You can see my expression, it is amazing, it is great.</p>
              <p>I am here in this female human physical  body as the inter-dimensional portal.</p>
              <p>I was able to speak to you straight completely as myself like this is my body.</p>
              <p>I crossed over, still standing next to my body, still seeing next to my body.</p>
              <p>Everything went white. Instead of seeing human beings in their physical 3D form, I see their expressions, not energy. Their thoughts exist on every part of their body. These thoughts continuously running ... A being pop up to me and said ... </p>
              <p>Question: What is going on inside human beings? </p>
              <p>Answer: Every human being looks like a system. These system exist inter-demensionally. All your thoughts, feelings, emotions, expressions are part of the system that exist inter-dimensionally.</p>
              <p>People don't want to know these stuff. It is very scary because people don't know these stuff. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">People keep thinking, thinking, thinking that feelings and emotions are normal.... but it is not</span>.</p>

              <p>One thing about these kind of channeling is that even if they did channel from many sources, most of these discarnate spirits in communication are unenlightened beings.</p>
              <p>You will see that most descriptions of reality by these beings does not come from the perspective of an enlightened being who is enlightened to the ultimate nature of reality...</p>

              <p>People think that thoughts are normal, feelings and emotions are normal, But you know what? It is not. It is because I myself thought that emotions, feelings are normal.</p>
              <p>You think thinking, you need your brain to be functioning in this world. You need the brain to do the work you require to do. Emotions, feelings, thinking are not part of the brain. Actually, your brain is your entire physical body. I know this is difficult for you to comprehen what I am saying, but it is true.</p>
              <p>I am saying that this is the truth I have experienced and discovered for myself as I die.</p>
              <p>Humans look normal in this world... But what the f**k is normal?</p>
              <p><strong>Three words, Thoughts, Emotions, Feelings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>These are what people think they are...</strong> My current passion is to have human beings realise that you are not that three liitle words... its so limited.</p>
              <p>And when you get into the inter-dimension, only when you die, and then you realised... f**k here I am, and now I realised, why didn't I realised it when I was on Earth. What stopped me?</p>
              <p>Then you realise, is all those thoughts up in your mind, and those emotions and  those feelings, and those feelings that stopped you.</p>
              <p>But there is a way to stop those thoughts, stop those emotions and feelings. Because in the dimension, I am slient, I am peaceful.</p>
              <p>Human beings have to realise this... is that with that silence, with that no thought, with that no emotions and feelings.. where you are massive, you are infinite, you are vast... you are not those little thoughts</p>
              <p>Each human have to realised these, but I wouldn't want everyone have to die to realise this. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Believe me, because there are dead people that don't have the ability to talk to you like I do</span>.</p>

              those emotions and  those feelings, and those feelings that
              stopped you.</p>
              <p>But there is a way to stop those thoughts, stop those emotions
              and feelings. Because in the dimension, I am slient, I am
              peaceful.</p>
              <p>Human beings have to realise this... is that with that silence,
              with that no thought, with that no emotions and feelings.. where
              you are massive, you are infinite, you are vast... you are not
              those little thoughts</p>
              <p>Each human have to realised these, but I wouldn't want everyone
              have to die to realise this. <span>Believe me, because there are
              dead people that don't have the ability to talk to you like I
              do</span>.</p>

              <p>What he said contains truth.</p>
              <p>But it is a little vague...</p>
              <p>Perhaps you may want to read Longchen's article on his initial realisations:</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">During
              deep meditative states, an all-pervading Presence is detectable. This
              Presence, is most often experienced when thoughts are momentarily
              suspended. This Presence which exists in the Eternal Present Moment is
              our true self. This Presence has been described by mystics since
              ancient times.<br> <br> Under most circumstances, attention is focused on perception,
              thoughts and sensations. We have wholly identified ourselves with these
              experiences and believed that to be the entirety of our self.</span></p>
              <p class="style4"><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">But we are more than that! We are the eternal Presence. The direct
              experience of this, will dispel all false beliefs which are almost
              blindly accepted by all who had not awakened. This understanding of
              'Presence as our true essense' alone should put us in a greater sense
              of security and allow one to be less fearful of eventual physical
              death, which happened to all (almost all) of us.</span></p>

              <p>Some of the articles I have seen in their website's FAQ (written/channelled by discarnate spirit 'Jack') also clearly describe this level of realisation (I AM), but not non-dual.</p>
              <p>Also see our moderator Thusness's six stages of experience: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a></p>
              <p>The glimpse of 'I AM' is an initial awakening into the luminosity aspect of our nature, but without realisation of non-dual/no-self and emptiness. Only the realisation of non-dual/no-self and emptiness is considered enlightenment in Buddhism.</p>

              <p>Just discussed this video (part 2) with Thusness this morning.</p>
              <p>He thinks this video is very good, but it is not necessary (to practice masturbation) -- even as in walking, one must be able to experience that. When our feet 'touches' the floor... the 'solidness'.. is really the 'Form' we are always talking about in the conventional sense, and that is awareness. One will not be able to experience that in totality without understanding non-duality and emptiness.</p>
              <p>One can also experience even before fainting, the entirety, the totality, if practice reaches certain stability in non-duality.. it is the totality of the experience and what he called 'self expresssion in the moment'. This is different from awareness as a behind reality or the I AM/Watcher, but reality as manifestation, non-dual.</p>
              <p>The video provides the way of having non-dual experience but not necessarily the non-dual insight... non-dual insight is to understand that this is the natural state, always so. One should also know that karmic propensities prevent one from the natural state.</p>
              <p>So basically the video is talking about vipassana, except it is in masturbation. However it is no good to practice this way, and one should not seek the pleasurable or intensity of experience... and it does your body more harm than benefits.</p>
              <p>But one should experience it in vipasanna practice, practice dropping and mindfulness, like body mindfulness throughout the whole body. Not to practice this as masturbation, but practice in walking, hearing, seeing, as in in hearing, just the sound, in seeing, just the seen, in touching, just the sensation. Then it does not harm one's body, we do not give up and exhaust our body as in the case of masturbation described by that person. It is however a good description.</p>

              <p>What "Dr Ian Stevenson" is talking about is what we are is not just the common notion or belief that we are our thoughts, emotions, and feeling, and our true nature is much more vast and infinite. I think this is quite similar to Longchen's article which I posted above, however, that article by longchen is only an initial realisation/glimpse of our true nature. Maybe longchen can comment.</p>

              <p>Watched the video .. a bit. Desteni is quite popular in the new age scene.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion...</p>
              <p>When we die, the thoughts and emotions can be dissolve in the death process... and what is left is the non-dual , all pervading experience of Presence. Here is usually when a 'being' discovered that it is not just the thought and emotion. But, the understanding is not clear here.</p>
              <p>For those on an enlightenment path, we sort of 'experience death' before physical death. This experience of death happens many many times while still physically alive. And with gradual experiences, we understand the nature of the reality better.</p>
              <p>In another word, we become more efficient and discard those ways of dealings that are not very helpful... Something like that...</p>

              <p>Truly so! You may want to see Â‘clearingÂ’ from another
              perspective.<br> Since there is merely letting whatever arises to subside on their
              own accord with luminous clarity, it is not so much of 'clearing'
              of karmic propensities. It is rather a Â‘non-re-enforcing' process.
              Ignorance unknowingly deepens the tendencies due to dualistic
              action.<br> <br> I used to find this a great challenge because the sense of self
              never fails to arise during challenging conditions but that is
              perfectly fine now. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"> However one
              must know the exact reason why it is fine and the mechanism of how
              karmic tendencies works. This knowing of 'exact reason' is not a
              form of rational deduction but rather a form of reflection due to
              clarity of the process when there is non-interference.<br> <br> If it doesnÂ’t arise, it is not cleared. The very arising is itself
              a clearing process; otherwise with a Â‘seedÂ’ latent and without
              condition for it to arise, how is it cleared? Therefore one must
              turn Â‘conditionsÂ’ to practice. <img title="Mr. Green" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green"></p>

              <p>Yes the process of gradual dissolution leading to the experience of Clear Light, which dawns in its splendor at the time of death, which the Tibetan Book of the Dead says "<span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">"Oh son/daughter of an
                  enlightened family ... your Rigpa is inseparable luminosity and emptiness and dwells as a great
                  expanse of light; beyond birth or death, it is, in fact, the Buddha of Unchanging Light." However a glimpse is probably not enough and without the wisdom/insight the experience will be lost in a moment, and the process of samsaric rebirth takes place again. </span></p>

              <p><strong>Question</strong>: When people hear of luminosity of clear 
                          light that dawns at the moment of death they ask why it is called clear 
                          light. What has this got to do with light as we know it? <br> <strong>Dalai Lama</strong>: "I don't think that in the term clear light, light 
                          should be taken literally. It is sort of metaphoric. This could have its 
                          roots in our terminology of mental will. According to Buddhism, all consciousness 
                          or all cognitive mental events are said to be in the nature of clarity 
                          and luminosity. So it is from that point of view that the choice of the 
                          term light is used. Clear light is the most subtle level of mind, which 
                          can be seen as the basis or the source from which eventual experience 
                          or realisation of Buddhahood, Buddha's wisdom might come about, therefore 
                          it is called clear light. Clear light is a state of mind which becomes 
                          fully manifest only as a consequence of certain sequences or stages of 
                          dissolution, where the mind becomes devoid of certain types of obscurations, 
                          which are again metaphorically described in terms of sun-like, moonlike 
                          and darkness. These refer to the earlier three stages of dissolution which 
                          are technically called, including the clear light stage, the four empties. 
                          At the final stage of dissolution the mind is totally free of all these 
                          factors of obscuration. Therefore it is called clear light. Sort of a 
                          light. It is also possible to understand the usage of the term clear light 
                          in terms of the nature of mind itself. Mind or consciousness is a phenomena 
                          which lacks any obstructive quality. It is non-obstructed."</p>

              many times while still physically alive. And with gradual
              experiences, we understand the nature of the reality better.</p>
              <p>In another word, we become more efficient and discard those ways

              <p>Hi Longchen,</p>
              <p>Must be having a challenging time sustaining the vivid
              presence of non-dual experience.<span>  </span>Just to
              share with you some of my thoughts:</p>
              <p>When we die, the thoughts and emotions that are karmically linked to the
              body are temporarily suspended.<span>  </span>The
              contrast in experience that resulted from the dissolution of the ‘bond of a
              body’ gives rise to a more vivid experience of Presence; although the
              experience of Presence is there, the insight into its non-dual essence and
              emptiness nature isn’t there.<span>  </span>This is
              similar to the experience of “I AM”.<span>  </span>Thoughts
              and emotions will continue to arise and subside with the bond of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’
              after death. <span> </span></p>
              <p>Awareness is always non-dual and all pervading; obscured but not lost.<span>  </span>In essence all manifestation,
              transient (emotions, thoughts or feelings) is really the manifold of Presence.<span>  </span>They have the same non-dual essence and empty
              nature.<span>  </span>All problems lie not at the
              manifestation level but at the fundamental level.<span>  </span>Deep in us we see things inherently and
              dualistically.<span>  </span>How the experience of Presence can be distorted with the ‘bond’ of dualistic
              and inherent seeing maybe loosely categorized as:</p>
              <p>1. There is a mirror reflecting dust. (“I AM”)
                  </p>
              <p>     Mirror bright is experienced but distorted.<span>  </span>Dualistic and Inherent seeing.</p>
              <p>2. Dust is required for the mirror to see itself.</p>
              <p>    Non-Dualistic but Inherent seeing.<span>  </span>(Beginning
              of non-dual insight)</p>
              <p>3. Dust has always been the mirror ( The mirror here is seen as a whole)</p>
              <p>   Non-Dualistic and non- inherent insight.</p>
              <p>In 3, whatever comes and goes is the Rigpa itself.  There is no Rigpa
              other than that.  All along there is no dust really, only when a
              particular speck of dust claims that it is the purest and truest state then
              immediately all other arising which from beginning are self- mirroring become
              dust.</p>

              <p>Hi Thusness,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the reply. :)</p>
              <p>Yes, there are some challenging situations to non-dual presence. I will share it on the forum..</p>
              <p>In my case, nondual is easier to experience when there are bodily movement. This is when i am walking or eating. The mind rest and just feeling the sensations.</p>
              <p>However, when thinking kicks in... it is not so easy. This can be liken to a dog trying to bite its own tail. The habitual tendency to let go of these thoughts becomes the arising of the dualistic perception. 'Let go' becomes the very effort.  and a  loop cycle ensues. However, there are also  time when the 'let go effort' drops and restfulness follows. ... and one wonders just how silly the 'let go' effort is. LOL.</p>
              <p>The guess is that one must sustain a 'deeper' level of 'knowing' non-efforting.... that cannot be sought after.</p>
              <p>Just a sharing.</p>

              <p>Precisely so and well experienced!<br><br>Non-dual brings u out of the mental loop, directly experiencing whatever touched, sensed, seen as IT.   Before perception intervenes, it is thoroughly experienced.  Non-dual eliminates the constant need of falling back to a source and see manifestation as source. <br> <br>However in a practical world, there is no way we can avoid dirtying our hands and remain free from conceptualization; we have to face 'thinking'.  It seems that whenever thinking steps in, the 'sense of self' surfaces and division is again experienced.  The ‘background’, the ‘ultimate source’ will arise and there is no way of getting rid of this split for this is the nature of dualism.  Ever time we recall or think there will always be a division; the background, the source will surface.  And as long as our fundamental way of analyzing and thinking rest on a subject-object paradigm, there will always be a mismatched between non-dual experience and the 'views' for a non-dualist.<br><br>Although non-dual insight eliminates the split between the observer and observed experientially, it does not dissolve the deeply rooted dualistic framework.  We continue to analyze and think and analyze using a subject/object dichotomy.  Even tough there is sufficient non-dual experiences, when attempting to orientate in terms of ‘views’, a non-dualist can still be confused himself and at times appears incoherent.  This is the de-synchronization between views and meditative experiences.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism there is a complete system of thought to orientate ourselves non-dually, that is, the viewless-view of Emptiness.  It is a raft but it is the antidote for the conventional mind to orientate itself in a non-dual and non-local context.  It also led to the amazing insight that ‘duality’ is really the result of seeing and taking things ‘inherently’ (You may want to the take up the challenge of re-engaging in thoughts penetrating this viewless view of Emptiness and thoroughly understand how this affect us into seeing things dualistically  ).<br><br>At present, we experience our world through the lens of seeing things as existing dualistically and inherently.  We deeply believe that entity possesses certain form of attributes.  Deep in us we believe that ‘redness’ belongs to the flower and ‘blueness’ belongs to the sky.  We were trained to see things not only dualistically but also objects consisting of attributes and functions.  But in truth, there is no such ‘redness’ that belongs to the ‘flower’.  There is no the ‘redness’ outside, nor inside us.  There is no properties 'inherently' attached or attributed to any objects. The formation of the 'center' and the tendency to grasp is not just the problem of seeing things 'dualistically' but also 'inherently'.  When we see in this way, all 'letting go' are mere illusions; For we are really 'holding' in our deep most consciousness and so the letting go' is only superficial.  When we see things inherently, whatever state, whatever experience, no matter how profound, how blissful, how vivid, how mystical, will be objectify into an object for seeking; the tendency operates subtly.  It is similar to how the experience of the Source "I AM" is distorted and later non-dual insight that sees the fundamental problem of the source.<br><br>Lastly, as stated in the Bahiya Sutta,<br><br>In seeing, (there is always) just the seen.<br>In hearing, (there is always) just sound.<br><br>The seen, sound are the non-dual luminous experience; but direct experience of non-dual luminosity is not suffcient.  Though perfectly clear and vividly present as in non-dual experience, the 'seen' is radically different from the 'sound' -- this is its emptiness nature.  This viewless view must be fused into our non-dual insight.  When views are firmly established and non-dual experience thoroughly authenticated, a practitioner will see everything as Awareness without conflict in both views and experiences.  Not bounded within an inherent and dualistic paradigm, he will not be confused.  When the real cause and the empty nature of our pristine awareness are understood, this ‘Emptiness’ view too must be discarded.<br><br>Happy CNY!</p>
