              <p>The ‘Understanding Amituofo’ course has been immensely interesting. 
              Shi’an has a knack of breaking down difficult concepts into accessible 
              information, which we can easily relate to in our everyday lives. This 
              course will be useful even for Pure Land practitioners who already know 
              something about the teachings. Shi’an always explores new perspectives 
              that surprises us. His humorous approach to teaching and the use of 
              clear, simple language is a major plus. There was never a dull moment. I
               enjoyed the classes tremendously! Amituofo, <strong>Wei </strong><strong>Peng</strong></p>
              <p>Thank you for teaching us about Amituofo in such a simple way yet 
              with so much for us to take away. I really appreciate your kindness and 
              sincerity in conducting this course. I am inspired… I am already looking
               forward to your next courses, ‘The Faith Factor’ and ‘The Heart Of The 
              Heart Sutra’.  I must say that I always just feel happy going for the 
              Saturday classes. Thank you for your time sharing your knowledge with 
              us. Amituofo, <strong>Weena</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Shi’an teacher, thank you very much for sharing so much about 
              Amitabha Buddha. Appreciate very much for spending your precious time to
               try to share as much as you can. - <strong>Rebecca</strong></p>
              <p>é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½›. Great talk this morning. - <strong>Shirley</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Shi’an, I am glad we did not missed last Saturday’s class. The 
              lessons are getting interesting and inspiring… Thank for sharing the 
              wonderful Living Dharma… Thank you very much for illustrating your 
              lessons for us with your real life experience on death. We truly enjoyed
               your last Saturday session… Thank you &amp; best regards. Amituofo, <strong>Susan, Linda &amp; Ricky</strong></p>
              <p>Bro. Shen Shi’an shares his personal experiences and anecdotes in his
               lessons which make the class interesting. I look forward to his class 
              every week… Many thanks for replying and clearing my doubts regards to 
              Buddhism. It being a pleasure attending your lessons. Amituofo, <strong>Ricky</strong></p>
              <p>Nianfo (mindfulness of Amituofo) is one of the best life skills, or 
              also ‘death skill’ that one should learn! Why? Knowing where one will go
               after death gives me peace of mind. And when unhappy thoughts arise, 
              nianfo switches the state of mind to something neutral for me. When I 
              get very angry, in some instances, I will get gastric pains. Once, I 
              went to a corner to nianfo quickly, and within one minute, my state of 
              mind changed and I was no longer angry. [Note: Nianfo can lead to 
              experience of spiritually blissful well-being too.] <strong>- Adeline</strong></p>
              <p>I’m very encouraged by your knowledge and your enthusiasm. Despite 
              overrun of time, you still pursued to complete the last lesson with 
              passion… Thank again for dedicating your life for teaching Buddhism. We 
              need more people like you… I’m looking forward to your (future) talks… 
              You do a great job in influencing another person with Buddhism. Thanks, 
              and have a great day! – Amituofo, <strong>Doreen</strong></p>
              <p>I attended your Amituofo class and found it to be informative and 
              encouraging. Indeed I’m impressed by your relentless efforts and your 
              meticulous attitude in explaining the sutra. Thanks. - <strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>Mdm Shen</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Bro. Shi’an, thank you to you, who made this course possible for
               the benefit of English educated brothers and sisters. A round of 
              applause to you!! Sadhu 3x. - <strong>Susan</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Bro Shi’an, thank you for conducting this course, without which I
               wouldn’t have the privilege of learning about Amituofo and the Pureland
               practice. Also, your ‘unconventional’ way of teaching enables us to 
              just relax and listen in class knowing that the notes (with lots of 
              helpful links) will be sent to us via email later. Thanks to your good 
              effort, I had definitely learnt and gained a lot. May you be well and 
              happy! With Metta, <strong>Audrey</strong></p>
              <p>As my exposure was more to Theravada teachings, I did not know much 
              about Pure Land but intrinsically I know that Amituofo and Pure Land 
              exist and rebirth in Pure Land is achievable. I am glad I made the 
              effort to attend this class because the knowledge that I gained 
              strengthened my faith in Amituofo and dispels the doubt and 
              misinformation that I was exposed to. I urge everyone to come with an 
              open heart and mind to learn about Amituofo. It is the best gift for 
              yourself! With deep appreciation, Amituofo, <strong>Karuna</strong></p>
              <p>“Dharma Teacher Shi’an is very sincere and earnest in delivery of his
               courses. Always filled with many interesting and creative analogies or 
              metaphors to let us have a better idea and understanding. The various 
              creative media used and implementation of the element of humour brings 
              the Dharma classes alive without boredom, very often allowing me to feel
               inspired and invigorated with renewed energy after the lessons. Really 
              appreciate the amount of effort Teacher Shi’an put into preparing his 
              classes. Hope that the work of Teacher Shi’an will continue and benefit 
              more of us!” <strong>- Ricky</strong></p>
              <p>‘Enjoying the course very much. Hope to have the chance to attend the
               same course again infuture. It brings a lot of joy and peace. 
              Wonderful!’ – Amituofo, <strong>Huimin</strong></p>
              <p>‘It was a very rewarding 10-lesson course. It enriches me even more in understanding Buddhism and Amituofo.’<strong> - Rosie</strong></p>
              <p>‘Hi Teacher Shi’an, I really enjoyed this course, there are so much 
              things to learnand I have gained a lot of knowledge from you. I will 
              definitely attend more of your courses in future.’ – Best Regards, 
              Amituofo, <strong>Pu-ling</strong></p>
              <p>‘Dear Dharma Teacher Shen, thank you for conducting the Understanding
               Amitabha Buddha Course. You earnestly put in good and detailed research
               into the preparation for conducting such a course, the result of which 
              the audience appreciated. This is the hallmark of a good teacher. 
              Moreover, you patiently use current examples of existing situations in 
              daily lives to make the topic as real and penetrating as possible for 
              the minds of the listeners. Good work.’ <strong>- Andrew</strong></p>
              <p>“The course was taught in a manner which could be easily comprehended
               by someone with minimal knowledge of Buddhism. Thank you for your 
              efforts in motivating all participants by making the lessons interesting
               through sharing of real stories, and for relentless encouragement of us
               to nianfo. åŠŸå¾·æ— é‡�! Amituofo.”<strong> - Jos<br> </strong></p>
              <p>“I enjoyed all the 10 lessons. They were all excellent and I have gain much knowledge.” <strong>- Gerald</strong></p>
              <p>“Thank you very much for your class. I have learned very much from youand it inspires me to want to practise more. Thank you.” <strong>- Fucai</strong></p>
              <p>“I feel that your frequent use of examples to illustrate your points 
              is very useful to me, especially as a beginner who find some topics 
              rather abstract. It is also these examples used that makes the lessons 
              interesting…” <strong>- Danny</strong></p>
              <p>“Thank you very much for having these sessions. Hope to see you again.” – Amituofo,<strong> Alex</strong></p>
              <p>“Hi Shi’an, appreciate very much for your teaching. The lessons are 
              really valuable. The materials are well prepared and carefully written. 
              They are very useful for recap. Initially I was quite hesitant to 
              register for the course. I thought I would probably drop out mid way 
              because it was on Saturday – a day when my work schedules are tight, and
               the location [Kong Meng San for 10th Run] is quite inconvenient for 
              me.. but your lessons were really so knowledgeable and interesting, that
               I wouldn’t want to miss them. In fact, I had been looking forward to 
              them. Among all, I found that the topic about the interruption between 
              each life [due to death]… to somewhat have an awakening effect on me. 
              Since then, I have started to nianfo everyday, and it has been 
              consistently carried out for 3 weeks! I hope I have all the time to 
              continue the practice and be mindful of Buddha every moment. I will 
              recommend your teachings to my friends and family members.” – Thanks 
              &amp; Regards, <strong>Mee Nah</strong></p>
              <p>“Thank you very much for your sharing of Pure Land practice. I have 
              enjoyed every session of the course. I had supposed it to be a serious 
              and dull subject. However, you had made it interesting and fun through 
              your jokes and excellent illustrations. Unfortunately, I missed the last
               session due to a family commitment. The course structure flowed very 
              well and is very suitable for a layperson to understand Pure Land 
              Buddhism in a progressive manner. Your constant encouragement to get us 
              to clarify our doubts through email [and in person] was very useful. 
              Now, I have a much better understanding of Pure Land practice. I look 
              forward to furthering my understanding and practice on Pure Land 
              Buddhism. Thank you once again.” – Amituofo, <strong>Lar Kee</strong></p>
              <p>“Thank you for the teaching and sharing of experiences. I also like 
              to thank Brother Steven for sharing his experience with all of us. It 
              showed us how someone practised what was learnt.” – Amituofo, <strong>Lisa</strong></p>
              <p>“Dear Bro. Shi’an, ‘The Gift of Truth Excels All Other Gifts.’ Thank 
              you for sharing the Pure Land Teachings with us. You have delivered the 
              teachings in a very concise, interesting and creative manner. We enjoyed
               the lessons very much and have benefitted a lot from them. We are glad 
              to have an excellent Dharma teacher like you in the Buddhist world. 
              Sadhu! Sadhu! Sadhu! Amituofo!” – With appreciation,<strong> Tuck Khuen, Amy, Ivy, Doris &amp; Joey</strong></p>

              <p>‘My wife and I were there. I must say that you are extremely 
              engaging; there was never a dull moment in the 2 hours (of each lesson)…
               It has been really enriching and enlightening…’ <strong>- Teng Leng</strong></p>

              <p>‘Dear Teacher Shen, thank you for your teachings… Thank you for all 
              the knowledge put in simple, digestable words in a light-hearted mood. 
              The lessons are well pacedand after each lesson, the faith in me grows a
               little bit more. I’m glad my hubby signed me up for the course as I 
              didn’t see the need to attend since I could access to the sutra and 
              notes of the previous round he attended. After the end of last week’s 
              8th class and Bro. Steven’s sharing, I walked out of… feeling very happy
               despite the drizzle… Once on the bus, [using another way to practise 
              mindfulness of Amituofo], I quickly whipped out my handphone to text 
              ‘Amituofo, Amituofo… [in Chinese]’ and almost filled the length of 12 
              messages during the 17-minute ride. Once home, our 89 cm tall son fell 
              down from a dining chair, where he was standing to drinkcereal. He 
              landed sideways, unhurt and with no crying or words of discomfort. He 
              had spilt half of his drink, and was still holding the cup. Both hubby 
              and myself were 2-3 arm lengths away. We witnessed this and was 
              speechless. It was as if our son was ‘lifted’ and merely placed on the 
              floor [to break his fall]. We’re not sure if this is the blessing of 
              Amituofo’s protection, but we are sure that nianfo [being mindful of 
              Amitabha Buddha] is wonderful and great! May you have a great Amituofo 
              day!’ <strong>- Emily</strong></p>

              your stay in Jakarta. The seminar really gave me a whole new perspective
               on Buddhism… I couldn’t have made a better decision than registering. A
               lot of the teachings were affirmative and complementing of what I’ve 
              understood about Buddhism so far.” <strong>- William</strong></p>
              <p>“I had the impression that it would be a ‘dry’ and boring class 
              initially. Thank Buddha you have the ability to make us giggle or laugh 
              during class. It is a ‘good investment’ to sign up for your class.” <strong>- Irene</strong></p>

              edutainment. The ‘before/after effect’ (like Marie France) of Pureland 
              teachings is indeed profound. I must say I’ve progressed rapidly in 
              ‘faith, vows and practice’, thanks to your passionate and generous

              Look forward to the next class. We enjoy every lesson. The path to Pure 
              Land is simple and fuss free. Coming from the past 15 years of Theravada
               Buddhist teachings’ background, this is refreshing and would certainly 
              add depth on our Dharma pursuits. We have never had a structured and 
              systematic education on Buddhism of any branch although all our lives we
               are connected to it from birth. The laoshi (teacher) Shen Shi’an is 
              engaging, witty and knowledgeable. Teacher is very well prepared, 
              eloquent, knowledgeable and systematic. <strong>- Lye Wai Fun</strong></p>

              beneficial for us to have a better fundamental understanding of 
              Buddhism. The organising committee is very committed to make this class a
               success, and tried their best to provide a conducive environment for 
              the participants.” <strong>- Yong Leow</strong></p>

              <p>“The trainer has done an excellent job in bringing Mahayana teachings
               to English-speaking Buddhists. He is able to dispel the myth that 
              Chinese Buddhism is suitable only to illiterate old men and women. May 
              the trainer be able to help more sentient beings to contact the 
              teachings. May Buddhas and Bodhisattvas support him in his endeavor.” <strong>- Anon3</strong></p>
              <p>“It was an enlightening session for the lesson that you have 
              conducted today. Thank you for imparting the knowledge on the ‘crash 
              course’ (on Buddhism for the first lesson). Things I learn in your 
              lesson today: To re-ignite my compassion to all beings, including those 
              that I previously do not like due to heavy office politics. Your passion
               in Buddhism that energised my learnings. It was another informative 
              session yesterday and I can understand the concept well, through your 
              interesting presentation.” <strong>– Jeffrey</strong></p>

              <p>“Must tell you that we enjoy your class. It is very comprehensive, with easy to understand and lively presentation.”<strong>– Rita</strong></p>
              <p>“Your clarion call on high importance and high urgency of learning 
              the route to Pureland was depicted with a ‘think out of the box’ 
              (manner) effectively. Witty dialogue on the multi-purpose use of 
              Amituofo’s name remains vividly in my mind. Leaves us much to practice. 
              Thank you for being a wonderful teacher by bringing the Dharma to us in a
               simple, interesting and fun way. In all the classes, we had been 
              educated and entertained! It was the very first time that we ever 
              attended a structured course, though we are ‘Buddhists” all our lives. 
              Lessons were joyfully taught by a highly knowledgeable and energetic 
              instructor who engaged your attention and captivated your imagination by
               the power of interesting visuals and sometimes comical parables.” <strong>– Lye Wai Fun</strong></p>
              <p>“Dear Bro Shi’an, I really enjoy your class on Amituofo. Learn many 
              things everytime I go for the class. Today’s testimonial is also really 
              inspiring! Amituofo” <strong>- Tiong Han</strong></p>
              <p>“Brother Shi’an, You are a great teacher; your teachings alone are a 
              tremendous inspiration to those like me who have good karmic affinity to
               listen to you. You soldand I bought the ticket to Pureland on the very 
              first lesson in March last year. That’s how inspiring you are! Thank 
              you. é˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½› _()_ ” <strong>– Steven</strong></p>
              <p>“Thanks for the guidance. I have re-evaluated your advice and 
              implemented it. The outcome is encouraging. Thank you for your statement
               that kept me motivated and not giving up. Thanks for making a 
              difference in our lives.” <strong>– Jeffrey</strong></p>
              <p>“Hi Shi’an, I want to thank you for giving me better insights of the 
              sutra, as well as instilling in me more faith. I am very thankful that I
               have the opportunity to attend your class. It is very difficult to find
               good English Buddhist classes and interesting teachers. I hope you can 
              conduct more classes so we English educated ones would not miss the 
              opportunity to understand and appreciate the Buddhist teaching and to 
              reach Pure Land. Your class is super, never one moment boring and time 
              just flies. I wish it never ends. Every moment is motivating, 
              interesting, soft-selling but never forcing, well presented and 
              delivered. Very good visual and presentation material. I believe that 
              only those with faith and passion like you could conduct such classes. 
              Academics would present and speak without conviction, but your easy 
              style and passion makes the class alive, interesting and motivating. 
              Shi’an good job!! Please don’t stop, we need your guidance. Thank you 
              again.” <strong>- Amituofo, Pauline</strong></p>
