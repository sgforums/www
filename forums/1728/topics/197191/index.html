To those attached to Emptiness, Buddha Sakyamuni taught Existence to break that grasp. To those attached to Existence, He taught Emptiness so as to loosen that grasp. To those grasping at both Emptiness and Existence, He taught "neither Emptiness nor Existence" to break that grasp. Lastly, to those grasping at "neither Emptiness nor Existence," He taught both Emptiness and Existence to break that attachment. (1)<br><br>In short, the purpose is to draw all sentient beings away from attachments. That is the Buddhist teaching of salvation. There is no other way to return to the source [the Mind], though there are many different expedient methods. We Buddhist students and practitioners should not become attached to these methods. When thoughts arise in our mind discriminating between what method is right and what method is wrong, that is against the purpose of the Buddhas and is a deviation from the Buddhist path.<br><br>For example, when Buddha Sakyamuni taught the Dharma of Emptiness, His message was not that it was the opposite of Existence, but rather that it was Truth and Reality. What are Truth and Reality? Let me quote the T'ien T'ai Patriarch Chih I:<br><br>When one dharma is empty, then all dharmas are empty; there is no separate Non-Emptiness. Without Non-Emptiness to contrast with Emptiness, Emptiness itself is unattainable [i.e., does not exist].<br>Similarly, when Buddha Sakyamuni taught Existence, this was not the opposite of Emptiness, but was rather to say:<br><br>When one dharma exists, then all dharmas exist; there is no separate Non-Existence. Without Non-Existence to contrast with Existence, Existence itself is unattainable.<br><br>We should understand the true meaning of Emptiness and Existence. Nothing we say about Emptiness or Existence is attainable (i.e., truly valid). And since this is so, why are we still attached to them?<br><br>The Great Master Han-Shan thoroughly understood the goal of the Buddhas. In tune with the minds of the Patriarchs, he spread the Dharma (teaching), grasping at neither Emptiness nor Existence, neither Non-Emptiness nor Non-Existence -- thereby manifesting the Middle Way. Thus, he promoted the cultivation of both Zen and Pure Land, pointing to the non-duality of Emptiness and Existence. That teaching is "Wonderful Enlightenment" (see Glossary). </span><a href="http://www.ymba.org/han/hanfrm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ymba.org/han/hanfrm.htm</a><br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Casino King,<br><br>Normally I don't like to do this... I am reading you 'symbolically via vision' since you want relevant information.<br><br>The following is just my interpretation.<br><br>You have a belief that you need to obtain accurate information. You feel defensive and that your survival depends on the correct information. I see that the belief is hollow inside... meaning that it is build up to be a strong emotional belief, although the thought/belief is empty or hollow inside. That means when you realise it, it will loses its importance. This is one karmic aspect of yourself.<br><br>There is another aspect. This other aspect binds and interwine with the first aspect... complicating your thought processes.  This other aspect is your strong need to compare and be better than others. These 2 aspect oscillate in you, seeking for dominance.<br><br>These are just my intuitive interpretations of the symbols that i see. I hope it is meaningful to you.<br><br></div>

You are not me and you have no idea what you are saying when you are talking about me. You only know about yourself and I know about myself.<br><br>What we are all doing here is very simple. It is no point teaching anybody anything. Everybody realises it for themselves.<br><br>Those who have gone a bit further help those a little behind by asking the correct questions. These questions are meaningless to people who have no idea what is going on. That is the way it should be.<br><br>The one asking the question cannot claim any credit because the one who realises it for himself did the realisation for himself.<br><br>What you are doing now is trying to tell people what you know. That is very pointless. Even if people know exactly what you are trying to say, they might not have realised that which you are trying to say.<br><br>To sinweiy : That is why we need people who have gone a little further to help those a little behind. There are so much scriptures. Which part is relevant? Which part is superflous? Which part comes first? Which part comes later?<br><br>You start by realising "existence" (the seekers.) Existence is empty so you realise "non-existence " (the Buddhist.) Then you realise the non existence of the doctrine of emptiness. When does the doctrine of emptiness itself become empty? Realise that.</div>
