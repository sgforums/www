Emptiness, is like the vast clear sky that allows clouds, birds, planes etc. to come in and go by, allowing infinite phenomena to occur within it. Emptiness is thus infinitely more than everything that the unenlightened can perceive. It is because of Emptiness that everything, including ourselves, can continually change for the better. Anything can transform into something else when the right combination of causes and conditions is present. Similarly, anyone can become Enlightened if one cultivates spiritually. <strong>Emptiness is thus a teaching full of hope.</strong><br><br>---<br><br>Benefits Of Realizing Emptiness<br>Our Ignorance is seeing the illusory as being "too real" - we see the constantly changing as unchanging and become attached to the unsubstantial. Ignorance of not seeing the unreality of the self creates suffering centering around our false sense of self. There is no hint of a fixed self in anything physical or mental. There is no "I, you, my, your..." When self is realized to be empty and unreal, all opposing differences disappear - all are seen just as they are in their naked reality without empty labels, judgments or prejudice.<br><br>Being able to apply Emptiness in daily life brings unlimited ease and happiness as one becomes free of the burden of attachment. Realizing Emptiness is to attain the Wisdom of selflessness (to see the non-self of everything). The functioning of selflessness is Compassion. Thus, true Wisdom is compassionate and true Compassion is wise - they are interdependently linked. Both perfection of Wisdom and Compassion form the twin peaks of spiritual cultivation or Enlightenment.<br><br>As we familiarize ourselves with Emptiness, we gradually open our minds and free ourselves from the bonds of Ignorance that misconceives reality. In time, we will eliminate all Ignorance, anger, attachment, pride, jealousy and other disturbing attitudes from our Mind. By doing so, we cease to create the destructive actions motivated by them. We will thus be freed from all problems. In other words, realizing Emptiness brings True Happiness.<br><br>As a summary, a practical application of Emptiness in everyday life would be:</span><br><br><strong>To Treasure Everything<br>(in this moment)<br>as All is Transient;<br><br>To Be Unattached to Everything<br>(in this moment)<br>as All Is Transient.</strong><br><br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/be_a_lamp_upon_yourself.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/be_a_lamp_upon_yourself.htm</a><br><br>/\<br><br></div>
