Non-obstruction in both realm of phenomenon and noumenon;<br>IV. Total Non-obstruction in ALL realms of phenomena.<br><br>..which subsequently became known as the standard formula of the Hua-yen dharmadhaatu doctrine.<br><br>According to his explanation, the first one is the dharmadhaatu particularized or phenomenalized into innumerable concrete things. The second one, is the "essential" aspect of the dharmadhaatu which is the foundation of all the manifested phenomena. The third one is the aspect of the dharmadhaatu in which phenomena and noumenon interfuse each other. The fourth dimension of the dharmadhaatu, which teaches basically the twin principle of interrelationship of all phenomena: mutual identification and interpenetration.</span><br><br>/\<br></div>

Because the old monk is already in the level of the WHOLE ONE, he can accept all kinds of opinions. As a matter of fact, the old monk can also give negative answers to his students like "You are wrong", it all because that the old monk already surpassed any standpoint and does not have his original nature.
