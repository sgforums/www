Perhaps we've also begun to understand that we conceive all the innumerable aspects of the world in the same manner. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rather than see the wind, or waves - or a stream or a cup or a book - as the constant flux that each is, we imagine them to be solid, persisting, separate, unchanging things.</span><br><br>We attribute this "thingness" to them in the same way we attribute selfhood to human beings. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instead of seeing the thoroughgoing motion, flux, and flow of experience, we imagine a vast proliferation of innumerable, separated things. In short, we grant selfhood to whatever we find "out there."</span><br><br>Then we make another error. Just as we conceive of a self and counter this notion with a non-self, so also are we taken in by another set of opposing concepts - existence and non-existence. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We get repeatedly caught in this duality, unwilling to see that, like self and not-self, both are phantoms created by consciousness. These concepts (like any concept) simply don't capture Reality.</span><br><br>The Buddha expressed this situation eloquently:<br><br>The world...is generally inclined towards two [views]: existence and non-existence. To them who perceives with right wisdom the uprising of the world as it has come to be, the notion of non-existence in the world does not occur... To them who perceive with right wisdom the ceasing of the world as it has come to be, the notion of existence in the world does not occur.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Let me discuss the basic meaning of "Buddhism" or "Buddhist" by refering to a famous parable about five blind men who attempt to define an elephant. The first blind man touches the tail of an elephant and says, "Now I know what the elephant is. It is like a rope." The second blind man touches its leg and declares that it is like a tree. The third, fourth, and fifth blind men respectively touch its body, nose, and ear and declares that it is like a wall, a hose, and a fan. These five blind men are firmly convinced that they are absolutely right in their understanding. So they start to fight among themselves.<br><br>Then what does it mean to become a "Buddhist' in this context? Here., we must talk about a another sixth, blind man. Then who is the sixth blind man? He is a person who has touched all those five parts of the animal. He is well aware that the elephant has all kinds of parts. He knows that all those five blind men are both right and wrong. He knows that all of them are right, partially right, because they are touching a part of an elephant. But at the same time he knows that all of them are wrong in their view that they have an absolutely correct understanding. The "Buddhist," the sixth blind man, can identify with all those five blind men, but, at the same time, he cannot agree with them when they say that their own respective views are the only truth. Those five blind men have their fixed positions and they cannot help fighting, whereas the sixth blind man has no position with which he can fight with others. <strong>A "Buddhist" is a person who can identify with all human assertions in some way or other, but cannot consider any one assertion the absolute truth.</strong></span></div>

Pls note that I'm not even saying that those first 5 people are wrong, they are just, not whole. Not absolute. Right and Wrong are all relative viewpoints and therefore CANNOT be the absolute, which means when you say "this is absolutely Right and that is absolutely Wrong", you're already fragmented. All relative truths are fragmented.

The more accurate view will accord the most benefits.<br><br>It is like gravity. Newtonian's gravity was very useful. Once that view on gravity came into being, it explained a lot about the world and mankind benefitted.<br><br>Then Einstein came along and proposed a more accurate view of gravity... sure, it did not replace Newtonian gravity theory but with Einstein's proposal, we have a more accurate view.<br><br>Just because Einstein knows that his gravity is not complete; he does not say... GRAVITY IS OUT THERE: NO POINT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND COMING OUT WITH A BETTER VIEW."<br><br>Which is what you people are saying.</div></blockquote>Classical physics is still working on the level of relativity. Now as I explained earlier, Buddhism is not asking you to avoid relative truths. I also said that the first 5 people who touched part of the elephant are NOT WRONG. But neither are these truths absolute. On the level of form we have to work on relative truths, that's where we have our scientific facts, technological advancements, all these comes from worldly knowledge but cannot capture Reality. We work on these knowledge but when we take one view as absolute we miss the essence already. We can never KNOW through conceptuality what is Reality. Thoughts and words can never capture them. The true nature of relative truths IS the ultimate truth is Emptiness (which is beyond the four extremes: existence, nonexistence, both, neither).</div>
