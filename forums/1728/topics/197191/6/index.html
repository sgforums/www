Is it Nirvana?</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Page 135, Buddhism Plain and Simple:<br>We've seen that the abiding self or soul we commonly assume we are is an illusion, a figment of the imagination. Perhaps we've also begun to understand that we conceive all the innumerable aspects of the world in the same manner. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rather than see the wind, or waves - or a stream or a cup or a book - as the constant flux that each is, we imagine them to be solid, persisting, separate, unchanging things.</span><br><br>We attribute this "thingness" to them in the same way we attribute selfhood to human beings. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Instead of seeing the thoroughgoing motion, flux, and flow of experience, we imagine a vast proliferation of innumerable, separated things. In short, we grant selfhood to whatever we find "out there."</span><br><br>Then we make another error. Just as we conceive of a self and counter this notion with a non-self, so also are we taken in by another set of opposing concepts - existence and non-existence. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We get repeatedly caught in this duality, unwilling to see that, like self and not-self, both are phantoms created by consciousness. These concepts (like any concept) simply don't capture Reality.</span><br><br>The Buddha expressed this situation eloquently:<br><br>The world...is generally inclined towards two [views]: existence and non-existence. To them who perceives with right wisdom the uprising of the world as it has come to be, the notion of non-existence in the world does not occur... To them who perceive with right wisdom the ceasing of the world as it has come to be, the notion of existence in the world does not occur.</div></blockquote>Emptiness talks about the emptiness of abiding self or thingness, nor unself, unthingness, or both or neither as said in the quote above.<br><br>Dependant origination talks about Wholeness, unfragmented reality.<br><br>These two are inseperable.</div>
