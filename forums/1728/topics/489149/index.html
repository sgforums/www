                                  sits the Leshan Giant Buddha statue. Carved into the side of Mt. Lingyun, the
                                  colossal statue is over 1,300-years-old and is considered to be the largest
                                  stone Buddha in the world, and by far the tallest pre-modern statue. The site
                                  attracts millions of people every year, including Buddhist pilgrims, making it
                                  something of a sacred destination and an ancient wonder of the world.</span></p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;  vertical-align: baseline; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 18.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A statue honoring Maitreya</span></h2>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: inherit, serif;">The Leshan Giant Buddha statue (also
                                  known as Dafo), is located to the east of Leshan City and sits at the junction
                                  of three rivers; the Min River, Qingyi River, and Dadu River.  It faces
                                  the sacred Mount Emei with the rivers flowing below its feet and depicts a
                                  stout, smiling monk, calmly sitting, resting his hands upon his knees with
                                  heavy-lidded eyes gazing across the river. The statue is believed to be
                                  Maitreya, a Buddha and disciple of Sakyamuni, who is thought to have been the
                                  founder of Buddhism, symbolizing brightness and happiness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: inherit, serif;">Worshiping Maitreya was especially
                                  popular between the 4th and 7th Centuries.  Today, images of him can still
                                  be found in many Buddhist temples throughout China and the Leshan statue is
                                  considered the most inspiring of them all.</span></p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;  vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 18.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The architecture of the
                                  Leshan Giant Buddha</span></h2>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: inherit, serif;">The appeal of the Buddha lies not only
                                  in its size but in its architectural craftsmanship.  The entire statue is
                                  made of stone, except for the ears which were crafted out of wood, then
                                  affixed, and covered with clay. The Buddha’s hair is arranged in special
                                  spiraled curls with 1,021 twists that have been skillfully embedded in the
                                  head.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: inherit, serif;">The statue is ten stories high, and if
                                  the statue stood upright, it would be almost eye to eye with the Statue of
                                  Liberty. The Buddha is so enormous that it is alleged that 100 monks could sit
                                  on one foot. Measuring 71 meters tall (233 feet), the statue has a symmetrical
                                  posture, creating a gracefully relaxed image. Its head is 15 meters (50 feet)
                                  high, its shoulders 28 meters (92 feet) wide, and its smallest toenail can
                                  accommodate a seated person.  Each eyebrow alone is 5.5 meters (18 feet)
                                  while its nose is 6 meters (20 feet) long. A large pair of ears, measuring
                                  seven meters (23 feet), is capable of holding two people inside.</span></p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;  vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 18.5pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The ingenious system of
                                  water drainage</span></h2>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: inherit, serif;">Several drainage passages hidden inside
                                  the Buddha's hair, collar, chest, and back of the ears, have prevented the
                                  statue from serious erosion and weathering over the millennia. The drainage
                                  system of the Giant Buddha is a complex system made up of hidden gutters and
                                  channels, which carry away rainwater and keep the inner parts dry. This is why
                                  the great Buddha has survived intact up until modern times. Compared to when it
                                  was initially completed, the statue looks quite different from how it looks
                                  today. It once sat in a grand 13-story wooden pavilion which protected the
                                  carving from erosion. However, the pavilion was eventually destroyed at the end
                                  of the Ming Dynasty, exposing the statue to the elements.</span></p>

                                  to have been built to calm the turbulent waters that plagued passing boats and
                                  killed many people each year. So, in the Tang Dynasty, a monk named Hai Tong,
                                  decided to carve a giant statue beside the river, hoping it would appease the
                                  river gods and save more local people’s lives. With this belief, the Hai Tong
                                  Monk begged for 20 years to acquire enough funds to begin his work. 
                                  According to legend, when some local government officials wanted to get large
                                  amounts of money from Hai Tong, he said they could have his eyeball but not the
                                  money raised for the Buddha statue. When government funding for the project was
                                  threatened, the monk is said to have gouged out his own eyes to show his
                                  sincerity and devotion to the cause. The officials were scared away, and Hai
                                  Tong saved the money and started the project in 713 AD. The project was half
                                  finished when he passed away and two of his disciples were left to continue the
                                  work. The project was finally completed 90 years later by the local governor in
                                  803 AD. Since so much stone was removed from the cliff face and deposited into
                                  the river below during the construction, the currents of the rivers were, in
                                  fact, altered by the statue, making the waters safe for passing ships.</span></p>

                                  Carvings</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; border: 1pt none windowtext; padding: 0in;"><br> <span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: inherit, serif;">As the biggest carved stone Buddha in
                                  the world, Dafo is featured in Chinese poetry, song and story. For the ancient
                                  Chinese, building a statue of this size and stature was a way of thanking their
                                  gods. Even after its completion, people continued to carve Buddhas, small ones,
                                  all around this massive statue. On the cliffs beside the Giant Buddha, there are
                                  two carved stone warriors in battle robes, holding a halberd (a combined spear
                                  and battle-ax).  Besides the Giant Buddha, are thousands of other carved
                                  Buddhas, making the mountain a museum of Buddhist carvings. Han Dynasty cliff
                                  tombs have also been found at the site and there is an onsite temple and shrine
                                  dedicated to Hai Tong near the Buddha. Mortuary artifacts have been found here
                                  as well making this area particularly important for archaeologists.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.95pt; font-weight: normal;">Today, erosion is the biggest threat to the Leshan Giant
                                  Buddha’s survival. The statue was nearly destroyed by the erosion of wind and
                                  rain before 1963, when the Chinese government began repair work and protection.
                                  In 1996, the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO inscribed the Mount Emei Scenic
                                  area and the Leshan Giant Buddha Scenic Area on their World Heritage List as a
                                  mixed cultural and natural property of the world. Since 2001, it has been
                                  rumored that the equivalent of over 40 million U.S. dollars has been spent to
                                  keep it intact.</span></p>
