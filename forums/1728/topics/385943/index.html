              <p>I agree with you. I understand what you mean because now I have a better understanding of Buddhism. However, these sightings help to build our confidence in Amitabha's pureland. I admit that I kind of clinging on to it, hoping I will see again the next time which is not very healthy right.</p>
              <p>I shared my experience with my friends and a neighbour. They know me well that I am someone who don't lie about this kind of thing. They followed me to temple for chanting for the very first time after I told them what I saw. So it is not all bad when you share your experience. But I must learn not to cling on to it, still learning.</p>

              <p>These phenomenon is not the same as what you said. They are no coincidence. Buddhists will know when they will happen. They will only happen after certain big chanting events or some well practiced Buddhist (eg. monks or layman) passed away.</p>

              <p>Draw one small circle, you have the Buddha and the arahants inside, non returners, draw another circle outside , you have the once returners and keep on drawing circles until, you reach barbaric people who would sooner kill you than you insult the belief and intelligence. </p>
              <p>When one professes faith, ie. Buddhism, one does not automatically become Buddha, depending on circumstances, one slowly grasp the noble truth, and the eightfold path. If one is an atheist, one comprehend from a view point of an atheist originally. If one practises monotheism or polytheism, that's where point of understanding start. How long have it taken to grasp Buddha's teachings? Personal convictions, everybody can form one. Do you intend to call people ignorant and stupid and have them at arm's length. Or do you wish to engage them with skillfull means? </p>

              <p>Some elderly Buddhists told me that these sightings are supposed
              to be hush hush thingy (å¤©æœºä¸�å�¯æ³„æ¼�ï¼‰, not allow to share with others.
              Some said it is ok to share. So who is correct ?
              If it is not allowed to share, why they are on website. I saw
              once myself but did not tape it down because I went unprepared.</p>

Paying homage to relics should be done by others. Just, O king, as it is the business of princes to learn the arts of warfare and the laws of property while husbandry, trading and care of cattle are the business of householders.”</span></p>

              <p>Once a man climbed the mountains, and after much effort and  many hardships, like preparations, crossing rivers and climbing and more climbing, that he reached the summit. Dead tired, he gazed at the rising sun as it climbs over  the horizon, and as he watched, tears flowed from his eyes, the beautiful sight after the long ordeal. Now, back to the ordinary world, he recounted the moment as the sun rises; "Chay!!!" Someone exclaimed"If you want to see the sun rise, you can see it everyday at the back of my flat!"</p>
