              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Preserving and Protecting the Buddhist Heritage of Laos</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shuyin Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-10-17 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At 4am, before even the first peep of sunrise, the sound of
              temple bells ripples through the silence that hangs over Luang Prabang, rousing
              the monks from their slumber to attend the morning chant and waking households
              to kindle their kitchen fires to cook the sticky rice for tak bat, or morning
              alms. It is a daily ritual that has been practiced for centuries past in this
              ancient capital (1354–1560) of the former Lao kingdom of Lan Xang.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The main difference these days is the presence of many more
              foreigners at the morning offering: some out of curiosity, but most to take
              snapshots of the spectacular sight of the parade of orange-clad monks walking
              solemnly through the streets to accept offerings from the villagers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Like many UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Luang Prabang, which
              was listed in 1995, is struggling to find a balance between preserving its
              cultural heritage and coping with the impact of tourism. Almost every home has
              been converted into a guesthouse, restaurant, or travel shop. Much of the local
              population has moved out after selling their properties to foreign investors
              eager to cash in on the opportunities offered by an ever-growing influx of
              tourists. The transformation of Luang Prabang into a tourist Mecca has
              undermined the traditional way of life—both the tangible and intangible. Even
              the Buddhist ritual of alms giving has been turned into a merchandising
              exercise, with signboards marketing the cooking of sticky rice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">While it is impossible to halt the impact of tourism,
              globalization, and technological advances, the preservation and protection of
              Lao history and culture, largely influenced by Theravada Buddhism, is
              important—not merely to woo foreign tourists, but to provide the Lao community
              with a sense of identity and continuity, and to promote respect for cultural
              diversity. This is particularly important in Luang Prabang, often regarded as
              the spiritual heart of Laos. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Bounded by the rivers Mekong and Kham, here is a city
              shrouded in myth and legend. In the Luang Prabang Chronicles, the Buddha
              traveled through the region accompanied by his close disciple Venerable Ananda,
              leaving a number of footprints, one of which is supposedly on the slope of
              Mount Phusi above Vat Si Phutthabat. The Buddha also predicted that a rich and
              powerful capital would be erected at the location, and that his religion would
              be established in the region.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is the protection and preservation of the rich and unique
              Lao cultural, religious, and historical heritage that underlines the
              establishment of the Buddhist Heritage Project (BHP) in 2005 by one of the
              country’s most venerated monks, the late Pha Khamchan Virachitta Maha Thela,
              abbot of Vat Saen Sukharam, and Hans Berger, a German photographer with whom he
              collaborated on a photographic project of Buddhist monastic life and rituals in
              Laos.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With keen foresight, Pha Khamchan understood that much of
              this would be lost with the passing of time and the social changes taking
              place. Hence, he safeguarded in his temple a massive collection of photographs,
              documents, manuscripts, religious texts, and artifacts. His aim was that these
              materials would be used by younger generations to study the history of Buddhism
              and of Laos. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, according to local custom upon the death of a monk,
              all photographs found in his possession are burned together with his body
              because it is considered inauspicious to set eyes on the photographs of the dead.
              To avert such a fate, Pha Khamchan entrusted an astonished Berger with a large
              photographic collection in 1995, with this instruction: “This is my collection
              of photographs, and this is the history of Lao Buddhism. I want you to take
              care of this. I am a very old monk. Here, nobody understands what these
              photographs are. These are important for future Lao generations and I want
              these photographs to make it to the future Lao generations.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The BHP’s first initiative was the Buddhist Archive of
              Photography, (renamed the Buddhist Archives of Luang Prabang in 2013). With
              permission from the Lao Sangha, the BHP team searched the collections of 19
              monasteries. The result was an incredible collection of photographs in various
              forms, some of which dated to the late 1800s, with many taken by
              “photographer-monks.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With a grant from the British Library's Endangered Archives
              Programme (EAP), and the guidance of international conservation experts, Berger
              and a small team of dedicated young Lao people (which included Dr. Khamvone
              Boulyaphonh, the current director of the Buddhist Archives of Luang Prabang,)
              scoured the mass of collected materials, cleaning, identifying, digitizing, and
              cataloguing each item before storing them in proper conditions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Following Pha Khamchan’s demise in 2007, the BHP continued
              its work under the patronage of the Lao Buddhist Fellowship and the sangha of
              Luang Prabang. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With more than 35,000 photographs and negatives, many of
              which have been hidden away for decades, numerous ancient palm leaf
              manuscripts, religious texts, official documents, personal letters, audio
              recordings, and various rare artifacts, the archive is one of the largest in
              Southeast Asia on the history of Theravada Buddhism in the region. Even the
              National Library of Laos does not have such extensive resources as many
              documents in the national archives were destroyed after the 1953–75 Lao
              revolution. These ancient manuscripts and documents present valuable insight
              into the thoughts of leading figures in Lao Buddhism. Pha Khamchan’s collection
              includes 340 ancient palm-leaf manuscripts and 85 leporello manuscripts, the
              oldest of which is dated 1791 and contains an ancient Buddhist prayer called
              Kammavaca used for the ordination of monks and novices. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To date, more than 35,000 photographs and several manuscripts
              have been digitized and catalogued in Lao and English languages. The originals
              are kept in Luang Prabang and remain the property of the sangha. Digital copies
              are available at the National Library of Laos in Vientiane and the British
              Library, and are accessible online through the EAP’s website.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The archive is housed in Sala Thammaviharn at Vat
              Suvannakhili, a beautifully restored two-floor French colonial building that
              was once the monks’ residence. With a renewed interest in meditation in Laos, a
              permanent Meditation Exhibition has been set up on the ground floor and is open
              to the public, offering a rare glimpse into the meditative life of monks,
              novices, and nuns in Laos.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The restoration of Vat Suvannakhili is one of the BHP’s
              conservation efforts, which also included many other ancient temples that were
              in ruins, such as Vat Khan, built in the 18th century, and Vat Hat Siaow. Aided
              by the Badur Foundation of London, UNESCO Heritage House, and local and
              international experts, the conservation works were carried out with the
              engagement of the local community, with special attention paid to adhering to
              ancient and traditional methods, such as the use of building materials and
              artistic forms. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Another unique aspect of Luang Prabang’s heritage are the
              sacred rituals and ceremonies of Theravada Buddhism, many of which have been
              forgotten elsewhere but are kept alive by the monks of the 34 monasteries.
              Through its Buddhist educational programs and support for the sangha, the BHP ensures
              the existence of a thriving sangha responsible for the continuity of Lao
              Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 2010, under the direction of Pha One Keo Sitthivong,
              chairman of the Lao Buddhist Fellowship Organization of Luang Prabang Province,
              the Buddhist Academy was established at Vat Pa Pha-O, north of the city of
              Luang Prabang. Most of the academy’s 500 novices, aged 10–19, come from
              impoverished farming communities in the north of the province and have no means
              or access to public education. At the academy’s lower secondary school, which
              is accredited by the Department of Education, these children are taught
              Buddhism and other secular subjects such as science and mathematics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, due to a lack of financial support, the prospects of
              furthering their education is limited for most of the novices. Many will leave
              monastic life and return to their communities. To equip those leaving with
              skills and opportunities for meaningful employment, plans are underway for a
              vocational school of arts. This will also address the poverty issue in the
              area. Furthermore, the planned school will seek to revive many of the arts and
              artisanal skills that have either disappeared completely or are on the verge of
              extinction, such as bronze casting and high glaze ceramic production, that form
              part of the colorful tapestry of Lao culture. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Aware of the importance of physical documentation, the BHP
              has also published a number of books on the cultural practices, ceremonies, and
              traditional knowledge that has been passed down from generation to generation.
              Korb Jai Ti Lieow Boeng (Thank You for Looking Here), originally printed in
              2000, is a schoolbook and the only one in the Lao language on the country’s
              Buddhist ceremonies and rituals. Pha Bunchankeo Photichitto and Lao Language is
              a linguistic study of the Lao language in the form of a dictionary. These
              publications, together with the archives, provide an invaluable and permanent
              data bank for future generations for the study and research on Lao history and
              culture, even as the winds of change continue to sweep across Luang Prabang.</span></p>
