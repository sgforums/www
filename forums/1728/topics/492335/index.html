              millions around the world marked the end of the holy month of Ramadan last
              week, a cloud hung over celebrations in Japan. Muslims here say they feel they
              are constantly under the ever-watchful eyes of the police.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Otsuka
              Mosque in Tokyo usually hosts around a few dozen Muslims for morning prayers,
              but hundreds packed the small prayer rooms last Wednesday on Eid al-Fitr, the
              holiday that signals the end of Ramadan.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“We had to
              hold the prayers four separate times so all the people lining up could fit in,”
              explains Haroon Qureshi, secretary-general of the mosque’s Japan Islamic Trust
              organization. “There must have been 1,000 people waiting to pray.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Qureshi,
              like almost all of Japan’s roughly 100,000 Muslim residents, is no stranger to
              police surveillance. However, the true extent of the systematic profiling and
              surveillance of Japan’s Muslim community only came to light in 2010, when over
              100 internal Metropolitan Police Department documents were leaked online.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The leak
              revealed that the police had compiled detailed profiles on 72,000 Muslims,
              including personal information such as bank account statements, passport
              details and records of their movements. The leak also showed that police had at
              times planted cameras inside mosques and used undercover agents to infiltrate
              Islamic nonprofit organizations and halal grocers and restaurants.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The leaked
              documents, which were made available unredacted online and included the
              personal profiles of dozens of Muslims, were downloaded more than 10,000 times
              in the first few weeks.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>A detailed
              breakdown of Qureshi’s life was among the documents, but he says he wasn’t
              surprised. He had known he was being followed for a long time.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“They
              follow me many times, I would always see them. After the London bombings in
              2005 it got worse,” Qureshi says. “I found them surrounding my house for three
              days. For two days I waited, and on the third day I went out and shouted, ‘What
              are you looking for?’ Only then, they left.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Qureshi
              says the leak has had a profound impact on the Muslim community and has soured
              its relationship with broader Japanese society. He says the leak led to several
              divorces between foreign Muslims and their Japanese spouses, usually due to the
              Japanese families’ concerns about the authorities’ spying.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“We have
              nothing to hide; we aren’t doing anything wrong,” Qureshi says. “Personally I
              don’t care (about being spied on), but for others it’s not good. Some Japanese
              people convert to Islam and come here to the mosque, but then the intelligence
              (services) follow them so much, at their home, their office, and they are so
              scared that they stop coming.”</span></p>

              gives nod to profiling</span></h3>

              Hayashi, 37, is a Japanese Muslim who converted to Islam in 2001. Roughly 10
              percent of Muslims in Japan are local converts, the rest are foreign nationals.
              Last year Hayashi became the country’s first female Muslim lawyer.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Along with
              a team of fellow lawyers, she recently took the national and Tokyo governments
              — the bodies responsible for the National Police Agency and Metropolitan Police
              Department, respectively — to Japan’s highest court to challenge the profiling
              and surveillance program.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>After the
              2010 leak, 17 of the Muslims named in the documents sued the government and
              police in a bid to have the widespread spying ruled illegal. In 2014, the Tokyo
              District Court agreed that the leak had violated the plaintiffs’ right to
              privacy and awarded them ¥90 million in compensation, but it also ruled that
              the intelligence-gathering was “necessary and inevitable.” The court
              sidestepped the issue of blanket profiling by religion, as did the Tokyo High
              Court in an appeal the following year.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Earlier
              this year, the group asked the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality
              of the lower court’s decision.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>The leaked
              documents refer to all those profiled as “suspects.” Their lawyers argued that
              spying solely on the basis of faith, rather than any suspicious activity,
              breached their plaintiffs’ rights to privacy, equality and freedom of religion.
              The Supreme Court dismissed the case on May 31.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“If
              somebody did something wrong, did something suspicious, then the police have a
              good reason to watch them. But when you are just being Muslims — acting like a
              Muslim — it doesn’t make sense,” argues Hayashi. “Everybody is a suspect.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>She says
              that while the leak uncovered the spying taking place in 2010, the Supreme
              Court ruling effectively gave the police a green light to continue surveillance
              of Japan’s Muslims. And this, she and other Muslim residents believe, is
              exactly what they are doing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“It is
              definitely still happening,” Hayashi says. “We see the police all the time at
              the mosques. It is also clear the police are watching the children, treating
              them like potential homegrown terrorists. They will grow up feeling isolated
              and excluded.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Among the
              72,000 Muslims cited in the leaked documents were 1,600 children attending
              public schools in Tokyo.</span></p>
              <h3 style="margin-top: 15.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 15.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 24.7pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>‘No
              domestic threat in Japan’</span></h3>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>A National
              Police Agency representative told a human rights committee hearing on the
              matter at the United Nations in 2014 that they couldn’t provide details on
              counterterrorism “information-gathering activities,” but that surveillance was
              always carried out in accordance with the law. Otherwise, the police have been
              largely silent on the issue.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Sebastian
              Maslow, assistant professor at the Tohoku University School of Law, questions
              the value of the surveillance program.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“Islamic
              terrorism represents no domestic threat in Japan today, and never has in the
              past,” he says. “Advocates for the surveillance would argue it is the reason
              for the absence of terrorist attacks, but the large-scale profiling of Japan’s
              Islamic population does not correspond to the scale of the domestic risk.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Maslow
              says that since coming to power, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has used the specter
              of the “war on terror” that was declared after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on
              the U.S. as a catalyst to enable Japan to become more assertive on the global
              stage.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“Islamic
              terrorism has served as a narrative to emphasize the need for a change in
              national security posture in the context of the Japan-U.S. alliance,” Maslow
              says. “As a result of this discourse, Japan’s Islamic population has suffered
              prejudice and unfounded concerns.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Robert
              Dujarric, director of Temple University’s Institute of Contemporary Asian
              Studies, agrees that the threat of a domestic terrorist attack in Japan is very
              low, while stressing that there is never zero risk.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>In Japan,
              Dujarric says, “For organizations like the Islamic State, there is just not a
              lot to gain by launching an attack. It’s also very tough to organize. In the
              United States you have the easy access to weapons, and in Europe there are a
              lot of Muslim supporters; in Japan you have neither.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Japan’s
              domestic intelligence agencies, Dujarric argues, were striving to stay
              relevant, but he questions whether they even had the necessary skills and
              resources to analyze the data they were collecting from their surveillance of

              University professor and Japan Times columnist Jeff Kingston says that although
              Japan has the advantage of being an island nation with strict border controls,
              the risk of terrorist attacks involving Japanese abroad will continue to rise.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Last week
              Reuters reported that the government intends to increase spending aimed at
              preventing terrorist attacks abroad by tens of billions of yen in the wake of
              the massacre by Islamist militants of 20 hostages at a cafe in Dhaka, including
              seven Japanese.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>Kingston
              argues that the increased threat facing Japanese workers overseas is partly due
              to Abe’s more active involvement in the Middle East. What’s more, he says, the
              recent use of overseas development assistance funds for security purposes means
              that aid workers are now more likely to be targeted, as they were in
              Bangladesh.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“Japan’s
              quiet diplomacy, its quite low-key posture, had kept it out of the way for a
              long time. Abe certainly raised the country above the parapet,” Kingston says.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>And while stressing
              that the government spying on Muslims in Japan was over the top, Kingston says
              he wasn’t surprised by the Supreme Court’s ruling, as the security forces have
              never had a negative ruling go against them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 11.25pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: 22.45pt; background: #FBFBFB;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #333333;'>“The
              government needs to strike a balance,” Kingston says, between security and
              freedom from surveillance. “At the moment, the balance is in favor of the
              security forces.”</span></p>

              worried that anti-Muslim sentiment in Japan is increasing in the wake of
              high-profile terrorist attacks against Japanese abroad, and he is deeply
              troubled by the government’s profiling of all young Muslims as potential
              homegrown threats.</span></p>

              found it difficult to come to terms with the fact that his government

              Muslims in Japan, 90 percent of whom are foreign nationals. Around 36,000
              Indonesians, 11,000 Bangladeshis and 13,000 Pakistanis reside in Japan, the
