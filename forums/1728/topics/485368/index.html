              <p>Nice post by Kyle in Emptiness group.</p>
              <p>Kyle Dixon Nenad, If you insist that your point of view is somehow the 
              correct treatment of these issues, then yes it may certainly appear as 
              if "this group seems to be too much focused on that type of confusion". 
              However, this group also does not insist that the so-called individual 
              is merely a thought, but rather explores the fact that the illusion of 
              an individual reference point depends on multiple factors.</p>
              <p>So 
              while HoM is very happy with simply denying thought, and then 
              identifying with 'this that is', touting that there cannot be multiple 
              factors because "there is only one"... emptiness traditions do not do 
              this. For traditions associated with emptiness inquiry, the illusion of 
              an individual is also created by imputation, but other factors such as 
              habitual patterns of grasping which create the appearance of 
              identification go into the illusion as well.</p>
              <p>HoM may state that a
               belief cannot be held, nor let go of, on the grounds that the 
              individual who would perform such actions is an abstraction which is 
              suggested by thought. However, in the opinion of emptiness traditions; 
              while the alleged identity may be partly a byproduct of imputation, that
               imputation also becomes interwoven into the fabric of behavior that the
               illusory entity appears to involve itself with. So in addition to that 
              imputation, there is other conditioning. And the actions predicated upon
               that conditioning occur habitually.</p>
              <p>I bring this up because the 
              very act of 'holding' or grasping is another factor which reifies a 
              subject relating to objects. For the very act of 'holding' presupposes 
              something to be held and a subject to hold it, and that activity in and 
              of itself implies these two. The action or activity literally creates 
              the illusion of a subject-object dichotomy, and if that illusion is not 
              seen for what it is, then the entire process runs away with itself, 
              becoming an intricate and delusional structure of habitual tendencies 
              which are conventionally referred to as a 'self'. Again, there is no 
              self contained therein, within, or apart from that activity, but the 
              delusion surrounding that activity cannot see that in the absence of 
              insight which reveals it to be so.</p>
              <p>For example, if we were to say
               there is only unpleasant emotions and no entity which is feeling those 
              emotions; emptiness would argue that those emotions are still arising 
              due to either accepting or rejecting. The very act of accepting and/or 
              rejecting presupposes something to be accepted or rejected, and the very
               act itself (along with the presupposition the action is based upon) is 
              precisely what the entity is. The entity cannot be found apart from that
               action, and ultimately the so-called entity cannot be found within that
               action either, but under the sway of delusion this is not apparent. 
              That is what the notion of karma truly is: 'action', but it is 
              delusional action which is predicated upon the misunderstanding that the
               apparent dependencies and relationships between subjects and objects, 
              or objects and objects etc., is valid. So emptiness seeks to penetrate 
              these subtle assumptions, presuppositions, conditioning behaviors and so
               on by revealing the unreality of the factors they are based upon. It is
               a very thorough and comprehensive process, which is also very 
              liberating. If done skillfully it utterly exhausts these subtle 
              tendencies and neuroses, and with the pacification of those tendencies, 
              the illusion of the entity which can exist or not exist is also 
              pacified.</p>
              <p>HoM of course scoffs at this because in your view you 
              merely negate the thought of an 'I', or the thought of a 'me', thoughts 
              of 'they', 'he', 'she', etc., on the presupposition that what you really
               are is the faculty of knowing which is inseparable from what is known. 
              So your 'ultimate' (knowing-known) is readily available and quite easy 
              to intuit by dispensing with what you refer to as 'thought-stories' and 
              simply recognizing the inseparability of the knower and known. And that 
              is all well and good, but a completely different view.</p>
              <p>So when 
              you make a statement such as 'this group is focused too much on that 
              type of confusion', it is because in your opinion, and in the opinion of
               HoM, who carry a certain view, such things are not required. And this 
              is due to the nature of the view you seek to engender, which is utterly 
              different from the view of emptiness.</p>
              <p>Now, does emptiness 
              ultimately contend that all of the aforementioned delusional actions, 
              dependencies, illusory entities and so on are valid and true? Not at 
              all. But they appear to be for those who are caught up in the throes of 
              that ignorance. In response to that HoM would merely say, "well there is
               no one to be caught up in anything!" And that is partly true, but not 
              in the sense that HoM means, where thought is merely being objectified 
              by thought. That type of view does not cut through the illusion of 
              entityhood. That is why you see people in HoM who merely state that 
              negative emotions and expressions of that nature simply appear 'to no 
              one', which honestly is just a subtle form of depersonalization it is 
              little more than a form of suppression and repression, where you 
              identify with the knowing and attempt to intuit that "everything is me",
               "I'm all of this, even the so-called negative stuff which really isn't 
              negative because it's all me and I am it, yet at the same time there is 
              no me".... that type of view is all well and good but it is not an 
              acceptable resolution to the deeply engrained habitual patterns which 
              give rise to the illusion of an individual. The individual still 
              persists in that type of view, it is only transferred onto a new form of
               itself, in most cases far more fortified than the previous individual.<br> 6 hrs · Edited · Unlike · 7<br> Kyle Dixon In addition to 'action' which is predicated upon the 
              misunderstanding that the apparent dependencies and relationships 
              between subjects and objects, or objects and objects etc., are valid; 
              another aspect of the issue is that those dependencies and relationships
               themselves, directly arise from that action. Though only apparently. 
              The grasping [action predicated upon delusion] presupposes the grasped 
              [object], however the very act of grasping directly manifests the 
              grasped through implication, the very arising of the grasped [object] 
              implies, and therefore appears to give rise to the grasper [subject] and
               so on. Each implied factor becomes the cause for (and effect of) each 
              corresponding factor, and the illusory web of factors build 
              exponentially as a result.</p>
              <p>At no time within this apparent 
              process do any of these attributes (subjects, objects and so on) 
              actually inherently arise, but they appear to. And becoming taken in by 
              that process, conditioned by it and investing in it, is precisely the 
              occurrences which solidify our experiences as independent and autonomous
               beings which exist in an environment separate from us, living lives 
              extended in time which will eventually end, and so on.</p>
              <p>As 
              familiarization with these afflictive processes build up and solidify, 
              they become more deeply engrained and at a certain point, the myriad 
              pieces of our experiences (which are implied by these processes) are 
              then mistaken to be inherent aspects of an inherent experience. We 
              become conditioned, and we only ever know and relate to the imaginary 
              figments of these processes, so attachment to them arises, aversion to 
              other aspects arise, and as a result of that, the implied aspects of 
              experience are solidified even further. Eventually we are here, as we 
              are, fully entrenched in this intricate and deceitful web.<br> 6 hrs · Edited · Unlike · 7</p>

              truths that we discover - impermanence, unsatisfactoriness/suffering, 
              not-self, dependent origination, etc. So if you truly, fully, comprehend
               the four noble truths, you also overcome the perception of permanence, 
              satisfactoriness, self, independence, inherency, and so forth.</span><br><br><span>If
               you see the four noble truths, you clearly see dependent origination in
               action. You clearly perceive that suffering - the eight kinds of 
              suffering - is rooted in craving, in grasping, in delusion, and you 
              clearly perceive that there is path which leads to the end of that 
              craving, that grasping, that delusion.</span><br><br><span>So
               you see dependent origination Directly, not just as an inference, but 
              you see ignorance in action - what does ignorance means? What does 
              karmic propensities mean? Many of us think of karmic propensities and 
              ignorance as being some kind of ghostly, hidden, almost mystical force 
              hiding somewhere and affecting our lives from a hidden 'subconscious' 
              component of consciousness stored away from sight. That is having an 
              inherent view, a self-view of ignorance and karmic propensities. We need
               to directly See that cause of suffering and that suffering as the total
               exertion of our experience in seamless dependencies.</span><br><br><span>As
               Thusness say, having the view of afflicted dependent origination is 
              having the enlightened view. The enlightened view does not conceive of a
               sufferer, suffering does not come from a self. How does it arise? Based
               on conditions - delusion, grasping, craving.</span><br><br><span>The
               totality of our experience is being shaped moment by moment by our 
              delusions (either that, or by wisdom), by our sense of self, and with it
               all kinds of grasping and craving and afflictions. Taste it, see it for
               yourself, what is it like? See that grasping in action, see that 
              becoming in action, see the birth of suffering. Only when you see 
              suffering and the cause of suffering, only then can you realize the path
               and the end of that suffering. (Otherwise you become some neo-advaitins
               that say the path is not necessary)</span><br><br><span>And
               the moment you perceive the nature of that - that every phenomena is 
              dependently arising, is empty of a self, is empty of inherent existence,
               at that moment, by realizing the four noble truths you realize 
              dependent origination and you realize emptiness. And with that, you 
              attain liberation. That is how overcoming the ignorance of the four 
              noble truths is so crucial. From a view that a Subject interacts with an
               Object, to a view of seamless process of dependencies without 
              self/Self, and furthermore clarity into the workings of delusion, 
              grasping, craving I-making and suffering.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
