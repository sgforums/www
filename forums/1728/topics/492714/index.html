              Shurangama Sutra (The most important sutra in Buddhism). It covers almost everything Lord Buddha teaches. A Sutra that answer to so many why why why.
                              
                              The following link provides complete version of the Sutra as what Lord Buddha has spoken + commentary by the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua that assist us to understand the Sutra without much difficulty.

                              By Venerable Master Hsuan Hua:
                              
                              Within Buddhism, there are very many important sutras. However, the most important Sutra is the Shurangama Sutra. If there are places which have the Shurangama Sutra, then the Proper Dharma dwells in the world. If there is no Shurangama Sutra, then the Dharma Ending Age appears. Therefore, we Buddhist disciples, each and every one, must bring our strength, must bring our blood, and must bring our sweat to protect the Shurangama Sutra. In the Sutra of the Ultimate Extinction of the Dharma, it says very, very clearly that in the Dharma Ending Age, the Shurangama Sutra is the first to disappear, and the rest of the sutras disappear after it. If the Shurangama Sutra does not disappear, then the Proper Dharma Age is present. Because of that, we Buddhist disciples must use our lives to protect the Shurangama Sutra, must use vows and resolution to protect the Shurangama Sutra, and cause the Shurangama Sutra to be known far and wide, reaching every nook and cranny, reaching into each and every dust-mote, reaching out to the exhaustion of empty space and of the Dharma Realm. If we can do that, then there will be a time of Proper Dharma radiating great light. 
                              
                              Why would the Shurangama Sutra be destroyed? It is because it is too true. The Shurangama Sutra is the Buddhaâ€™s true body. The Shurangama Sutra is the Buddhaâ€™s sharira. The Shurangama Sutra is the Buddhaâ€™s true and actual stupa and shrine. Therefore, because the Shurangama Sutra is so true, all the demon kings use all kinds of methods to destroy the Shurangama Sutra. They begin by starting rumors, saying that the Shurangama Sutra is phony. Why do they say the Shurangama Sutra is phony? It is because the Shurangama Sutra speaks too truly, especially in the sections on The Four Decisive Deeds, the Twenty-five Sages Describing Perfect Penetration, and the States of the Fifty Skandha Demons. Those of off-center persuasions and externally-oriented ways, weird demons and strange freaks, are unable to stand it. Consequently there are a good many senseless people who claim that the Shurangama Sutra is a forgery. 
                              
                              Now, the principles set forth in the Shurangama Sutra are on the one hand proper, and on the other in accord with principle, and the weird demons and strange freaks, those in various cults and sects, all cannot hide away their forms. Most senseless people, in particular unwise scholars and garbage-collecting professors â€œTread upon the holy writ.â€� With their extremely scant and partial understanding, they are confused and unclear, lacking real erudition and true and actual wisdom. That is why they falsely criticize. We who study the Buddhadharma should very deeply be aware of these circumstances. Therefore, wherever we go, we should bring up the Shurangama Sutra. Wherever we go, we should propagate the Shurangama Sutra. Wherever we go, we should introduce the Shurangama Sutra to people. Why is that? It is because we wish to cause the Proper Dharma long to dwell in the world. 
                              
                              If the Shurangama Sutra is regarded as true, then there is no problem. To verify its truth, let me say that if the Shurangama Sutra were phony, then I would willingly fall into the hells forever through all eternity - for being unable to recognize the Buddhadharma - for mistaking the false for true. If the Shurangama Sutra is true, then life after life in every time I make the vow to propagate the Great Dharma of the Shurangama, that I shall in every time and every place propagate the true principles of the Shurangama. 
                              
                              Everyone should pay attention to the following point. How could the Shurangama Sutra not have been spoken by the Buddha? No one else could have spoken the Shurangama Sutra. And so I hope that all those people who make senseless accusations will wake up fast and stop creating the causes for suffering in the Hell of Pulling Out Tongues. No matter who the scholar is, no matter what country students of the Buddhadharma are from, all should quickly mend their ways, admit their mistakes, and manage to change. There is no greater good than that. I can then say that all who look at the Shurangama Sutra, all who listen to the Shurangama Sutra, and all who investigate the Shurangama Sutra, will very quickly accomplish Buddhahood.

              Hi Dharma bro / Sis, Lord Buddha has warned us since 2500yrs ago, during our present period (dharma ending period), it is common to see fake teaching / demonic teaching. He further emphasized that it is important to follow the teaching of Sutra. Any dharma teacher who teach outside of Sutra will likely spreading demonic or trying to destroy the true teaching of Buddhism. The Shurangama Sutra and Mantra will be the first to disappear during current dharma ending period. Any good person who wish to cultivate the true teaching should constantly refer to Sutra especially Shurangama Sutra and recite the Shurangama Mantra in heart. The heart mantra as follow : "She Tan Toh, Poh Dah lar" Any person who constantly recite this short mantra will not easily confuse by demonic teaching and will be able to hear / see / practice true dharma peacefully. 
                                  
                                  Any good person who spread, read or chant Shurangama Sutra and Mantra will have unlimited merits.

              <p>Indeed another term for demon is mara. Mara is also related to aggregates. There is no academic study, science or research, without first  going into sequential releasing for developing in depth understanding or PHD in a specific field of study, needless to mention beyond academic.  In a Theravada approach to visit Shurangama sutra, it becomes Theravada. And when Buddha started to discussion in the Lotus sutra, all Theravada disciples withdrawn themselves as they find it difficult to accept. Shurangama Sutra is discovering an infinite equal self of all. It is marvellously indescribable, and a finite approach is liken to researcher that will never bear fruit of infinity. Constant calm pleasant mind reading over and over again is delightful  due to its infinity, and simultaneous upgrading from within. Unlike all worldly books, Shurangama sutra is free of a specific yet all encompassing. And through the tutorial found in this sutra that providing finest details from mote of dust to aggregates and the entire cosmos, it leads reader to rediscover gradually or spontaneously, its wealth of wisdom that no worldly and religious books could measure up.</p>
              <p>Shurangama sutra is from the inherent truth of all buddha and beings. May all continue to enjoy and delight together the beauty of dharma</p>

              pass lives. Nothing to do directly with achieving enlightenment. It is a preliminary
              basic for any form of meditation. </span></p>

Twelve TathÄ�gatas arose in succession for one kalpa, and its last Buddha was named “Surpassing Sun And Moon Light”. That Buddha taught me the SamÄ�dhi from Mindfulness of Buddha.</span></p>
              <p style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 20px; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; word-wrap: break-word; color: #444444; font-family: 'Open Sans'; -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #008000;">For example, there are persons, of one focused on recollecting, and one person focused on forgetting. Such two persons, if they come across each other, it is as if they do not come across each other, or if they see each other, it is as if they do not see each other. If these two persons mutually recollect each other, with the duo’s mindful recollection being deep, thus, even from life to life, similar to form and shadow, they will not depart from each other. The ten directions’ TathÄ�gatas are sympathetically mindful of sentient beings, like a mother recollecting her child. If the child runs away, although there is recollection, what is the use? If the child recollects the mother, like when the mother recollects the child, the mother and child, in life after life, will not be far away from each other. If sentient beings’ minds recollect the Buddha [AmitÄ�bha], and are mindful of the Buddha, now or in the future, they will definitely see the Buddha. With the Buddha not far away, without use of expedient means, they will, by themselves, attain awakening of their minds.</span></p>

I, when on the fundamental causal ground, with my mind being mindful of the Buddha, entered the Patience of Non-Birth. Now in this world, I gather those mindful of the Buddha, for return to his Pure Land. The Buddha asked about Perfect Penetration, and I have no other choice, than to gather in the six roots, with pure mindfulness of the Buddha in continuous succession, to attain SamÄ�dhi, as this is the foremost method.’</span> (<em style="box-sizing: border-box; border: 0px; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">The Great Buddha Crown’s ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama SÅ«tra’s Section On MahÄ�sthÄ�maprÄ�pta Bodhisattva’s Perfect Penetration With Mindfulness Of Buddha – Translated from Chinese into English in 2556 B.E. by UpÄ�saka Shen Shi’an from Singapore)</em></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Just curious, this Sutra is captured in the form of conversations of the Buddha with Ananda. If Ananda is the one that reproduced this account, wouldn't it be collected in one of the four nikayas? Ananda is considered an Arahant in early Buddhism, in this account is his attainment considered different? The content's level seems highly advance as it culminated with detailed analysis of means to release each aggregates one by one and symptoms that will appear to judge the entire progress. Such details do not appear in early Buddhism materials. Usually this type of presentation should be later writings that appeared later than heart sutra in my opinion.</p></div>

Not all buddhism materials were brought to China then, which means the volumn collected are not fully, but enough to achieve enlightenment. And in China, there were quite a number of materials lost or destroyed during many periods of destroying buddhism.</p></div>
