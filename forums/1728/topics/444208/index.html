              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I am a beginner practitioner and would like to learn to give more.  So far for me, giving has mainly entailed donating money to charities, and giving time and attention to friends and family.  I would like to start giving the gift of dharma.  Kindly advise how to go about doing it.  Thank you.</p>

              <p>If you have understood well the teachings of the Buddha, sharing what you have learnt and any insights you may have, is a form of giving the gift of Dharma.  These can be done in person, via writing articles/books, or like some of us here, sharing online.</p>
              <p>There are also people who donate money to publish Dharma publications, to be freely given out at Buddhist bookshelves.  However, an older Buddhist friend recently cautioned us to be mindful of what we donate towards.  Don't simply give money the moment people mention that they are printing Dharma books.  Take the time out to find out that the material to be sponsored is truly the correct teaching of the Buddha.  (This older Buddhist friend has encountered free publications that weren't teaching the correct concepts.)</p>
              <p>Involving others in Dharma activities is also a form of gifting Dharma.  For example, if your temple is holding a talk, chanting session or meditation lessons, you can invite friends and family to join in.  (Of course, please do so without coercing or putting anyone off.  I daresay discernment is also needed when figuring out when and how to share.)</p>

              <p>just add one point,</p>
              <p>you should not be <strong>too </strong>fixated on the notion of giving for the sake of the merits/giving.  But do it in a nonchalant non-agenda way, as the conditions arise, you do it because u r in the position to do so without too much calculation.</p>
              <p>this is the spirit of buddhism and in tune with truth.</p>

              <p>Anger is unwholesome, because it leads us to do foolish things, create karma and further suffering. Anger itself is suffering.</p>
              <p>Buddhism allows us to permanently end greed, anger, ignorance. It awakens us from the darkness of our ignorance to the brightness of our original nature, pure awareness.</p>

              </p><p>In practicing giving of material things or fearlessness we are enlarging the sphere of our care and transcending our self-centered attachments. Since the goal is Original Purity in Limitless-Oneness, our giving should not stem from selfish or prejudiced motives and should not be discriminating to the recipients. The ideal act of giving should be sincere, spontaneous, and responsive to the need of whomever one encounters. It should also be free from expectation of any return, reward, fame, admiration, affection, etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Helping others obtain material comfort or physical well-being is important but temporary because what one can do is little and there is no end to needs and suffering. Besides, one's well-being is also determined by his inner life, and when he lacks peace of mind or falls into deep depression, all the external comforts in the world mean nothing. The giving of Dharma aims at this fundamental salvation--to show everyone the path to inner peace and freedom and help them advance on it. In addition to the ideal qualities mentioned in the last paragraph, the giving of Dharma should base on both knowledge of Buddhist teachings and insight gained through practice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All practices of giving should be brought into connection with the giving of Dharma because only in this way can the help become ultimate and thorough. In this way the giving of material or fearlessness becomes truly a sublimation toward Limitless-Oneness. The connection with Dharma can be indirect and remote such as maintaining an intention to introduce the teachings of Buddha in the future when the circumstance becomes appropriate. The connection with Dharma can be direct and immediate such as repeating silently a Buddha's name or a mantra during the act of giving.</p>
              <p>In Limitless-Oneness each act of giving is an expression of boundless compassion to all beings. On the surface an act of giving benefits only a certain number of beings at a particular juncture of space and time; nevertheless, through continuous practice with the awareness of Original Purity in Limitless-Oneness the artificial boundary of self-centeredness will diminish and disappear, and consequently each act of giving becomes a wave in the ocean of compassionate salvation activities of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas transcending limits of recipient, space and time. In Limitless-Oneness the fundamental discrimination of giver and recipient has vaporized into thin air; each act of giving is as natural and free from an awareness of self-and-others as one taking food when hungry.</p>
