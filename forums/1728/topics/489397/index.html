              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Udarata took on the responsibility of
              protecting Buddhism when the Maritime Provinces went under Christian rule in
              the 17th century. The Tooth relic was brought to the capital city, by
              Wimaladharmasuriya I and the king became its custodian. The major places of traditional
              worship such as Anuradhapura, Mahiyangana, Sri Pada were in Udarata territory
              and Udarata kings took responsibility for their maintenance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">There was a deep loyalty to Buddhism in
              the Udarata. Knox (1659-1679) observed that Udarata inhabitants had a ‘Budu Ge’
              in their garden, where they ‘lay flowers, food and candles every morning’. The
              public made regular pilgrimages to Anuradhapura to worship at the Sri Maha
              Bodhi. Knox said ‘pilgrims set up tents around the Tree, there are dancers and
              jugglers, and the women dress in their best. Ceremonies are always in the
              night, and last three or four days till the full moon.’ People gifted land to
              temples. Pahalavela kumbura was offered to Atkande vihara by Teliyaskatuwe
              lekam and Maddumaya (Historical Manuscripts Commission, 1933). Temples such as
              Hanguranketa potgul viharaya, Mahiyangana vihara and Alu vihare, Matale held
              annual peraheras.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Udarata had ‘rock cut’ viharas, with the
              stupa hidden inside a cave and attention centering on the image house. Selected
              temples from different parts of the kingdom were elevated to Raja maha viharas.
              The five great Raja maha viharas were Medawala, Gangaramaya, Dambulla, Ridi and
              Degaldoruwa. Royal endowments and private donations made these temples very
              rich. Villagers also built temples. Damunumeya vihara was built by the
              prominent villagers of the Damunumeya village, in Hanguranketa. Naranvita
              vihara was built by the villagers in the reign of Narendrasinha (1709-1739).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Udarata made a major contribution to
              Buddhism by re-establishing the upasampada which had died out in the 16th
              century. Burmese bhikkus brought upasampada in 1597, 1602 and 1697, but a
              permanent upsampada only came in 1753 when Thai bhikkus arrived and helped to
              create the Siyam Nikaya. This Nikaya claimed unbroken succession from
              Anuradhapura‘s Maha Vihara, since the Thai bhikkus came from the ‘Sihala
              sangha’ of Siam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Malvatu and Asgiriya were made the centres
              of the Siyam Nikaya. Each had a Mahanayake, appointed by the king, with two
              anunayakes. Kirti Sri Rajasinha (1747-82) then placed all temples in the island
              under Malwatu and Asgiri. Malwatu was given control over the solosmasthana
              (Anuradhapura) Sri Pada, Ridi vihara and all temples in the Maritime Provinces.
              Asgiri had Polonnaruwa, Mahiyangana, Mutiyangana and Dambulla temples. The
              Mahanayakes, assisted by a committee representing the main monasteries within
              each division, had supervisory powers over the monasteries and bhikkus under
              their control. Impious monks were expelled, succession issues examined. ‘In few
              parts of the world is the establishment of religion more regularly organized
              than in Ceylon,’ said Davy in 1821.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Velivita Saranankara, (1698-1778)
              sangharaja of Siyam Nikaya played a major role in the Buddhist revival. He
              ensured that Siyam Nikaya produced well trained, disciplined bhikkus by
              establishing training centers with set syllabuses and study guides. The bhikkus
              emerged with a sound knowledge of Buddhism and a sound training in preaching.
              They returned to their temples and did good work. Abeyawardana (2004) notes
              that Tumpane, Weligodapola, Kalatuwawa, Dunkumbura, Miningamuwa, and Gurudeniya
              and other village temples, were given preaching halls and tampita viharas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Siyam Nikaya produced scholarly bhikkus.
              Saranankara laid great stress on correct grammar. Grammars and dictionaries
              were prepared. Bhikkus acquired a sound knowledge of Pali, Sanskrit and Sinhala
              and developed very good composition skills. Some won special praise for this.
              They also acquired knowledge of astronomy, poetics (chandas alankaraya),
              medicine, astrology, and law (artha nithi sastraya). Those who came from the
              Maritime Provinces went back to their temples and began a literary and
              religious revival there, centering on Matara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The first three Vaduga kings, starting
              with Vijaya Rajasinha, have not been given sufficient credit for reviving
              Buddhism in the island. The argument that they were secretly Hindu, and only
              gave lip service to Buddhism cannot be sustained. They had studied Buddhism and
              they were practicing Buddhists. They guarded the tooth relic, gave gifts to the
              Dalada Maligawa and held public exhibitions of the Tooth relic. They
              participated in religious festivals such as the Katina pinkama and netra
              mangalya. They went on pilgrimage to Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mahiyangana and
              Sri Pada. They built new temples, renovated old temples and re-dedicated temple
              lands. The temple projects were supervised by the chiefs of the area.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Dewaraja says the credit for preserving
              Buddhist texts must go to the Vaduga kings. A 1755 sannasa records a grant of
              land to goldsmith Ratnavalli for transcribing Buddhist texts onto gold plate.
              Culavamsa confirms this grant. The kings revived the upasampada and oversaw the
              birth of the powerful Siyam Nikaya. The Kandy Esala perehera originally consisted
              only of dewale pereheras. Dewales were never considered equal to temples, and
              temples kept their distance from dewales. But Kirti Sri added a Dalada segment
              to the Esala perahera and the public now believe that the Dalada Maligawa has
              four dewales attached to it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">According to Culavamsa, the queens of
              Vijaya Rajasinha also became Buddhist and did much for the religion. The two
              brothers of Kirti were said to be ardent Buddhists. The gifts made of gold
              given by Kirti Sri’s mother can still be seen in the Dalada Maligawa, said
              Dewaraja Sri Wickreme’s mother and sister had attended the ceremony which
              marked the completion of Alut vihara and the queen mother had donated some of
              her lands to the temple, added Dewaraja.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The king retained a firm hold over the
              temples. He appointed the first incumbent to newly built or restored viharas
              and was the final arbiter of disputes regarding the incumbencies of viharas.
              Selected monks were given supervisory control of all the monasteries in a
              disavani. Vehalle Dhammadina was made head of the ‘temple ridden’ Sabaragamuwa
              disavani in 1751. Dewaraja observed that this monk would have been a check on
              any ambitious plans of the disava. The newly restored Dambulla vihara
              incumbency was given to Potuhara Ratanapala in 1780 to be continued in
              pupillary succession. This monk was a loyal supporter of the king and had
              protected the tooth relic during the Dutch invasion of 1766.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The kings also kept a vigilant eye on
              private donations to the sangha. All private offerings of land, called
              ‘pidavili’, required the permission of the king. Only the king could declare
              those lands free of royal service and transfer them to the temple. The king’s
              permission was also sought when a high official planned to build or restore a
              temple. In 1766 Pilimatalauwe, disava of Satara Korale built a fully equipped
              vihara in Dodanvela and informed the king.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Buddhists in the Dutch controlled Maritime
              Provinces looked to Udarata for guidance in Buddhism. Sitinamaluwe Dhammajoti,
              from Tangalle, was one of Saranankara’s earliest pupils. The temples and
              monasteries of the south were affiliated to Malvatte vihara by Kirti Sri, and
              from then on, the chiefs of these temples went to Udarata to receive their
              appointments. Once there, they stayed on to participate in ecclesiastical
              courts, and to discuss pupillary succession, monastic discipline and land
              matters. From 1765, higher ordination was given only at Malwatte. Kirti Sri,
              and thereafter Rajadhi, came to be regarded as the protectors of Buddhism in
              the Maritime Provinces.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Udarata kings used Buddhism to assert
              their position over the Dutch controlled Maritime Province. Wimaladharmasuriya
              II (1687-1707) sent a demand for the rebuilding of the dagabas in the south,
              return of temple lands and freedom of worship to Buddhists. In 1750 Udarata
              monks asked to visit Kelaniya. This was refused so they asked to visit Sri Pada
              through Galle and Matara. This was also refused.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Kirti Sri (1747-82) used Buddhism to made
              incursions into the Dutch territory. The chief priests of the maritime temples,
              strong supporters of Kirti Sri, also had great influence over the mudaliyars
              and Buddhism was used as the rallying cry when Kirti Sri invaded Dutch
              territory in 1761. Kirti Sri made a grant of land to Mulgirigala vihara in
              1761. He also renovated and endowed Kelani vihara and sent artists to paint
              frescos there. These frescos appear on the walls of the Ot pilimage, Raja
              pilimage, Ran pilimage, Sri Maha Bo ge, and corridor between Ran and Raja
              pilimage.</span></p>
