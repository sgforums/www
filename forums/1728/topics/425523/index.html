              <p>In early April, there will be a remarkable opportunity to practice Chöd in the sacred enclave of Bhutan. We will learn practices and engage in them in a land of unique spiritual potency.<br><br>Bhutan is the last Vajrayana country in the world. Here, we meet the pure energies of Guru Rinpoche, Yeshe Tsogyal, Tontang Gyalpo, Pema Lingpa, PeGyal Lingpa and more, and sit where the yidams, dakinis, protectors dwell. This precious heritage has been preserved and nourished, and the living traditions remain vibrant and palpable. In spite of political, social, economic and cultural issues, not for below the surface, the pure dharma percolates and bubbles forth.</p>
