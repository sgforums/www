You should do some inquiry... That's what my taiwanese dharma teacher did to someone who asked him about how to deal with lust.. find out what is the source of these matters. Do you watch sexually suggestive women on the net..? Do you have posters of pretty ladies all over your room? And many other possible factors....<br><br>One suggestion he gave was to tear down all the pictures of the skimpily dressed ladies in your room, and replace them with all the pictures of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas... my teacher said, confirm you won't get excited! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Cos they're all so holy and 'zhuang1 yan2' everywhere you look.. hehe..<br><br>Here's also some suggestions from my Master's book:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">The Buddha taught some solutions:<br><br>(Book Source: Fa Yu Bing Fen 2nd Series by Ven.

Don't understand can ask, I can explain <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Very sorry for taking so long to post. Here is a summary.<br><br>The Chinese text was talking about the king who is concerned with the progress of youngsters and the distraction of sexual lust on the youth's academic and work perfomance. He requested the give instructions on how to be free from sexual lust.<br><br>The Buddha gave 3 suggestions:<br><br>1) The female that is more elder in age should be looked upon as one's Mother or aunt. For the female that is younger in age one should look upon her as one's own sister and for one that is very young in age, one should look upon her as one's.. uh, (sorry I don't know what's that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> someone can tell me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). In this way, one's mind will be in stillness, and ones three poisons, Greed, Hatred and Ignorance will be transformed and dissolved by one's Wisdom naturally.<br><br>2) One should review this very frame of body upwards from the soles of the<br>feet, &amp; downwards from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as<br>full of many kinds of impurities: There are in this body head-hairs,<br>body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow,<br>kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery,<br>vomit in the stomach, excrement, bile, lymph, pus, blood, sweat, fat,<br>tears, mucus, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine and the various impurities, this way one can be freed from sexual lust and the mind will naturally be still.<br><br>3) One should guard one's six sense doors: Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind.. if one's eyes sees sights, one should not grasp on the appearances, do not give rise to discriminative mind and naturally our attachment will be dissolved. After one guards his eye-sense faculty one should then guard the other senses (ears, nose, tongue, body and mind), do not give rise to discriminative mind and naturally craving will not arise.</div></blockquote></div>

It is the willingness to take steps and put in effort into practice.  Both AEN and Xprobe gave good advices and IMO it will work.  However it will take many years of practice before you see results.<br></div>

It will also depends on the type of scriptures one reads.  It is best to find scriptures that are related to the problems you are facing. And while looking for the scriptures that you had identified, try finding those with Commentaries. Commentaries are written by monks who help laypersons (none-monks, householders, lay practitioner) to understand the basic meanings of the scriptures.<br><br>Of course you will find many Dharma words, terms and such that you might not understand. You can definitely post your questions here and ask the good advisors here.<br><br>My personal experience is rather interesting. Also having the same problem in the beginning, I tried reading scriptures. Funny is that the Sutra is so chim and I don't understand but I already forgotten about lust! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Of course it is only temporary. But if you ae hardworking enough to train yourself to read something not related to lust such as Sutra or a thick physics tectbook, it will reduce your lust level.<br><br>Also try not to excite your senses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
