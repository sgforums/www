              that doubt is an essential tool on the path to enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Perhaps because of our Judeo-Christian background, we have a tendency to
              regard doubt as something shameful, almost as an enemy. We feel that if we have
              doubts, it means that we are denying the teachings and that we should really
              have unquestioning faith. Now in certain religions, unquestioning faith is
              considered a desirable quality. But in the Buddha-dharma, this is not
              necessarily so. Referring to the dharma, the Buddha said, “<em>ehi passiko</em>,”
              which means “come and see,” or “come and investigate,” not “come and believe.”
              An open, questioning mind is not regarded as a drawback to followers of the
              Buddha-dharma. However, a mind that says, “This is not part of my mental
              framework, therefore I don’t believe it,” is a closed mind, and such an
              attitude is a great disadvantage for those who aspire to follow any spiritual
              path. But an open mind, which questions and doesn’t accept things simply
              because they are said, is no problem at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>A famous sutra tells of a group of villagers who came to visit the
              Buddha. They said to him, “Many teachers come through here. Each has his own
              doctrine. Each claims that his particular philosophy and practice is the truth,
              but they all contradict each other. Now we’re totally confused. What do we do?”
              Doesn’t this story sound modern? Yet this was twenty-five hundred years ago.
              Same problems. The Buddha replied, “You have a right to be confused. This is a
              confusing situation. Do not take anything on trust merely because it has passed
              down through tradition, or because your teachers say it, or because your elders
              have taught you, or because it’s written in some famous scripture. When you
              have seen it and experienced it for yourself to be right and true, then you can
              accept it.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Now that was quite a revolutionary statement, because the Buddha was
              certainly saying that about his own doctrine, too. All through the ages it has
              been understood that the doctrine is there to be investigated and experienced
              by each individual. So one should not be afraid to doubt. In fact, Buddhist
              writer Stephen Batchelor wrote a dharma book entitled <em>The Faith to Doubt</em>.
              It is right for us to question. But we need to question with an open heart and
              an open mind, not with the idea that everything that fits our preconceived
              notions is right and anything that does not is automatically wrong. The latter
              attitude is like the bed of Procrustes. You have a set pattern in place, and
              everything you come across must either be stretched out or cut down to fit it.
              This just distorts everything and prevents learning.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If we come across certain things that we find difficult to accept even
              after careful investigation, that doesn’t mean the whole dharma has to be
              thrown overboard. Even now, after all these years, I still find certain things
              in the Tibetan dharma that I’m not sure about at all. I used to go to my lama and
              ask him about some of these things, and he would say, “That’s fine. Obviously,
              you don’t really have a connection with that particular doctrine. It doesn’t
              matter. Just put it aside. Don’t say, 'No, it’s not true.’ Just say, 'At this
              point, my mind does not embrace this.’ Maybe later you’ll appreciate it, or
              maybe you won’t. It’s not important.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>When we come across a concept that we find difficult to accept, the
              first thing we should do, especially if it’s something that is integral to the
              dharma, is to look into it with an unprejudiced mind. We should read everything
              we can on the subject, not just from the point of view of Buddha-dharma, but if
              there are other approaches to it, we need to read about them, too. We need to
              ask ourselves how they connect with other parts of the doctrine. We have to
              bring our intelligence into this. At the same time, we should realize that at
              the moment, our level of intelligence is quite mundane. We do not yet have an
              all-encompassing mind. We have a very limited view. So there are definitely
              going to be things that our ordinary mundane consciousness cannot experience
              directly. But that does not mean these things do not exist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Here again, it is important to keep an open mind. If other people with
              deeper experiences and vaster minds say they have experienced something, then
              we should at least be able to say, “Perhaps it might be so.” We should not take
              our limited, ignorant minds as the norm. But we must remember that these
              limited, ignorant minds of ours can be transformed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>That’s what the path is all about. Our minds do become more open and
              increasingly vast as we progress. We do begin to see things more clearly, and
              as a result they slowly begin to fit into place. We need to be patient. We
              should not expect to understand the profound expositions of an enlightened mind
              in our first encounter with them. I’m sure we all know certain books of wisdom
              that we can read and reread over the years, and each time it seems like we are
              reading them for the first time. This is because as our minds open up, we begin
              to discover deeper and deeper layers of meaning we couldn’t see the time
              before. It’s like that with a true spiritual path. It has layer upon layer of
              meaning, and we can only understand those concepts that are accessible to our present
              level of mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>I think people have different sticking points. I know that things some
              people find very difficult to grasp were extremely simple for me. I already
              believed many of the teachings before I came to the Buddha-dharma. On the other
              hand, some things that were difficult for me, others find simple to understand
              and accept. We are all coming from different backgrounds, and so we each have
              our own special problems. But the important thing is to realize that this is no
              big deal. It doesn’t matter. Our doubting and questioning spur us on and keep
              us intellectually alert.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>There have been times when my whole spiritual life was one great big
              question mark. But instead of suppressing the questions, I brought up the
              things I questioned and examined them one by one. When I came out the other
              end, I realized that it simply didn’t matter. We can be quite happy with a
              question mark. It’s not a problem at all, actually, as long as we don’t
              solidify it or base our whole life on feeling threatened by it. We need to
              develop confidence in our innate qualities and believe that these can be
              brought to fruition. We all have Buddha-nature. We have all the qualities
              needed for the path. If we don’t believe this, it will be very difficult for us
              to embark because we have no foundation from which to go forth. It’s really
              very simple. The Buddha-dharma is not based on dogma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>But why is it so difficult for us? Basically it’s because of our state
              of mind, because we lack knowledge of who we are and our role here in this life.
              Because we don’t know who we are, we feel separate from everybody else. There’s
              this sense of “me” that creates all our fears, angers, attachments, jealousies,
              and uncertainties. But the Buddha said that it doesn’t have to be like that.
              Our inherent nature is pure. All we have to do is rediscover who we really are,
              and that’s what the path is for. It’s very simple. It’s not based on faith, but
              rather on experiments and experience leading to realization. It’s not a matter
              of learning what this lama says, or what that tradition says, and then
              believing it’s going to save us. It’s not going to save us. Of course we need
              to know what the Buddha said. We need to know what great teachers in the past
              have said, because they have been there ahead of us and have laid down maps for
              us to follow. But it’s a bit like reading a travel book. You can read a travel
              book and feel you’re already there, but in reality you’re not there. These are
              somebody else’s travel experiences. And when you do go there, you will have your
              own unique experiences. Following the path is about experiencing it for
              ourselves. It’s not taking on what other people have described. It’s not based
              on blind faith. Of course, you need a certain amount of confidence to buy a
              ticket and start on your journey. You have to believe that the country exists
              and that it’s worthwhile to go there. But beyond that, the important thing is
              just to go. And as you go, you can say to yourself, “Yes, that’s just the way
              they described it. That’s right. It does look like that.”</span></p>
