              <p>Of course, but it will be unskillful and leads to further rebirths, and bad rebirths.</p>
              <p>Unless you're an arhant - there are records of arhants in the suttas who commit suicide and that is blameless because they no longer reborn. (However if you're an arhant, please seriously consider staying longer to spread the dharma in the limited lifespan you have for the sake of other sentient beings. My Taiwanese dharma teacher almost 'suicided' in his meditation after enlightenment as he felt there wasn't conditions to teach the dharma and there wasn't any point for his existence, and almost succeeded until his family members 'pulled him back from impending death' - bad choice to suicide at that point I think, as he now has thousands of students learning dharma from him.)</p>
              <p>If you aren't an arhant, don't think about that for the sake of your future births. Please also consider that human birth according to Buddha is one of the most precious and rare gifts, a great opportunity to practice dharma, attain liberation, accumulate wisdom and merits.</p>

              <p><br>when you are near the cliff, your body will shake terribly. you may cry, pee yourself even at the thought of jumping. your heart will pump super fast and you will breath very heavily. suicide is not as simple as abc. This is because of survival instinct</p>

              <p>juz wanna share abit on this topic of beer from my own experience. used to be a hardcore drinker drinking at least 3 nites a week doing alot of hard liquor and beer. went on like this for almost a decade since army days til 2007. now i don't touch any liquor, even during wedding dinners and gatherings drink coke.</p>
              <p>alcohol is something that ends up creating harm all of the time. even the best behaved person can become a demon under the influence of alcohol. what really is happening is uncontrolled feeding of pent up energies, anger is fed with more anger, sadness with more sadness, even 'happiness' is fed with more 'happiness'.</p>
              <p>but of cos, there's no healing in reality. even the seemingly happiness is actually causing more sufferings from the cravings of these parties.</p>
              <p>then there's also the spillover effect. our attention span becomes shorter, we tire more easily, become physically weaker, liver also affected, become very much poorer ( used to be spending at least 2k a month). and the lifestyle surrounding alcohol becomes a major force in shaping the other aspects of our lives.</p>
              <p>anyway i dun think this is just an exclusively Buddhist teaching. it is a universal teaching which we will have to learn, be it from the easy or hard way.</p>

This is like a paradox because we may drink and party away just to attain feeling 'high' and happiness .. but on the other hand, it does not solve the source of the problem on why we feel dissatisfaction, restlessness and unhappiness. Sometime, it even creates more problem like drunk-driving, family problems,disfunctional personality and other social problems.</p></div>

              <p>Intention to live is part of drinking. You can always choose to die. I am not kidding, so please do answer my question of dying to live or living to die.You have to eat and drink to live, yet you can always choose to die to prevent oneself from creating bad karma.</p>

              <p>I have another logic for you who don't believe in bad karma by committing suicide but this is just to prove that your logic does not work so don't take my words and commit suicide. I don't want to create bad karma.</p>
              <p>You can also choose to commit suicide, why work so hard to earn money just to fill your stomach since you know your ending is death. You are now 'eating full waiting for death' å�ƒé¥±ç­‰æ­».</p>
              <p>If you tell me you survive till now because you have a purpose to live, same goes for Buddhists, we survive to create more good karma as human realm has the opportunity to create good karma than other lower realm.</p>
              <p>If you think your logic works, why are you still around till today ?</p>

              <p>so intent is important?</p>
              <p>if i got into a car accident and killed alot of people unintentionally, i am not accumulating bad karma?</p>
              <p>so the belief is that we should not kill sentient being only and not all life?<br>cos i thought the teaching is not to 'sha shen' (literal translation kill life)<br>if that is true, then buddhist consider cows, chickens, fishes etc sentient?</p>
