              <p>so intent is important?</p>
              <p>if i got into a car accident and killed alot of people
              unintentionally, i am not accumulating bad karma?</p>
              <p>so the belief is that we should not kill sentient being only and
              not all life?<br> cos i thought the teaching is not to 'sha shen' (literal
              translation kill life)<br> if that is true, then buddhist consider cows, chickens, fishes etc
              sentient?</p>

              <p>Cows, chickens, fishes are sentient (conscious) beings. They suffer. Grass, plants, are alive but they do not have consciousness, discrimination, mind, and suffering. Hence they are edible.</p>
              <p>As for your other question, hope this helps:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Extract from <strong>'Only We can 
              Help Ourselves' by
                                      Dhammavuddho Thero.</strong></p>
              <p>Kamma-vipaka is sometimes translated as cause
               and effect ('yin
                                      kuo' in Chinese books) but that is not a good 
              translation.</p>
              <p>This is because there are two types of cause 
              and effect -
                                      <em><strong>worldly cause and effect,</strong></em> and
                                      <em><strong>kammic cause and effect</strong></em>. </p>
              <p>The difference can be seen, for example, when
               you drive a car
                                      and suddenly a small boy runs across the road, 
              and you hit the boy
                                      and kill him.</p>
              <p>You did not have have the intention to kill 
              the small boy, so
                                      you did not create any kamma.  However you did 
              knock down the
                                      boy and the boy's family might pull you out of 
              the car when you
                                      stop, and beat you up.  In addition to that, 
              they might also
                                      sue you in court.</p>
              <p>So there is a result of knocking down the 
              boy, namely, you get a
                                      beating and then be sued in court.  However this
               is worldly
                                      cause and effect.  It is not concerned with 
              Buddhist kamma
                                      vipaka because there was no intention on your 
              part to kill the
                                      boy.</p>
              <p>So we must clearly differentiate between 
              worldly cause and
                                      effect and kamma-vipaka.  They are different 
              because one
                                      involves action with intention and the other 
              does not.</p>
              <p>...<strong>The working of kamma-vipaka is 
              very
                                      complex.</strong>  The Buddha said in one 
              discourse (Anguttara
                                      Nikaya 4.77 - Acintita Sutta / <span>å¢žä¸€ é˜¿å�«ç¶“ï¼Œ<span style="color: black; letter-spacing: 0.25pt;">åˆ†åˆ«åŠŸå¾·è®ºå�·ç¬¬ä¸€</span></span>)
                                      that there are four things that you should not 
              think about too
                                      much.  If you think too much about these four 
              things, you
                                      could become deranged. </p>
              <p>The first is the power of the Buddha;</p>
              <p>The second is the depth and power of jhana 
              (meditative
                                      absorption);</p>
              <p>The third is kamma-vipaka;</p>
              <p>And the fourth is speculation about the 
              world.</p>
              <p>...The working of kamma-vipaka depends not 
              only on our present
                                      lifetime but also on <strong>many, many 
              lifetimes of unsettled
                                      kamma accounts.</strong> </p>
              <p>On top of that, it also depends on the state 
              of our mind at that
                                      moment.  Moreover, the state of mind of the 
              other being you do
                                      the kamma to also affects your vipaka.</p>
              <p>For example, when you make an offering to a 
              murderer, or a
                                      criminal, or to an evil person, your merit is 
              very small, but if
                                      you make an offering to a holy man, then your 
              merit or blessings is
                                      great.  Conversely, if you kill a holy man, then
               your kammic
                                      offence is very great.  If you kill a mosquito, 
              the kamma is
                                      not as bad, but still you are not encouraged to 
              kill it.</p>
              <p>...Sometimes we see certain people whom we 
              consider as evil,
                                      rough, stingy and offensive, but they are having
               a good, luxurious
                                      life.  That could be due to their good kamma 
              from past life
                                      supporting them.  However they are now creating a
               lot of evil
                                      kamma which has not ripened yet.  <strong>This 
              could be due to
                                      the fact that people can change.</strong></p>
              <p>For example, when a man is poor he is humble,
               industrious,
                                      faithful to his wife, frugal, etc.  When he 
              becomes rich after
                                      several years, he may become arrogant, vain, 
              womanize, drink,
                                      gamble, etc. - a completely different 
              personality.</p>
              <p>Similarly, a good person in a previous life, 
              when reborn under
                                      favourable conditions, might become corrupted by
               his good
                                      fortune.  Because of this we may find it hard to
               see fairness
                                      in this world.</p>
              <p>Sometimes we see that good people are not the
               ones who are
                                      happy, but many evil people are happy.</p>
              <p>The working of kamma-vipaka is <strong>very 
              difficult</strong> to see unless we have the <strong>psychic power 
              to look into the
                                      past.</strong></p>
