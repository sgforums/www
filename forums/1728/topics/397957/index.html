                                      Theravada also believes that the Buddha allowed the monks to choose a 
                                      vegetarian diet, but only prohibited against eating <a title="Human" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human">human</a>, <a title="Elephant" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant">elephant</a>,

                                       Buddha did not prohibit any kind of meat-eating for his lay followers. 
                                      In <a title="Vajrayana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vajrayana">Vajrayana</a>,
                                       the act of eating meat is not always prohibited. The <a title="Mahayana" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana">Mahayana</a> schools generally recommend a vegetarian diet, for they believe that 
                                      the Buddha insisted that his followers should not eat <a title="Meat" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat">meat</a> or <a title="Fish" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">fish</a>.</p>

              <p>Next. I think drinking water doesn't have much karma because first of all, you don't have the intention to kill any beings when you drink, and intention is a necessary factor for karma.</p>
              <p>Secondly I don't think there are many sentient beings in water, especially in the clean water of Singapore. Microbes, germs, virus, don't necessary mean sentient beings -- sentient beings are beings that have consciousness. Since these single celled or multi-celled beings do not have a nervous system, I do not believe they are sentient beings, I do not think they feel pain, I doubt they have consciousness that can be reborn. My Master told us that eating medicine to kill off bacteria is blameless because these bacterias are not sentient beings.</p>
              <p>As for beers: in Buddhism we are told to abstain from alcohol and other intoxicants because alcohol causes 'carelessness', i.e. stupidity and stupid actions you'll never think of doing while sober. I have personally witnessed this in my friends when sometimes they get dead drunk, even lapsing into unconsciousness (scary incident). Sad to say, I'm also guilty recently of frequenting clubs and binge drinking quite frequently and I am going to quit this habit. Haven't been a good Buddhist, haven't been a good example...</p>

                                      <br>Venue: Residence of Lee Hock Seng
                                      <br>Special occasion: Dana upon moving into new house</strong> <br> <br>When Buddhists move into a new house, they invite monks for dana in 
                                      order to make merits. These merits are then shared with the devas who 
                                      are around. In doing this, one is offering one of the highest dana 
                                      possible to the devas. The devas are honoured and, in reciprocation, 
                                      will protect the house and its residents. Those whom the devas have 
                                      sympathy for are bound to meet with good fortune. 
                                      <br> <br><strong>Ven Kumara then continues with the series of talks on 
                                      ‘Blessings’. </strong> <br> <br>The next blessing is that of refraining from taking intoxicants. 
                                      <br> <br>Here’s a story on the origins of intoxicating drinks. Long ago in a 
                                      forest in the Himalaya Mountains, there was a big tree. The top branches
                                       grew such that they formed a receptacle-like depression where rain 
                                      water collected. As a creeper plant climbed up the tree trunk, its 
                                      fruits fell into the pool of rainwater. Sometimes birds also dropped 
                                      fruits into it. They then fermented in the water. 
                                      <br> <br>The monkeys and birds that drank this fermented liquid became 
                                      intoxicated and fell into a drunken stupor after which they woke up. A 
                                      forester witnessed this. Curious, he tasted the fermented liquid. It 
                                      made him feel good. A hermit came along and the two of them had a good 
                                      time drinking and feeding on roasted birds. 
                                      <br> <br>The idea then came to them that they could make money by selling 
                                      this fermented liquid. So they collected the drink and sold it to the 
                                      people in a nearby city. As their business was good, it did not take 
                                      long for them to realise that they had to find out how they could 
                                      manufacture it themselves. They spent time studying the process and were
                                       able to mass-produce alcohol. The inhabitants of that city soon 
                                      degenerated into drunkards who could not work. Consequently, they could 
                                      not afford to buy the alcohol. 
                                      <br> <br>Seeing that their sales had dropped there, the two men moved to 
                                      Savatthi, another city, to continue their business. The King himself was
                                       so taken with the alcohol that he bought 500 jars of it. Soon he was 
                                      partying on the alcohol. 
                                      <br> <br>Sakka Devaraja (Thni Kong, the God of Heaven) saw this and decided 
                                      that he must do something to prevent the world from being ruined by this
                                       evil habit. He came to earth in the guise of a Brahmin and levitated 
                                      himself in front of the King, carrying a jar. The King was curious and 
                                      asked the Brahmin what the jar contained. The Brahmin replied that if he
                                       wanted to know, he would have to drink it himself, but warned him of 
                                      the consequences. 
                                      <br> <br>“You’ll be in a stupor, unable to control your mind, actions or 
                                      speech. You will also be unable to discriminate between good and bad, 
                                      and become shameless. Your reputation will suffer and you will lose the 
                                      respect of others. You will also break your precepts. In doing so, you 
                                      will also harm others as well as yourself.” 
                                      <br> <br>The King realised the folly of taking intoxicants and destroyed his 
                                      store of alcohol. However, alcohol had already been discovered and 
                                      continues to be made and drunk till this day. 
                                      <br> <br>During the time of the Buddha, a monk who was an accomplished 
                                      meditator with psychic powers took intoxicants, became drunk and 
                                      unmindfully laid on the ground with his feet pointing at the Buddha. The
                                       Buddha criticised the foolish act and set down a Vinaya rule 
                                      prohibiting monks from consuming alcohol. 
                                      <br> <br>Here, we can see that taking intoxicants can bring about much evil. 
                                      If one were to refrain from it, one could be free from all these evils. 
                                      So, we can rightly say that refraining from taking intoxicants is a 
                                      great blessing.

              <p>Just a note: Sakka Devaraja is Shakyamuni Buddha's previous incarnation.</p>
              <p>Btw... I read that over the past 15 years, life expectancy in Russia has varied from 
                                      roughly 58 years to 65 years for men, and roughly 71 to 74 years for 
                                      women.</p>
              <p>The reason why males have such lower life expectancy is because many Russians tend to be alcoholics and die early from alcoholism.</p>
              <p>The harm of alcohol to health is much worse than tobacco... if abused on a long term. In fact scientists have <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/65988.php">ranked alcohol as more dangerous than many drugs</a> like ketamine, ecstasy, tobacco, marijuana, LSD, etc (not that I recommend the other drugs).</p>

              <p>No. Heart beating, breathing, all automatic non-intentional processes.</p>
              <p>If you try to control your breathe, stop your breathe, that is intentional, but even without any intentions - you still breathe. Otherwise you will be dead when you are dreaming or in deep dreamless sleep.</p>
              <p>The body is run by an intelligence greater than the conceptual mind.</p>
              <p>In other words: suicide is intentional, living is natural and non-intentional.</p>
