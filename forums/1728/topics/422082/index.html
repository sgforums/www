In Tibetan iconography he is usually black, although he appears in other colors as well. He has two to six arms, three bulging eyes with flames for eyebrows, and a beard of hooks. He wears a crown of six skulls.</p>
              <p>Mahakala is the protector of the tents of nomadic Tibetans, and of monasteries, and of all Tibetan Buddhism. He is charged with the tasks of pacifying hindrances; enriching life, virtue and wisdom; attracting people to Buddhism; and destroying confusion and ignorance.</p>

              <p>2)  Yamantaka is the wrathful form of <a href="http://buddhism.about.com/od/iconsofbuddhism/tp/Major-Bodhisattvas.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366cc;">Manjushri, Bodhisattva of Wisdom</span></span></a>. It was as Yamantaka that Manjushri conquered the rampaging Yama and made him a protector of the Dharma.</p>
              <p>In some versions of the legend, when Manhushri became Yamantaka he mirrored Yama's appearance but with multiple heads, legs and arms. When Yama looked at Yamantaka he saw himself multiplied to infinity. Since Yama repesents death, Yamantaka represents that which is stronger than death.</p>
              <p>In art, Yamantaka usually is shown standing or riding a bull that is trampling Yama.</p>

              <p>Hayagriva is another wrathful form of Avalokiteshvara (as is Mahakala, above). He has the power to cure diseases (skin diseases in particular), and is a protector of horses. He wears a horse's head in his headdress and frightens demons by neighing like a horse.</p>

He is also known as Ä€calanÄ�tha, Ä€ryÄ�calanÄ�tha, Ä€cala-vidyÄ�-rÄ�ja and <span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">Caá¹‡á¸�amahÄ�roá¹£aá¹‡a</span>. The Sanskrit term <em>Ä�cala</em> means "immovable"; Ä€cala is also the name of the eighth of the ten stages of the path to become a <em><a title="Bodhisattva" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Bodhisattva"><span style="color: #0645ad;">bodhisattva</span></a></em>. His <a class="mw-redirect" title="Siddham" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Siddham"><span style="color: #0645ad;">siddham</span></a> seed-syllabe is "<span class="Unicode" style="white-space: normal; text-decoration: none;" title="International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration">hÄ�á¹ƒ</span>".</p>
              <p>Ä€cala is the destroyer of delusion and the protector of Buddhism. His immovability refers to his ability to remain <em>unmoved</em> by carnal temptations. Despite his fearsome appearance, his role is to aid all beings by showing them the teachings of the Buddha, leading them into self-control.</p>
              <p>He is seen as a protector and aide in attaining goals. Shingon Buddhist temples dedicated to Ä€cala perform a periodic <a title="Homa (ritual)" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Homa_(ritual)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">fire ritual</span></a> in devotion to him.</p>

              <p>In a particular tradition that I am familiar with, it is said<br>that there are three kinds of protectors.  They are dharmapalas,<br>lokapalas and ksetrapalas.  Respectively they translate to<br>"dharma-protectors," "world(ly)-protectors" and "field-protectors." <br>Dharma-protectors are those who are highly advanced on the Path. <br>From Vajrayana's point of view, these beings are actually<br>manifestations of the activities of the Buddhas.  Some of these<br>beings are considered Buddhas while some are on different levels of<br>the Bodhisattva path.  For example, Mahakala and Ekazati are both<br>considered fully enlightened beings while someone like Dorje Lekpa<br>is considered a tenth stage bodhisattva.  The worldly-protectors<br>refer to beings who have pledged to protect the teachings and<br>practitioners.  These include powerful worldly gods, local spirits,<br>energies and other beings.  It is said that sometimes these beings<br>do not even fully accept the teachings of the Buddha.  They are in<br>other words as deluded as we are  - some of them more, others less. <br>Field protectors are usually associated with very specific places or<br>buildings. In Tibet, families live in the same place and house for<br>hundred of years. As time passes, it is believed that there are<br>certain protectors especially connected with that particular house,<br>clan or family. Spiritually both the worldly and field protectors<br>are much lower than the Dharma-protectors.  Both the worldly and<br>field protectors are not particularly related to Dharma in the same<br>way as Dhama-protectors are.<br><br>    How should we relate to the protectors?  I remember reading His<br>Holiness the Dalai Lama's response to a similiar question.  His<br>Holiness advised that it is actually sufficient to regard the Triple<br>Gem (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) as protectors.  In his opinion, if<br>one truly takes refuge in the Triple Gem they will be the best<br>protectors one can have. He further explained that protectors are<br>related to Vajrayana practice and only those who are deeply involved<br>with Vajrayana practices should be concerned with the protectors.  I<br>suspect that His Holiness' response in this case is spoken for the<br>general audience and in no way indicates that he is not in favor of<br>protector practices.  Other teachers also agree that if one really<br>relies on the Triple Gem, protection is guaranteed.<br><br>    Very briefly, according to Vajrayana, protectors should never be<br>seen as something separate from oneself.  Protectors actually have<br>two levels which we can relate with.  On the relative level, there<br>are protectors like Mahakala, Palden Lhamo, Dorje Lekpa or Ekazati. <br>There are numerous sadhanas (practices) associated with these<br>protectors.  But ultimately, it is our own rigpa (the natural mind<br>which is empty, spacious and open) that is the protector.  The<br>sadhanas usually have a structure where the meditator visualizes him<br>or herself as a particular protector. The meditator is reminded<br>again and again that his or her own nature is never separate from<br>the protectors'.  Some teachers further explain that in a way, these<br>protectors are simply our own awareness and mindfulness. Because we<br>are beings with both body and mind, it is easier in the beginning<br>for us to focus on some being with a form - the various protectors. <br>By meditating on their enlightened form - the various attributes and<br>ornaments (these are related to different enlightened qualities and<br>activities), one is to actualize these same enlightened qualities in<br>oneself.  In a sense, we can say that the protectors are our own<br>awareness and mindfulness appearing in enlightened forms.  With<br>right awareness and mindfulness, we will be able to relate to things<br>as they truly are (the wisdom aspect) and carry out the bodhisattva<br>activities (the compassionate aspect).  Therefore, the effectiveness<br>of these protectors are directly related to our own level of<br>awareness and mindfulness.  I have also heard another teacher<br>explaining that the law of karma is the real protector.  Here, he<br>means that if one were to truly understand cause and effect, one<br>will then abstain from performing any negative actions but instead<br>only cultivate good.<br><br>    Perhaps on a more advance level, the Dharma-protectors are<br>related to different forms and levels of energies.  These energies<br>are said to be latent in us.  By relating to a particular protector,<br>one learns how to channel up a particular energy and to deal with it<br>in an enlightened way. Because energy is simply energy (with<br>negative and positive potentials), there is always a chance of not<br>knowing how to deal with a certain energy that has been aroused<br>through  practice.  Or perhaps the means of arousing that energy is<br>misused.  This is when it is believed that negative effects will<br>occur.  This effect might not only affect the practitioner himself<br>but might include other as well.  Therefore, some teachers are<br>extremely cautious when it comes to protector practices.  In<br>traditional language, protector's practice is something that one<br>does only if one is certain that one can fulfill all the commitments<br>(samaya or damtshig) related to that practice.  Unlike practices<br>like Chenrezig meditation or Tara, it is said that when the<br>protector practice is done wrongly or is not done consistently, the<br>protectors will get extremely "wrathful."  These protectors are<br>guardians of the different practices.  It is also said that<br>protectors are there to make sure that the purity of the lineage is<br>protected.  And to do that, they guard the practices of the<br>practitioners.  It is not uncommon to hear people saying that when<br>they became lazy in their practice or got distracted, something<br>mysterious or supernatural happened that pulled them back into the<br>Path again!  And devout Tibetans will straightaway acknowledge the<br>protectors for fulfilling their duties.  There are also stories of<br>protectors who guard termas - hidden "treasures" (teachings, ritual<br>objects etc, that have supposedly been hidden by masters like<br>Padmasambhava to be retrived in latter days to benefit people). <br>Some of these protectors are even believed to fiecely guard these<br>termas so that if the wrong people get these termas, they might be<br>destroyed or the termas will simply vanish.  These protectors are<br>usually not Dharma-protectors but some worldly protectors.<br><br>    Therefore, on the relative level, these protectors are treated<br>like independent beings who have pledged to protect the Dharma (but<br>since the ultimate and relative can never be taken as distinct, one<br>is always reminded of the ultimate protector - one's own natural<br>mind).  Different lineages, teachers and practices  have different<br>special protectors.  For example, Palden Lhamo and Dharmaraja is<br>particularly associated with the Gelugpas.  For the Kagyupas,<br>Mahakala is especially significant.  Different aspects of Mahakala<br>(two-armed, four-armed, six-armed, female aspects) are practised by<br>the Sakyas, Gelugs, Kagyus and Nyingmas.  In the Drikung-Kagyu (one<br>of the major sects in the Kagyu school), Achi Chokyi Drolma is a<br>protector intimately related to members of this lineage.  Milarepa<br>himself is related to the five protector goddesses of Tibet - known<br>as the Tseringmas.  Among the Nyingmapas, Ekazati, Rahula and Dorje<br>Lekpa are protectors very closely related to Dzog-chen.  The famous<br>deity of the Nechung oracle is the personal protector of the Dalai<br>Lamas.  Various elaborate rituals and sadhanas are performed to<br>these protectors in the lives of practitioners.  There are certain<br>monasteries that have protector practices carried out 24 hours a day<br>for 365 days a year.  If I am not mistaken, there are a group of<br>monks specially charged with the task of performing protector<br>practices for the welfare of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in<br>particular, and the live of the Dharma in general.<br><br>full article on</p>
