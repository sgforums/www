              church and state</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Sally Tyler 17 July 2017
              Policy Forum</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              Trump to Thailand, religion and government are a combustible mix</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Recent
              decisions in the US threaten to weaken firewalls between the two institutions,
              and draw parallels with questions of religion and society in Asia, Sally Tyler
              writes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              customary, the Supreme Court of the United States saved its most incendiary
              decision for the last days of the court’s annual session, a sort of precursor
              to Fourth of July fireworks. This year’s explosive decision held that states
              cannot deny public funds to churches strictly because they are religious
              institutions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              deceptively mundane case concerning a competitive grant program to resurface a
              church childcare centre’s playground, Trinity Lutheran v. Comer could
              potentially impact more than 30 US states which prevent public funds from going
              to religious organisations, even for secular purposes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              decision is being widely criticised as a blow to the fundamental tenet of
              separation of church and state.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              the high court ruling garnered major headlines, an even more pernicious attack
              on church/state separation was stealthily slipped into the 2018 Financial
              Services and General Government Appropriations bill, which provides annual
              funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), among other federal government agencies.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              reversing the long-standing Johnson Amendment, the bill would eliminate the
              IRS’ ability to define “political activity” for non-profit entities, such as
              religious institutions, and would severely curtail the agency’s power to
              investigate churches which engage in political activity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              amendment prohibits tax-exempt non-profit organisations, including religious
              entities, from participating in a political campaign on behalf of/or opposing
              any candidate. Also, while most non-profits may use up to 20 per cent of their
              budget to lobby on issues by taking positions on legislation and ballot
              initiatives, religious organisations do not have a quantified threshold for
              such advocacy, but must limit any lobbying to an “insubstantial” basis, which
              is defined on a case-by-case basis by the IRS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              threat of taxation has been the primary regulatory mechanism that the US has
              used to shore up what Thomas Jefferson called “the wall of separation between
              church and state”. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              primacy of this concept within American society cannot be minimised. The
              country’s founders, some who had fled religious persecution, understood
              religious freedom to incorporate both freedom to practice their religion of
              choice, as well as freedom from religion, a concept heartily articulated by
              Australia’s most recent census.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              without the impending stick of taxation, would churches use their considerable
              resources to play politics? Other nations seem to agree that they might.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte aimed his gunslinger mouth at
              bishops during his campaign, and some of his supporters have urged him to begin
              taxing churches. But one doubts he actually has the guts to pull the trigger on
              his rhetorical threats in a nation with the world’s third largest Catholic population.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Singapore, churches are required to register as charities to receive a tax
              exemption, with revenue from side business or investment taxed at a regular
              rate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Not
              surprisingly, the Singapore government is efficient about policing revenue owed
              to it. Leaders of the City Harvest Church (CHC) were recently criminally
              convicted in a high-profile case for misuse of SG$50 million of donations meant
              for charity, funnelling the funds into the pastor’s wife’s pop singing career,
              as well as an opulent penthouse in Sentosa.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              got a chance to see the CHC meeting hall while in Singapore earlier this year.
              Huge and gleaming, with overtones of a spacecraft ready to take the faithful to
              Heaven, it broadcasts plainly that the church is a proponent of what has been called
              prosperity theology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              geography and denominations may vary, this form of religion flourishes on many
              continents.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Nor
              does Christianity have the lock on prosperity theology. Thailand’s Wat
              Dhammakaya urges adherents around the world to give generous donations as a
              short cut to merit making and is conspicuous in its accumulation of wealth.
              Some have argued that the junta has been targeting the temple’s assets to line
              its own coffers, summoning images of Henry VIII’s dissolution of the monasteries
              to pay for his military campaigns. The Thai government maintains the case was
              solely about money-laundering charges against the temple’s abbot Luang Por
              Dhammachayo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But,
              as with so much in Thailand over the past decade, the dotted line leads back to
              the unseen hand of the country’s former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra,
              supposedly conducting the orchestra from across the sea. It has been suggested
              that the underlying reason why current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has
              drawn a bull’s eye on the temple is its alleged close association with the
              deposed prime minister and the loyalty that many Red Shirts show for it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              endless Ramayana ballet of Thaksin and Prayuth aside, the failed siege of
              Dhammakaya illustrates one peril involved in establishing a state religion: its
              institutions become impervious to attack by the government, regardless of the
              transgressions of their leaders.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thailand’s
              constitutional requirement that its monarch be Buddhist has created a de facto
              state religion. Despite its litany of legitimate or manufactured charges
              against Dhammachayo, the junta must tread carefully in attacking any wat, even
              one thought to have deep connections to political forces which threaten its
              existence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Power
              is, and always has been, central to the struggle between church and state. When
              instructing Christian disciples on how to set up the new church, Paul tells
              them, in Hebrews 10:25, “Do not give up meeting together.” Assembly is at the
              heart of most religions, and this factor makes the church a potent target for
              political manipulation. Add the high-tech reach of televangelism and you have
              an instrument capable of being weaponised for partisan purposes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is precisely the calculus that led to Trump’s move to reverse the Johnson
              Amendment. A man who had no contact with evangelicals until he launched his
              campaign, he has made the facile assumption that they will be a powerful force
              for his re-election, so he aims to unleash preachers across the country to
              speak in support of Republican candidates for next year’s mid-term elections.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              the Christian faith, like other religions, is more diverse and nuanced than can
              be encompassed by his bombastic rhetoric. If his plan to encourage political
              participation of churches becomes law, he may well be greeted with legions of
              religious leaders who oppose his efforts to deny health coverage, undo
              environmental protections and allow racial discrimination, and call for their
              followers to cast votes on those issues. Rather than the wind-up music box that
              Trump envisions setting in motion with his move to allow overt political action
              by churches, he may have opened Pandora’s box.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              always complicating questions of church and state is the difficulty in
              disaggregating between religion and culture. Indeed, when most people speak of
              what religion means to them, they do not talk as often about spirituality or an
              individual relationship with God as about cultural practices. And religious
              adherents are taught from the beginning not only this is what we believe, but
              also this is what defines us, and this is what distinguishes us from others.
              Separateness and division are hard-wired into the very concept of world
              religions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Trump
              attempted to foment this sense of cultural divide in a darkly nationalistic
              speech emphasising the spectre of otherness in Warsaw before the G-20 summit.
              Hoping to rally NATO allies to help the US fend off hordes of imagined
              barbarians at the gates, he implored, “We must work together to counter
              forces…from the South or the East, that threaten … to erase the bonds of
              culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Rhetorically
              addressing the collective West, he asked: “Do we have the confidence in our
              values to defend them at any cost?” I would remind him that religious freedom,
              predicated on the separation of church and state, is at the centre of American
              values; but it is his own Administration that constitutes the biggest threat to
              it.</span></p>
