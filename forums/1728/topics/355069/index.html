              <h1>Mahamudra and Dzogchen, Two Systems of Buddhist Yoga</h1>
              <p>It is now in the present century, that for the first time, the West 
                      is finally beginning to learn something in depth about the ancient mystical 
                      teachings and practices of Buddhist Yogacara. Yogacara means to practice 
                      yoga, or in other words, to practice meditation, stilling the mind, searching 
                      inwards so as to acquire self-realization. This is the "practice 
                      tradition" at the heart of the Buddhist religion. Where ever Buddhism 
                      exists, there are those who commit themselves to this tradition - to the 
                      genuine "practice" of Yoga-meditation.</p>
              <p>Here, the concept "practice" stands in contrast to "scholasticism". 
                      It means to practice a spiritual path, rather than study and debate philosophy. 
                      It means to practice yoga-meditation rather than trying to understand 
                      the meaning of life by using discursive reasoning.</p>
              <p>In Thailand and Burma, monks have for centuries taken themselves off 
                      to the forest, living simple ascetic lives, so as to devote themselves 
                      to contemplative practice. Likewise in Ceylon. Similarly, amongst Buddhists 
                      in China and Japan, we can see how various "practice tradition" 
                      movements have emerged in the form of what is now known as Ch'an meditation 
                      or Zen. An exemplar of the "practice tradition" in Tibet was 
                      the great yogi Milarepa, and it is from the latter that the Ka'gyu Order, 
                      now headed by His Holiness the Karmapa, descends to modern times.</p>
              <p>Today, we follow the "practice tradition" of Buddhism than 
                      comes under the guidance of the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa, <a href="http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/contemporarymasters/urgyen-thinley-dorje.htm">Urgyen 
                      Thinley Dorje</a>. That is, we follow the tradition of yoga as taught 
                      in the Ka'gyu Order of Tibet.</p>
              <p>By "practice tradition" we mean a tradition that is focused 
                      on the practice of spiritual conduct and meditation, where the individual 
                      aims to attain Enlightenment in his or her present life. Believing that 
                      the discursive intellect, on its own, is not capable of reasoning a way 
                      to true Enlightenment, the Yogin is a woman or man who turns to yoga-meditation 
                      so as to experience directly the nature of the mind.</p>
              <p>Yogacara does not mean a particular set of views or religious beliefs. 
                      It does not imply a specific philosophy, such as the Middle Way View of 
                      Nagarjuna <em>(Madhyamaka)</em> or the Mind-only doctrine <em>(Cittamatra)</em>, 
                      nor a system of thought like Vedanta or the scientific speculations of 
                      someone such as Stephen Hawkings. Though anyone may benefit from pondering 
                      the nature of existence and studying the thought of philosophy and science, 
                      and although we do study the above systems of thought, "Yogacara" 
                      strictly means to do meditation or various spiritual exercises that will 
                      lead to direct experience of the nature of the mind in and of itself. 
                      To know mind in the yogacarin sense is far more than a study of psychology—it 
                      means to directly experience one's own mind, fully and in all its aspects, 
                      including its deepest self-reflexive nature.</p>
              <p>In Buddhist India and Tibet, the culmination of the long development 
                      of contemplative yoga practice led to two close systems of practice: the 
                      one known as "Mahasamdhi" or Dzogchen, and the other called 
                      Mahamudra. These are two branches of one original yoga system, introduced 
                      from India many centuries ago. Mahasamdhi means "absolute wholeness", 
                      or all-inclusive completeness. Mahamudra is a term referring to the "Great 
                      Seal" of nonduality. Both describe that final state of realization 
                      in which the duality of apparent existence, the differentiation of subject 
                      (consciousness) and object (world), collapses into original wholeness.</p>
              <p>Dzogchen or Mahamudra is a "tantric" teaching concerning absolute 
                      Reality. In practice, this tradition says that absolute Reality <em>(dharmata)</em> can be known, but only through coming to experience the fundamental nature 
                      of one's mind. What is mind? Can we experience it?</p>
              <p>We can perfectly well see that every sentient being has consciousness. 
                      We can see that consciousness is the perception of an object. There is 
                      no consciousness, without being conscious of something. What is consciousness 
                      conscious of? To guide the enquirer to an understanding of this question, 
                      it is pointed out that visual-consciousness is that which is conscious 
                      of visible phenomena. Through vibrations making an impression on the organ 
                      of sight, the eye, visual-consciousness is made aware of colour, light 
                      and form. The same goes for auditory-consciousness, tactile consciousness, 
                      and so forth. So "consciousness" is a state of mind that always 
                      is conscious of something. To recognize this, is to see that consciousness 
                      does not observe itself, because its very nature is to be preoccupied 
                      with observing something other than itself. At least this is apparently 
                      so.</p>
              <p>Besides the actual five "sense-consciousnesses," associated 
                      with seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, we can also speak of 
                      a mental-consciousness <em>(mano-vijnana)</em>. Mental-consciousness is 
                      that which is aware of mental phenomena, such as our thoughts, feelings, 
                      desires and instinctual impulses, etc. When in Western psychology, and 
                      when in common western speech, we refer to the term "Consciousness", 
                      we are from a<em> </em>Buddhist perspective generally referring to the 
                      mano-vijnana. But we should take account of the other five consciousnesses 
                      as well. Indeed, we can assume that within the human brain there are thus 
                      six centres of consciousness.</p>
              <p>But there are also, apparently, mental processes that go on, of which 
                      we are not conscious. In western psychology we say that these processes 
                      occur unconsciously, or subconsciously. Likewise, in Yogacara terminology, 
                      we speak of a process of mentation that is called the klista-manas, "obscured 
                      mind" or the "unconsciousness." A fundamental aim of Buddhist 
                      yoga practice is to remove this "obscuration" and bring to light 
                      this significant region of the human mind. The traditional yogi or yogini 
                      learns to penetrate into the unconsciousness (klista-manas) through the 
                      practice of one-pointed concentration and the nine stages of Shamatha 
                      meditation. Just as the darkness of a shadow vanishes before the light 
                      of a lamp, so it is said that the klista-manas exists not in the mind 
                      of the enlightened Arhat.</p>
              <p>When the veil of the klista-manas is penetrated, the meditator experiences 
                      a vast new wealth of awareness. This deep and refreshing state of oceanic 
                      awareness is the unified field of consciousness <em> (alaya-vijnana)</em> of which each individual sentient being is, as it were, a finite spark. 
                      To experience unified mind is to gain a sense of communion with the very 
                      ground of existential consciousness in its own true nature. It is to know 
                      evolving "mind" <em>(citta)</em> in its fullest and most universal 
                      sense.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, to gain this experience, it has to be understood what mind 
                      or consciousness is. As emphasized above, we have to understand that "consciousness" 
                      <em>(vijnana)</em> is a mental function concerned with perceiving something 
                      other than "itself". This means that the world of experience 
                      is apparently divided into subject and object. To be conscious of an object, 
                      to "see" something, is to separate the consciousness which "sees" 
                      from the apparent object which is "seen." And this division 
                      of subject and object is a function inherent to consciousness itself. 
                      Thus, in a sense we might say, this is what makes "consciousness" 
                      what it is. Amazingly enough, if you think about it, this means that consciousness 
                      could not exist on its own, if no "object" were to exist. Thus 
                      subject and object are mutually interdependent.</p>
              <p>To know mind in its own nature—to directly experience mind and 
                      arrive at awakened realization—the process of consciousness has 
                      to undergo a reversion in its very basis. This means that the continuous 
                      function of perceiving an object has to stop. The duality of observer 
                      and observed, of subject and object, has to collapse. In doing so, when 
                      there occurs a reversal of the basis in the depth of being, there then 
                      emerges an innate but previously not experienced, self-reflexive awareness 
                      <em> (svasamvedana)</em>. For the yogin, this event comes as a stunning 
                      breakthrough. Strangely enough, however, nothing has actually changed-self-reflexive 
                      awareness is realized to have been there all along, from the very beginning. 
                      Recognizing this, we are made aware that self-reflexive awareness is precisely 
                      a unique state of knowing (jnana) innate to all intelligence. In other 
                      words, it is an absolute condition of intelligence "to know." 
                      "To know"-this IS what intelligence <em>(vidya)</em> actually 
                      is. Bare knowingness is nondual. It just is intelligence.</p>
              <p>In the ancient Dzogchen Tantras, which for generations have been kept 
                      as actual "secret treatises" in the temple libraries of the 
                      yoginis and yogis of the Himalayas and in Tibet, it is revealed how, through 
                      meditation and insight, one may come to experience bare Intrinsic Intelligence, 
                      in its own essence. Indeed, the Dzogchen or Mahamudra system in particular, 
                      shows us that our own essential nature or "ultimate identity" 
                      is neither the body nor the consciousness, but rather, an immaculate and 
                      original Intelligence, which in the Tantras is described as being <em>Param-adi-Buddha</em>, 
                      the one supreme Absolute Intelligence itself. Original Intelligence-the 
                      very ground of all existence-is said to be entirely empty of ipseity; 
                      a self-luminous uncreate Clear Light of innate Knowingness, that is unlimited 
                      or unimpeded in the ever spontaneous manifestations of its endless love. 
                      The yogini and yogi who, through the methods of Mahamudra meditation, 
                      awakens to the intrinsic nature of mind, immediately realizes just this 
                      profound state of Absolute Totality <em>(dzog-pa chen-po)</em>. To experience 
                      this is to make life meaningful. To experience this is to know that no 
                      one "disappears" when they die. It is to know the ultimate divine 
                      beauty of one's Essence. That knowing is perfect peace.</p>
              <p>The purpose of the "Guru" <em> (Tib: bLa-ma, the Master)</em> in this Tradition is to point the spiritual seeker towards an immediate 
                      recognition of this "wholeness," which is our own root identity 
                      as bare Intelligence, and then to teach the yogacara methods concerning 
                      how to stabilize in one's consciousness, so that liberation may unfold 
                      naturally. The Master introduces one to one's own mind, by giving the 
                      pointing out instructions that describe what the actual nature of the 
                      mind is. The uniqueness of Dzogchen or Mahamudra is the rapid way in which 
                      meditation can lead to an experience of Enlightenment in this very lifetime.</p>
              <p>An important step to understand the Mahamudra View is to distinguish 
                      between the nature of relative mind (citta) belonging to the worldly experience 
                      of consciousness and appearance, and that original uncreate state of bare, 
                      nondual Intelligence <em>(known as Vidya)</em>, which is the essence or 
                      ground of what mind is, in and of itself.</p>
              <p>The Master Shantideva, 7th century author of the <em>Bodhicaryavatara</em>, 
                      says:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>"The absolute is beyond Consciousness; that which is within 
                        the realm of Consciousness is known to be always relative."</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is the all-inclusive Intelligence <em> (vidya)</em>, empty of subject 
                      and object differentiation, that the Master attempts to point out to the 
                      seeker, and recognizing the meaning of that is what is called "acquiring 
                      the View of Absolute Wholeness." Mysterious as it may sound, this 
                      very recognition allows mind to undergo the fundamental reversion of its 
                      basis, so basic for realization, whereby mind's inherent nature becomes 
                      revealed nakedly. Abiding in a state of attention, which merely holds 
                      to the View, without falling into linear thinking, forgetfulness or distraction, 
                      is the meditation. Sustaining that calm abiding state allows natural evolution 
                      to unfold into eventual Liberation.</p>
              <p>As the great yogi-master Patrul Rinpoche used to say:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>"The essence of mind, the very face of Intelligence, is introduced 
                        [to the seeker] at the very instant that conceptual consciousness is 
                        let go of."</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>To approach the teachings of Mahamudra there are certain preliminary 
                      meditation practices. One of our great teachers, the late <a href="http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/contemporarymasters/kyabje-dilgo-khyentse.htm">Kyabje 
                      Dilgo Khyentse</a> Rimpoche, emphasized the importance of these preliminaries 
                      <em>(Ngön-dro)</em> when he said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>"Without the preliminaries, or foundation practices, the 
                        main practice [of meditation] will not resist deluded thoughts, and 
                        carried away by circumstances the mind will be unstable."</em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Therefore those who come to the Dharma Fellowship seeking instruction 
                      in Mahamudra, are introduced to the teachings in a step-by-step process. 
                      They must begin with the preliminaries, the Purvaka Exercises, so as to 
                      lead them into the profound methods of Buddhist Yoga safely and carefully.</p>
              <p>As the seeker becomes more confident in performing meditation, and as 
                      a spiritual foundation is laid, he or she may then be introduced to the 
                      Tantric yoga methods of our school. With time, the Four Transmissions 
                      of Tilopa are explained - consisting of Chandali-yoga (or what is sometimes 
                      called, <em>Kundalini</em>), the Illusory-body meditation, Clear Light, 
                      and Karmamudra practices. Such a spiritual path, with its attendant exercises, 
                      leads deep into the heart of Mahamudra. Then rapid unfoldment can happen 
                      in earnest.</p>
              <p>This is meant to be a very brief outline of what Dzogchen or the Mahamudra 
                      Yogacara way is all about. Forgive us if we have left much out, or been 
                      less than clear in trying to explain this most difficult to describe, 
                      profound Path of Nondualist Mysticism.</p>

              <p>Here's an article (among a number of others), which I think are quite well written, shared to me by a friend 'mikaelz':</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I
                              had a wonderful meeting with Harada Roshi for one hour at Sogenji in Okayama on Monday. I
                              managed to digitally record the discussion and have it<br> now on my computer to listen to. Harada Roshi was very gracious and answered
                              all my Dharma questions regarding Zen practice, Ki and how total Awareness as
                              the essential <br> Buddha Nature comes about.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'><br> He also gave me much advice regarding my training others in Zen and offered to
                              give me advice as I may request in the future. He confirmed everything we have
                              been discussing in recent months as being exactly the way one would describe it
                              from the experience of Zen Mind or <br> Satori, and asked why would one think that the experience could be different
                              than the Tibetan traditions?<br> <br> I really felt I was sitting with a fully enlightened Buddha, a lineage holder
                              of that tradition going back to the original experience that Gautama Buddha
                              shared with the world over 2500 <br> years ago. I will go into his essential instructions over the next couple of
                              days. But essentially <br> his view was extremely clear and left no wiggle room for doubt in one's
                              practice. Let me relate Julie and Brett's recent conversations on Awareness and
                              how to work with skillful means such as the rushen of Dzogchen to Harada Roshi's
                              comments to me.<br> <br> When we are speaking of some sort of practice to open up the space of
                              Self-realization, we are already lost in duality and conceptualization and are
                              essentially making matters worse. This is enabling the assumption that there is
                              some state that is attainable if one could just get the practices and
                              subsequent insights "just right". We have objectified Awareness or
                              Rigpa as some sort of state that comes and goes... in glimpses that grow and stabilize
                              with more and more familiarity over time. But we must come to see that the
                              reverse is true: Rigpa or Awareness<br> is always stable and fully present, it is the energy of conceptualizing mind
                              that comes and goes like waves on the sea. Otherwise we remain snared in a
                              subtle state of ego-mind that is always chasing some experience called
                              Awareness. Awareness cannot be attained through practice. It is only when ALL
                              efforts at getting somewhere beneficial with our practice dissolve that it is
                              discovered that what is being looked for is exactly one's awareness in this
                              moment...not some future moment. This concept that there is some other
                              "higher" Awareness that will result after one gets it just
                              "right" is delusion and should be made clear.<span>  </span>The essential requirement is that the
                              ego-self mind projection must dissolve totally for all of this to become self-evident,
                              suddenly. Since that mind projection arises freshly from moment to moment,
                              there is always a gap where that ego-self is already non-existent. When that
                              ego-self is absent only Awareness shines, and in that moment of Self-Knowing,
                              it is recognized that there is no one who needs to attain enlightenment, as the
                              present Awareness is unchanging Enlightenment Itself. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>This
                              is a direct experience.. . that occurs to no one... but does occur.<span>  </span>Practicing being aware of Awareness does
                              produce some pleasant experiences of openness and clarity for sure.<br> But we are still "doing" something from the viewpoint of ego as ego.
                              Then the ego tries to re-experience those positive states again and again in
                              the vain hope it will gain greater and greater stability in this state that is
                              now being labelled "Rigpa" or Awareness by the ego consciousness. It
                              gets very tricky here... we have to be very alert to what is arising disguised
                              as whatever it seems <br> to be.<br> <br> Again secondary practices are resorted to only when this initial" pointing
                              out" or "direct introduction" have failed.<span>  </span>Let's not give in so easily to the ego's
                              needs and desires to be able <br> to "do something" to bring things along a bit according to its
                              samsaric view of its situation. All <br> doing, study and effort is exerted by one's ego, one's Awareness has no need of
                              any such activities in order to be what it already is and has always been.<span>  </span>Awareness has not forgotten who and what it
                              truly is and now needs to remedy the situation! There is no situation that
                              needs remedying, but there is a conceptual belief that there is. That
                              conceptual belief is just as invalid as the belief that there is an individual
                              being or person, and stems directly from that conceptual ignorance. All of
                              these concepts and feelings are arising within your Awareness as the<br> one who is having the experience.. . but it is being experienced from a place
                              where no concepts of self, nor problematic situations exist. These delusions of
                              being a self and its distractions just arise without any benefit or harm to the
                              experiencing Awareness.<br> <br> Entering the Way directly is extremely easy and pleasant. Your sensory
                              perceptual faculties are not a product of ego-consciousness. The ego does not
                              create the ability to see, hear, feel, taste or smell. Just seeing, hearing,
                              feeling, tasting and smelling immediately and directly are the functions of the
                              Buddha Nature.<span>  </span>However, thinking and
                              conceptualizing about those direct and immediate perceptions is where and how
                              ego consciousness enters the stage... always after the fact. First moment of
                              direct perception is the Buddha Mind functioning. The immediate next moment the
                              sensory perceptions are processed through ego consciousness.<span>  </span>Naked perceiving, free of all conceptualizing
                              through the five senses is being a Buddha in all that you do.<br> There is the wisdom of the Buddha Nature that directs one's actions with out
                              need of conceptualizing.<br> <br> Freedom is living fully in the moment of now, by taking everything that arises
                              "as it is" and leaving it as it is. Whatever perceptions arise leave
                              them just as they are. Whatever internal events, such as thoughts and feelings
                              arise, leave them just as they are. But if you now conceptualize that as
                              "ok, I will just leave things exactly as they arise as my practice",
                              you have already committed a fatal error as the ego has now turned this into
                              its own believed method of practice that will lead <br> to some enlightened or higher state or so it hopes!<br> <br> Just hear a sound... hear the next sound. Is there any separation between the
                              sound, the hearing and your Awareness of it? Is the sound heard and your
                              Awareness of it inseparable at that moment? Is that immediate and non-dual
                              samadhi where the unified field of Awareness and <br> Energy are in seamless Oneness?<span>  </span>That
                              being the case... how can you say the realization of Oneness is difficult or
                              requires effort and practice to attain? It occurs with every sound heard...<br> <br> When you are Aware of any experience.. . internal or external perceptions,
                              aren't you Aware of each and every one of those experiences that you have
                              knowingly experienced? If <br> so, how can you say that it is difficult or that it requires effort and
                              practice in order to find true Awareness, the default knowing and perceiving
                              Awareness of the Buddha Nature that is having those experiences?<br> <br> Your Buddha Awareness is alive and well in each moment already... who <br> do you think is reading this?<br> <br> More to come on all this…<br> <br> Love,<br> <br> Jax</span></p>

It happened one evening whilst Patrul Rinpoche was staying up in one of the retreat centers above the Dzogchen monastery. It was a beautiful night; the sky was clear, and the stars were very bright.

                  and the stars were very bright. It was very quiet, and the sound of
                  solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the
                  monastery below.<br> <br> Nyoshui Lungtok had not asked him anything that evening, and Patrul
                  Rinpoche called him over, saying "Didn't you tell me that you still
                  hadn't got the main point of the practice of Dzogchen?" Nyoshul
                  Lungtok replied: "Yes, that's right".<br> <br> "It's very simple", he said, and lying down on the ground, he
                  beckoned to him: "My son, come and lie down here like your father"
                  So Nyoshul Lungtok did so. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, in a
                  very affectionate way: "Do you see the stars in the sky?"<br> <br> "Yes"<br> <br> "Do you hear the dogs barking from the Dzogchen monastery?"<br> <br> "Yes"<br> <br> "Do you hear what I am saying to you?"<br> <br> "Yes"<br> <br> "Well, the nature of Dzogpachenpo is just - simply this."<br> <br> At this moment, everything fell into place, and instantaneously
                  Nyoshul Lungtok was completely realized.<br> --------------<br>  <br> About the Zen article, I sent Thusness and he said "but do note the
                  empty nature of Presence to make presence more Presence and fully
                  effortless."</p>

              <p>nice of you to share this articles</p>
              <p>the beauty of this is that Patrul Rinpoche have not employed anything magic...</p>
              <p>he just employ the techniques of  pointing the awareness in the thing we viewed..Once we are void of all perception , conception and luminousity appear ,that is Dzogchen ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but remember , all alot of hardwork in Nyoshui preliminaries to repent the past karmic offense before the Inner Buddha nature is surfaced</p>

              <p>Yes, preliminaries are still important for removing the emotional and cognitive obscurations.</p>

              <p><span>To reach enlightenment, we need to remove forever two sets of <span class="searchword4"><span><span class="searchword4"><span><span class="searchword4">obscurations</span></span></span></span></span>:</span></p>

              <p><span>These <span class="searchword4"><span><span class="searchword4"><span><span class="searchword4">obscurations</span></span></span></span></span> bring us, respectively, the suffering of uncontrollably recurring existence (</span><em><span class="tool" title="Uncontrollably recurring rebirth under the power of disturbing emotions and attitudes and of karma. Some translators render it as 'cyclic existence.'">samsara</span></em>) and the inability to be of best help to others.

In essence, the mind (mental activity) is
                              naturally pure of all fleeting stains. This is an important aspect of
                              its <span class="tool" title="Literally: Buddha caste-trait, Buddha family-trait. A factor imputable on the stained mind of a limited being (sentient being) that transforms into or allows for the attainment of enlightenment.">Buddha-nature</span>.</p>

                      Removing obscuration also requires a level of mind (or mental activity)
                      most conducive for bringing about this removal. <span class="searchword1"><span><span class="searchword1"><span><span class="searchword1">Dzogchen</span></span></span></span></span> practice brings us to that level.</span></p>

              Interview for Vajradhatu Sun, 1985
              <p class="indextext">The following interview with Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche was 
                            recorded on the 16th day of December, 1985, at Nagi Gompa, outside of 
                            Kathmandu. <br> When Rinpoche was asked if he would grant an interview for the Vajradhatu 
                            Sun, his reply was, "What is the use of the tiny light of a firefly 
                            when the sun has already risen in the sky?" referring to Trungpa 
                            Rinpoche's presence in the West.</p>
              <p><span class="indextext">Q: Can Rinpoche please tell us about his life, 
                            his teachers, and the retreats he has done?</span></p>
              <p class="indextext">R: I was born in Eastern Tibet, in Kham, in the area called 
                            Nangchen. The Dharma teaching of my family line is called Barom Kagyu. 
                            My grandmother was the daughter of Chokgyur Lingpa, the great terton, 
                            so my family line also practices the Nyingma teachings. Since I hold 
                            the lineages of both Kagyu and Nyingma, my monastery in Boudhanath is 
                            therefore called Ka-Nying Shedrub Ling, The Kagyu and Nyingma Place 
                            for Teaching and Practice.</p>
              <p class="indextext">From the time I was quite small until the age of twenty-one, 
                            I stayed with <img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/Kangyur.jpg" alt="Kangyur - the Tripitaka" width="119" height="160" align="right">my 
                            father who was a Vajrayana teacher and tantric layman. His name was 
                            Tsangsar Chimey Dorje. My father was my first teacher and from him I 
                            received the transmission for the Kangyur, the entire teachings of the 
                            Buddha, and also for the Chokling Tersar, "The <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Chokling_Tersar.htm">New 
                            Treasures</a> of Chokgyur Lingpa." Later, I studied with my father's 
                            older brother, Tulku Samten Gyatso from whom I received also, among 
                            other things, the entire transmission of the Chokling Tersar.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Later on I studied with an incredible great master named 
                            Kyungtrul Karjam and from him I received the entire Dam-ngak Dzo as 
                            well as Chowang Gyatsa, the Hundred Empowerments of Cutting Practice. 
                            He also passed on to me the reading transmission for the <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Nyingma_Gyubum.htm">Hundred 
                            Thousand Nyingma Tantras</a> and the <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Rigdzin_Godem.htm">Jangter 
                            Gongpa Sangtal</a>, the Northern Treasure of Unimpeded Wisdom Mind. 
                            In particular, I received from him a detailed commentary and clarification 
                            of the important treasure of Chokgyur Lingpa renowned as <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Lamrim_Yeshe_Nyingpo_introduction.htm">Lamrim 
                            Yeshe Nyingpo</a>, the Gradual Path of The Wisdom Essence.</p>
              <p class="indextext">From the time I was eight years old, I received teachings 
                            on the nature of mind from my own father, and I was lucky later on, 
                            to receive detailed instructions in the form of "guidance through 
                            personal experience" from Samten Gyatso on the teachings of Dzogchen, 
                            the Great Perfection. From my other uncle, Tersey Rinpoche, who was 
                            a close disciple of the great siddha Shakya Shri, I was also lucky to 
                            receive teachings on Dzogchen.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Moreover, I again received detailed teachings on <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Lamrim_Yeshe_Nyingpo_introduction.htm">Lamrim 
                            Yeshe Nyingpo</a> from Jokyab Rinpoche, a disciple of Dru Jamyang Drakpa. 
                            The body of teachings known as <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/Rinchen_Terdzo.htm">Rinchen 
                            Terdzo</a>, the Precious Treasury, I received from Jamgon Kongtrul, 
                            the son of the <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Khakyab_Dorje_15th_Karmapa.htm">15th 
                            Karmapa</a>. As for the other of the Five Treasuries, I received the 
                            Gyachen Kadzo from my third uncle, Sang-ngak Rinpoche, the Kagyu Ngakdzo 
                            from H.H. the 16th Karmapa himself, and the Sheja Kunkyab Treasury from 
                            Tana Pemba Rinpoche. I addition, I have received the root empowerments 
                            of Jigmey Lingpa from H.H. Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche several times.</p>
              <p class="indextext">In Eastern Tibet I spent three years in retreat just reciting 
                            the Mani. [Laughs]. Later on at Tsurphu, the seat of the Karmapas, I 
                            also spent three years in retreat and then again in Sikkim I was able 
                            to spend almost three years in intensive practice. Lately, I have been 
                            here at Nagi Gompa for a few years. That's my life story.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: What lineages does Rinpoche hold?<img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/gampopa.jpg" alt="Gampopa" width="133" height="160" align="left"></p>
              <p class="indextext">R: My family line is the holder of the Barom Kagyu teachings 
                            which originate from Gampopa's disciple Barom Dharma Wangchuk. His disciple 
                            was Tishi Repa whose disciple was called Repa Karpo. His disciple again 
                            was Tsangsar Lumey Dorje. His disciple, Jangchub Shonnu of Tsangsar, 
                            is in my paternal ancestral lineage. The line of his son and his son 
                            again, all the way down to my father, is called Tsangsar Lhai Dung-gyu, 
                            the Divine Bloodline of Tsangsar.</p>
              <p class="indextext"><img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/25_disciples3.jpg" alt="" width="105" height="160" align="left">My 
                            incarnation line is called Chowang Tulku. With that same name I am just 
                            the second. My past life was said to be an incarnation of <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/guru_chowang.htm">Guru 
                            Chowang</a>. <img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/Nubchen_Sangye_Yeshe2.jpg" alt="Nubchen Sangye Yeshe" width="128" height="160" align="right">He was also said to be an emanation of one of the <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/25_disciples.htm">twenty-five 
                            disciples</a> of Padmasambhava called Nubchen Sangye Yeshe, but who 
                            knows that for sure. [Laughs]. My former life, Chowang Tulku, was a 
                            "secret yogi." No one knew how his practice was, but when 
                            he passed away his body shrunk down to the size of one cubit without 
                            decomposing.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: What does Dzogchen mean?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: Dzog, "perfection" or "completion," 
                            means as in this quote from a tantra, "Complete in one - everything 
                            is complete within mind. Complete in two - everything of samsara and 
                            nirvana is complete within this."</p>
              <p class="indextext">"Dzog" means that all the teachings, all phenomena, 
                            is completely contained in the vehicle of Dzogchen; all the lower vehicles 
                            are included within Dzogchen. "Chen," "great," means 
                            that there is no method or means higher than this vehicle.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: What is the basic outline of practice according to 
                            the Dzogchen path?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: All the Buddha's teachings are contained within nine 
                            gradual vehicle of which Dzogchen, the Great Perfection, is like the 
                            highest golden ornament on a rooftop spire, or the victory banner on 
                            the summit of a great building. All the eight lower vehicles are contained 
                            within the ninth which is called Dzogchen in Tibetan, Mahasandhi in 
                            Sanskrit [and the Great Perfection in English]. But Dzogchen is not 
                            contained in the lowest one, the shravaka vehicle. So when we say "perfect" 
                            or "complete" it means that all the lower yanas are perfected 
                            or completely contained within the Great Perfection, within Dzogchen.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Usually we say that Dzogchen, sometimes called Ati Yoga, 
                            is a Dharma tradition but actually it is just the state of one's mind, 
                            basically.</p>
              <p class="indextext"><img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/Karmapa_03.jpg" alt="3rd Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje" width="132" height="160" align="left">When 
                            it comes to combining these following two points into actual experience, 
                            we can use the statement of the 3rd Karmapa, Rangjung Dorje, "It 
                            is not existent as even the buddhas have not seen it." This means 
                            that the basic state of mind is not something that exists in a concrete 
                            way; even the buddhas of the three times have never perceived it. "It 
                            is not non-existent as it is the basis for both samsara and nirvana. 
                            This is not a contradiction, it is the middle path of unity." Contradiction 
                            is like having fire and water on the same plate. Its impossible. But 
                            that is not the case here. The basic nature is neither existent nor 
                            non-existent - these two are an indivisible unity. "May I perceive 
                            the mind nature free from extremes." Usually when we say "is" 
                            it contradicts "is not." And when we say "non-existent" 
                            it contradicts "existent." But this middle path of unity is 
                            devoid of such contradiction. When it is said "to attain the unified 
                            state of Vajradhara," that actually refers to what I discussed 
                            here.</p>
              <p class="indextext">This unity of being empty and cognizant is the state of 
                            mind of all sentient beings. There is nothing special about that. A 
                            practitioner should encompass that with "a core of awareness." 
                            That is the path of practice. Again, "the unity of being empty 
                            and cognizant with a core of awareness."</p>
              <p class="indextext">The special feature of Dzogchen is as follows: "Primordial 
                            pure essence is Trekcho, Cutting Through." This view is actually 
                            present in all the nine vehicles, but the special quality of Dzogchen 
                            is what is called "The spontaneously present nature is Togal, Direct 
                            Crossing." The unity of these two, Cutting Through and Direct Crossing, 
                            Trekcho and Togal, is the special or unique teaching of Dzogchen. That 
                            is how Dzogchen basically is. That's it.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: That is a very wonderful teaching. It seems like Dzogchen 
                            is very direct and doesn't seem to have a linear quality in terms of 
                            the way one would approach it. In the other yanas sometimes one would 
                            first do the set of preliminaries, then a yidam practice. tsa-lung practice 
                            etc., this and that. It seems like Dzogchen is very immediate, like 
                            the essence is already present, available. Is there any kind of linear 
                            path in the way one would approach these teachings or is it always direct, 
                            like this?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: We do in the Dzogchen tradition have the gradual system 
                            of preliminaries, main part and so forth. But the special characteristic 
                            of Dzogchen is to introduce or point out directly the naked awareness, 
                            the self-existing wakefulness. This is for student who are suitable, 
                            meaning those who have sharp mental faculties. In stead of going through 
                            a lot of beating around the bush, one would introduce them directly 
                            to their mind essence, to their self-existing awareness.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Dzogchen is said to have great advantage but also great 
                            danger. Why is this? Because all the teachings are ultimately and finally 
                            resolved within the system of Dzogchen. This can be divided into two 
                            parts, resolving all the teaching through intellectual understanding 
                            and through experience.</p>
              <p class="indextext">To resolve through experience is what is the great advantage 
                            or benefit in the sense that having pointed out and recognizing directly 
                            naked awareness and simply makes that the main part of practice. That 
                            is the point when there is an incredible great benefit because that 
                            itself is the very direct and swift path to enlightenment.</p>
              <p class="indextext">On the other hand, the great danger is when one just leaves 
                            it as intellectual understanding, that "In Dzogchen there is nothing 
                            to meditate upon. There is nothing to view. There is nothing to carry 
                            out as an action." That becomes just a concept of nihilism and 
                            is completely detrimental to progress. This is because the final point 
                            of the teaching is conceptlessness, being beyond intellectual thinking. 
                            Yet, what has happened is that one has created an intellectual idea 
                            of what Dzogchen is and holds on to that idea very tightly. This is 
                            a major mistake that can happen. So, it is very important to take the 
                            teachings into one's personal experience through the oral instructions 
                            of one's teacher. Otherwise, simply to have the idea "I am meditating 
                            on Dzogchen" is to completely miss the point.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Self-existing wakefulness is present within the mind-stream 
                            of all sentient beings since primordial time. This presence is something 
                            which should not be left as theory, but should be acknowledged though 
                            one's experience. One first recognizes it, then trains and attain stability 
                            in it. That is when it is said that Dzogchen has great benefit. There 
                            is actually no greater benefit than this.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Great danger means that when this is left as words of 
                            mere intellectual understanding then one doesn't gain any experience 
                            but merely holds some concept about it and lack the nonconceptual quality. 
                            Conceptual mind is merely intellect whereas experience to remain in 
                            the continuity of naked awareness; growing used to it what is called 
                            "experiencing."</p>
              <p class="indextext">It is the same principle whether one talks of Madhyamika, 
                            Mahamudra or Dzogchen. As is said in the Bodhicharya Avatara, "When 
                            one's intellect holds neither the concept of concreteness nor of inconcreteness, 
                            that is the state of not conceptualizing." As long as one is not 
                            free from concepts, one's view remains as mere intellectual understanding 
                            and the Dzogchen view is then left as mere theory. One might then think 
                            "Dzogchen is primordially empty, it is free from a basis. There 
                            is nothing to meditate upon, no need to do anything If I meditate in 
                            the morning, I am a buddha in the morning. When I recognize at night, 
                            I am a buddha at night. The destined one does not even have to meditate."</p>
              <p class="indextext">Actually, Dzogchen is the way to purify the most subtle 
                            obscuration of dualistic knowledge - it is something quite in credible. 
                            But if one only imagines it, if it is a mere theory, thinking "I 
                            don't need to do anything, neither meditate nor practice," [one's 
                            has completely missed the point]. There has been many people thinking 
                            like this in the past.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Compared to straying into an intellectualized version 
                            of Dzogchen, it is much more beneficial to practice according to Madhyamika 
                            or Mahamudra where one goes along step by step, alternating theory and 
                            experience within the structure of theory, experience and realization. 
                            Proceeding gradually in this way one becomes more and more clear about 
                            what is to be resolved and then finally captures the "dharmakaya 
                            throne of nonmeditation." In this graduated system there are some 
                            reference points along the various paths and levels. But in Dzogchen 
                            the master will from the very beginning point out the nonconceptual 
                            state, instructing the student to remain free from concepts. It then 
                            happens that some student will think, "I am free from concepts, 
                            I am never distracted!" while walking around with vacantly gazing 
                            eyes. That is called straying into intellectual understanding.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Later on, when we have to die, mere theory will not help 
                            us whatsoever. Tilopa told Naropa, "Theory is like a patch. It 
                            will wear and fall off." After dying, we will undergo various pleasant 
                            and unpleasant experiences, intense panic, fear and terror. Intellectual 
                            understanding will not be able to destroy those fears; it cannot make 
                            confusion subside. So, merely to generalize that one's essence is devoid 
                            of confusion is useless. It's only a thought, another concept, which 
                            is ineffective at the moment of death when it comes to deal with one's 
                            confusion.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: What will help then?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: One needs to recognize the view of one's essence. If 
                            one hasn't thoroughly acknowledged the correct view but only constructed 
                            it from concepts, this intellectual understanding will be useless. Its 
                            like knowing that there is a delicious meal to be eaten. Without putting 
                            it into one's mouth one will never know what is tastes like. Likewise, 
                            one needs to be totally free from the merest flicker of doubt concerning 
                            the state of naked aware ness. Jigmey Lingpa said about having stability 
                            in awareness, "At this point there is no need for 100 panditas 
                            and their thousands of explanations. One will know what is sufficient. 
                            Even when questioned by these scholars, one will not give rise to doubt. 
                            So the main point is to be stable in awareness through experience.</p>
              <p class="indextext">This awareness is not introduced through an intellectual 
                            understanding where one only has the idea of it. When a qualified master 
                            encounters a worthy student it is like iron striking flint creating 
                            fire immediately. When such two persons meet together it's possible 
                            to be free from doubt.</p>
              <p class="indextext">When one doesn't feel any doubt, no matter how much one 
                            may try, that is the proof of having recognized the mind essence. But 
                            if it's possible to start doubting, thinking "I wonder how it is, 
                            what shall I do?" that is the proof of having mere intellectual 
                            understanding.</p>
              <p class="indextext">This difference between theory and experience is what 
                            I basically meant by saying that Dzogchen has both great benefit and 
                            great danger.</p>
              <p class="indextext">When a practitioner is introduced to naked awareness he 
                            will be able to attain enlightenment in that very body and lifetime 
                            because in the moment of recognizing the essence of awareness, the obscuration 
                            of dualistic knowledge is absent. This is called "touching the 
                            fruition." In this respect there are three ways: taking ground 
                            as path, taking path as path, and taking fruition as path. Receiving 
                            the pointing-out instruction means that one takes fruition as path. 
                            That is why it is so precious. So don't let it stray into mere theory.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Experience is said to be the "adornment of awareness." 
                            Awareness is present within all beings; whoever has mind has awareness 
                            since it is the mind's essence. The relationship between mind and awareness 
                            is mind being like the shadow of one's hand and awareness being the 
                            hand itself. In this way, there is not one single sentient being who 
                            does not have awareness. We might hear about awareness and then think 
                            "I understand, awareness is just such and such." This mental 
                            construct is totally useless - from the very first the absence of mental 
                            fabrication is crucial. As is said, "Within the naked dharmadhatu 
                            of non- fabrication."</p>
              <p class="indextext">Introducing awareness means to point out the absence of 
                            mental fabrication. Otherwise it becomes an introduction to mere discursive 
                            thought. [Laughs]</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: What is the difference between the practice of Dzogchen 
                            and that of the Anuttara Yoga Tantra in the system of the New Schools, 
                            (gsar ma)? It was taught that all the eight lower vehicles are contained 
                            within Dzogchen, so how does the difference come about?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: In the system of the New Schools, there are first of 
                            all the four tantras of Kriya Tantra, Charya Tantra, Yoga Tantra, and 
                            Anuttara Yoga Tantra. The fourth is divided into Father Anuttara Tantra, 
                            Mother Anuttara Tantra and Nondual Anuttara Tantra. This correspond 
                            exactly to the structure of the Old School, Nyingma, in that father 
                            tantra of Anuttara is Mahayoga, mother tantra is Anu yoga and the nondual 
                            tantra is Ati Yoga, [Dzogchen]. However, there are no explicit teachings 
                            on Togal in Anuttara. That is the main difference, whereas it is taught 
                            that there is no difference whatsoever between "essence Mahamudra" 
                            and Dzogchen in meaning - only in terminology.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Concerning the inclusion of the lower vehicles in the 
                            highest is "All phenomena of samsara and nirvana are included with 
                            the expanse of awareness." That is the meaning of "inclusion."</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: There are many kinds of conceptual practices in Anuttara 
                            Yoga such as visualization and manipulations of the nadis and pranas. 
                            How do the fit into the Dzogchen system?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: These practices actually belong to the systems of Mahayoga 
                            and Anu yoga. However, in Ati Yoga which should be effortless, free 
                            from fixation, these practices are applied as "means for enhancement." 
                            Q: From where does the tradition of giving the transmission of the pointing-out 
                            instruction originate?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: The first origin is what we call the "mind transmission 
                            of the victorious ones." <img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/Buddha-Samantabhadra.jpg" alt="Buddha-Samantabhadra" width="137" height="160" align="right">After 
                            that there was the "sign transmission of vidyadharas" and 
                            today we have the "oral transmission of great masters." First, 
                            the mind transmission of the victorious ones, was when the manifestation 
                            aspect of Samantabhadra appeared in a bodily form and the five families 
                            of victorious ones recognized dharmata by merely seeing this bodily 
                            form. <img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/Garab-Dorje-3.jpg" alt="Garab Dorje" width="136" height="160" align="left">This 
                            was mind transmission through simply manifesting as a deity without 
                            the need for any conversation. This mind transmission seems to have 
                            gradually degenerated. Following that, by means of the sign transmission 
                            of vidyadharas such masters as <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Garab_Dorje.htm">Garab 
                            Dorje</a>, <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Shri_Singha.htm">Shri Singha</a> and 
                            Guru Rinpoche recognized the self-existing wakefulness of dharmata through 
                            a simply gesture such as a finger pointing at the sky. Finally, Guru 
                            Rinpoche, The Eight Indian Vidyadharas as well as the Tibetan King, 
                            Subject and Companion [Trisong Deutsen, <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Vairotsana.htm">Vairotsana</a> and Yeshe Tsogyal] and so forth gave teachings through oral transmission. 
                            This oral transmission which comes from India and is not a Tibetan invention, 
                            was originally imparted by whispering through a copper tube such as 
                            in the case of <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Vairotsana.htm">Vairotsana</a> into whose ear 
                            was whispered the sentence, "The single sphere of dharmakaya, self-existing 
                            wakefulness, inconceivable reality, is present within the mind of sentient 
                            beings. Oral transmission literally means "transmitted into the 
                            ear."</p>
              <p class="indextext">In the case of the Kagyu lineage, Tilopa stated, "I 
                            have no human masters. My master is Vajradhara himself." <img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/marpa2.jpg" alt="Marpa Chokyi Lodro" width="130" height="160" align="right">So, figuratively 
                            speaking, Vajradhara gave the teachings to Tilopa and Tilopa transmitted 
                            them orally to Naropa who then passed then on to Marpa. He gave them 
                            to Milarepa and he again to Gampopa from whom they were orally transmitted 
                            to the "four great and eight lesser lineages.</p>
              <p class="indextext"><img src="http://www.rangjung.com/images/thumbnails/Vimalamitra.jpg" alt="Vimalamitra" width="121" height="160" align="left">In 
                            the case of the Nyingma lineage, Guru Rinpoche, <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/vimalamitra.htm">Vimalamitra</a> and <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/authors/Vairotsana.htm">Vairotsana</a> passed the teachings on 
                            chiefly as an oral transmission to the <a href="http://www.rangjung.com/gl/25_disciples.htm">Twenty-five 
                            Disciples</a> headed by the King, Subject and Companion. Here Dzogchen 
                            was transmitted as the pointing-out of the expression of awareness; 
                            not to awareness itself but to its expression which is dharmata. From 
                            this point, the Twenty-five Disciples passed the teaching on to the 
                            Eighty Tibetan Siddhas and others such as the various oral lineages 
                            as well as the treasure lineages, so that this transmission has been 
                            uninterrupted down until our own root guru. If the lineage had been 
                            broken there would be no pointing-out and recognition</p>
              <p class="indextext">of awareness.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: Why is this pointing-out instruction considered so 
                            important?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: That is self-evident. Isn't awareness the actual path 
                            for attaining enlightenment? There is nothing more important than recognizing 
                            it and become a buddha [laughs]. If you put all the riches in the world 
                            on one side and the pointing out of awareness on the other, awareness 
                            will be more valuable for enlightenment.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: Having received the pointing-out instruction and recognized, 
                            will that itself be sufficient or how should one train?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: Once one has received the pointing-out instruction 
                            there is the chance of either recognizing it or not. But a student who 
                            has actually recognized will have enough for this entire lifetime in 
                            the "single sufficient instruction." The same goes for the 
                            bardo state. Yet, one can still apply the paths of Mahayoga and Anu 
                            yoga for enhancement and for clearing away hindrances. Once one has 
                            recognized one's essence, it is like a fire that only will blaze up 
                            more intensely the more firewood is added; the fire will never diminish 
                            with the adding of wood. Similarly, there will be benefit from applying 
                            the paths of Mahayoga and Anu yoga; even Hinayana practice will be beneficial.</p>
              <p class="indextext">According to one's ability one can apply what one feels 
                            inclined towards - like gathering honey from many different flowers. 
                            Or, simply to cultivate and practice the recognition of awareness alone 
                            will be sufficient for attaining enlightenment within this body and 
                            lifetime. All the different practices of Mahayoga and Anu yoga, as in 
                            the system of Jamgon Kongtrul the First, are for the purpose of attaining 
                            stability in awareness. While benefiting beings one can become more 
                            stable in awareness. As I already mentioned, fire blazes up and increases 
                            the more wood is added; it is not the opposite way.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Having recognized one's essence, one should sustain its 
                            continuity. There will be no benefit from simply leaving it with "I 
                            have recognized!" It is necessary to maintain the continuity of 
                            awareness until all confusion and conceptual thinking has been exhausted. 
                            That itself is the measure; when thoughts are exhausted then it is enough. 
                            There is no more need for meditation or for "sustaining the continuity."</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: Although Rinpoche has a large monastery in Boudhanath, 
                            Kathmandu, I notice that he spends most of his time up at Nagi Gompa 
                            Retreat Center. Why is that?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: As a matter of fact, it is said, "In this age 
                            of degeneration, carry the burden of the Doctrine. If you are not able 
                            to do so, simply the fear that the teachings will die out occurring 
                            in your mind for but instant will have tremendous merit." For this 
                            reason, the purpose of building a monastery with a gathering of the 
                            sangha of monks - as just an image of the doctrine in this dark age 
                            - is that we have the great hope that they will practice the tradition 
                            of the Dharma. Whether or not the monks individually do any practice 
                            is their own business. But if they just wear the robes on their bodies, 
                            cut the hairs on their heads and gather together in a group of merely 
                            four monks, the benefit of accumulating merit and purifying one's obscurations 
                            will result from the respect, faith and donations one can make as a 
                            benefactor, no matter how insignificant one's contribution or faith 
                            may be. This is independent of whether or not the monks misbehave or 
                            misappropriate their donations; that is totally up to themselves. For 
                            the benefactors, their will be the blessings of the Buddha when they 
                            make a donation to a gathering of just four monks. Their will be no 
                            failure in that for the patrons themselves. It is for this reason that 
                            I took the effort to build a monastery. Moreover, this age is the time 
                            when Buddhism is slowly dying out, like the sun about to depart while 
                            setting over the mountains in the west. Considering this combined with 
                            having received the command of His Holiness Gyalwa Karmapa, we have 
                            constructed this insignificant monastery.</p>
              <p class="indextext">The place up a Nagi Gompa was initially build by the meditator 
                            and hermit Kharsha Rinpoche as a hermitage for his following of monks 
                            and nuns. After he passed away, the place was offered to Karmapa who 
                            then placed me as a caretaker. So I, this old man here, is just a caretaker 
                            [laughs]. That is the only reason why I live up here; I am not at all 
                            like Milarepa, living in mountain retreats and caves after renouncing 
                            samsara. But I have a nice spot to sleep on and a warm place in the 
                            sun [laughs]. That is how I live.</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: What is the benefit and purpose of doing retreat practice?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: With many distractions one is not able to practice 
                            the Dharma properly. Distraction means a lot of business, noise and 
                            things to do. When going up in the mountains there will be less distraction. 
                            That is the reason for mountain retreat. In addition to that, if one 
                            is able to keep some discipline, remaining in solitude without allowing 
                            outsiders to visit and not going out oneself, there will be no other 
                            distraction than that made by one's own mind. External distractions 
                            have been eliminated. That is the purpose of seclusion.</p>
              <p class="indextext">When distractions have been abandoned one can exert oneself 
                            in the practice. Through exertion it is possible to destroy confusion. 
                            When confusion falls away, enlightenment is attained. That is the whole 
                            reason [laughs].</p>
              <p class="indextext">Q: Finally but not least, does Rinpoche have any special 
                            advice for the readers of Vajradhatu Sun who are primarily householders?</p>
              <p class="indextext">R: They should first of all receive the pointing-out instruction 
                            and recognize their essence. Having recognized, they should refrain 
                            from losing its continuity and then mingle that with their daily activities. 
                            There are basically four kinds of daily actions traditionally called 
                            moving, sitting, eating and lying down. We don't always only sit or 
                            only move about; we alternate between the two. In addition we eat, shit 
                            and sleep. So there actually seem to be five kinds [laughs]. But at 
                            all times, in all situations, one should try not to lose the continuity 
                            of the practice. One should try to be able to mingle the practice with 
                            daily life. As one gets more accustomed, any amount of daily life activities 
                            will only cause nondualistic awareness to develop and become the adornment 
                            of this undistracted awareness, free from being obscured or cleared.</p>
              <p class="indextext">When one is able to mingle practice with the activities 
                            of daily life, these activities will then be beneficial and devoid of 
                            any harm whatsoever. That is if one has already recognized one's essence 
                            correctly. Without the correct recognition one will get carried away 
                            by the daily activities - one will have no stability. Lacking stability 
                            is like a strand of hair in the wind bending according to how the wind 
                            blows whereas a needle will be stable no matter how small it is. Even 
                            a very thin needle cannot be bent by the wind. Once one has truly recognized 
                            one's essence one cannot be carried away by the activities of daily 
                            life, just as a needle that is stable. Dualistic mind is completely 
                            unstable, like a hair that is just ready to move by the tiniest breeze; 
                            it falls prey to the five external sense objects. Awareness, on the 
                            other hand, when properly recognized, does never fall subject to sense 
                            objects. It is like a needle that is unmoved by the wind.</p>

              <p>Not so much of we cannot use words (though it is true that a mind under the hypnotic spell of thoughts and concepts will never truly notice what is direct and self-evident).
