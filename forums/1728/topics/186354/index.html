There is no doer of deed, and there is nobody experiencing the effect. It is made up of 5 skhandas, it is the Volition doing the deed.<br><br>When we speak of "intentions"/"volition", we must know that volition is part of every sentient being (5 Skhandas), so even though "he" does not know what he has done that, "his" volition of doing shall create the karma. Only an enlightened person can transcend that, that is Non-volition. But non-volition is not the same as not knowing because not careful. Non-volition must be understood in terms of Prajna/Wisdom. Without prajna, a person cannot attain non-volition. That is why an enlightened person no longer creates karma. Thus learnt from Thusness.<br><br><blockquote>karma of killing is like this. if person A kill person B, person B will feel that he would want to kill back person A. to erase the killing karma, person B have to Forgive person A, hence the action of killing have to stop in either of the person.<br><br>when Buddha was a bodhisattva, out of compassion and wisdom, He killed the killer who was about to kill all the people on the boat. the bodhisattva actually took on the karma of reborning into hell for the killer. even if the action of killing is out of compassion, the bodhisattva(who have not reached a level of Tenth Bhumi) will still have to watch their Actions and intention.<br><br>/\[/b]</blockquote>Yes! A Bodhisattva does willingly commit "sins" for sentient beings. My dharma teacher herself also said, for example, if the dharma centre is full of mosquitoes/etc, she might take up the karma for the sake of spreading dharma for us, she might call the pest control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> But I think I don't have wisdom and I dare not take up karma for sake of others...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not exactly sure this is right but I donÂ’t think unintentional actions constitute karma.  Any way in Theravada tradition, karma-vipaka is one of the four unthinkables stated by Buddha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i kind of thought the same. but if Ven had cited it from sutra, then i'm willing to believe. anyway, if contemplate on it, Buddha did mentioned,  Black kamma, black result; White kamma, white result; then non-intentional kamma, non-intentional result(?).<br>maybe, it's those very fine karma that spring from ignorance or not being mindful (of the surrounding).<br><br><blockquote>What is the cause of Karma?<br><br><strong>Ignorance </strong>(avijja), or not knowing things as they truly are, is the chief cause of Karma. Dependent on ignorance arise activities (avijja paccaya samkhara) states the Buddha in the Paticca Samuppada (Dependent Origination). </blockquote><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm#2" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm#2</a><br><br>also ref:<br>Six Kinds of kamma -<br><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9280/kamma1.htm#Kinds" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9280/kamma1.htm#Kinds</a><br><br>or/and maybe it's those very fine karma that spring from unskillfulness.<br><br>imho,<br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kind of think of it, i can cite a couple of example but similar situation of a non-intention karma, that i personally experience. but to protect the identity, i will use person A and B in a family/company. person A was doing more work than person B. but person A have no intention that person B or the company is treating him unfairly. then things happened, and now person A is relaxing, while person B is now doing more work than before.<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how coincident, just heard from Ven Hai Tao, who cited another example of non-intentional action do have non-intentional karma. it's regarding the Emperor Liang Wu Ti who was playing chess with his subordinate and he shouted 'Kill' in the midst of the game. the soldier outside heard it and killed a monk who was coming to visit Emperor Liang. when Liang Wu Ti found out, he went to ask another monk who was able to see the past lifes. the monk said that in a previous life the monk was preaching the Dharma and a worm came to listen. the monk was holding a stick and was unintentionally stumbing the gound while preaching. the worm which was the previous life of Liang Wu Ti went under and was crushed.<br><br>/\<br></div>
