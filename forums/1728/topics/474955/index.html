              What happened when he was sitting under the tree and through his meditation, became the Fully-Enlightened Buddha? 
              
              What happened during those days and nights when he had meditated there? Is it that the Buddha realised some universal truths or something?

              <p><br>He gained three knowledges: 1) past lives, 2) karma and its results, 3) liberation from afflictions/suffering/rebirth<br><br>See <a href="http://balawegaya.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/what-happened-under-the-bodhi-tree/">http://balawegaya.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/what-happened-under-the-bodhi-tree/</a><br><br>(Partial excerpt. Buddha said:)</p>
              <p>“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, 
                              rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to 
                              imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the recollection of past
                               lives. I recollected my manifold past lives.</p>
              <p>“This was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch 
                              of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose, darkness 
                              was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, 
                              ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not
                               invade my mind and remain.</p>
              <p>“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, 
                              rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to 
                              imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the passing away and 
                              reappearance of beings. Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and 
                              surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing, inferior
                               and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I 
                              understood how beings pass on according to their actions.</p>
              <p>“This was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle 
                              watch of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose, 
                              darkness was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides 
                              diligent, ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose in 
                              me did not invade my mind and remain.</p>
              <p>“When my concentrated mind was thus purified, bright, unblemished, 
                              rid of imperfection, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to 
                              imperturbability, I directed it to knowledge of the destruction of the 
                              taints. I directly knew as it actually is: ‘This is suffering’; ‘This is
                               the origin of suffering’; ‘This is the cessation of suffering’; ‘This 
                              is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’.</p>
              <p>In the first discourses he said that he knew perfectly well these 
                              four truths as theory, their function and fulfillment of their function.</p>
              <p>In the way he realized: ‘These are the taints’; ‘This is the origin 
                              of the taints’; ‘This is the cessation of the taints’; ‘This is the way 
                              leading to the cessation of the taints.’</p>
              <p>“When I knew and saw thus, my mind was liberated from the taint of 
                              sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of 
                              ignorance. When it was liberated there came the knowledge: ‘It is 
                              liberated.’ I directly knew: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been
                               lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to 
                              any state of being.’</p>
              <p>“This was the third true knowledge attained by me in the last watch 
                              of the night. Ignorance was banished and true knowledge arose, darkness 
                              was banished and light arose, as happens in one who abides diligent, 
                              ardent, and resolute. But such pleasant feeling that arose in me did not
                               invade my mind and remain.”<a href="http://balawegaya.wordpress.com/Users/seawolf/Desktop/What%20Happened%20under%20the%20Bodhi%202600%20Magazine.doc#_edn9">[ix]</a></p>
