              Historical Tree in the World</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">January 23, 2017 Stephen
              Forbes The Adelaide Review</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In Sri Lanka, there grows to this day, a
              tree, the oldest historical tree in the world.” – H.G. Wells</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Late
              last year our family made a pilgrimage to the ancient city of Anuradhapura in
              Sri Lanka. The World Heritage site illustrates millennia of Sri Lanka’s
              cultural history while remaining an important contemporary religious and
              regional centre. Our visit coincided with the Ill Full Moon Poya day public
              holiday drawing crowds to the Thuparamaya, Sri Lanka’s source for Buddhism, and
              to the ancient Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi – the oldest cultivated tree in the world
              with a documented written history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              veneration accorded this tree, especially by devotees of the Theravada Buddhist
              tradition, reflects the direct connection of this tree to the living Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was established from the southern branch of the peepal (or
              esathu) tree (Ficus religiosa) in whose shade the Buddha achieved
              enlightenment. This branch was brought to Sri Lanka from India in 236 BC by the
              Buddhist nun Sanghamitta Maha Theri, through the patronage of King Ashoka, a
              convert and powerful supporter of Buddhism – she is often referred to as his
              daughter, and accordingly, as a princess.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So,
              the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi is around 2250 years old and has been curated and
              protected by Buddhist monks and devotees throughout its life. Such devotion to
              a tree deserves some contemplation – certainly the tree is approached with
              piety for its connection with the Buddha but the tree is singular, and an
              individual in its own right and the achievement in protecting the tree
              demonstrates what good people can do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddha’s
              enlightenment dates from around the 5th century BC and took place near the
              river Neranjana at Bodh Gaya in the Bihar State in northern India. The peepal
              tree was already a place of devotion, and after the Buddha’s enlightenment was
              identified as the Bodhi tree and became a pilgrimage site during his lifetime.
              Sanghamitta’s arboricultural endeavours turned out to be timely as subsequent
              arboricidal events show.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">King
              Ashoka’s second wife, Tisayaraksita, jealous of her husband’s love for the
              Bodhi, had the tree pierced by poisonous mandu thorns, although the tree
              subsequently regenerated. To protect the Bodhi tree, Ashoka built a three-metre
              high stone wall (elephants particularly like them). But within half-a-century
              the tree was destroyed by King Pushyamitra Shunga during his persecution of
              Buddhism. The tree planted to replace the Bodhi, possibly at that stage a scion
              from the original, was destroyed at the beginning of the 7th century AD – this
              time by King Sassanka.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Accordingly
              there is considerable doubt as to whether the present tree at Bodh Gaya is even
              a scion of the original. This tree was planted by Alexander Cunningham, a British
              archaeologist in 1881 after the death of its predecessor. Such doubts over the
              provenance of the original Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya see the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi
              at Anuradhapura viewed as the closest authentic link to the living Buddha and,
              consequently, as the preferred for scion wood for establishing the Bodhi trees
              that are central to many Buddhist temples in Asia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              the Bodhi tree is important to Buddhists, the tree that the Buddha chose to sit
              under was already a sacred tree in Hindu doctrine. In the Bhagavad Gita the
              Lord Krishna declares that, ‘Of all the trees I am the peepal tree’ and the
              peepal is mentioned as one of the names of Lord Vishnu in the Vishnu
              Sahasramana. In India sadhus choose them for meditation and many Hindus still
              practice pradakshina including circumambulation, or meditative pacing around
              peepal trees with an accompanying chant of ‘vriksha rajaya namah’ (‘salutation
              to the king of trees’). So while the Buddha chose the peepal tree perhaps the
              peepal tree might also have chosen the Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sacred
              trees and sacred groves aren’t isolated to Hinduism and Buddhism in human
              history. The earliest written chronicles including the Epic of Gilgamesh and
              the Bible record both the destruction and the planting of sacred groves. Hiking
              in the Simien Mountains of Ethiopia the only stands of trees still remaining
              are such sacred groves, including the ‘church forests’ associated with
              Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo churches and monasteries. In earlier times such
              sacred groves were revered by Agao pagans whose religious gatherings,
              sacrifices and burials were associated with the groves. These groves were
              apparently also adopted by early Islamic converts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              the traditions associated with such groves are disappearing globally alongside
              the global destruction of forests and the globalisation of culture, the truth
              in these relationships remains relevant. In a post last November Reuters
              journalist Dean Yates outlined his experiences following the development of
              Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a war correspondent. While professional help
              has been critical Yates witnesses the solace provided by the ancient trees of
              the Tasmanian wilderness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Trees
              play a critical role in food, water and climate security, but they also play a
              critical role in our spiritual wellbeing. Our future depends on them.</span></p>
