              <h1>Building Zangdokpalri Monastery,  oasis of Buddhist scholars</h1>
              <p>Instructions to construct a new monastery and temple for the
                                      monastic community in this area were revealed to
               Kunzang Dechen
                                      Lingpa Rinpoche in a dream, along with an exact 
              vision of where the
                                      structure should be placed. After a short 
              search, Rinpoche located
                                      the land for the temple as described in his 
              dream, including its
                                      relationship to four major mountains, local 
              caves located in the
                                      four directions, and additional environmental 
              and geographical
                                      details <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zangdokpalri.org/map.html">http://www.zangdokpalri.org/map.html</a>.
               With his own
                                      limited resources, Rinpoche acquired the land 
              and started work on
                                      building Zangdokpalri Monastery as a future 
              oasis of Buddhist
                                      scholarship, sacred art and meditation.<br> <br> Kunsang Rinpoche was born in the Earth Snake 
              Year 1928, in Southern
                                      Tibet in Lhodrak (map). He is the13th 
              reincarnation of the Buddha
                                      Rinchen Tsug Tor Gyen. From childhood he was 
              only interested in
                                      spiritual things. At 16 he went into full time 
              spiritual retreat,
                                      and studied with Dudjom Rinpoche for 10 years.It
               was prophesized,
                                      and he became a terton or treasure revealer at 
              age 20. Rinpoche was
                                      recognized by H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche as the Lodhak
               Terton, the
                                      reincarnation of Terton Longsel Nyingpo, of the 
              Drubchen Melong
                                      Dorje lineage.<br> <br> Based on premonitions of the ensuing diaspora, 
              Kunzang Dechen
                                      Rinpoche left Tibet for the famous "hidden land"
               of Pemakod in
                                      1955, 4 years before the Chinese takeover of 
              Tibet. After 7 years
                                      in meditation retreat there he eventually 
              settled in Assam, the
                                      northeastern extremity of India. There he 
              received prophecies in
                                      his dreams from Guru Padmasambhava that two 
              gonpas or monasteries
                                      should be built in that area. Acting on his 
              vision, Rinpoche first
                                      built Tashi Choling nunnery in Assam. Over a 
              decade later, in the
                                      neighboring state of Arunachal Pradesh Rinpoche 
              discovered the
                                      exact location as depicted in his previous dream
               for the
                                      Zangdokpalri Temple. The local people have 
              donated this mountaintop
                                      and the temple is now under construction to 
              precise specifications,
                                      according to Rinpoche’s vision of Guru 
              Rinpoche’s palace in the
                                      Copper Colored Mountain pure land.<br> <br> Rinpoche is renowned for his "pure vision" 
              treasure revelations of
                                      Dorje Drollo, Throma Nagmo and many others he 
              directly received
                                      from Padmasambhava. His unique Healing Chö 
              practice has brought
                                      healing and relief from suffering to countless 
              beings around the
                                      world. In these times of rampant degeneration 
              Rinpoche's teachings
                                      illuminate and dispel the darkness of ignorance,
               delusion and
                                      suffering. Ven. Kunsang Dechen Lingpa 
              personifies wisdom,
                                      compassion, spiritual power, integrity and 
              delight in life.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zangdokpalri.org/art/teacherlineage.jpg">http://www.zangdokpalri.org/art/teacherlineage.jpg</a><br> <br> About a month before he passed Rinpoche spoke to
               the monks close to
                                      him that there would be specifically 5 
              incarnations. On occasions
                                      when traveling in the past he had indicated that
               his incarnations
                                      would be reborn even in different countries. 
              Rinpoche had often
                                      expressed his wish to pass in the presense of 
              his monks and nuns at
                                      the Zangdolpalri Temple site.<br> <br> All indications are that he passed at will, 
              having finished the
                                      drupchens at both the nunnery and the monastery 
              and having given
                                      the Longevity Buddha Initiation (Tse Wang) to 
              nearly 10,000 people.
                                      Afterwards he was not feeling well but refused 
              to go to the
                                      hospital. Dungse and Ani Tsering Paldron 
              determined that his
                                      condition seemed dire and took him anyway to the
               local military
                                      hospital; before leaving the temple project 
              grounds his last words
                                      to his senior administrator monk, Tsewang Dondup
               were “ you go on
                                      putting the mantras in the statues and I will 
              return.” Rinpoche’s
                                      vital signs ceased about an hour after arriving 
              at the hospital. He
                                      was then returned to his room at the gompa 
              (monastery) where
                                      Rinpoche remained in a state of deep 
              meditational awareness sitting
                                      upright unassisted for 2 and half days (Tib: 
              TUKDOM) When I asked
                                      the monks how they knew he had left tukdom they 
              explained that
                                      Dungse (his son) wrote him a letter requesting 
              him to leave tukdom
                                      as there were many students and sponsors waiting
               to pay respects to
                                      his body and that he knew it was not good to 
              stay in that state of
                                      deep meditation too long. Dungse placed the 
              letter before him and a
                                      storm rolled in during this particularly dry 
              period. A bolt of
                                      lightening struck the pray flag pole in the 
              center of the court
                                      yard and a down pour of rain began, and then a 
              rainbow appeared
                                      just above his room. . His body had than lost 
              its luster. Now the
                                      body is packed in dry salt and puja is to be 
              constantly performed
                                      for 49 days. The salt is changed every 5 or 6 
              days and distributed
                                      to the faithful. A special stupa is being 
              constructed which will
                                      contain the body in perpetuity. Rinpoche 
              instructed the monks in
                                      this process during the last few months.<br> <br> Rinpoche passed away while preparing for another
               tour to the west
                                      with a group of his most accomplished nuns and 
              monks. His goal of
                                      obtaining donations to finish the Zangdokpalri 
              temple that the
                                      Buddha Guru Rinpoche had specifically directed 
              him in a dream to
                                      construct in order to bring peace to these 
              troubled times drove him
                                      to leave his Himalayan meditation retreat and 
              travel. Now that goal
                                      is just a thought.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.zangdokpalri.org/rebirth2.pdf">http://www.zangdokpalri.org/rebirth2.pdf</a></p>
