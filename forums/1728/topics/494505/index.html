              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Demystifying the
              Abhidharma</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; ">Marie

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In the West, and even among some Asian</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> traditions, Abhidharma study is rare. One of the
              three main “baskets,” or collections of texts of the Buddhist Pali
              canon—alongside the Vinaya, or monastic code, and the Suttas, the teachings—it
              was originally compiled by councils of the Buddha’s followers in the centuries
              after his death. It lays out what is essentially his systems theory: the text
              describes the nature, origin, and interaction of all psychological and material
              phenomena, including human consciousness itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              clinical psychologist and Soto Zen teacher Beth Jacobs puts it in The Original
              Buddhist Psychology: What the Abhidharma Tells Us about How We Think, Feel, and
              Experience Life, the Abhidharma is “comparable to a periodic table of
              experience.” Yet while the Abhidharma is a subject for fruitful study, it seems
              anything but student-friendly: it comprises mainly lists and charts that have
              grown and shrunk over centuries as Buddhist scholars expanded upon, then
              distilled, the teachings. (For example, it contains charts of predictable Buddhist
              topics like “Causes of Suffering,” lists of aspects of cognition such as “The
              Four Perversions That Distort Perception,” and enumerations of categories of
              individuals such as “Four Kinds of People Comparable to a Jar.”) In sum, it is
              a vast map of the Buddhist view of the mind and how it relates to the world,
              and it is notoriously abstruse.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Perhaps
              because of the difficulty of studying it in its entirety, the status of the
              Abhidharma varies across Buddhist traditions. Some hold it and its commentaries
              as equal in importance to the suttas themselves; for others it plays a much
              more minor role. Such is the case even within the Theravada Abhidharma of
              Southeast Asia that Jacobs explores in her book. (This, the Pali version of the
              compendium, is one of three canonical Abhidharmas that have survived, though
              there is evidence that there were once many more.) Jacobs aims to mitigate the
              difficulty of studying the Abhidharma by weaving in her experiences as a
              therapist and longtime Buddhist student to provide more accessible entry points
              to the text. Below, she explains how the Abhidharma view of the mind can
              supplement and expand upon the Western psychological perspective, and what
              benefit to our practice the study of it can bring—no matter how difficult.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">–Marie
              Scarles, Associate Editor</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What drew you to the Abhidharma? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fairly
              early in my Buddhist training I was in dokusan [private interview] with my
              teacher, Sojun Diane Martin Roshi. She was just beginning to think about
              slowing down as a teacher, and she wanted to give certain areas of her study to
              different students. She asked me if I’d be interested in studying the
              Abhidharma, and I naively said, “Sure,” without having any idea what it was.
              [Laughs.] You know, it just sounded good!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              think she must have detected the potential affinity I’d have for it, though,
              because when I started reading I was immediately drawn to it. I found it
              fascinating, like a buried treasure. This is a whole unexplored genre of
              Buddhist study that most people think of as being very technical and esoteric,
              but I think it is far more useful than people realize. I’ve been a therapist
              for 35 years, and if there’s anything that will make you wonder about causation
              and karma and consciousness, it is listening to people and their deep stories. The
              Abhidharma really organized a number of questions I had that came from that
              listening and gave me a broader frame of reference for my observations. For
              instance, there is a concept in the Abhidharma called the bhavanga, or life
              continuum, a level of consciousness that is present in the background
              throughout an individual’s lifetime whenever no active cognitive process is
              taking place, as in deep, dreamless sleep. Learning this gave me a way to think
              about subtle qualities of continuity I had noticed in people’s psychological
              makeup, despite great changes in the course of psychotherapy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Outside of the academy and the
              monastery, the Abhidharma is not very well known to Western convert Buddhists. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yes,
              that’s true. It’s not very well known at all. And even among well-educated
              Buddhists, it’s got this very bad reputation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Why is that? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              begin with, it’s not easy to enter—it’s wildly complex and interwoven, so it’s
              really hard to summarize, and wherever you start, you need the next chapter to
              understand where you are. With every academic book I’ve read on Abhidharma, I
              pretty much needed to start over again when I was done. It’s that kind of
              study. It also has a reputation for being quite dry and technical: it consists
              of lists and matrices and explanations of those lists. It also doesn’t help
              that the academic and monastic people who have worked on it talk in very formal
              terms. Some of the translations call it the “higher or further” dharma, and
              it’s an area of traditional reverence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Abhidarma view is that consciousness is an action. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              my book, I’ve tried to do the heavy lifting to bring the Abhidharma to the
              popular reader without any watering or dumbing down, while also rearranging the
              way it’s usually presented so that readers have more of an entry point. Some
              will close the book and go to a more academic text; for others the book will be
              plenty of Abhidharma study in itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              I think it’s really important to bring the Abhidharma into the discussion and
              dialogue about early Buddhism. It adds a kind of ballast. We’re a top-heavy
              Buddhist culture, where the practices are stressed above all else. But the
              Abhidharma sets forth the original basis of why we’re doing these practices—to
              help the practitioner see phenomena and the mind as the Buddha saw them, and
              thereby reach nirvana.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You’ve described the Abhidharma as a map
              of mental states. Does the Western psychological tradition have anything like
              it? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              have been a series of efforts in the West to map the domain of consciousness.
              What is different about the Abhidharma is that it isn’t dissecting
              consciousness; it’s contextualizing consciousness, which is vital to why it
              works and why it’s so useful.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What do you mean by dissecting versus
              contextualizing consciousness? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dissection
              would be like the Freudian division of id, ego, superego. Freud kept changing
              his theories because he was trying to pin down a model of the mind as a closed
              system, rather than seeing the flux of the mind within a broader frame of
              interactions. That’s one example of a classic Western-mind dissection. Another
              is the current trend in neuropsychology, where it’s “this part of the brain
              does that and that part of the brain does this, and there’s the anxiety loop
              and this loop and that loop.” There’s usefulness in that—I don’t mean to be
              disparaging. But neuropsychology is a field that embraces dissection of the
              mind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Western view of the mind looks at consciousness as a domain of localized
              awareness. But the Abhidharma view is that consciousness is an action, a
              capacity for meeting whatever its object is. So the resulting inquiries are
              very different. The Abhidharma is asking, What are the causes and conditions of
              all the factors that bear on conscious activity? What’s interacting with what?
              Whereas Western psychology asks, What are the components of the thing?
              Consciousness can be dissected and broken up in all kinds of ways, and this can
              be useful, but it’s not as useful as locating consciousness in a bigger, moving
              universe. Because when you’re asking what’s moving with what, you can adjust
              variables: you don’t get fixated on a structure or a self, and the
              investigation is very process-oriented, not content-oriented. If you think of
              consciousness as a thing, then you start to identify with it or own it or
              become overinvested in making it be something, and that’s how we get off to the
              races with all of the problems that give rise to dukkha, suffering. What
              happens here is that we kind of back up to the Buddha’s primary instruction to
              abandon clinging. The Abhidharma helps you abandon construction and dissection.
              Instead, you feel the moment-by-moment complex evolution of the activity of
              consciousness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I was going to ask you if there is an
              area in the Abhidharma that you would like the Western psychological tradition
              to pay more attention to. It sounds as though this delineation of dissection
              versus contextualization might be part of that.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Definitely.
              Western psychology, by not having a broader context, aims toward control of the
              mind. That’s another thing I’ve learned from 35 years of watching people try to
              control their minds in therapy: it doesn’t work so well. [Laughs.] It’s a much
              more freeing stance to look at the mind and say, “OK, it’s moving with all of
              these variables. What can we do to make the movement better, not the mind
              itself?” In simple terms, if someone suffers from chronic guilt, instead of
              trying to stop it through analysis, the person learns to recognize the guilt
              formation arising in a moment, looks at the context that provoked it, and
              becomes aware of the clinging that makes the situation so difficult. That kind
              of orientation helps with letting go of things in a way that Western psychology
              doesn’t manage so well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s interesting that you say that
              Western psychology aims for control of the mind. I think many people are under
              the impression that’s what meditation is supposed to do. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              people do think of it that way, but this kind of study helps you break through
              that model. There’s no personal pronoun in the Abhidharma. There might be an
              illustration here or there, but there’s no story in it at all—you’re just
              looking at the complex process that lies under any content. So while it’s a
              very structured text, it breaks structures open, and in that way is
              paradoxically freeing. It helps you not to get snagged on anything in
              particular, and also not to take anything in particular for granted. Early on
              when I was studying it, I noticed that when I had been working on it and then
              walked away, I would have an unmistakably buoyant feeling. My Abhidharma
              hangover, I guess.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              was another funny moment during my study when I was looking at the 17 steps of
              a perceptual process. I was looking at it, and thinking, “You know, there are
              steps of perception charts in neuropsychology books.” So I dug one out and had
              both of them on the table. There was the Abhidharma chart—17 steps to full
              visual perception—next to “From Stimulus to Discrimination of a Visual
              Response” in the psychology book. I realized they were the same thing, and they
              corresponded in very specific ways. I was so blown away by that. I mean, I know
              it’s just translation from one system to another. But the system in the
              biopsychology book was the system I had always known, so when I realized that
              these Abhidharma people were presenting something that occurs in about a third
              of a second, broken down into 17 fairly accurate steps of brain movement, I was
              amazed. It cracked something open for me. They did this without any imaging
              equipment—it was just from the meditative process, which can actually slow down
              the perception of time, that they were able to perceive these steps in
              literally a blink of an eye.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Abhidharma says a lot about time, and they write about these vast realms of
              beings and time frames that are quite astronomical. You realize that just as we
              see a range of colors or hear a range of sounds, we experience time in a range
              of ways. That’s another example of how the Abhidharma opens things up. It opens
              up worlds. And then you walk out the door and things actually look a little
              fresher and livelier. You notice things differently when you realize the
              arbitrariness of our perceptual range. Our senses could work in so many
              different ways. When we observe animals, we can see how different perceptual
              systems can be—cats hear more acutely than we do and dogs smell so much more,
              for example.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do ethical concerns play a role in the
              Abhidharma? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              version I studied was the Theravada Abhidharma, which is naturally very
              influenced by the Theravada ethical structure. So there are whole sections in
              it about what is wholesome, what is unwholesome, what are beautiful mental
              factors and what are not beautiful mental factors, and so forth. And that comes
              with a strict gradation of ethics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              for me the bottom line is that the Abhidharma helps you be more consonant with reality,
              so that you’re moving with the variables of your own existence in a more
              harmonious way. Not looping back, not fixating and getting stuck on your
              associations, but moving with the immediate perceptions that are in front of
              you and around you. To me, that is the essential ethical basis of it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Western
              psychology and Buddhism ultimately say the same thing: don’t get stuck, don’t
              go backward, don’t retrigger. There are so many different terms for that. Even
              the SSRIs, the popular antidepressant medications, work on a chemical mechanism
              that prevents reuptake, and that’s a good present-day metaphor for this
              important point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Theravada monk and renowned
              translator Bhikkhu Bodhi says that the Abhidharma helps to interpret the
              phenomena that appear during meditation, while meditation translates the
              concepts in the Abhidharma into lived experience. Did you notice this in your
              own life while you were working on the book?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              relation to my own sitting practice, I have found the explanation of the word
              citta in the Abhidharma to be very helpful. Citta is the essential unit of a
              consciousness activity; it’s a microscopic, almost atomic-level way of thinking
              about consciousness. When I sit, instead of thinking, “What is nonthought?” or,
              “Drop thought,” or anything like that, I’ll think, “Watch the flow of citta.”
              It shifts the scale of what I’m doing and simplifies it, because citta is a
              very bare and plain terminology for watching the mind’s activities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              find the Abhidharma makes Buddhist philosophy so accessible, because when you
              adopt an Abhidharmic perspective, how can you get really hung up on a self? It
              has a way of making the whole concept not so relevant. Or when you look at
              causation, which is the same thing as the study of interdependent origination, you
              see so plainly that there’s no place where you just can start and say, “Well,
              this leads to this.” Wherever you start, there’s a lot that’s already in motion
              affecting a lot that’s already in motion. So Abhidharma study is a way to talk
              about basic Buddhist philosophy that actually brings it to life. It doesn’t
              reify it at all, but makes it felt.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Then
              again, it is a tough study. It is dense and complex and you have to hold a lot
              in your mind. It’s just that as you’re holding it in your mind, other areas open
              up that you might not have anticipated, and that is, I think, how all Buddhist
              study is. You’re working in one direction, and the next thing you know, another
              direction has opened up.</span></p>
