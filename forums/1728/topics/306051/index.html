              <p>Who am I? I don't know 'I'.. to say there is 'I', is a concept.. to say 'I' don't exist, also a concept.. is there a 'I' to be found? 'I' can't find 'I' in my body, in my head, or outside my body, or in between. Not a thing to be found... only assumed.</p>
              <p>What people usually call 'me'... is actually just thoughts arising... what 'we' are, are just moment to moment arising of thoughts... arising and gone. But not only that, there is the sound of keyboard typing, the words appearing on the screen. No separation at all... all separations are assumed.</p>

              <p><img src="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Images/goldhub.gif" alt="Vispassana, Sunyata" width="30" height="29"></p>
              <p>I am sitting, meditating. Awareness of thoughts and feelings 
                                  is sharp. A thought or a feeling is seen the moment it arises. 
                                  It subsides quickly. Awareness intensifies. Not a thought, 
                                  regardless of how subtle, escapes it. Yet there is no effort, 
                                  there is no going after objects of awareness. There is a feeling 
                                  of tremendous energy in my body that shoots up to the crown 
                                  of the head. Here I open my eyes. Awareness is intense, clear. 
                                  No ego is left. Sunyata prevails. There is only what is. Everything 
                                  in the room looks as if I am seeing it for the first time. 
                                  It shines with its own essence. Everything is just what it 
                                  is, and it is totally complete in its nakedness. The lamp 
                                  is totally packed with lampness. The music is just music, 
                                  absolutely, and it is beautiful. Everything is as significant 
                                  as everything else. A drop of water, with its own intrinsic 
                                  nature, expresses the truth of reality.</p>
              <p>A hanging drop<br> On the verge of extinction<br> Ready for the infinite<br> Without expecting<br> Small and itself<br> Totally existing<br> Reality<br> And reality’s expression.</p>
              <p>Virgin freshness<br> Vibrant purity<br> Here now being<br> At the door of eternity.<br> Clear as a crystal<br> In stillness<br> Cleansing<br> The light.<br> An insignificant drop<br> Of ordinary water<br> A mudra<br> Of reality</p>
              <p>It is itself<br> Yet it is the truth<br> It is finite<br> Yet the eye of infinity.</p>
              <p>Totally empty<br> Totally full<br> A fair piece<br> Of the ineffable.</p>
              <p>Everything shines with its own <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/s/suchness.htm">suchness</a>. 
                                  Just naked existence of what is.</p>
              <p>Every now and then “I” pops out, creates itself 
                                  as if out of nowhere and claims the experience. Ego materializes 
                                  as an identity, as a center. This interrupts the direct perception, 
                                  and sunyata is no longer pure. It becomes more like interrupted 
                                  intervals of sunyata, the interruption made by ego popping 
                                  its head out and saying, “Here I am.” So I start 
                                  writing.</p>
              <p>Everything I think or do is to create an “I” 
                                  that does not exist. Not that it is better if it did not exist, 
                                  but that is the reality: “I” does not exist. Reality 
                                  just is, nothing. If anything, then it is me which prajna 
                                  alone can cut away. What is left is a thought, or a thought 
                                  looking at a thought. A feeling. A car driving by.</p>
              <p>My friend Ron. I feel I want to tell Ron. It is important 
                                  for me. So back to me. From sunyata to me.</p>
              <p>So, no matter what I say, I will just come back to me, and 
                                  since me, as “me,” is only a creation of “me,” 
                                  .... who said that?</p>
              <p>So.</p>
              <p>This is funny. I want to say that I know what sunyata is, 
                                  but where? It’s all gone, the moment I have this thought.</p>
              <p>Sunyata has an infinite power to free, not to free somebody, 
                                  but to free freedom from somebody who wants or thinks of freedom.</p>
              <p>Ego = self = identity, is the opposite of sunyata.</p>
              <p>Sunyata has no limits. Its depth is unimaginable. I won’t 
                                  say I can’t imagine it, because there is nobody to imagine 
                                  anything anymore.</p>
              <p>It is amusing, this “I” that comes in and out 
                                  every now and then which seems to claim some sort of right 
                                  to be here. The thing, friend, is not that it is here or there; 
                                  it is that there is no you in the first place. So where does 
                                  this statement come from?!</p>
              <p>There is a tendency to glorify, but there is nobody to glorify. 
                                  There is only glory. Glory is golden with green haloes around 
                                  it.</p>
              <p>There are times when</p>
              <p>I am = zero</p>
              <p>That has the effect of an atom bomb. Who says so? Ego, of 
                                  course.</p>
              <p>Sunyata is there at the edge of ego, right at the zero edge 
                                  of identity.</p>
              <p>“The ‘I’ seems to have some sort of strength.”</p>
              <p>A thought! Another trick of ego.</p>
              <p>Sunyata is gone when ego tries to play a trick on itself 
                                  that it exists.</p>
              <p>The interesting thing is that I am not writing this for me; 
                                  for, frankly speaking, this me does not seem to be.</p>
              <p>Trying to capture sunyata, by writing about it, is always 
                                  at the edge of sunyata and self. It is very tricky. It is 
                                  very tricky—the moment there is an identity to an action 
                                  then there is no sunyata.</p>
              <p>We must not forget that ego, too, is sunyata, for sunyata 
                                  is.</p>
              <p>Sunyata is important, but not to me personally, for “I” 
                                  is more of an appearance than anything else. Right now, for 
                                  instance:</p>
              <p>“I” = “Belief that I know sunyata.”</p>
              <p>This “I” is mixed up with another bunch of “I”s, 
                                  all assuming that they exist. And so they create problems. 
                                  But, in fact, they are problems for nobody. And, in fact, 
                                  they are not problems. And, in fact, they are not. And, in 
                                  fact.</p>
              <p><br> In the Heart Sutra, Avaloketisvara tells Shariputra, “Form 
                                  is emptiness, emptiness is form.” In sunyata, form is 
                                  empty. It is totally empty of any conceptual significance. 
                                  No association follows the perception. It is just what it 
                                  is, nothing. For making it a thing is the function of concepts. 
                                  On the other hand, each form assumes its full substantiality, 
                                  becomes full to the brim with itself. So this emptiness is 
                                  not really empty, it is quite full, but full with its own 
                                  reality and not what I lay on it. So the bed is full, is packed 
                                  with bedness. The dark is one hundred percent full with darkness. 
                                  Each form, because it is empty of concepts, takes the full 
                                  measure of its nature. The quality of beingness in sunyata 
                                  is of being awake: bodhi. It is not that I am awake. It is 
                                  more like reality is awake. Everything awakens to its own 
                                  nature. It is a sense of openness, brightness, naturalness. 
                                  My eyes are wide open, shiny. My face shines with an inner 
                                  light, so does everything else. A feeling of total presence, 
                                  of concreteness. Everything shines and is luminous, yet stays 
                                  just itself. There are no additions to reality. It is just 
                                  manifesting its intrinsic nature, now that it is free from 
                                  the tyranny of my beliefs and concepts about it. Everything 
                                  lightens up when ego relaxes its grip. Everything wakes up 
                                  when ego is gone, gate, gate. So the Heart Sutra says: Gate 
                                  gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi, swaha. So be it.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine, are you sure you are just feelings of happy, sad, angry, good? How about this: before birth, who are you?</p>
              <p>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/some-writings-on-non-duality-by-ken.html</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br>There are many things that I can
                  doubt, but I cannot doubt my own consciousness in this moment. My
                  consciousness and even if I tried to doubt it, it would be my
                  consciousness doubting. I can imagine that my senses are being
                  presented with a fake reality – say, a completely virtual reality or
                  digital reality, which looks real but is merely a series of extremely
                  realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the consciousness that is
                  doing the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability of my present
                  awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, immediately delivers
                  to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a certainty of Being in
                  the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt consciousness and Being in
                  this moment, for it is the ground of all knowing, all seeing, all
                  existing…<br><br>Who am I? Ask that question over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is conscious of everything?<br><br>If
                  you think that you know Spirit, or if you think you don’t, Spirit is
                  actually that which is thinking both of those thoughts. So you can
                  doubt the objects of consciousness, but you can never believably doubt
                  the doubter, never really doubt the Witness of the entire display.
                  Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is thinking that it knows
                  God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable immediacy of
                  now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The certainty
                  lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects appear, not
                  in the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see God,
                  because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object that
                  can be seen…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but
                  impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never really
                  be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the
                  Runner. To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but
                  impossible to avoid: it is that which is looking at this page right
                  now. Can’t you feel That One? Why on earth do you keep looking for God
                  when God is actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I
                  am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am aware
                  of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in
                  the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body –
                  and I am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover,
                  I can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can
                  doubt that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt that the
                  Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there
                  to witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings
                  in the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am
                  that Witness – a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent
                  Openness that impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror
                  spontaneously reflects all its objects…<br><br>You can already feel
                  some of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of
                  witnessing this moment, you already feel that you are free from the
                  suffocating constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts
                  – they all come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open
                  Witness of them all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This
                  is actually the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the
                  formless Witness, causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the
                  entire world arises, stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are
                  not the body, not the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that
                  – you are a vast Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With
                  this discovery… you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any
                  and all finite objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are
                  free, open, empty, clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted,
                  drenched in a blissful emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to
                  time, prior to tears and terror, prior to pain and mortality and
                  suffering and death. You have found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss,
                  the unqualifiable Ground of all that is, and all that was, and all that
                  ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that only halfway home? </span>Because
                  as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware
                  of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great
                  catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear
                  entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead
                  of touching the earth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the
                  thunder, you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos because One
                  Taste – you can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt.
                  Everest in the palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and
                  the solar system replaces your head…<br><br>You are One Taste, the
                  empty mirror that is one with any and all objects that arise in its
                  embrace, a mindlessly vast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal,
                  radiant beyond release. And you… are… That…<br><br>So the primary
                  Cartesian dualism – which is simply the dualism between… in here and
                  out there, subject and object, the empty Witness and all things
                  witnessed – is finally undone and overcome in nondual One Taste. Once
                  you actually and fully contact the Witness, then – and only then – can
                  it be transcended into radical Nonduality, and halfway home becomes
                  fully home, here in the ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so
                  how do you know that you have finally and really overcome the Cartesian
                  dualism? Very simple: if you really overcome the Cartesian dualism,
                  then you no longer feel that you are on this side of your face looking
                  at the world out there. There is only the world, and you are all of
                  that; you actually feel that you are one with everything that is
                  arising moment to moment. You are not merely on this side of your face
                  looking out there. “In here” and “out there” have become One Taste with
                  a shuddering obviousness and certainty so profound it feels like a
                  five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling
                  hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which is actually your ever-present
                  condition, there is no exclusive identity with this particular
                  organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a constriction
                  that makes it seem that “you” are in the head looking at the rest of
                  the world out there; there is no binding of attention to the personal
                  bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is arising – a
                  vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and infinitely Full
                  expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every single subject
                  and every single object are erotically united in the Great Embrace of
                  One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your eyes, and you
                  become the All, you directly and actually feel that your basic identity
                  is everything that is arising moment to moment (just as previously you
                  felt that your identity was with this finite, partial, separate, mortal
                  coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside have become One
                  Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br><br>(Source:

              Isn't that a very easy to answer question?
              
              Q: Who are you?
              
              A: I am what I want to be.
              
              ...........................................
               
              This is a very dangerous answer.This kind of mind is, I, mine, me.Our society and the world is cause by this kind of mind.
