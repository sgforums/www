              <p>Moments ago before reviewing this sutta, my mind and heart was caught up with the smelly poultry hawker food as wells as the ongoing hazy conditions afflicting Singapore. The body is mostly a composite of soils and waters perhaps also air and heat that sooner or later becomes a corpse, yet amidst all that becoming, if we 'squeeze' more corpses, i.e. the corpses of other animal beings and imho even plants into our mouths in the excuse of 'nourishment', technically the consumption model is just using corpses to get beyond corpses, while anything but 'entirely wrong' since there are tibetan monks that noticeably eat dinners and meats, it's just plain silly in the longer term of oneself and sometimes everybody else.</p>
              <p><em>"Maha-salayatanika Sutta: The Great Six Sense-media Discourse" (MN 149), translated from the Pali by  Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, </em><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.149.than.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000080;"><em>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.149.than.html</em></span></span></a><em> .</em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="savatthi"><span style="color: #000000;">Savatthi</span></a> in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha"><span style="color: #000000;">Anathapindika</span></a>'s Monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>
              <p>"Monks, I will teach you the great six sense-media [discourse]. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said: "Not knowing, not seeing the eye as it actually is present; not knowing, not seeing forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye as they actually are present; not knowing, not seeing whatever arises conditioned through contact at the eye — experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — as it actually is present, one is infatuated with the eye... forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye... whatever arises conditioned by contact at the eye and is experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>
              <p>"For him — infatuated, attached, confused, not remaining focused on their drawbacks — the five clinging-aggregates head toward future accumulation. The craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now this &amp; now that — grows within him. His bodily disturbances &amp; mental disturbances grow. His bodily torments &amp; mental torments grow. His bodily distresses &amp; mental distresses grow. He is sensitive both to bodily stress &amp; mental stress.</p>
              <p>"Not knowing, not seeing the ear... Not knowing, not seeing the nose... Not knowing, not seeing the tongue... Not knowing, not seeing the body...</p>
              <p>"Not knowing, not seeing the intellect as it actually is present; not knowing, not seeing ideas... consciousness at the intellect... contact at the intellect as they actually are present; not knowing, not seeing whatever arises conditioned through intellect-contact — experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — as it actually is present, one is infatuated with the intellect... ideas... consciousness at the intellect... contact at the intellect... whatever arises conditioned by contact at the intellect and is experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>
              <p>"For him — infatuated, attached, confused, not remaining focused on their drawbacks — the five clinging-aggregates head toward future accumulation. The craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now this &amp; now that — grows within him. His bodily disturbances &amp; mental disturbances grow. His bodily torments &amp; mental torments grow. His bodily distresses &amp; mental distresses grow. He is sensitive both to bodily stress &amp; mental stress.</p>
              <p>"However, knowing &amp; seeing the eye as it actually is present, knowing &amp; seeing forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye as they actually are present, knowing &amp; seeing whatever arises conditioned through contact at the eye — experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — as it actually is present, one is not infatuated with the eye... forms... consciousness at the eye... contact at the eye... whatever arises conditioned by contact at the eye and is experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>
              <p>"For him — uninfatuated, unattached, unconfused, remaining focused on their drawbacks — the five clinging-aggregates head toward future diminution. The craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion &amp; delight, relishing now this &amp; now that — is abandoned by him. His bodily disturbances &amp; mental disturbances are abandoned. His bodily torments &amp; mental torments are abandoned. His bodily distresses &amp; mental distresses are abandoned. He is sensitive both to ease of body &amp; ease of awareness.</p>
              <p>"Any view belonging to one who has come to be like this is his right view. Any resolve, his right resolve. Any effort, his right effort. Any mindfulness, his right mindfulness. Any concentration, his right concentration: just as earlier his actions, speech, &amp; livelihood were already well-purified. Thus for him, having thus developed the noble eightfold path, the four frames of reference go to the culmination of their development. The four right exertions... the four bases of power... the five faculties... the five strengths... the seven factors for Awakening go to the culmination of their development.[1] [And] for him these two qualities occur in tandem: tranquillity &amp; insight.</p>
              <p>"He comprehends through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be comprehended through direct knowledge, abandons through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be abandoned through direct knowledge, develops through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be developed through direct knowledge, and realizes through direct knowledge whatever qualities are to be realized through direct knowledge.</p>
              <p>"And what qualities are to be comprehended through direct knowledge? 'The five clinging-aggregates,' should be the reply. Which five? Form as a clinging-aggregate... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness as a clinging-aggregate. These are the qualities that are to be comprehended through direct knowledge.</p>
              <p>"And what qualities are to be abandoned through direct knowledge? Ignorance &amp; craving for becoming: these are the qualities that are to be abandoned through direct knowledge.</p>
              <p>"And what qualities are to be developed through direct knowledge? Tranquillity &amp; insight: these are the qualities that are to be developed through direct knowledge.</p>
              <p>"And what qualities are to be realized through direct knowledge? Clear knowing &amp; release: these are the qualities that are to be realized through direct knowledge.</p>
              <p>"Knowing &amp; seeing the ear... Knowing &amp; seeing the nose... Knowing &amp; seeing the tongue... Knowing &amp; seeing the body...</p>
              <p>"Knowing &amp; seeing the intellect as it actually is present, knowing &amp; seeing ideas... consciousness at the intellect... contact at the intellect as they actually are present, knowing &amp; seeing whatever arises conditioned through intellect-contact — experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — as it actually is present, one is not infatuated with the intellect... ideas... consciousness at the intellect... contact at the intellect... whatever arises conditioned by contact at the intellect and is experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
