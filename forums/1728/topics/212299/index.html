Sarva Mangalam!,<br><br>DharmaSpace<br><br>THE PRACTICE TO BE DONE UPON AWAKIN FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.....<br><br>When you first wake in the morning, visualize in the sky in front of you your most gracious Root Lama surrounded by all the dakas and dakinis. All are playing bells and damarus and with great compassion are entreating you to arise and do your practice.<br>The sky is filled with rainbow lights in all directions; beautiful flowers are raining down; and all space is permeated with the sweet smell of incense. With this clearly in mind, listen to your Root Lama and the Dakas and Dakinis reminding you why you must practice and entreating you to get up now.:<br><br>(Weeping sound)<br>You fortunate noble one<br>Dont be lazy<br>Put forth effort and get up<br>From beginning less time until now<br>You have slept in ignorance<br>Dont sleep now but use your body, speech, and mind virtuously<br>Dont you know the sorrows of birth<br>Old age, illness and death?<br>You are impermanent!<br>Today is the time for you to put forth effort.<br>This is the only time to<br>Attain the perfect happiness;<br>This is not the time to be idle.<br>Think of death and complete your meditation.<br>Your life is impermanent<br>And filled with obstacles.<br>When your time (to die) comes and you feel recalcitrant<br>What is the benefit of leaving (your body)?<br>All dharmas are empty<br>And uncreated<br>Like a magic show, a mirage, and a dream;<br>Like the smell-eaters village and an echo from the rocks;<br>Like the moon reflected in water; bubbles in water; illusions; and bodily transformations.<br>All manifestations are like these examples;<br>All of samsara you should understand in this way.<br>The nature of all dharmas is unborn.<br>They do not reside; they do not cease; they do not come and go;<br>They are beyond speech, beyond thoughts, beyond all seeing; beyond all definition.<br>Now is the time for you to understand this.<br>All dharmas of samsara are impermanent.<br>Long have you reminded in the ocean of non-liberation.<br>For you who suffer from negative karma, I have great compassion.<br>May the oceans of samsara be dried!<br>Through ignorance you create your own suffering<br>Even though you all want happiness.<br>For you who are ignorant (of the way), I have compassion.<br>May all your defilements be purified!<br>You are bound in the prisons of your desires<br>like a wild animal who again (and again) gets caught.<br>For you who are suffering in this prison (of ignorance), I have compassion.<br>May the suffering of samsara be cleared.<br>The karma of the six realms of samsara<br>Is like the ripples in water going from one to another.<br>For you who are suffering in samsara, I feel compassion<br>May the door to birth in the six lower realms be closed!<br>You ignore the sorrows of birth, old age, illness and death<br>No matter how much you see.<br>You waste your life in idleness.<br>May you please realize impermanence and death.<br>All is impermanent; there is nothing to depend on yet<br>You still have attachment to samsara?!<br>In grasping after happiness you waste your life<br>Please turn away from samsara.<br>The world is impermanent and will be destroyed by fire and water;<br>Sentient beings are impermanent and will be separated mind and body;<br>Summer, winter, spring and fall are all impermanent.<br>May you be blessed to realize the suffering of impermanence.<br>Last year, this year, the beginning and ending if months are all impermanent.<br>Night, day and this very moment is impermanent.<br>Understand that your death is imminent.<br>May all your efforts to meditate be blessed!<br>It is very difficult to attain this life of leisure and endowments.<br>For you who are caught by death, empty-handed<br>Without having practiced the dharma, I feel great compassion.<br>You must realize<br>There is nothing to enjoy because all is impermanent and death is inevitable.<br>You, the triple gem of great compassion;<br>The victorious one of love and compassion<br>Bless all sentient beings in the six realms of samsara<br>To be liberated in this very moment.<br>- (Kagyu waking text/prayer to be recited upon waking.)
