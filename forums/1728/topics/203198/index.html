A #1 New York Times bestseller, it has been translated into over 30 languages. The book has helped countless people around the globe awaken to the spiritual dimension in their lives, find inner peace, increased joy and more harmonious relationships<br><br>To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. From the beginning of the first chapter we move rapidly into a significantly higher altitude where one breathes a lighter air, the air of the spiritual. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to guide us. The words themselves are the signposts.<br><br>For many of us there are new discoveries to be made along the way: we are not our mind; we can find our way out of psychological pain; authentic human power is found by surrendering to the Now. We also find out that the body is actually one of the keys to entry into a state of inner peace, as are the silence and space all around us. Indeed, access is everywhere available. These access points, or portals, can all be used to bring us into the Now, the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy and are able to embrace our true selves. It is here we discover that we are already complete and perfect.<br><br>Many of us will find that our biggest obstacle to this realization is our relationships, especially our intimate relationships. But again, we are in new territory and all is not what it had seemed before. We come to see that our relationships are yet another doorway into spiritual enlightenment if we use them wisely, meaning if we use them to become more conscious and therefore more loving human beings. The result? Real communion between self and others.<br><br>If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now; if we are able to feel the reality of such things as the inner-body, surrender, forgiveness, and the Unmanifested, we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.<br><br><strong>A New Earth - Awakening to your lifeÂ’s purpose</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.eckharttolle.com/propaganda/images-htmlarea/ECK-NW8BOOK.jpg"><br><br>Building on the astonishing success of The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle presents readers with an honest look at the current state of humanity: He implores us to see and accept that this state, which is based on an erroneous identification with the egoic mind, is one of dangerous insanity.<br><br>Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one.<br><br>In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly areÂ—which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently think we areÂ—and learn to live and breathe freely.<br><br>Â“The One ThingÂ” by Eckhart Tolle<br><br>In the Gospel story of Mary and Martha, Jesus says to Martha, Â“You are anxious and troubled about many things, but only one thing is needful.Â” (Luke 10:41)<br><br>As I was writing A New Earth, people would sometimes ask me, Â“What is the new book about?Â”  And invariably, my answer would be, Â“I only ever write or speak about one thing.Â”<br><br>What is that one thing?<br><br>Spiritual awakening.<br><br>Can a person be awakened spiritually by a book?<br><br>Yes, if three conditions are met:<br><br>Firstly, there must be a readiness on the part of the reader, an openness, a receptivity to spiritual truth, which is to say, a readiness to awaken.  For the first time in history of humanity, large numbers of people have reached that point of readiness, which explains why millions have responded so deeply to The Power of Now.<br><br>Secondly, the text must have transformative power.  This means the words must have come out of the awakened consciousness rather than the accumulated knowledge of a personÂ’s mind.  Only then will a text be charged with that power, a power that goes far beyond the informational value of the words.  That is why such a book can be read again and again and lose none of its aliveness.<br><br>Thirdly, the terminology used needs to be as neutral as possible so that it transcends the confines of any one culture, religion, or spiritual tradition.  Only then will it be accessible to a broad range of readers world-wide, regardless of cultural background.<br><br>All these conditions were met in The Power of Now, which is why the book has had such an impact on the collective consciousness.<br><br>Why write another book?<br><br>Since the publication of The Power of Now, I have given hundreds of talks and teaching sessions all over the world, and in the course of those seven years, the teaching evolved.  While the essence remained the same (The Truth is timeless.), new perspectives arose, new signposts, alternative approaches to the Truth, as well as an added sense of urgency.  A New Earth reflects this evolution and this urgency.<br><br>If The Power of Now worked for you and changed your life Â– as it did for countless people all over the world Â– there is no need for you to read A New Earth (although you may enjoy reading it and may find some of it helpful in recognizing the ego and thus sustaining the state of Presence).<br><br>My feeling is that A New Earth will make the teaching (the one thing) accessible to an even wider audience, including people who perhaps would not have dreamt of reading a Â“spiritualÂ” book but have within them a hitherto unrecognized longing for spiritual awakening.<br><br>A New Earth will also be extremely helpful for those who read The Power of Now, found it interesting, but somehow missed the essence of it.  It presents them with new perspectives on the same truth, new signposts, pointers towards Presence.  Different pointers work for different people.<br><br>Millions are now ready to awaken because spiritual awakening is not an option anymore, but a necessity if humanity and the planet are to survive.  Everything is speeding up Â– the madness, the collective egoic dysfunction, as well as the arising of the new consciousness, the awakening.<br><br>We are running out of time.  From the perspective of the ego, thatÂ’s bad news and will give rise to fear.  From a higher perspective, the running out of time is exactly what is needed for the new consciousness to come into this world.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A little about Eckhart Tolle, the author of The Power of Now:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>I have already personally sent many people emails to get this... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Introduction of the Book:<br><br>[b]<span class="large">The Power of Now</span><br><br>Eckhart Tolle<br><br>I have little use for the past and rarely think about it; however, I would briefly like to tell you how I came to be a spiritual teacher and how Â‘The Power of NowÂ’ came into existence.<br><br>Until my thirtieth year, I lived in a state of almost continuous anxiety interspersed with periods of suicidal depression. It feels now as if I am talking about some past lifetime or somebody else's life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Awakening</span><br>One night not long after my twenty-ninth birthday, I woke up in the early hours with a feeling of absolute dread. I had woken up with such a feeling many times before, but this time it was more intense than it had ever been. The silence of the night, the vague outlines of the furniture in the dark room, the distant noise of a passing train Â– everything felt so alien, so hostile, and so utterly meaningless that it created in me a deep loathing of the world. The most loathsome thing of all, however, was my own existence. What was the point in continuing to live with this burden of misery? Why carry on with this continuous struggle? I could feel that a deep longing for annihilation, for nonexistence, was now becoming much stronger than the instinctive desire to continue to live.<br><br>Â‘I cannot live with myself any longer.Â’ This was the thought that kept repeating itself in my mind. Then suddenly I became aware of what a peculiar thought it was.. Â‘Am I one or two? If I cannot live with myself, there must be two of me: the Â‘IÂ’ and the Â‘selfÂ’ that Â‘IÂ’ cannot live with.Â’ Â‘Maybe,Â’ I thought, Â‘only one of them is real.Â’<br><br>I was so stunned by this strange realization that my mind stopped. I was fully conscious, but there were no more thoughts. Then I felt drawn into what seemed like a vortex of energy. It was a slow movement at first and then accelerated. I was gripped by an intense fear, and my body started to shake. I heard the words Â‘resist nothing,Â’ as if spoken inside my chest. I could feel myself being sucked into a void. It felt as if the void was inside myself rather than outside. Suddenly, there was no more fear, and I let myself fall into that void. I have no recollection of what happened after that.<br><br>I was awakened by the chirping of a bird outside the window. I had never heard such a sound before. My eyes were still closed, and I saw the image of a precious diamond. Yes, if a diamond could make a sound, this is what it would be like. I opened my eyes. The first light of dawn was filtering through the curtains. Without any thought, I felt, I knew, that there is infinitely more to light than we realize. That soft luminosity filtering through the curtains was love itself. Tears came into my eyes. I got up and walked around the room. I recognized the room, and yet I knew that I had never truly seen it before. Everything was fresh and pristine, as if it had just come into existence. I picked up things, a pencil, an empty bottle, marvelling at the beauty and aliveness of it all. That day I walked around the city in utter amazement at the miracle of life on earth, as if I had just been born into this world.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Bliss</span><br>For the next five months, I lived in a state of uninterrupted deep peace and bliss. After that, it diminished somewhat in intensity, or perhaps it just seemed to because it became my natural state. I could still function in the world, although I realized that nothing I ever did could possibly add anything to what I already had.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Understanding</span><br>I knew, of course, that something profoundly significant had happened to me, but I didn't understand it at all. It wasn't until several years later, after I had read spiritual texts and spent time with spiritual teachers, that I realized that what everybody was looking for had already happened to me. I understood that the intense pressure of suffering that night must have forced my consciousness to withdraw from its identification with the unhappy and deeply fearful self, which is ultimately a fiction of the mind. This withdrawal must have been so complete that this false, suffering self immediately collapsed, just as if a plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What was left then was my true nature as the ever-present I am: consciousness in its pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also learned to go into that inner timeless and deathless realm that I had originally perceived as a void and remain fully conscious. I dwelt in states of such indescribable bliss and sacredness that even the original experience I just described pales in comparison. A time came when, for a while, I was left with nothing on the physical plane. I had no relationships, no job, no home, no socially defined identity. I spent almost two years sitting on park benches in a state of the most intense joy.<br><br>But even the most beautiful experiences come and go. More fundamental, perhaps, than any experience is the undercurrent of peace that has never left me since then. Sometimes it is very strong, almost palpable, and others can feel it too. At other times, it is somewhere in the background, like a distant melody.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Sharing</span><br>Later, people would occasionally come up to me and say: Â‘I want what you have. Can you give it to me, or show me how to get it?Â’ And I would say: Â‘You have it already. You just canÂ’t feel it because your mind is making too much noise.Â’ That answer later grew into my book, Â‘The Power of NowÂ’.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">From The Power of Now, copyright 1999 by Eckhart Tolle, published in the UK in 2001 by Hodder and Stoughton.</span></strong><br><br>Photographs Â© Cygnus Books 21-Feb-2001[/b]</blockquote></div>
