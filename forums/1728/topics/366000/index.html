                  consciousness and experience oneness with the universe.” The master
                  glanced at the note and threw it away. <br><br>The following month,

                  all things.” The master seemed disappointed.<br><br>In his third letter
                  the disciple enthusiastically explained, “The mystery of the One and
                  the many has been revealed to my wondering gaze.” The master yawned. <br><br>The
                  next letter said, “No one is born, no one lives, no one dies, for the
                  self is not.” The master threw up his hands in despair.<br><br>A year
                  passed, and the master reminded his disciple of his duty to keep him
                  informed of his spiritual progress. The disciple wrote back, “I am
                  simply living my life.” <br><br>The master read this and cried, “Ah, he's got it at last.”</em></span></p>

              <p><em><br>Ordinariness has always been Taoism’s forte. In Zen we also see
                  the importance of this being depicted in those enlightenment models
                  like <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/tozan-ryokais-verses-on-five-ranks.html">Tozan’s 5 ranks</a> and the The Ten Oxherding Pictures. But ordinariness must only be
                  understood that non-dual and the Maha world of suchness is nothing
                  beyond. There is no beyond realm to arrive at and never a separated
                  state from our ordinary daily world; rather it is to bring this
                  primordial, original and untainted experience of non-dual and Maha
                  experience into the most mundane activities. If this experience is not
                  found in most mundane and ordinary activities then practitioners have
                  not matured their understandings and practices.</em></p>
