              <p>Hi yea we left because of funny rules in the church (like no BGRs, no short skirts etc) and also because of the bible. Can't agree with the bible. Oh most of us are agnostics or irreligious now. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">@ Steaks -There is a distinction between Taoism and Buddhism.<span>    </span>Buddhism was established earlier in India whilst Taoism originated from China.<span>  </span>Even in Buddhism, there are many sects with different beliefs, traditions and practices (i.e. Zen Buddhism, Shinto, Theravada, Mahayana, and Tibetan Buddhism).<span>  </span>Although Buddhism<span>  </span>have split into schools and sects, but the different sects of Buddhism have never gone to war with each other and have developed tolerance and understanding that they can practice and worship together.<span>  </span>So, you need to find the one that fits your lifestyle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Regarding Buddhism, all of the many teachings of the Buddha centre on the Four Noble Truths.<span>    </span>They are called “Noble” because they ennoble one who understands them.<span>  </span>And they are called “Truths”, because, corresponding with reality, they are true.<span>  </span>There are plenty of materials that you can find on the internet about the Four Noble Truths.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">As the Buddha says:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">‘No one saves us but ourselves,</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">No one can and no one may.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We ourselves must walk the path,</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;">But Buddhas clearly show the way.’</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span>                                                                </span></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Once there was a man called Upali who was impressed by the Buddha’s teachings and decided to become one of his disciples.<span>  </span>But the Buddha said to him:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em>‘Make a proper investigation first Upali.<span>  </span>Proper investigation is good for a well-known person like you</em>rself.’</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><em><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">@ Steaks – In Buddhism, understanding is very important and understanding takes time.<span>  </span>It is the end product of a process, so do not impulsively rush into Buddhism.<span>  </span>Take your time, ask questions, consider carefully and then make your decision.<span>  </span>The Buddha was not interested in having large number of disciples.<span>  </span>He was concerned that people should follow the teachings as a result of a careful investigation and consideration of facts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If after careful consideration, you find that the Buddha’s teachings are acceptable, it would be good to join a good Buddhist group and continue to learn more about the Buddha’s teachings.<span>  </span>Then, when you are ready, you would formally become a Buddhist by taking the Three Refuges.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There are four aspects to going for refuge:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; "><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By knowing the good qualities</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; "><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By knowing the distinctions</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; "><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Through commitment</span></p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent: -18pt; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt; "><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4.</span><span style='font: 7pt "Times New Roman";'>       </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By refusing to acknowledge other refuges</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge requires recalling the good qualities of the refuge (i.e. the good qualities of the Buddha’s body, speech, mind and enlightened activities).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge by knowing the distinctions among the three jewels (i.e. The Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha community, each with its defining characteristics) leading to the path of enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge through commitment means upholding the Buddha as the teacher of refuge, the teachings – nirvana – as the actual refuge, and the community as those who assist us to attain refuge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge by refusing to acknowledge other<span>  </span>refuges means first of all understanding the differences in worth between Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachers, teachings, and disciples, for then you will uphold only the three jewels as your refuge, and refuse teachers, teachings and disciples that do not accord with them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My advice to beginners is to first, study and then analyse the Buddha’s teachings. Always adopt the middle way rather than rush to practice without actual knowledge and full understanding.<span>  </span><span> </span>To begin, we need to hear the Dharma, listen and reflect.<span>  </span>Then, develop your meditation abilities to help you explore the truth for yourself and not take on any teachings unexamined.<span>  </span>Wisdom is achieved once you are able to merge what you have learned with your life’s experiences.<span>  </span>And may you then, develop clear faith in the Buddha’s teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">@ Steaks, regarding altars – There are numerous types of altars based on different cultures, religions and personal taste.<span>  </span>It is good if you sincerely wish to have an altar set-up to make offerings as well as a reminder for practice, or another mean of accumulation (for the more advanced practitioner).<span>   </span>You should join a good Buddhist group where you can seek more advice on how to set-up a proper altar and what it means to have one rather than just collect any statues “off-the-shelf”.<span>  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In Buddhism, the altar is where you place your holy objects, pictures and texts which inspire your mind and inform your practice.<span>  </span>A proper Buddhist altar holds symbols of enlightened body, speech and mind, traditionally represented by displaying a statue or a photo of Buddha Shakyamuni, a scripture and a stupa.<span>  </span>At the very least, the altar should hold an image of Buddha Shakyamuni, the founder and source of the teachings in our time.<span>  </span>The objects on the altar also represent the Three Jewels of Refuge. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>If there is only a statue of Buddha Shakyamuni, think that it represents all Three Jewels.<span>  </span>If there is also a scripture and a stupa, think that the stupa represents the Buddha, the scripture represents the Dharma, and the image of the Buddha represents the Sangha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is important to keep in mind that the objects on the altar serve as a means for directing one’s mind to the Buddha’s enlightened qualities, which one aspires to emulate for others’ benefit.<span>  </span><span> </span>The reason for setting up an altar is not for fame, for showing-off, or to increase pride, but rather it is to reduce one’s mental afflictions and to seek the ability to help all sentient beings.<span>  </span></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><em>‘Make a proper investigation first Upali.<span> </span> Proper investigation is good for a well-known person like you</em>rself.’</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">@ Steaks – In Buddhism, understanding is very important and understanding takes time.<span> </span> It is the end product of a process, so do not impulsively rush into Buddhism.<span> </span> Take your time, ask questions, consider carefully and then make your decision.<span> </span> The Buddha was not interested in having large number of disciples.<span> </span> He was concerned that people should follow the teachings as a result of a careful investigation and consideration of facts.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">If after careful consideration, you find that the Buddha’s teachings are acceptable, it would be good to join a good Buddhist group and continue to learn more about the Buddha’s teachings.<span> </span> Then, when you are ready, you would formally become a Buddhist by taking the Three Refuges.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There are four aspects to going for refuge:</span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">1.</span><span>      </span></span></span> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">By knowing the good qualities</span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">2.</span><span>      </span></span></span> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">By knowing the distinctions</span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">3.</span><span>      </span></span></span> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">Through commitment</span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">4.</span><span>      </span></span></span> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">By refusing to acknowledge other refuges</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge requires recalling the good qualities of the refuge (i.e. the good qualities of the Buddha’s body, speech, mind and enlightened activities).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge by knowing the distinctions among the three jewels (i.e. The Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha community, each with its defining characteristics) leading to the path of enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge through commitment means upholding the Buddha as the teacher of refuge, the teachings – nirvana – as the actual refuge, and the community as those who assist us to attain refuge.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Going for refuge by refusing to acknowledge other<span> </span> refuges means first of all understanding the differences in worth between Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachers, teachings, and disciples, for then you will uphold only the three jewels as your refuge, and refuse teachers, teachings and disciples that do not accord with them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">My advice to beginners is to first, study and then analyse the Buddha’s teachings. Always adopt the middle way rather than rush to practice without actual knowledge and full understanding.<span> </span> <span> </span>To begin, we need to hear the Dharma, listen and reflect.<span> </span> Then, develop your meditation abilities to help you explore the truth for yourself and not take on any teachings unexamined.<span> </span> Wisdom is achieved once you are able to merge what you have learned with your life’s experiences.<span> </span> And may you then, develop clear faith in the Buddha’s teachings.</span></p>

              <p>Awesome! - all sects work on the same 4 noble truth, in which, there is 4 noble truth of human realm, there is 4 noble truth of heavenly realm,  there is 4 noble truth of stream enterer realm, arahat realm, bodhisavatta realm and buddha realm. It's emptiness and varied according to individual grade of conditioned mind subjected to its own blessing and wisdom, and importantly the conditioning factor from their teacher as well.<br>It is in the best of one interest to study in the Buddhist institution / monastery that offered structured courses, enjoying both blessing and wisdom - human life is short but blessing and wisdom are eternally blissful. One needs not have to convert but can learn from Buddhism that actually open its door to understand all tenets in other religions and its sects.</p>

              <p>though, in chinese Buddhism, it's ok for an ex-worshiper to bring/è¯· their "gods" to the Buddhist Monastery, but seat a step below the Buddha, so that they too can be liberated by the Buddha's teaching.  not because when one is converted they have to destroy the gods statues.</p>

              <p><br>My advice is have you read and understand the meaning of taking the 3 refuge?</p>
              <p>Sometimes ceremony will include taking the 5 precept also, so are you ready to take the 5 precept also? if not please check before taking the ceremony does it include the 5 precept or just the 3 refuge.</p>
              <p>For me and my linege, next seek out the particular master that you have "yuan" as taking refuge automatically develop the Guru disciple relationship..</p>
              <p>Then request from the master to take refuge under him, some big organisation you need to register with them and the next refuge taking ceremony you need to attend.</p>

              Oh,yes...I asked my friend that what she dreamt of after that visit to the temple and she told me that she has recurring dreams of a lady dressed in a white robe with 2children and she looked quite angry at what my friend has done.She will tell me later what the medium had said during her session with her.
                  
              My friend said that the medium told her the lady she saw was Guan Yin and as a penance for her sin,she had to be her disciple and be a vegetarian from now on.

              </pre>
              <p>My friend said that the medium told her the lady she saw was Guan Yin and as a penance for her sin,she had to be her disciple and be a vegetarian from now on.</p>

              <p><br>Hi being Kayboh here, below is the commitment in taking refuge</p>
              <p>What Is To Be Avoided<br>1. Having taken refuge in the Buddha, one should not take refuge<br>from the depths of one’s heart in worldly gods, such as Brahma and<br>so on, and one should not prostrate to such objects. One should<br>not entrust oneself from the depths of one’s heart to non-virtuous<br>friends or teachers of non-Buddhist teachings that have no supporting<br>levels.<br>2. Having taken refuge in the Dharma, one should avoid harming any<br>being, either directly by oneself, or indirectly by making others do it.<br>3. Having taken refuge in the Sangha, one should avoid entrusting<br>oneself to and keeping company with negative friends and followers<br>of hedonism.</p>
              <p>What Is To Be Practiced<br>1. Having taken refuge in the Buddha, with a mind of respect toward<br>those gone to bliss (the buddhas), one should regard even statues as<br>being actual buddhas and should prostrate and pay respect to them.<br>One should avoid showing disrespect to them by, for example,<br>placing them on the bare ground, judging them according to their<br>material value, or discriminating between them, saying that some<br>are good and others bad.<br>2. Having taken refuge in the Dharma, one should pay homage and<br>respect by generating the recognition of all scriptural texts, or even<br>just one syllable of the teachings, as being the actual rare sublime<br>Dharma.</p>
              <p>One should avoid placing texts on the bare ground, regarding them<br>as material objects, using them as security for a loan, or carrying<br>them together with one’s shoes.<br>3. Having taken refuge in the Sangha, one should regard even one<br>member of the Sangha as being the actual Sangha.<br>One should avoid discriminating within the Sangha community<br>but should have equal respect for all.<br>One should train well in all the advice concerning what is to be<br>practiced, such as not even stepping over pieces of monastic robe or<br>throwing them in dirty places, but instead placing them in clean<br>places.</p>

              You are not kaypoh,you gave me advise cos of good intentions.To top it off,my friend was willing to go vegetarian and be a adopted disciple of Guan Yin.She even advised me to do so too.
                                      
              When we go back to school next year,my friend will be a changed person.Do you guys think it is a blessing or something bad for my friend?
                          
              While waiting for your replies,will do some mediating/chanting with her as she had came for a visit.Really enjoy chatting here!Will share more about her recurring dreams about Guan Yin later.But I am just curious...who are the 2 small ones on her left and right?My friend could not tell too...

              Well,I and my friend are going to our neighbourhood temple to learn the dharma from the teachers there on Thursdays.
                                      
              During her dream,my friend found herself in a bright place...She heard someone calling her name(Her name is Yanning) and she saw a lady(Guan Yin)in those white Chinese robes staring at her and there were 2 children on her left and right.The lady was staring at her angrily and asked her why she showed disrespect at the temple and does she know that she was guilty of her sin.My friend thought that she looked similar to Guan Yin and bowed down in respect and kept denying that she had not sinned.Guan Yin then told her that she had to be punished for not having a pure heart and not dressing in a respectful way.She told Yanning that she had to be on a permanant vegetarian diet and meditation and she also wanted to adopt Yanning as her disciple.Having said that,she shaved a lock of her hair off and disappeared.That is the dream that Yanning had for the past 4 months.
                                      
              What do all of you think of this dream?

                      Erm,I remember we went to a temple that has statues of Taoist and Buddhist deities.So could it be the gods were punishing Yanning for her sin?Last Friday morning,she dreamt of a different deity again.This deity also told Yanning that she must be punished severely because she had disrespected the deities in the temple.
                                      
                      Sorry for the triple post cos trying to piece the details of the incident together.
                          
                      I am sorry if my story seems too far fetched but Yanning told me the story herself but the 2 of us really need help on what to do.

              </p><p>Hi, Steaks</p>
              <p>Your friend's problem with those deities could be spiritual or just her 
              guilty conscience of her attire that cause it.     </p>
              <p>Mediums?    There are many mediums around.    Went to consult many of them 
              myself and found out that they are all not effective.   One even told me off I 
              did not give donation.    I did but he did not see it.     Money minded!</p>
              <p>Also recently I learn that not all temples are clean as in there are both 
              yang temples and ying temples for taoism.     If one's luck is down and happen 
              to be in a yin temple he or she may invite problems.      In yin temples there 
              are unclean spirits around.</p>
              <p>Best is now that you and her are attending dharma class, consult your dharma 
              teacher or go to the buddhist temple for help instead of consulting mediums.     
              I believe buddhism can provide help to solve her problems.  Put all your hearts 
              practising buddhism, do away with taoism.   If not , it is going to cause 
              confusion.</p>

              Yin temples?I never heard of it before...Can you tell me more about it?We will go back to ask the nuns about Yanning's problem.I spoke to her just now and she said she was ready and willing to be Guan Yin's adopted disciple and turning vegetarian permanantly.Hopefully,the dreams will go off by themselves.
                          
              I have similar dreams lately too...Don't tell me the same thing is happening to me too?
              
              By the way,I have got my friend's name wrong.Her name is Yanning,not Yunfang.Yunfang is her sister.
