              <p>What’s done has been done.The only thing is to get used to a
                  vegetarian diet from now on.Me and Yanning can only learn from this
                  experience.We plan to take our 3 refuges next year.Right now,the
                  vegetarian diet and lots of mediation is important to us in our
                  daily lives and to repent or chan hui from our sins.</p>
              <p>We are still getting visits from those Taoist deities in our
                  dreams and we were still warned of pain of punishment if we refuse
                  to give ourselves to them cos they said that our uniforms had been
                  chopped with their seals with the red ink at the temple that day so
                  we technically belong to them.</p>
              <p>Was wondering…should I and Yanning throw away those uniforms or
                  burn them up so that they would not pester us anymore?</p>

              <p>In the six realms of samsara, there are 3 lower realms, 3 higher realms. The 3 lower realms are hell, ghost, animal. The 3 higher realms are human, asuras, heaven.</p>
              <p>Where are we? Human realm, of course.</p>
              <p>Where are those deities from? Not heaven... those deities you see in temples, communicate through mediums, those are spirit-deities.</p>
              <p>Spirit-deities are ghosts from the lower realm. However because they have relatively better karma than the other ghosts, they sort of 'control' the ghosts and also receive worship from superstitious people. Notice that they have 'mafia-like' characteristics - they also have desires, craving, and they try to 'control their followers' such as by appearing in your dreams and warning you. But if you set your mind straight and have the intention to turn to Buddhism and take refuge, and make up your mind about your religion, probably they will stop bothering you.</p>
              <p>As my Master said - those spirit-deities belong to the lower realm, they do not have happiness themselves, how can they bring happiness to others? Even we are in a higher realm than them.</p>
              <p>Of course I am not saying they are all bad... many spirit-deities also want to do good deeds, they also advice people to do good deeds. Those spirit-deities also want to accumulate good karma so that they can be reborn in higher realms or have better karma. They try to help people in mundane ways through their supernatural powers (all ghosts have some limited supernatural powers).</p>
              <p>However, we should not be superstitious about spirit-deities.  As my dharma teacher told a friend of mine many years ago,</p>

                  +0800<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Hi C,<br>&gt;<br>&gt;I'm Li Zhu lao shi's daughter, 
                  &amp; replying on behalf of her.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;1) Those "chosen" people were 
                  possessed by some other spirits who claimed that they were the Tua ya bei, Ji 
                  gong and so on, all these spirits were those human beings who were very 
                  superstitious when they were alive and like going to all these superstitious 
                  places to learn these kind of teachings &amp; practice them. All these teachings 
                  would lead human to the habit of greed, darkness, ignorance, dependent &amp; 
                  insecurity. These spirits would always get angry &amp; develop hatred easily 
                  when their wishes were not fulfilled. They would punish those "chosen" people, 
                  making them sick or worsen their living. Therefore, a wisdom human wouldnot 
                  believe &amp; accept these stupid &amp; superstitious beliefs. They would rather 
                  choose the Bliss &amp; Wisdom teaching which would lead them to brightness &amp; 
                  rightful thinking.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;2) Some temples tie white strings 
                  around many golden buddhas statue is because it's a form of superstitious 
                  tradition which they think the white strips would bring them brightness &amp; 
                  luck to them. So from here, we know that all humans like to choose the brighter 
                  path &amp; not the darker one. Only through Buddha teaching, would you achieve 
                  it.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Lastly, if you wish to become a monk in 
                  future, you must start to learn the Buddha teaching now, through reading 
                  Buddhist books &amp; listening to the CDs or coming to our centre to join our 
                  activities.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;May Buddha Be With You,<br>&gt;Li Zhu lao shi</p>

              My friend Yanning and I started our vegetarian diet this week...We have been eating fruits and I cooked my meals at home instead of dining outside.Cooked food like mapo tofu with mushrooms,beans with black pepper and fried kailan with mushrooms.Usually eaten with rice or noodles...Feels great but I don't think I can find a vegetarian food stall in ITE where I am studying.Most likely,we need to lunch outside of our school or pack food from home.We need to work out a schedule also to mediate and chant because our school term is starting soon.Is spaghetti with tomato sauce allowed for full time vegetarians like us?
                                              
              The incident of the temple still unsettles both of us cos we were recently haunted by dreams of those taoist deities over and over again.We need to settle quickly cos our school term is staring soon and on the other hand,we do not want to go back to the mediums again.
                                          
              In one of my dreams,Yanning and I were in a dark temple in our ITE uniforms with the red chops on our shoulders and we were lying on the floor with thunderous laughter around us.3 figures and some small ghosts appeared in front of us.Then the 3 figures ordered the small ghosts to chain us up to 2 pieces of wood stuck together in a shape of a cross how they torture prisoners in the jail to get confessions in olden China.We tried chanting continously but it does not seem to help.Then the small ghosts stripped us of our uniforms and whipped us until we were bleeding and we begged for mercy but to no avail.
                                          
              Then 2 of the three figures stuck their hands into our chests and stomachs and dug out our hearts and intestines...Our hearts were still bloody and moving in their hands.The pain was so intense that you wish you would have died.We were barely recovering from the pain when those small ghosts sank their razor teeth into every part of our bodies and we were screaming until one of the figures warned us that if we continued to oppose them,we would suffer worse fates when Yanning and I have died and imprisoned in hell forever.Yanning would be a particular slave to figure A and I would be a slave to figure B.We were then unchained with our uniforms with the red chops torn and tattered.The small ghosts were ordered to lock us into a cell each with orders to guard us.
                                          
              That was when I woke up in cold sweat and Yanning had a similar dream too that night...I told her I would not give up and I would fight to the end together with them.It is time to turn aggressive.

              <p>Seriously man... those ghosts also stupid, they think they can coerce followers into submission through fear and torture and worse - lies?</p>
              <p>What do you chant?</p>
              <p>You must understand that only You yourself can choose your own path - nobody else, not me, not Buddha, not the deities. YOU must make the descision. I can only tell you what I will do if I am in your shoes.</p>
              <p>Don't listen to them. If you cut off all ties from them, your afterlife will be much better than if you follow them. You will never fall into hell due to not following the orders of ghosts (lower realm beings), in fact you will be much better off.</p>
              <p>If you follow them, you risk high chance of falling into the lower realms - the ghost realm - simply because you are building a strong karmic connection with beings from the ghost realm. If you cut off your ties with them and follow Buddha, you will much more likely get either liberated from samsara, or reborn in higher realms. <strong>Why? Because you can only attain enlightenment and nirvana through practicing Buddhist teachings, and rebirth in higher realms is entirely dependent on your own good karma and **have NO relation to following a god at all!** No god can choose where you are reborn in your next life, only your own karma will show.<br></strong></p>
              <p>If can, tell your friend the right concepts and don't get tricked by the lies of those ghosts.</p>

              <p>Also, take refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha, even now. Read aloud the refuge verses here: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/tisarana.html">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/tisarana.html</a> . Then take refuge formally in the presence of a real sangha when the time comes.</p>
              <p>If you happen to heed my advice to take refuge, understand that taking refuge also means renouncing refuge in other gods and deities. Make a strong resolution never to follow ghost-deities ever again in your life, renounce all your former affiliations to those practices only to follow the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha from now on. It is foolish to follow them and end up like them in next life.</p>
              <p>If you end up becoming a medium, you will have short life (can ask people around - its true) and you will reborn in ghost realm.</p>
              <p>If you are a Buddhist, you must aim to attain liberation and enlightenment, and if you are not able to achieve this life, at least rebirth in the higher realms. Nobody wants to be reborn in a miserable lower realm.</p>

              <p>Also, when you meditate, don't meditate wrongly. It is easy to fall into trance and get posssessed by ghosts if you don't meditate properly. Meditating wrongly will make you end up become a medium.</p>
              <p>If in your meditation, you don't maintain very strong presence of awareness, and when you relax, let go, and enter into a trance, this is where spirits can enter. This is when 'tiao dang' can happen. You must not let this happen.</p>
              <p>If you meditate, follow these instructions:</p>

              <p><em><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #008040; font-size: small;">Observe
                      the mind to purify it</span></strong></em></p>
              <p><em> <span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>We are all human
                      beings and we all have a mind. We are frequently ‘deceived’ by our minds. For an
                      entire lifetime we are ‘deceived’ and ‘misled’ by our minds without
                      ever realizing it! If the mind is good, then of course, it is all very well. Such a mind
                      creates a good person; one can ascend to the heavens or one can perform a lot of virtuous
                      deeds. What happens if the mind is evil and becomes defiled? It can drag us to become
                      animals, ghosts and deities, or descend to hell. This is because our mind is not pure, and
                      therefore the world becomes a sea of suffering. This suffering world of ours is called the
                      "Saha World". It means having to endure and is also called the "World of
                      enduring sufferings".</strong></span> </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>If
                      we all purify our minds, then the world becomes a heaven. Everybody is very happy and
                      there is no suffering. In learning and practising Buddhism, the most important thing is to
                      purify our minds. When we can purify our minds, then naturally there will be happiness in
                      our world.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>To do that we have to observe the
                      non-arising of the mind. This is called ‘contemplation of the mind’. When the
                      mind is polluted, then we cleanse it with the dew of the Buddha. And when our minds have
                      been purified, then they are the same as those of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. In this
                      way, we will progress very quickly in our cultivation.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Observing the mind is very simple.
                      It is like watching out for the mouse. Everybody dislike mice because they steal our food
                      or they damage our clothings. An idiom describes this sentiment with the phrase,
                      ‘When the mouse crosses the street everybody goes after it.’ Obviously mice are
                      not welcomed and they have to be dealt with. One method of dealing with it, is the cat. At
                      the sight of a mouse, the cat puts his paws firmly on the ground and fixes its steely eyes
                      on the mouse. On seeing the cat, the mouse trembles with fear, not daring to make even the
                      slightest movement. Treat your mind as if it were a mouse and your awareness as the cat.
                      At every moment observe your mind, in the same way as the cat watching the mouse. The
                      mouse wants to live and hardly has time to think of its own safety, let alone of stealing
                      food. If we can observe our minds, then we will hardly have time enough to treasure our
                      wisdom life, let alone think of committing evil deeds.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Therefore when we are learning and
                      practising Buddhism, we need to learn to "contemplate the mind". In this way, we
                      will very quickly be able to avoid all evils and do all that are good.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>"Avoid all evils; do all that
                      are good; purify one’s mind. These are the teachings of all Buddhas". Besides
                      avoiding all evils and doing all that are good, we need to purify our thoughts. When our
                      thoughts have been purified, then the mind is pure. The purpose of learning and practising
                      Buddhism is to purify the human mind. If the minds of everyone in the family is pure, then
                      our home is pure; if the minds of everyone in this society is pure, then our society is
                      pure; if the minds of everyone in the country is pure, then our land is pure; if the
                      entire human race in the world is pure, then our world is as happy as the Western Pure
                      Land. </strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #0000a0; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Our mind is like the stealthy
                      mouse, ever watchful of a chance to creep out to commit evil deeds, and we are not even
                      aware of that. I hope all of us will keep a cat to watch our minds, so that we can become
                      Buddha quickly.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><strong>................<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>When you have presence of awareness, your mind will be bright and not allow the interference of spirits. It is important to note that if you can't do that (maintain the presence of awareness), if you cannot maintain presence of awareness, don't meditate for now.</strong> If you fall into an unconscious trance, it is dangerous.</p>

              You mean once I or Yanning fall into the ghost realm by following them,whether we become humans again will depend on what we do in the ghost realm?Is the worse secenerio never to be reborn again as humans but stuck forever in the ghost realm to harm others?
                              
              If that is so,it is real scary...We don't want to be slaves forever to them.Yanning has got more of a docile character,I am more aggressive.But 2 of us still have the potential to fall into the ghost realm if we are not careful.
                              
              Had another dream last night...Will share asap.We must really be more focused on mediating and chanting correctly and keeping to our vegetarian diet.Thanks.

              <p>Hi steaks</p>
              <p>Try <a href="http://www.yogichen.org/gurulin/efiles/e0/e0040.html">http://www.yogichen.org/gurulin/efiles/e0/e0040.html</a></p>
              <p>There is a picture there you can print out and also the mani mantra sheet to invoke the protection of Wei Tuo bodhisattva.</p>
              <p>If you are truly sincere about following Dharma path to realisation, there is no doubt that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will help and guide you.  </p>
              <p>You can chant what AEN tell you. Like Di Zang Pu Sa name is very good.  If too long, you can also chant NAMO BUDDHAYA.</p>
              <p>Have courage!</p>

              In my dream last night,me and Yanning were locked up as prisoners in the cells with our ITE uniforms.A few small ghosts then came and dragged us out and were given a whipping before being taken to a olden Chinese court and made to kneel down in front of a woman who was sitting at a kind of judge's table.She asked us if we would follow them and be their slaves.I shouted angrily that I would not even if I die.Yanning told her the same thing.Then the woman ordered the small ghosts to hang Yanning by the legs from a pole and one of the three figures took a long sword and cut between her legs and through her body and she was cut into 2 halves screaming.I then abused the woman with vulgarities and she ordered the small ghosts to cut off my tongue...It was so painful and I could not chant anything at all.The woman said that she would get us sooner or later.If we submitted to her,our lives will be spared.But opposing her will bring us a horrible death.I shook my head at her and the small ghosts stripped me and used long hooks to pull my heart and organs out of my body.I can't describe the pain I went through and it was like I am in hell.After that,we were locked back in our cells with a last warning to follow them if not we would be tortured every few days until we agreed.We were also warned not to seek help from others as it is useless to do so.Sooner or later,we would be part of them so we had better submit to them.
              
              I told Yanning just now that we must fight to the end...If we submit to them,then I think we would be a different people liao.Actually,I am very tired and thought of giving in...but I dunno.Tried all ways but does not seem to work.
