                    We did make a promise to them before regarding our grades...We said if they help us with our grades,we would be willing to offer them fruits,food and whatever else they wanted.We had done what we promised.

              Tell them nicely you have already fulfilled their wishes and because you want to follow Buddha from now on and practice dharma, you do not want to be involved in these any more. Ask them nicely.

              Anyway,I felt that Yanning would be the first to submit to them.She told me just that she wanted to do so in order to stop all these.She even wanted to see another medium.I told her to hang on while I am looking and asking around for help and DO not go to any more mediums.We had enough on our plates than to go and create more trouble.
              
              I made her promise not to do anything rash without consulting me first.

              <p>This master has the wisdom, methods and attainments to help you.  He is also not greedy for repayment or money.  When he helps someone, it is done selflessly, with no expectations in return. So if the dreams go on, you should quickly find someone to help. He is one of the options available to you. I feel that you shouldn't delay anymore but seek help. </p>

              <p>Steaks, I hope Yanning and you don't give up but continue to find solutions to your problems.     I believe buddhism can solve your problem.    Please do not go back to the sleazy taoist temple any more.   The more you go the more they demand from you.    What AEN said of the toaism mediums are right.   I have encountered mediums behaving like humans.    The more you and yanning go back to them the deeper you all are falling into the hole.     </p>

              <p>I have 100% confidence in Rinchen Dorjee Rinpoche. I have met
              many teachers but this Rinpoche is truly extraordinary.  He is
              also like us, a layperson and also a Chinese.  But his
              qualities are truly remarkable. If the karmic factors permit it,
              this would be a piece of cake to him.  It is in your
              hands.</p>

              'struggle' is going to effect you for your spiritual future and for
              lives to come.  It is most important that you do not give up

              <p>I don't have any recipes on hand because I don't cook much.  I daresay that when school term starts for you, it will be difficult to keep up with cooking for yourself every day. </p>
              <p>I previously posted this on <a href="/forums/1728/topics/419787">another thread</a>, and I'm posting it again in hopes it can be of help.</p>

              <p>This is what most new vegetarians fail to factor in when they

                                      your friend to make a habit of snacking on a variety of nuts (the
                                      less they are roasted/salted the better).  No harm also in
                                      eating mock meats as they give protein, but my personal preference
                                      is for the natural stuff.</p>

                                      everyday.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">All vegetarian stalls will at least have these.</span></p>

                                      fruits of different colour groups is also a good way of ensuring a
                                      wide variety of nutrients.  Generally speaking, those with
                                      more intense/bright colours are more nutritious.</p>
              <p>Also, <strong>chew food thoroughly</strong>.  When eating
                                      animal foods, chewing is less important, but vegetables and fruits
                                      are fibrous and chewing well to extract nutrients ensures you get
                                      the most out of your food.</p>

              <p>A few more general pointers...</p>
              <p>- Living in Singapore, get acquainted with what's frequently available at vegetarian cooked food stalls. It's possible to eat healthily by knowing which dishes to pick.  Not everything sold is oily or lacking nutrition.  Full-time vegetarians usually know how to pick what's freshest for the day and to choose natural foods over mock/gluten meats.  The above-mentioned pointers will also guide you.</p>
              <p>-  If you are female, be aware of increased need for iron and Vitamin B12 (for formation of blood).  Some people insist that vegetables also have B12, but I think nutritionists have proven otherwise.  So if you're not going to drink milk or eat cheese, consider getting yourself a B12 supplement (can privately PM me for recommendations).  The molasses I mentioned earlier is a good source of iron, and so are dark green leafy veggies.</p>
              <p>-  Zinc may be somewhat lacking in vegetarian diets.  Eat more pumpkin seeds.</p>
              <p>-  Iodine may also be somewhat deficient unless you make a habit of eating kombu (kelp) and seaweed every now and then.  I know vegetarian food stalls do offer these sometimes.  Sushi is also a yummy way to get in some seaweed ;)</p>
              <p>-  Choose brown or unpolished rice if given the option.  Also, eat wholemeal bread instead of white.  Whole grains are a good source of B vitamins.</p>
              <p>-  Variety is the key to a balanced diet, vegetarian or otherwise.</p>

                    the same way as there are visible and invisible lights.</em> </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Buddhism does not deny the existence
                  of good and evil spirits. There are visible and invisible beings or spirits in the same
                  way as there are visible and invisible lights. We need special instruments to see the
                  invisible light and we need a special sense to see the invisible beings. One cannot deny
                  the existence of such spirits just because one is unable to see them with one's naked
                  eyes. Theses spirits are also subject to birth and death. They are not going to stay
                  permanently in the spirit form. They too exist in the same world where we live. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A genuine Buddhist is one who moulds his life according to
                  moral causation discovered by the Buddha. He should not be concerned with the worshipping
                  of these gods and spirits. However, this kind of worshipping is of some interest and
                  fascination to the multitude and has naturally brought some Buddhists into contact with
                  these activities. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Regarding protection from evil spirits, goodness is a
                  shield against evil. Goodness is a wall through which evil cannot penetrate unless a
                  person opens the door to an evil influence. Even though a person leads a truly virtuous
                  and holy life and has a good shield of moral and noble living that person can still lower
                  his shield of protection by believing in the power of evil that would do harm to him. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Buddha has never advised His followers to worship such
                  spirits and to be frightened of them. The Buddhist attitude towards them is to transfer
                  merits and to radiate loving-kindness to them. Buddhists do not harm them. On the other
                  hand, if man is religious, virtuous and pure in mind, and if he is also intelligent and
                  possesses strong will-power and understanding capacity, then such a person could be deemed
                  to be much stronger than spirits. The evil spirits would keep away from him, the good
                  spirits would protect him. </span></p>

                                                  <p>Steaks,</p>
                                  <p>I don't have any recipes on hand because I don't cook
                                  much.  I daresay that when school term starts for you, it will
                                  be difficult to keep up with cooking for yourself every
                                  day. </p>
                                  <p>I previously posted this on <a href="/forums/1728/topics/419787" rel="nofollow">another thread</a>, and I'm posting it again in
                                  hopes it can be of help.</p>
                                  
                                  <p> </p>
                                  <p>A few more general pointers...</p>
                                  <p>- Living in Singapore, get acquainted with what's frequently
                                  available at vegetarian cooked food stalls. It's possible to eat
                                  healthily by knowing which dishes to pick.  Not everything
                                  sold is oily or lacking nutrition.  Full-time vegetarians
                                  usually know how to pick what's freshest for the day and to choose
                                  natural foods over mock/gluten meats.  The above-mentioned
                                  pointers will also guide you.</p>
                                  <p>-  If you are female, be aware of increased need for iron
                                  and Vitamin B12 (for formation of blood).  Some people insist
                                  that vegetables also have B12, but I think nutritionists have
                                  proven otherwise.  So if you're not going to drink milk or eat
                                  cheese, consider getting yourself a B12 supplement (can privately
                                  PM me for recommendations).  The molasses I mentioned earlier
                                  is a good source of iron, and so are dark green leafy veggies.</p>
                                  <p>-  Zinc may be somewhat lacking in vegetarian diets. 
                                  Eat more pumpkin seeds.</p>
                                  <p>-  Iodine may also be somewhat deficient unless you make a
                                  habit of eating kombu (kelp) and seaweed every now and then. 
                                  I know vegetarian food stalls do offer these sometimes.  Sushi
                                  is also a yummy way to get in some seaweed ;)</p>
                                  <p>-  Choose brown or unpolished rice if given the
                                  option.  Also, eat wholemeal bread instead of white. 
                                  Whole grains are a good source of B vitamins.</p>
                                  <p>-  Variety is the key to a balanced diet, vegetarian or
                                  otherwise.</p>

              If come worse to worse,I have no choice but to packet food from home and eat in the canteen during break time.Yanning should have no problems cos she can cook by herself.Food is not a problem but the harder thing is deciding what is vegetarian and whats not.
                          
              Sushi?Ya,just eat the rice and the seaweed like those bought from NTUC.I read milk is not a problem and I don't think I will take cheese.I and Yanning are planning to train to eat vegetarian full time cos we plan to be nuns and take the tonsure after we graduate from ITE.We want to devote our life to something that we believe in.
