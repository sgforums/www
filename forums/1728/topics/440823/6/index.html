              <p>Is the temple that your friend goes to a Buddhist temple ? If not, why a taoist temple conduct a dharma course? Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (Guanyin Pusa) will not punish anyone even if they are disrespectful to them. There's no such thing as punishments in Buddhism. In Buddhism, we only talk about Karma which is law of nature and not control by Buddhas or Bodhisattvas. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are very compassionate, they will try to help you even if you are disrespectful to them because they know that people who are disrespectful to them are ignorant.</p>

              <p>Most likely your friend has offended Taoist Deities. Some taoist deities will appear as Guanyin Pusa or other Bodhisattvas but they are actually not. I also go temple touring but only Buddhist temples. It is advisable to take dharma course in Buddhist temple only.</p>

              <p>My opinion is since she has offended the taoist deities, just do what they want. Most likely is they want her to do some prayers with offerings and apologise. Unless they ask for something ridiculous, or else no harm doing what they request to appease them and be cautious next time.</p>
              <p>Though I'm a Buddhist and I don't advise people to go and seek medium's help but if a person has offended taoist deities, it is better to go back to the source and get the problem solve. Just remember, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will never feel offended.</p>

              I also have similar dreams too....Will be seeing someone later to see if she can help me to interpret the recurring dreams.Yanning was suggesting we go back to Guan Yin to see if she can help us.
                      
              In my dream,I dreamt that there was also a female deity who wanted me to be her disciple.The medium confirmed it with me just now.

              After hearing what the medium has said,I have decided to go vegetarian full time.So I think the issue is beyond our control.We just have no choice but to guai guai know that we are like binded to the deities.
              
              Be it being their medium or disciples,we are going to submit to our fates.

              I remember on that particular day at the temple,the keeper of the temple where we were visiting offered us a drink mixed with yellow paper which was supposedly to bless us because our exams were on the next day.She also took those kinds of ancient chinese seal from the altar and stamped on our uniforms with it on our left front shoulder while we were offering incense and our eyes were closed.The seal had some Chinese words on it but we could not make out what the words are.We had a bit of a hard time washing our uniforms because they were in white and the stamp was red in color. I guess that was when our problems started.
              
              Wonder what was her motive in stamping on us with the seal with the red ink...Was the drink really blessed or what?

              <p>I'm not sure whether they are evil spirits. Some gods are like humans who have temper. They are also like us, not enlightened yet. Some "gods" are good and some are evil, some are petty and easily feel offended. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are different from us, they are enlightened.</p>
              <p>Don't ask help from "gods" if possible. Their help is only temporary and sometimes they can't help you at all as they can't even help themselves. Follow Buddha's teachings, accumulate merits by doing good deeds sincerely. Doing good deeds may not necessarily involve money. Like give a helping hand as and when you see someone in need. By removing a stone on the ground to avoid others from tripping over it is also a kind of good deeds. Things will go smoothly once you have accumulate enough merits.</p>
              <p>The drinks which mix with the talisman are supposed to bless you but if you have no merits, nothing can be done to bless you. If you have merits, you don't need any blessings. Instead of asking gods or others for blessing, bless yourself by doing good deeds is more practical and reliable.</p>

              <p>I agree, always trust in the law of cause-and-effect.  No matter what is being advertised or promised, however attractive it is, it can never go against the law of karma.  Don't fall into the sorrow of greed.   Even if your wishes may momentarily be solved but it will not be long-term benefit.  I have prayed to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas for wishes before (not in temple, just in my own practice).  If it is going to be beneficial to you (ie, help you towards ultimate enlightenment), it will always be granted.  If it is not going to help you, or it is not in line with your merits, then it will never happen.  But in the long run, you will realise and thank them for not fulfilling your wishes.  That is the beauty of praying to Enlightened beings.</p>

              <p>I am over joy that ppl are converting to buddhism, but i would advice, out there are many confusion which is what? Hope you can ultimately find the right place/Guru to lead and guide you to enlightenment and not be mislead.</p>
              <p>That temple you went, obviously is not a pure buddhist temple. Most likely is a taoist with buddha images..</p>

              We are still getting visits from those Taoist deities in our dreams and we were still warned of pain of punishment if we refuse to give ourselves to them cos they said that our uniforms had been chopped with their seals with the red ink at the temple that day so we technically belong to them.

              <p>It is good to take 3 refuges. May be they will not disturb you after you take the 3 refuges. If you practice well, there will be dharma protectors around you and they will also respect you. I advise you to recite "Amituofo" ï¼ˆé˜¿å¼¥é™€ä½›ï¼‰and see whether does it help. If you are uncomfortable with the uniforms , it is ok to throw or burn them.</p>
              <p>Let me know if you need help to take the 3 refuges. Bright Hill Temple used to have 3 refuges on every Guanyin Pusa birthdays.</p>

              What are the kinds of foods we should eat as vegetarians?Only fruits and greens?What is a typical vegetarian breakfast,lunch and dinner menu?Need to plan a typical all day menu...Is milk or cheese allowed?Your vegetarian meal suggestions are appreciated.

              <p>I thought you mean Guan Yin talked about punishing... maybe I misread. But it is very common for spirits to appear in the form of well known gods or bodhisattvas.</p>
              <p>If you are vegetarian, you should eat a healthy vegetarian diet - otherwise you will become unhealthy. There are many stores that sell very oily/unhealthy vegeterian food (even unhealthier than many non-veg stores), don't always eat there... try to eat healthier vegetarian food or cook yourself. Check out what are the alternative sources of protein apart from meat. Make sure you get enough nutrients. As I am unfortunately not a vegetarian, I will not be of much help here... there are others who can answer you.</p>
              <p>Milk and cheese is not a problem imo - consider that Buddha himself drank the milk given by a lady after he left his ascetism. Some Chinese Buddhists insist on pure vegan diet - absent even milk and cheese, however I don't buy into that. As Loppon Namdrol says, total vegan diet is a Chinese invention - it has no basis in Indian Buddhism (the origin of Buddhism).</p>

              <p><span class="contentdescription"><strong>Q: Are eggs and milk included in vegetarian diet? Are there other non-meat restrictions?<br></strong><br><strong>A:</strong> Buddhism encourages vegetarian diet out of compassion for the animals. 
              Eggs may be fertilized and therefore have consciousness, so we don’t eat
               eggs. Milk does not involve killing of the animal, so dairy products 
              are fine. <br>We also do not use garlic and onion, because they increase
               lust when cooked and increase bad temper when eaten raw, and they leave
               a strong odor. Nor do we use alcohol because it is intoxicating.<br>These
               are general guidelines rather than strict rules; these foods may be 
              used if one has special health conditions. You don’t have to be a 
              vegetarian to be a Buddhist. It is up to us individually to make the 
              decision. </span></p>
