              <p>Hi Nyorai, to see true self as an all-pervading, eternal witnessing presence, and the world as created and passing is still a dualistic view of "I AMness"... in this case there is realization and experience of one's luminous essence but the view of duality and inherency is not yet purified. Many mystics from all kinds of religions get stuck in this view.<br><br>In the beginning after a glimpse of our luminous essence aspect of buddha-nature (but not its empty nature) one is likely to hold onto a kind of partial-eternalism view (like what Buddha refuted in Brahmajali Sutta) but as one progresses, one will realize that there never was such a God-creation dichotomy and such a paradigm is fundamentally flawed.<br><br>As Jackson Peterson told me before:<br><br><strong class="_36"></strong></p>

              <p>It
                       is one thing to say and understand:  "Everything is Awareness", but 
                      quite another to say and understand "Awareness is only Everything"...</p>

              </div>

              <p>...it is just clear now how there is an imputation 
                      we put on Awareness as being "separate' from experience, as some sort of
                       "stand alone" awareness".  I have always experienced awareness as 
                      experience inseparably so, but didn't notice the subtle imputation that 
                      gives still a separate implication of being a remainder, when all things
                       are absent.  Being wouldn't know itself outside of experience.  If 
                      being did know itself in total voidness, that very "knowing" would 
                      itself be an experience, hence the void would not be void.  God cannot 
                      be separated from creation, because the potential for creation is 
                      already Known.</p>

              nothingness. When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the 
              illusionary nature of the individuality, subject-object division does 
              not take place. A person experiencing “AMness” will find “AMness in 
              everything”. What is it like?<br> <br> Being freed from individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all 
              phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness. The 
              AMness is not experienced as an ‘entity’ residing anywhere, neither 
              within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground reality for 
              all phenomenon to take place. Even in the moment of subsiding (death), 
              the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing the
               ‘Real’ as clear as it can be. We cannot lose that AMness; rather all 
              things can only dissolve and re-emerges from it. The AMness has not 
              moved, there is no coming and going. This "AMness" is God.<br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Practitioners should never mistake this as the true Buddha Mind! </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">"I
               AMness" is the pristine awareness. That is why it is so overwhelming. 
              Just that there is no 'insight' into its emptiness nature. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><strong>Nothing stays and nothing to hold on to. What is real, is pristine and flows, what stays is illusion. </strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">The sinking back to a background or Source is due to being blinded by strong karmic propensities of a 'Self'. </span><span style="color: black; font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">It
               is a layer of ‘bond’ that prevents us from ‘seeing’ something…it is 
              very subtle, very thin, very fine…it goes almost undetected. What this 
              ‘bond’ does is it prevents us from ‘seeing’ what “WITNESS” really is and
               <strong>makes us constantly fall back to the Witness, to the Source, to the Center</strong>.
               Every moment we want to sink back to Witness, to the Center, to this 
              Beingness, this is an illusion. It is habitual and almost hypnotic.<br> <br> But what exactly is this “witness” we are talking about? It is the <strong>manifestation </strong>itself! It is the <strong>appearance </strong>itself! There is no Source to fall back, <strong>the Appearance is the Source! </strong>Including the moment to moment of thoughts. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is we choose, but all is really it.</span> There is nothing to choose. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="color: black;"><br> </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><strong><br> There is no mirror reflecting<br> Manifestation alone IS.<br> </strong><br> </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"> There is no 
              invisible witness hiding anywhere. Whenever we attempt to fall back to 
              an invisible transparent image, it is again the mind game of thought. It
               is the ‘bond’ at work. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="color: black;">(See <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a>)</span></span><br> <span style="font-size: 100%;"><br> <span style="font-family: arial;"> Transcendental
               glimpses are misled by the cognitive faculty of our                    
                   mind. That mode of cognition is dualistic. All is Mind but this    
                                   mind is not to be taken as ‘Self’. “I Am”, Eternal 
              Witness, are all                         products of our cognition and 
              is the root cause that prevents true                         seeing. </span></span><br> <span style="font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-family: arial;"><br> When consciousness experiences the pure sense of “I AM”, overwhelmed by 
               the transcendental thoughtless moment of Beingness, consciousness 
              clings  to that experience as its purest identity. By doing so, it 
              subtly  creates a ‘watcher’ and fails to see that the ‘Pure Sense of 
              Existence’  is nothing but an aspect of pure consciousness relating to 
              the thought  realm. This in turn serves as the karmic condition that 
              prevents the  experience of pure consciousness that arises from other 
              sense-objects.  Extending it to the other senses, there is hearing 
              without a hearer and  seeing without a seer -- the experience of Pure 
              Sound-Consciousness is  radically different from Pure 
              Sight-Consciousness. Sincerely, if we are  able to give up ‘I’ and 
              replaces it with “Emptiness Nature”,  Consciousness is experienced as 
              non-local. No one state is purer than  the other. All is just One Taste,
               the manifold of Presence.</span></span><br> <br> <span style="font-family: arial;"> The ‘who’, 
              ‘where’ and ‘when’, the ‘I’, ‘here’ and ‘now’ must                      
                 ultimately give way to the experience of total transparency. Do not  
                                     fall back to a source, just the manifestation is 
              sufficient. This                         will become so clear that total
               transparency is experienced. When                         total 
              transparency is stabilized, transcendental body is                      
                 experienced and dharmakaya is seen everywhere. This is the samadhi   
                                    bliss of Bodhisattva. This is the fruition of 
              practice.<br><br>....etc (continued in URL)</span></p>

              <p>Buddha-nature is a Mahayana teaching but without correct understand can lead to an eternalist extreme. Loppon Namdrol says in 2006:<br></p>
              <p>Loppon Namdrol:<br> <br> Were the Buddha to teach such a doctrine, it might be so. However,
              in the Nirvana sutra is states quite plainly the following:<br> <em><br> That is called ‘Buddha-nature’ because all sentient beings are to
              be unsurpassedly, perfectly, completely enlightened at a future
              time. Because afflictions exist in all sentient beings at present,
              because of that, the thirty two perfect marks and the eighty
              excellent exemplary signs do not exist”.<br></em><br> Here, the Nirvana sutra clearly and precisely states that
              buddha-svabhaava, the "nature of a Buddha" refers not to an actual
              nature but a potential. Why, it continues:<br> <br> <em>"Child of the lineage, I have said that ‘curd exists in milk’,
              because curd is produced from milk, it is called ‘curd’.<br> <br> Child of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there
              is no butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the curd arises from milk
              with the conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have
              the ‘curd-nature’."</em><br> <br> So one must be quite careful not to make an error. The Lanka states
              unequivocably that the tathagatagarbha doctrine is merely a device
              to lead those who grasp at a true self the inner meaning of the
              Dharma, non-arising, the two selflessnesses and so on, and explains
              the meaning of the literal examples some people constantly err
              about:<br> <em><br> "Similarly, that tathaagatagarbha taught in the suutras spoken by
              the Bhagavan, since the completely pure luminous clear nature is
              completely pure from the beginning, possessing the thirty two
              marks, the Bhagavan said it exists inside of the bodies of sentient
              beings.<br> <br> When the Bhagavan described that– like an extremely valuable jewel
              thoroughly wrapped in a soiled cloth, is thoroughly wrapped by
              cloth of the aggregates, aayatanas and elements, becoming impure by
              the conceptuality of the thorough conceptuality suppressed by the
              passion, anger and ignorance – as permanent, stable and eternal,
              how is the Bhagavan’s teaching this as the tathaagatagarbha is not
              similar with as the assertion of self of the non-Buddhists?<br> <br> Bhagavan, the non-Buddhists make assertion a Self as “A permanent
              creator, without qualities, pervasive and imperishable”.<br> <br> The Bhagavan replied:<br> <br> “Mahaamati, my teaching of tathaagatagarbha is not equivalent with
              the assertion of the Self of the non-Buddhists.<br> <br> Mahaamati, the Tathaagata, Arhat, Samyak Sambuddhas, having
              demonstrated the meaning of the words "emptiness, reality limit,
              nirvana, non-arisen, signless", etc. as tathaagatagarbha for the
              purpose of the immature complete forsaking the perishable abodes,
              demonstrate the expertiential range of the non-appearing abode of
              complete non-conceptuality by demonstrating the door of
              tathaagatagarbha.<br> <br> Mahaamati, a self should not be perceived as real by Bodhisattva
              Mahaasattvas enlightened in the future or presently.<br> <br> Mahaamati, for example, a potter, makes one mass of atoms of clay
              into various kinds containers from his hands, craft, a stick,
              thread and effort.<br> <br> Mahaamati, similarly, although Tathaagatas avoid the nature of
              conceptual selflessness in dharmas, they also appropriately
              demonstrate tathaagatagarbha or demonstrate emptiness by various
              kinds [of demonstrations] possessing prajñaa and skillful means;
              like a potter, they demonstrate with various enumerations of words
              and letters. As such, because of that,<br> <br> Mahaamati, the demonstration of Tathaagatagarbha is not similar
              with the Self demonstrated by the non-Buddhists.<br> <br> Mahaamati, the Tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those
              grasping to assertions of the Self of the Non-Buddhists, will
              demonstrate tathaagatagarbha with the demonstration of
              tathaagatagarbha. How else will the sentient beings who have fallen
              into a conceptual view of a True Self, possess the thought to abide
              in the three liberations and quickly attain the complete
              manifestation of Buddha in unsurpassed perfect, complete
              enlightenment?"<br></em><br> Thus, the Lanka says:<br> <em><br> All yaanas are included<br> in five dharmas, three natures,<br> eight consciousnesses,<br> and two selflessnesses<br></em><br> It does not add anything about a true self and so on.<br> <br> If one accepts that tathaagatagarbha is the aalayavij~naana, and
              one must since it is identified as such, then one is accepting that
              it is conditioned and afflicted and evolves, thus the Lanka
              states:<br> <em><br> Tathaagatagarbha, known as ‘the all-base consciousness’, is to be
              completely purified.<br> <br> Mahaamati, if what is called the all-base consciousness were (37/a)
              not connected to the tathaagatagarbha, because the tathaagatagarbha
              would not be ‘the all-base consciousness’, although it would be not
              be engaged, it also would not evolve; Mahaamati, it is engaged by
              both the childish and Aaryas, that also evolves.<br> <br> Because great yogins, the ones not abandoning effort, abide with
              blissful conduct in this at the time of personally knowing for
              themselves…the tathaagatagarbha-all basis consciousness is the
              sphere of the Tathaagatas; it is the object which also is the
              sphere of teachers, [those] of detailed and learned inclinations
              like you, and Bodhisattva Mahaasattvas of analytic
              intellect.</em><br> <br> And:<br> <em><br> Although tathaagatagarbha<br> possesses seven consciousnesses;<br> always engaged with dualistic apprehensions<br> [it] will evolve with thorough understanding.<br></em><br> <br> If one accepts that the tathaagatagarbha is unconditioned and so
              on, and one must, since it is identified as such other sutras
              state:<br> <em><br> "`Saariputra, the element of sentient beings denotes the word
              tathaagatagarbha.<br> `Saariputra, that word ‘tathaagatagarbha’ denotes
              Dharmakaaya.<br></em><br> And:<br> <em><br> `Saariputra, because of that, also the element of sentient beings
              is not one thing and the Dharmakaaya another; the element of
              sentient beings itself is Dharmakaaya; Dharmakaaya itself is the
              element of sentient beings.</em><br> <br> Then one cannot accept it as the aalayavij~naana-- or worse, one
              must somehow imagine that something conditioned somehow becomes
              conditioned.<br> <br> Other sutras state that tathaagatagarbha is the citta, as the
              Angulimaala suutra does here:<br> <br> "Although in the `Sraavakayaana it is shown as ‘mind’, the meaning
              of the teaching is ‘tathaagatagarbha’; whatever mind is naturally
              pure, that is called ‘tathaagatagarbha’.<br> <br> So, one must understand that these sutras are provisional and
              definitive, each giving different accounts of the tathaagatagarbha
              for different students, but they are not defintive. Understood
              improperly, they lead one into a non-Buddhist extremes. Understood
              and explained properly, they lead those afraid of the profound
              Praj~naapaaramitaa to understanding it's sublime truth. In other
              words, the Buddha nature teaching is just a skillful means as the
              Nirvana sutra states<br> <em><br> "Child of the lineage, buddha-nature is like this; although the ten
              powers and the four fearlessnesses, compassion, and the three
              foundations of mindfulness are the three aspects existing in
              sentient beings; [those] will be newly seen when defilements are
              thoroughly conquered. The possessors of perversion will
              <strong>newly attain</strong> the ten powers (44/b) and four
              fearlessness, great compassion and three foundations of mindfulness
              having thoroughly conquered perversion.<br> <br> Because that is the purpose as such, I teach buddha-nature always
              exists in all sentient beings.</em><br> <br> When one can compare and contrast all of these citations, and many
              more side by side, with the proper reading of the Uttataratantra,
              one will see the propositions about these doctrines by the Dark Zen
              fools and others of their ilk are dimmed like stars at noon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And Namdrol also says:<br> <br> There is no teaching in Buddhism higher than dependent origination.
              Whatever originates in dependence is empty. The view of Dzogchen,
              according to ChNN in his rdzogs chen skor dri len is the same as
              Prasanga Madhyamaka, with one difference only - Madhyamaka view is
              a result of intellectual analysis, Dzogchen view is not.
              Philosophically, however, they are the same. The view of Madhyamaka
              does not go beyond the view of dependent origination, since the
              Madhyamaka view is dependent origination. He also cites Sakya
              Pandita "If there were something beyond freedom from extremes, that
              would be an extreme."<br> <br> Further, there is no rigpa to speak of that exists separate from
              the earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness that make up
              the universe and sentient beings. Rigpa is merely a different way
              of talking about these six things. In their pure state (their
              actual state) we talk about the radiance of the five wisdoms of rig
              pa. In their impure state we talk about how the five elements arise
              from consciousness. One coin, two sides. And it is completely empty
              from beginning to end, and top to bottom, free from all extremes
              and not established in anyway.<br> <br> Dzogchen teachings also describe the process of how sentient being
              continue in an afflicted state (suffering), what is the cause of
              that afflicted state (suffering), that fact that afflicted state
              can cease (the cessation of suffering) and the correct path to end
              that suffering (the truth of the path). Dzogchen teachings describe
              the four noble truths in terms of dependent origination also.<br> <br> Ergo, Dzogchen also does not go beyond Buddha's teaching of
              dependent origination which Nagarjuna describes in the following
              fashion:<br> <em><br> I bow to him, the greatest of the teachers,<br> the Sambuddha, by whom dependent origination --<br> not ceasing, not arising<br> not annihilated, not permanent,<br> not going, not coming,<br> not diverse, not single,<br> was taught as peace<br> in order to pacify proliferation.</em></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>The "creator of the world," basically, is the mind. In the Sutras, the mind is described as an <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">agent</span></strong>. It is said that consciousness has no beginning, but we must distinguish here between gross consciousness and subtle consciousness. Many gross consciousnesses appear as dependents of the physical aggregates, of the body. This is evident when you consider the different neurons and the functioning of the brain, but just because physical conditions are met does not mean that this is enough to produce a perception. In order for a perception which will have the faculty to reflect and know an object to arise, it must have a consubstantial cause. The fundamental consubstantial cause, of the same substance as its result, will in this case be the subtle consciousness. It is this same consciousness or subtle mind which penetrates the parental cells at the moment of conception. The subtle mind can have no beginning. If it had one, the mind would have to be born of something that is not the mind. According to the Kalacakra Tantra, one would have to return to the particles of space to find the fundamental consubstantial causes of the external physical world as well as of the bodies of sentient beings. --HHDL</p>

              <p>so people do not start to pray or worship "Buddha nature, or Infinite, or Continnum, or an agent" etc as something Personal "out there". like "Oh <em>Infinite</em>, can you let me strike toto?" haha;) no u cannot do that to something impersonal.</p>

              <p>Mind is also empty of any eternal substance or self, the Dalai Lama said "With our superficial observance, mind, which has concrete experience and
               clear cognizance as its nature, appears to be a powerful, independent, 
              subjective, completely ruling entity. However, deeper analysis will 
              reveal that this mind, possessing as it does the function of experience 
              and cognizance, is not a self-created entity but Is dependent on other 
              factors for its existence. Hence it depends on something other than 
              itself. This non-independent quality of the mind substance is its true 
              nature which in turn is the ultimate reality of the self."<br><br>As I posted in FB before:</p>
              <p><br>In Greg's Emptiness group, Elaine Catton posted:<br>Taking the following quote from the Dalai Lama, regarding the Clear Light, how is Clear Light understood in the emptiness teachings?<br><br>""Dodurupchen says that all phenomena are quite definitely such that they arise as rigpa energy or rigpa display. From the point of view of the new schools of tantra (sarma), everything that appears arises as the display of great bliss, and the display of emptiness. In the terminology of Dzogchen whatever manifests arises as the display of rigpa, and that is certain. So the agent responsible for all of this as well as the space and ground for it all, is the single state of Clear Light. Everything, in fact , is the display or array of Clear Light. Such experiences of Clear Light will arise, and when they do, you are left without any fear of falling into samsara: you are left without any hope of attaining nirvana: you are left without any hope or fear whatsoever. All experiences and all feelings, be they good or bad, karma, its results, birth and death and change: all of this manifests as the magical display of Clear Light."<br><br>Dzogchen by the Dalai Lama pp 196 and 197<br><br>I replied with my limited knowledge on this subject:<br><br>Posted this before:<br><br>The Dalai Lama has this to say:<br><br>http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2009/07/happiness-karma-and-mind.html<br><br>"...We have become so habituated to consciousness of the form and color of gross objects that, when we make concentrated introspection into the nature of mind, it is, as I have said, found to be a vast, limitless void free from any gross obscurity or other hindrances. Nevertheless, this does not mean that we have discerned the subtle, true nature of the mind. What has been explained above concerns the state of mind in relation to the concrete experience and clear cognizance by the mind which are its function, but it describes only the relative nature of mind."<br><br>"...However, as we have observed, its true nature has many aspects, including consciousness of concrete experience and cognizance of objects. Now let us make a further examination in order to grasp the meaning of the subtle essence of such a mind. Mind came into existence because of its own cause. To deny that the origination of mind is dependent on a cause, or to say that it is a designation given as a means of recognizing the nature of mind aggregates, is not correct. With our superficial observance, mind, which has concrete experience and clear cognizance as its nature, appears to be a powerful, independent, subjective, completely ruling entity. However, deeper analysis will reveal that this mind, possessing as it does the function of experience and cognizance, is not a self-created entity but Is dependent on other factors for its existence. Hence it depends on something other than itself. This non-independent quality of the mind substance is its true nature which in turn is the ultimate reality of the self. "<br><br>It may be further questioned on the Dalai Lama's position: this subtle, relative nature of mind, which is not merely gross sensory objects and thoughts but which even seem like a void and illuminating source, how can that be said to be non-independent? It seems to be non-arising and non-dependent.<br><br>What the Dalai Lama calls the 'subtle clear light' is indeed non-arising like anything and everything due to its empty nature, but in emptiness teachings we do not treat it as having some special or ultimate status of being a 'powerful, independent, subjective, completely ruling entity'.<br><br>It is never lost but is seen as a stream... as the Dalai Lama considers that this clear light mind is "permanent not in the sense of not disintegrating moment by moment but in the sense that its continuum is no interrupted…" (http://www.dreamyoga.com/tibetan-dream-yoga/the-dalai-lama-on-the-clear-light) In other words this mind of Clear Light, which is pure Knowingness and luminosity as described there, is not unchanging as a static substratum but as an uninterrupted flow like a mighty river. Luminosity will never be lost, so it is like a vajra (diamond), but not in the sense of a substantiated entity. It is not a background source behind manifestation but we see that the source is in fact manifestation itself - it is the flow of knowing without knower, in all manifestation and differentiation we experience the same taste of luminosity and emptiness.<br><br>Elsewhere such as http://newbuddhist.com/discussion/14234/fundamental-innate-mind-of-clear-light - the Dalai Lama furthermore clarifies the non-independent, causal nature of clear light.<br><br>Geoff (jnana/nana) from Dharmawheel sums up this view:<br><br>"...For example, Sajjana's MahÄ�yÄ�nottaratantraÅ›Ä�stropadeÅ›a equates tathÄ�gatagarbha with luminous mind, and then explains that although this luminous nature is not-conditioned (unlike ordinary states of mind that are contingent upon the four conditions), the luminous nature arises due to the previous moment of that same luminous mind. Shakya Chogden has a similar understanding, stating that although the tathÄ�gatagarbha is often said to be permanent, etc., "that is also done in terms of its continuum. Otherwise, [it should] be [understood as] impermanent, precisely because of having an immediately preceding condition [deriving] from [its previous] moment."<br><br>"...Again, Tibetan commentators such as Go Lotsawa maintain that space is also momentary. Relying on the DharmadharmatÄ�vibhÄ�gavá¹›tti, he states:<br><br>It is not the case that space that exists only as enclosed space does not partake of the nature of momentariness along a continuum. If you take time into account here, space at the beginning of an eon (kalpa) is not the [same] space at the time of [its] destruction. In terms of location, the substance that exists as the enclosed space of a golden receptacle is not that which exists as the enclosed space of an earthen receptacle.<br><br>He then applies this analysis of space to the buddha element:<br><br>Likewise, a moment in the continuation of a continuum having the quality of the [buddha] element's awareness of sentient beings is not a moment in the wisdom of a buddha. Notwithstanding, in the same way as the existence of the enclosed space of a golden and earthen receptacle is not different in terms of type (rigs), the nonconceptuality of a buddha and the nonconceptuality of sentient beings are of a very similar type." .<br><br>In the above quotations, Dalai Lama made it clear that the "concrete cognizance" of mind (clear light/luminosity) is still the relative/conventional nature of mind, while the ultimate nature of mind is its emptiness. Awareness itself is conventional and empty! 'Awareness' is like the word 'chariot' or 'self', not a singular, independent and irreducible ("It's all just One Awareness") kind of substance or reality that can be pinned down somewhere apart from the various streams of dependently arisen consciousness (or revealing its actual state as the five wisdoms, when in knowledge) empty of any core or self/Self.<br><br>Similar statements can be found elsewhere such as http://www.byomakusuma.org/Teachings/InterviewWithKhenchenRigdzinDorjeOnTheNyingmapaView.aspx<br><br>"Khenpo: According to the Nyingmpa, the luminosity can be experienced as pure or impure but the ultimate truth is emptiness. We have two types of conventional truth, one is pure and one is impure. The conventional truth of the ordinary man is impure, while the conventional truth of the Buddhas is permanently pure.<br><br>Ratnashree: So, salwa/luminosity/prabhashwar is still conventional. It is pure or impure but still conventional?<br><br>Khenpo: Yes<br><br>Ratnashree: Only emptiness is the ultimate truth?<br><br>Khenpo: Yes<br><br>Ratnashree: We have 1) self emptiness view, that is Rangtong/Swa Sunya view/Tawa/ Dristi and 2) other emptiness view Shentong/Para Sunya view/Tawa/ Drishti, etc. What is the official Nyingmpa view (Tawa/Dristi)? What is the view of Longchenpa, Mipham, Jigme Lingpa etc.?<br><br>Khenpo: According to the Nyingmapa, we are not Rangtong, we are not Shentong. If you believe only Rangtong, it becomes nihilistic (ucchedvad). If you believe only Shentong, it becomes eternalist (saswatvad). We believe in Sung Zhug/Yuganadh or Abheda (the indivisibility of or unity of clarity and emptiness/ Prabhaswar Sunyata Yuganadha). According to the second turning of the wheel, all the appearance itself is emptiness .That is Rangtong/Swasunyavadin. According to the third turning of the wheel, we can say that there is some pure vision which the Buddha can see. That is called Shentong/Parasunyavadin. But these two are united. Pure vision and emptiness are united primordially. And that is the Sung Zhug view, Abhedavadin or Yuganaddhavadin, ‘Indivisible-ist’ so to say. Therefore, we are not Shentong and not Rangtong.<br><br>(NB: Actually when it comes to actual meditation the Sakya meditation view is also what the Khenpo here calls Sung Zhug. Rangtong in the Sakya system actually means that the emptiness of the Prasangika is not abandoned in the ultimate truth and in Sung Zhug this emptiness (niswabhavata) or empty of real self existence is not abandoned. And regarding luminosity/clarity (prabhashwar) being the conventional truth, regardless of whether it is pure or impure, it is also the view of the Mahasiddha Virupa, which makes it the official Sakya view;( prabhaswar/luminosity/clarity/awareness by itself is the conventional truth)<br><br>........<br><br>(end of excerpt)<br><br>But with regards to the original teachings of Nagarjuna or Madhyamika studies in general, I think not much is spoken about clear light/luminosity, unless you consider treatises (which is attributed to but not likely to be actually written by, Nagarjuna) like In Praise of the Dharmadhatu to be the actual writings of Nagarjuna, which I think is great regardless of who wrote it.<br><br>Clear Light however is spoken in all four traditions of Tibetan Buddhism and if you are talking about Tibetan Buddhism as a whole and not just Madhyamika teachings, then you will find abundant teachings about the inseparability of luminosity and emptiness.</p>

              <p>Indeed. Environment too is none other than five aggregates. Five aggregates are none other than environment. Mind is none other than mental activities.</p>

              <p>About an hour into talk, we resume the Paramarthah Gathas of Asanga’s Yogacarabhumi sutra study with Gatha 17-21, particularly focusing on the verses dealing with the ephemeral nature of all things we think of as ourselves.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>17-18. The physical body is like foam. Feelings are like bubbles on the surface of the water. The perceptions are like a magic city. The mental formations are like the stem of a banana tree. The consciousness is like a magic show. That is what the Buddha has taught.</p>
              <p>19. Ignorance does not make ignorance ignorant, nor does it make others ignorant. Another does not make ignorance ignorant. Nevertheless ignorance is not non-existent.</p>
              <p>20. Ignorance is born from inappropriate attention. Inappropriate attention arises in the ignorant person.</p>
              <p>21. Merit, lack of merit and immovability; these formations are imagined in a threefold way. All things have three kinds of karma and these karma’s are not compatible with each other.</p>

              <div style="margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px;">As the mind’s focus grows narrower, the currents sent out by the mind grow shorter and more limited. Mae Chee Kaew had investigated and understood conceptual phenomena so thoroughly that the clear, bright essence no longer made conscious contact with them. Thought and imagination within the mind had come to a complete halt. The mind’s essential knowing nature stood out alone, on its own.</div>
              <div id="yui_3_7_2_1_1367591729307_2268" style="margin-right: 50px; margin-left: 50px;">When strange and unusual things occur in your meditation, just let them happen. Don’t become attached to them. Such things are really an external focus and should be let go of. Put them down and move on — don’t hold on to them. All realms of consciousness originate from the mind. Heaven and hell originate from the mind.<em> Pretas </em>and <em>devas, </em>lay people, nuns — all living beings originate from the mind. Because of that, it is far better to focus exclusively on your own mind. There you will find the whole universe.</div>

The heart at complete rest is still. When the heart is still, wisdom appears easily, fluently. When wisdom flows, clear understanding follows. The world’s impermanent, unsatisfactory and insubstantial nature is seen in a flash of insight, and we become fed up with our attachment to this mass of suffering and loosen our grip. In that moment of coolness, the fires in our heart abate, while freedom from suffering arises naturally of its own accord.</div>
