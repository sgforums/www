              moral psychology represents a distinctive contribution to contemporary moral
              discourses. Most Western ethicists neglect to problematize perception at all,
              and few suggest that ethical engagement begins with perception. But this is a
              central idea in Buddhist moral theory. Human perception is always
              perception-as. We see someone as a friend or as an enemy; as a stranger or as
              an acquaintance. We see objects as desirable or as repulsive. We see ourselves
              as helpers or as competitors, and our cognitive and action sets follow in train.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4d4d4d;'>We can
              explain or express this in the Buddhist language of<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">sparsa</em><span> </span>(contact),<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">vedanÄ�</em><span> </span>(hedonic
              tone), samjña (ascertainment),<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">chanda</em><span> </span>(action selection) and<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">cetanÄ�</em><span> </span>(intention).
              Every perceptual episode, while it might begin with sensory contact, has some
              hedonic tone. We experience the object with which we have contact on a
              continuum from pleasurable to distasteful. Perception involves
              ascertainment–the representation of the object perceived as of a kind. This
              ascertainment and hedonic tone lead us to ready action appropriate to the
              object and its affective valence, and as we do so, we form an intention to act,
              perhaps before we even become aware that we do so. Perception is always part of
              a contact-cognition-action cycle in which there is no bare awareness of an
              object disjoint from our interests or affect.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4d4d4d;'>It is
              hard to avoid the conclusion that perception itself is morally charged. If I
              see women as tools, or Latinos as fools, the damage is done. That perception
              involves the formation of intentions that are morally problematic on their
              face, and that lead to harms of all kinds. Perceiving in that way makes me a
              morally reduced person. If, on the other hand, I perceive people as
              opportunities to cooperate, or to provide benefit, I perceive in a way that
              involves the construction of morally salutary intentions, good on their face,
              and productive of human goods. For this reason, much Buddhist ethical discourse
              eschews the articulation of duties, rules or virtues, and aims at the
              transformation of our mode of perceptual engagement with the world. Moral
              cultivation, on this view, is the cultivation of a way of seeing, not in the
              first a instance a way of acting.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt; text-align: justify; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4d4d4d;'>The
              importance of moral perception is well-illustrated by the phenomenon of
              implicit bias. Since Greenawald et al. (1998) a raft of evidence has
              demonstrated both the omnipresence and the pernicious effects of implicit bias.
              Implicit bias—the subliminal association of negative traits with members of
              groups that are the victims of bias and positive traits with dominant goups—is
              evident in the implicit bias association task, in experiments asking
              professionals to evaluate resumés with stereotypical names, in salary decisions
              regarding candidates of opposite genders, in tasks asking participants to
              identify objects carried by individuals in rapid presentation, in medical
              decisionmaking, etc. It is far too widespread, and far too robust a finding to
              be dismissed. While it is possible to reduce the effect of implicit bias
              through training, that training must be regular, and must be regularly repeated
              if the effects are to be significant or lasting, and the most effective methods
              in reducing implicit bias are affective, not cognitive. Changing people’s explicit
              beliefs or attitudes, and even making them aware of their own implicit bias has
              no real effect. Only training that involves changing the immediate affective
              valence of the perception of others has any lasting effect.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4d4d4d;'>Implicit
              bias demonstrates that the roots of virtue and vice, or of good and evil lie
              not in what we do, but in how we see. The fact that in the moment we have no
              control over our implicit bias may excuse us from culpability of that bias in
              the moment, but it does not excuse us from responsibility to transform
              ourselves so as to eliminate that bias. Involuntariness, that is, may excuse
              the act, but it does not absolve us of moral blameworthiness. The same goes,<span> </span><em style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;">mutatis mutandis</em>, for morally salutary perceptual
              sets. We have an obligation, once we recognize our implicit biases, to
              remediate them. We cannot reflectively endorse being the kind of person who
              perceives the world in this way.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4d4d4d;'>Implicit
              bias is only the tip of the moral iceberg of our perceptual lives. The very
              processes that are salient when we investigate racial or gender bias in these
              disturbing studies are ubiquitous in our psychology. It is not only racial
              stereotyping that is problematic; the representation of Maseratis as desirable,
              or of insect protein as undesirable may be just as morally charged, and just as
              deeply implicated in perceptual processes. And the powerful effects not merely
              of implicit social pressures at work in the cases of racial stereotyping, but
              also the deliberate efforts of advertisers, demagogues, preachers and moral
              philosophers to distort our perception must be morally scrutinized, for just as
              implicit bias demonstrably distorts our explicit reasoning and judgments in
              invidious ways, the panoply of subliminal processes to which it is kin have the
              same effect across the domains in which agency is manifest.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt; text-align: justify; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #4d4d4d;'>A
              Buddhist moral psychology shows us just how and why our moral lives begin with
              perception, and Buddhist meditative practices provide an avenue to eradicate
              the vices of perception and to encourage more virtuous ways of seeing the
              world.</span></p>
