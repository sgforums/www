              <p>Ultimately, Kyimo Lung has only its raw  untouched beauty and the 
              blessings of Dharma. Difficult transportation and the lack of 
              communication prevent the outside world from encroaching; remoteness and
               inaccessibility provide a serene and undisturbed environment perfect 
              for the practice of Dharma.</p>
              <p>Kyabje Dodrup Chen Rinpoche formally accepted the role 
              of spiritual head of Sera Gonpa (Nubri) Monastery in order to continue 
              the benefit of the 11th Nubri lama’s endeavors.  The local people are 
              devoted, but life is very hard here.  It is no longer possible for these
               people to independently support the monastery. They need help from 
              outside.  Even obtaining the bare essentials is problematic. For 
              example, rice has to be bought in the market in the lowlands; then 
              porters must be hired to carry the rice on their backs up to Kyimo 
              Lung.  So, even rice is prohibitively expensive.  As Rinpoche made a 
              commitment to Nubri Monastery, he currently provides financial support. 
              Rinpoche is now old so the Monastery need to find other means of 
              support.</p>
              <p>Since the Monastery became connected to Dodrup Chen 
              Rinpoche, the religious community has grown to over 100 monks and nuns. 
              The 11th Nubri Lama had originally intended to keep the monastery small,
               but Rinpoche feels that in this degenerate age it is rare to find those
               with motivation for Dharma, so anyone who comes to Nubri to practice 
              should be accepted.  Life at the monastery is hard. For example, there 
              is no electricity or running water.  Only the most dedicated 
              practitioners brave the hardships.</p>

               Thrisong Deutsen (790-858) asked Guru Rinpoche, the great 9th century 
              saint and founder of Buddism in Tibet.</p>
              <p>"In future times, when there will be warfare, strife,
               and difficult circumstances in the world, will there be a safe haven 
              where people can go to practice?"</p>
              <p><strong>Guru Rinpoche told the king that there would be 
              five Lungs where warfare would never enter. Kyimo Lung is one of these 
              five.</strong></p>
              <p>Guru Rinpoche himself, came to bless this valley. Near 
              Sera Gompa,Nubri Monastery is the mountain of Tashi Palsang where 
              heart treasures are hidden. These discovered treasures Ter were then
               reconcealed in the mountain and there continued presence is a 
              protection against war, Terdak Lingpa [Minling Terchen, 1646-1714] 
              discovered Ter here as did Terton Garwang Dorje, who took six scriptures
               as Ter practices from the mountain before replacing them. The Mirror of
               the Enlightened Mind of Vajrasattva and The Heart Tantra of 
              Padmasambhava on Dzogchen were both discovered in Kyimo Lung.</p>
              <p>According to one of the greatest Tertons, Rigdzin 
              Goddem, many Termas still remain in the mountains of Nubri. Karma Tulku 
              has listed a few:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">The original 18 Dzogchen Tantras in
               5 cycles written in Lapis given by Vajrapani to King Ja. </span> </li>

              Trisongdeutsan’s youngest son in a copper vessel. </span> </li>

              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">Avalokitesvara’s crystal

              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">King Trisongdeutsan’s crown 
              which was originally given by Indra to Shakyamuni, then hidden as a 
              terma, re-discovered by Guru Rinpoche and given to King Trisongdeutsan. </span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">King Trisongdeutsan’s robe. </span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">Guru Rinpoche’s set of 21 
              phurbas. </span> </li>
