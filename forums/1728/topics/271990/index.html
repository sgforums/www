Things like studying hard, we all must do our part as a student to study hard, for our own benefit and also as part of our filiality to our parents and their expectations. We can also strife for a better life of course, just as long as we do not become too attached. Like anything else, if we become too attached, then it's no good. We should practise dharma in daily living whatever we are doing, and not attached in the midst of whatever we are doing.<br><br>We live in the mundane world, and so we must gain knowledge of our mundane world to be able to benefit ourselves and others in many ways.<br><br>However, Buddhism teaches us not to only gain in knowledge but also in <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">wisdom</span></strong>.

They are just two aspects of the same reality. The same goes to Nirvana and Samsara.<br><br><blockquote>False-imagination teaches that such things as light and shade, long and short, black and white are different and are to be discriminated; but they are not independent of each other; they are only different aspects of the same thing, they are terms of relation and not of reality. Conditions of existence are not of a mutually exclusive character; in essence things are not two but one. Even Nirvana and SamsÃ¡raÂ’s world of life and death are aspects of the same thing, for there is no Nirvana except where is SamsÃ¡ra, and no SamsÃ¡ra except where is Nirvana. All duality is falsely imagined.<br><br>~ Lankavatara Sutra</blockquote>The deepest essence of non-duality is the non-duality of Subject-Object and the non-duality of Samsara and Nirvana.</div>

He is unable to perceive the Emptiness nature of all appearances, and suffers all the time in endless dualistic pursuit.<br><br>When this happens, useful and compassionate desires become dualistic <span style="font-style: italic;">greed</span>.. greed being founded on ignorance and attachment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....As stated earlier, a helpful concept here is compassion, a heart aspect of the practice and reality related to kindness. <strong>You see, wherever there is desire there is suffering, and wherever there is suffering there is compassion, the desire for the end of suffering.</strong> You can actually experience this. So obviously there is some really close relationship between suffering, desire and compassion. This is heavy but good stuff and worth investigating.<br><br><strong>We might conceive of this as compassion having gotten caught in a loop, the loop of the illusion of duality. This is sort of like a dogÂ’s tail chasing itself. Pain and pleasure, suffering and satisfaction always seem to be Â“over there.Â” Thus, when pleasant sensations arise, there is a constant, compassionate, deluded attempt to get over there to the other side of the imagined split. This is fundamental attraction. You would think that we would just stop imagining there is a split, but somehow that is not what happens. We keep perpetuating the sense of a split even as we try to bridge it, and so we suffer. When unpleasant sensations arise, there is an attempt to get away from over there, to widen the imagined split. This will never work, because it doesnÂ’t actually exist, but the way we hold our minds as we try to get away from that side is painful. When boring or unpleasant sensations arise, there is the attempt to tune out all together and forget the whole thing, to try to pretend that the sensations on the other side of the split are not there. This is fundamental ignorance and it perpetuates the process, as it is by ignoring aspects of our sensate reality that the illusion of a split is created in the first place....</strong></span><br><br>--- Dharma Dan.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Remember how it was stated above that suffering motivates everything we do? We could also say that everything we do is motivated by compassion, which is part of the fundamentally empty nature of reality. That doesnÂ’t mean that everything we do is skillful; that is a whole different issue.<br><br>Compassion is a very good thing, especially when it involves one's self and all beings. It is sort of the flip side of the Second Noble Truth. The whole problem is that Â“misdirectedÂ” compassion, compassion that is filtered through the process of ego and its related habits, can produce enormous suffering and often does. It is easy to think of many examples of people searching for happiness in the strangest of places and by doing the strangest of things. Just pick up any newspaper. The take-home message is to search for happiness where you are actually likely to find it.<br><br>We might say that compassion is the ultimate aspect of desire, or think of compassion and desire on a continuum. <strong>The more wisdom or understanding of interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect compassion and the more the results will turn out well. The more greed, hatred and delusion or lack of understanding of interconnectedness there is behind our intentions and actions, the more they reflect desire and the more suffering there will likely be.</strong></span><br><br>~ Dharma Dan<br><br>Just my 2 cents. Perhaps others can share their understanding on 'greed'...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something just come across my mind just now while reciting the Heart Sutra and being observant/aware of my mind.<br><br>Suddenly, it become apparent to me that 99% of my incessant (and useless) thoughts are related to deeply rooted habit energy of incessantly wanting to 'know' things.<br><br>It is the deeply rooted karmic propensity that keeps wanting to know things in accordance to its dualistic mode of perceiving -- Who, What, Where, When, How, etc.<br><br>It is the deeply rooted karmic propensity... I have written about this based on my discussions with Thusness but it just become more apparent to me just now, perhaps because I was a little more mindful of my own thinking, or I was able to 'step out' of the momentum and become aware of its habitual patterns.<br><br><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html" rel="nofollow">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Karmic Propensities is what blinded us from seeing the ultimate reality. Our entire mind is affected by karmic propensities such that our entire system of enquiry, even when we want to inquire on reality, we cannot know beyond "Who", "When", "What", "Where". Our mind is always thinking dualistically, in terms of subject and object (an I and a Not-I/an Observer apart from the Object of Observation, which cannot be found in reality). It is a momentum that cannot be located, yet it can be directly felt and experienced, and the momentum arises every moment and affect the entire way we see things. When we are affected by momentum the mind cannot know the ultimate reality (Emptiness).....</span><br><br>This does not mean we should stop seeking knowledge. The only thing is that we must be aware not to deepen our karmic propensity and habit energy, that's all. Lot's of practise is needed to be able to become aware of our karmic propensities and deconstruct them... in that way there will be clarity and we are not bonded by our propensities.</div>
