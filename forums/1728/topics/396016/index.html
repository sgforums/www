              <p>Dear Dharma Friends,
              <br> <br> I am sad to announce that the proposed visit of His Holiness the 17th 
              Gyalwang Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje was not approved by the Government 
              of India. The visit was scheduled to take place from 27th May to 2nd 
              July in nine countries of Europe.
              <br> <br> The Kagyu Office, the Administration of Gyalwang Karmapa was informed of
               the decision by the Tibetan Government in Exile on 3rd April 2010. The 
              process has begun to find out why this visit was not possible and what 
              positive conditions are needed to make the visit possible in near 
              future.
              <br> <br> I know a huge number of followers and friends in Europe were eagerly 
              waiting for the visit of Gyalwang Karmapa and I know that all of you are
               sad and disappointed.
              <br> <br> I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the organizers, 
              volunteers and donors for working so hard to prepare for the visit in 
              last many months. Your cooperation and support were beyond any 
              expectations.
              <br> <br> I hope and pray together with you that the visit will happen in very 
              near future and that all of us would be able to receive his teachings in
               Europe.
              <br> <br> Ringu Tulku</p>

              <p>A Statement from the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa, Ogyen Trinley Dorje<br><br>I know that the Co-ordinator of Karmapa in Europe 2010, has already notified everyone that my proposed visit has had to be cancelled for reasons beyond my control. I was very much looking forward to meeting with my European students, visiting  your dharma centres, giving teachings, and having the opportunity to gain first-hand experience and  insight into the great variety of European life and culture.<br><br>I was wholeheartedly preparing for this visit so you will understand  that I too was sad and  disappointed  when I learned  that  I would not be able to come this time. However, I hope that this is merely a  temporary setback and that I will definitely  be able to visit Europe in the near future.<br><br>It remains for me to express my gratitude to Ringu Tulku and all of you in the different countries and dharma centres who have worked so hard to prepare for the visit. Please be assured that your work has not been in vain or wasted.  By these efforts, you have planted a powerful seed and when it reaches fruition my intention to come to Europe will be fulfilled.<br><br>Meanwhile, my aspiration and vision remain firm. I am determined  to follow in the footsteps of the 16th Gyalwang  Karmapa,  renewing  connections  with  long-standing students  and forging  a closer relationship with all my European friends,  past, present and future.<br><br>17th Gyalwang Karmapa,<br>Ogyen Trinley Dorje,<br>Gyuto Tantric University,<br>Himachal Pradesh,<br>India<br>7th April, 2010</p>
