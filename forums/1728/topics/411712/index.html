              <p>Situated in the eastern nook of India, surrounded by China, Bhutan and
              Myanmar on its three sides, Arunachal Pradesh is a land of rugged
              grandeur whose snowy peaks like Kangto (7090 mts), Nyegi Kangsang (7050
              mts), Gorichen (6488 mts), Chomo (6000 mts), etc are gorged through
              roaring rivers and swift streams. It offers a breath-taking spectacle
              of Nature's glory in a wild profusion of flora, fauna and people
              abounding in a variety of tribal customs, culture, language and dress.
              Endowed with unsurpassed beauty. Arunachal Pradesh was, until recently,
              the hidden frontier, existing in splendid isolation. The magnificent
              landscape in its un spoilt glory is now accessible and open to
              tourists, travelers and adventure lovers.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Pemako is very special; it is a hidden land, a sacred place. The Pemako region spreads from Tibet into upper India and it is the body of Dorje Phagmo. The mountains, the rivers, the valleys are her body. Our school is near the birthplace of Dudjom Rinpoche and right next to the womb space of Dorje Phagmo it is very sacred.<br><br>Many great masters fled to Pemako after the Chinese invaded Tibet and it was also the birthplace of H.H. Dudjom Rinpoche. Many Terma speak about the special qualities of Pemako. For instance in a Terma discovered by Chogyur Lingpa and rediscovered by Khamtrul Rinpoche it says,Â  "In future times, at the end of the turbulent and wicked age, there will arise a time when Vidhyadharas of intrinsic awareness will flee their homelands from foreign invaders who incite great trepidation and fear in the hearts of our people. Out of all mystic places, that which is most pre-eminent and supreme amongst the hidden valleys is the Beyul Pema-ko - resplendent like an immaculate lotus flower."<br><br>'Hung! I prostrate to you Dorje Tho Treng Tsal.<br><br>In future times, at the end of the turbulent and wicked age, there will arise a time when Vidhyadharas of intrinsic awareness will flee their homelands from foreign invaders who incite great trepidation and fear in the hearts of our people. Their longing will guide them to pilgrimage to distant hidden lands and will find refuge amongst the secret valleys to the south in the land of Monyul. There are myriad enumerations of short and long-winded tales of these most blessed of lands however, the account I have written here is a concise summary of my own.<br><br>Our legends tell us that Tibet, the Land of Snows is analogous to a supine ogress outstretched on her back. In the upper torso of her body lay the heart of Ngari, and Tsang. In her lower torso are the legs of Do Kham, China and Mongolia. In her secret place is Er Lang Ri and her head arises as the immaculately pure glacial snows of Mount Kailash. In her cardinal and intermediate directions, she is surrounded by the twenty-five sacred Neychen containing the mysterious and unknown abodes of the gods. Out of all of these obscure and mystic places, that which is most pre-eminent and supreme amongst all the hidden valleys in the Land of Snows is the Beyul Pema-ko - resplendent and agape like an immaculate lotus flower.<br><br>It is from this then, from the center of China and Mongolia, Do Kham, U and Tsang that the wondrous body of the sublime Dorje Pagmo arises. Her head is renowned as the, "glorious mountain" south of Kongpo. Her neck is Pema Dzong and Orgyan Puk and her heart is the spontaneously arisen palace of great bliss. Her navel is Trakar Tashi Dorje Dzong and her secret place is a mountain of crystal lotuses. All of these are the wondrous display of the three channels and five chakras of her Vajra body. Furthermore, arrayed in the ten directions surrounding her form are the Beyuls of Yagu Lung and the glorious Beyul Dre-mo 'jong (Sikkim). In addition to these realms which emerge from her wondrous display are the five large valleys and six continents of Arya Jong, Go'o Jong, Khenpa Jong and Bachak Sher-ri Jong each of which are the five types of spontaneously arisen grains and cereals.<br><br>In the future, as the complex necessities and riches of the world increase, there will remain two great Neychen into which the foreign invaders will fail to reach. These are the Beyul Dre-mo 'jong (Sikkim) and the Beyul Pema-ko. Contained herein is a concise guide for finding their door and entering their valleys here in the Land of Snows.'<br><br>Read more at :<br>http://www.snowlionpub.com/pages/N64_20_2.html</p></div>

              <p>For nearly 2000 years, the notion of an earthly paradise 
                          or Shangri La hidden among the peaks of Asia has captivated 
                          the human imagination. Western explorers combed the 
                          region in search of this hidden land of bliss and nectar 
                          described in ancient Buddhist texts as the Pemako or 
                          the Lotus land.</p>
              <p>According 
                          to Buddhist tradition Pemako is one of the 16 earthly 
                          paradises, a promised land free of worry, the ultimate 
                          hidden haven. The place is where, it is prophesied that 
                          the seed of humanity will thrive at the end of the world 
                          in famine and calamities.<br> <br> In the beginning of the 20th century, many Khampas from 
                          Tibet made the long, arduous trek to Pemako in quest 
                          of succor and refuge. They are one of the major inhabitants 
                          of the region, along The Adis, Mishmis who were the 
                          original inhabitants here. The region is a melting pot 
                          of different tribal cultures, where all the tribes exist 
                          in complete harmony among themselves and the nature. 
                          Walking through pemako one can see Adi, Memba, khampa 
                          and Mishmi villages with their distinctive culture, 
                          faith and lifestyle.<br> <br> The Pemako is consecrated to the female divinity of 
                          Dorje Phagmo and its sacred geography is mapped to the 
                          body of this sleeping Goddess. Her head is the Kangri 
                          Kangpo, her two breasts is Namche Barwa and Gyala Peri 
                          respectively. The lower part of her body lies in Yangsang 
                          or the innermost pemako which is the upper Siang region 
                          of Arunachal Pradesh. In the confluence of Siang (Tsangpo) 
                          and Yangsang is the sacred triangle Kila Yangzom the 
                          vulva of Goddess Dorje Phagmo. This the supreme of sacred 
                          lands is now open to the world to discover and marvel.<br> <br> Every year pilgrims traverse the area on Kora (circumbulation). 
                          Covering the sacred Devakota, the gathering place of 
                          Dakinis, The holy Titapori mountain, Pemashree and Riu 
                          Tala (Eko Dumbing for Adis).<br> <br> After an arduous trekking of 4 days one reaches the 
                          sacred Titapori Mountain at 14,000 ft. The landscape 
                          here forms a fully opened lotus. In the lake of Danakosha 
                          there is the Citta Island, âthe heart of the worldâ. 
                          According to ancient pemako guide book; upon merely 
                          seeing this place ones obscurations of knowledge will 
                          be cleared and negative Karma accumulated over a thousand 
                          eons will be purified.<br> <br> From here one have breathtaking view of the majestic 
                          Himalaya range with Namche Barwa peak and Kondu Dosem 
                          Potrang the mythical palace of Dorje Sempa in the north, 
                          the Pemashree and the Eko Dumbing or Riu Tala of the 
                          Abroka range towards west and south respectively.<br> <br> It is a treasure trove of flora and fauna with all kinds 
                          of medicinal and aromatic plants and rare flowers. It 
                          is also a Rhododendron fairyland. 44 new species was 
                          discovered here in 2005. Wildlife: Goral, Takin, Musk 
                          deer, Snow leopard, Tiger.<br> <br> The Adi hunters come to the high mountains in an annual 
                          expedition to collect aconite poison and offer their 
                          prayer and homage to the Deities of the mountain.<br> <br> The region offers very challenging trekking opportunities 
                          for pilgrims, plant enthusiasts and bird watching.<br> <br> <em>Best period August to October.</em></p>

              <p>Really the story begins many years ago when four friends, all 
              Lamas, and I left Tibet. Upon reaching to India we made a vow together that one 
              of us would someday start a school to preserve the special teachings and yogic 
              practices of the Nyingma lineage. We made this promise to Dudjom Rinpoche. Now, 
              many years later not all of us are alive and others are engaged in important 
              work and so it has fallen to me to undertake this project. Really I am 
              very lucky because to do such auspicious work in a sacred land such as Pemako 
              makes one very fortunate. We are all very fortunate to be able to help the 
              Buddha's teachings to flourish.</p>
              <p>In many Terma Padmasambhava spoke of the special characteristics of Pemako as 
              a sacred hidden land. To go there, to help the Buddha's teachings there, brings 
              great merit. Two years ago when I began this work I went to the Supreme Head of 
              the Nyingma Lineage, H.H. Minling Trichen Rinpoche, and he blessed our school 
              with the name Lhundrup Topgye Ling. This year while in America my root Lama, 
              Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche's son, also gave very strong 
              blessing for this project. So I am very lucky indeed to be doing this work.</p>
              <p>When I came to the west I met many people who wished to help and now people 
              from three continents and more than 7 countries have contributed to our noble 
              project. We have built a school where there has been no school. We have built a 
              nursery for small children and also a kitchen, which provides food for children 
              and parents. We offer clothing and medical care as well. Just this year we have 
              arranged for a medical camp to come to the region with doctors and supplies from 
              the west. This sacred area of Pemako is so remote that it receives very little 
              aide and these resources are much needed.</p>
              <p>My goal was not to merely start a school but to help the whole community 
              there thrive. Our vision must be holistic it must be very broad because we must 
              make the whole community strong in order to save these precious teachings. As 
              Buddhist we must have impartial compassion and love for all beings not only 
              those who look like us or have our nationality. For this reason we offer the 
              school, the nursery, the aide, to all people in the region both Tibetan refugees 
              and local children. In this way the school will be built on a strong foundation 
              and continue into the future after we are all gone.Â  Guru Rinpoche's 
              tradition is for everyone!</p>
              <p>Lopon P. Ogyen Ten'dzin Rinpoche comes from the family lineage of Pema Lingpa 
              and was a long a time student of Dudjom Rinpoche. He has studied with many of 
              the greatest Lamas of his generation and now strives to preserve these teachings 
              through a variety of activities. Rinpoche served as head of the Nyingma Students 
              Association at the Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies in Varanasi for many 
              years, is founder of the Boddhicitta Foundation - a non-profit aide group in 
              India and is now director of the Pemako Project in India.</p>
              <p>LHUNDRUP TOPGYE LING NGAKPA DRATSANG SCHOOL IS UNIQUE Recognizing
              interdependence: Education does not take place in a vacuum. Efforts to
              meet local needs for medical care, infant care, food and clothing
              complement the schoolâs initiative and create an environment where
              grass-roots support and community involvement insure long-term success.</p>
              <p>The school is a traditional âdratsangâ, where the spiritual, academic,
              artistic and cultural treasures of the Tibetan people are passed from
              generation to generation. Blessed and named by the Supreme Head of the
              Nyingma Lineage, H.H. Minling Trichen Rinpoche, it upholds the
              Gokar-chang-loâi-dÃ©, the culturally vital non-monastic lineage of
              ngakpas representing one of the two original streams of Buddhism in
              Tibetan history that has flourished in Tibet since the 8th century.
              Following the Chinese occupation of Tibet it is in danger of extinction
              unless efforts are made to pass it on within the Tibetan community
              outside its homeland.</p>
              <p><br> Offering aid to those who would otherwise be
              missed: Because the Pemako region is remote, little aid reaches the
              Tibetan refugee populations and the region is often ignored. Girls are
              generally denied education in order to baby-sit younger children while
              parents work the fields. The Lhundrup Topgye Ling Foundation gives
              particular importance to creating a framework conducive to the
              education of girls.</p>
              <p><br> Cultural preservation means cultural diversity: Sadly, despite the best
              of intentions, large-scale relief efforts often overlook smaller but
              vital aspects of an endangered culture. The LhundrÃ¼p TopgyÃ© Ling Ngakpa
              Dratsang School is the only school working to save the ngakpa tradition
              within the exiled Tibetan community.</p>
