              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Although female monks, or bhikkhunis, were part of Buddha’s
              original vision, Thailand’s clergy won’t allow them to become fully ordained.
              Now a 72-year-old abbess is leading the movement to give women back their
              rightful place within the religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As dawn breaks across Thailand, it brings with it one of the
              country’s most important and revered traditions. Clad in bright orange robes,
              barefoot and with their heads shaven, male monks make their morning rounds,
              receiving alms in return for simple blessings. The sight is so familiar to
              people in Thailand and around the world, it’s become iconic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But in Nakhon Pathom, from the sanctuary of a monastery set
              behind a busy highway about 30 miles (48km) west of Bangkok, one particular
              group of monks has long been denied the respect and recognition given to the
              men in orange. Now its members are rattling the country’s religious cages in
              the hopes of reviving an ancient tradition and, more importantly, regaining
              their legitimacy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Songdhammakalyani Monastery is one of Thailand’s few<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.thaibhikkhunis.org/eng2014/his.html"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">all-female monasteries</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">. Its abbess, the Venerable
              Dhammananda, 72, (formerly named Chatsumarn Kabilsingh) was the first Thai
              bhikkhuni, or female monk, to be fully ordained in the Theravada tradition, the
              most widely practiced form of Buddhism in the country. Her late mother, the
              Venerable Voramai Kabilsingh, was Thailand’s first female monk of the modern
              era.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Dhammananda and the smattering of female monks like her
              around the country are seen as troublemakers by the country’s clergy –
              insurgents intent on destroying the all-male monastic status quo. During
              Buddha’s time 2,500 years ago and for several hundred years after, bhikkhunis
              were present right across Sri Lanka and India, and were considered equal to
              their male counterparts. But by the 11th century, political turmoil and reports
              of sexual violence had effectively killed off the tradition of female Buddhist
              monks. Brandishing embedded ideas about gender roles and the strict rules around
              the requirements for ordination, officials decided that women shouldn’t be
              wearing monks’ robes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Dhammananda’s mother had made it part of her mission to push
              back against the prejudices that had stripped female monks of their rights. And
              now Dhammananda is carrying on the fight – and causing controversy – as she and
              her fellow bhikkhunis try to restore women to their rightful place in the
              country’s spiritual identity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">“When the Buddha was enlightened, and he established the
              Buddhist religion, he described the four pillars of the faith: bhikkhu,
              bhikkhuni, laymen and laywomen. This was very clear in his mind and it is
              written in the historical texts,” says Dhammananda. “So it is not about
              equality as such, it is about what’s right. We are shareholders of the faith
              and simply upholding Buddha’s original vision.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In Thailand, the full ordination of female monks is outlawed.
              Dhammananda had to go to Sri Lanka to be fully ordained, and she’s currently
              only allowed to perform first-level ordinations on women. But the ban on fully
              ordaining women comes down to a technicality. Under the dharma rules upheld by
              Thailand’s governing Buddhist council, only an unbroken lineage of bhikkhunis
              can be fully ordained. Since such a lineage no longer exists, the council argues
              that the bhikkhunis have no claim to monastic legitimacy. Officially, the
              practice of fully ordaining a woman can result in a fine or, at worst,
              imprisonment, but it rarely comes to that. Instead, bhikkhunis are tolerated,
              but considered illegitimate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">For a long time, Dhammananda wasn’t even going to be a monk.
              “Growing up, people assumed that I would follow in my mother’s path, but I
              didn’t like to be told what to do,” she says. “I married, had three sons and I
              was very happy. My life was full.” She earned a PhD in philosophy and Buddhism,
              became an accomplished author and hosted a long-running TV talk show on the
              dharma teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Then in 1983, while at a conference at Harvard University on
              women, religion and social change, Dhammananda was struck by the idea that her
              specialized knowledge of how integral women had been to Theravada Buddhism
              obliged her to act on it. “It was then that I came to a realization that I am
              the only one in Thailand who has all this information about Theravada
              bhikkhunis, about what is right and what is wrong and how to support them, but
              I’m not doing anything. I’m just sitting comfortably and that’s shame on me,”
              she says. “So I knew that the only way I could really make change was to become
              a bhikkhuni myself and set the example.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But even after her lightbulb moment at the Harvard
              conference, Dhammananda took 17 years to transition into a monk. Since Buddhist
              monks are not allowed to touch members of the opposite sex, she knew that
              starting that journey would mean pulling away from her three sons. “So I waited
              for them to grow up, I had to make sure that they were on their right path.
              Now, they tell me they are very proud,” she says. “My eldest son said he
              sacrificed his mother for the Buddha.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Dedicating her life to Buddha also meant divorcing from her
              husband. “Well of course he was resistant,” she says. “But he has a younger
              wife now, so he is okay.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It’s 6 a.m. and the village around Songdhammakalyani
              Monastery is springing to life. At a ramshackle street stall, pots of soups and
              curries are being laid out, while a disheveled couple whiz past on a motorbike.
              On the veranda of a modest house, an elderly couple wait, surrounded by
              offerings of fresh fruit, small cartons of milk and freshly boiled rice. As the
              bhikkhunis approach on their morning alms round, the couple prostrate
              themselves, flat to the floor, their palms pressed together firmly above their
              heads. The monks recite a small blessing and graciously take the offerings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">It wasn’t always this way. Dhammananda says when she was
              first ordained, only one or two houses would give the women offerings. “It was
              not uncommon to pass by households that would turn around as we approached,
              they could not face us,” she says. “They were only used to giving alms to the
              male monks, not female. But I would just bless them as I passed and hoped that
              one day maybe they would understand. Now people are much more open and
              supportive, so things have changed.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But there is still resistance. Dhammananda says she and her
              fellow bhikkhunis will keep up their steady, peaceful struggle until they are
              standing side by side with male monks, the way Buddha had always intended. “My
              strength comes from my academic background and a deep understanding of what I
              am doing and that what I am doing is correct according to the text,” she says.
              “People can attack from any corner, but I can always say, ‘Go back to the text,
              please look up this line or this page and you will see what the Buddha said.’”</span></p>
