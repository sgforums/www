              <p>Say, 6 Dharma talk per week. If a monastery got 3 Dharma Master, each one cover 2 Dharma talk per week, 2 times 3 thats 6 Dharma talk per week. One Dharma talk let it be 1 hour. Where got difficult? Okay, if 1 hour per dharma talk too long, make it 30 minutes. Thats also good. Instead of that, now, the monastery here at most only one or two Dharma talk per week... Many monastery dun even have that... Like that how to æ™®æ¸¡ä¼—ç”Ÿ? Only held æ³•ä¼š? Sianz...</p>

              <p>Its their job to give Dharma talk and help others isn't it? How can say tiring or not? If one hour of dharma talk, 3-4 times per week too tiring, make it 20-30 minutes then. No audience? Get the monastery volunteer to sit in lor. One two volunteer, thats audiences liao what. Right now, say, today. If I want to hear some Dharma talk this evening, not much choices in Singapore isn't it? See the problem we have here?</p>

              <p><br>erm not compulsory. during Buddha time, the disciples give some dharma talks when collecting alms. or when Buddha ask them to go to who ever need it. some just sit in the cave meditating. there are other form of dharma transmission. è¨€æ•™(teach by speech)is one, èº«æ•™(teach by body conduct)is another.  </p>

              <p>My local dharma teacher plans to have different dharma teachers giving talks every single day of the week (even on weekdays). Somewhere along her plan discussion she mentioned my name. I told her I don't know how to give talks... lol (but I think she was saying to take charge of the adult group, aka answer people's questions)</p>
              <p>As she said... becoming a dharma teacher is not so easy. Not only must ä¼šä¿®ï¼Œalso must ä¼šè¡Œï¼Œä¼šè®²ï¼Œä¼šå†™</p>
