This practise does not help the deceased... but rather we should put all our effort in getting the deceased be reborn in Pure Land or at least in higher realms. This is by dedicating merits to the deceased, chanting (the deceased might chant along as well if everyone chants around him), if best have a venerable speak to the dharma to the deceased.<br><br>Things like food, or giving whatsoever to him, will only cause more attachments and for a deceased person it would be best that we should let him go detached from all worldly things, tell him that everything will be taken care of, and it is time for him to leave. If one becomes too attached to worldly things, it will impede his rebirth and may in turn become a ghost.</div>
