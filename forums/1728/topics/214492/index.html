They still need translators to get their message across or understand what the other is saying. Where did you get the idea that they are not dependant on conditions? Of course, the enlightened state is not dependant on language or conditions at all. But if you want to speak the language you have to learn it what... isn't that common sense? Enlightened people still have to learn concepts in the mundane world, whether for work etc.<br><br>But a perfect Buddha is different because he is omniscient and can speak in any language and even to animals.</div>

Even after the clock and calendar changed to "year 2016", it still is NOW. There never was time, there only is NOW. Time is merely clock, measurement, analysis, comparison, relativity... etc. So sum it up, Krishnamurti says "Time is Thought".<br><br>I told you, the timeless Now is not a Now in relation to past and future. Past, future, now, never existed. The timeless Now is eternal Now, beginningless and endless.<br><br>Therefore to say you were born a particular year ago is ultimately illusory. You were never born and will never die.</div>

Does the 5 sense consciousnesses continue to function?<br><br>Anyway I was reminded of something Teacher Chen mentioned when reading your post... he taught that our everyday reactions to the external world can be summarised in four steps.<br><br>[b]1) I see a mass of things</strong><br><br>Because the 'thing' you saw is still distant away and you cannot see clearly, you also do not know that you are looking at. There is just the Sight, and it is the functioning of our Buddha Nature, Pristine Awareness. There is no mental reactions whatsoever (yet), nor labeling.<br><br><strong>2) "Wah, Money!"</strong><br><br>When we got closer to the object at the distant, we instantly recognised what it is - money. The reason why we recognised it as money is because we have seen and used the money before and many times, the currency is also familiar to us, we have planted the 'seed' of 'money' in our 8th consciousness and therefore, when the conditions are present, we spontaneously recognised it as "money".<br><br><strong>3) "I came first, this is mine"</strong><br><br>Due to our ignorance and habitual defilements, we 'personalise' the situation by making a stance that the money belongs to me, I came first, etc. Also known as 7th consciousness. There starts to be grasping and seeking, desire and lust.<br><br><strong>4) Sin committed, resulting in either landing up in jail or rebirth in hell</strong><br><br>You took away the money you are not supposed to take away and share with those around you, thereby committing a very heavy karma. The money could be used to save other people's life or for other important reasons, but somehow out of ignorance you cannot resist the temptations, and for that you will suffer karmic effects by ending up with a jail term and a horrible afterlife.<br><br>----------<br><br>So moral of the story is... do not wait until Step 4, it is too late. When 'Step 2' happens, we must instantly recognise it with mindfulness, and the thought is self-liberated. Otherwise we will go on seeking and grasping, leading to step 3, and step 4. Step 2 is the Cause/Seed, and Step 4 is the Effect. Step 1 is merely the functioning of our pristine awareness, buddha nature.[/b]</blockquote></div>

But they are too stupid to ask 'why me'.<br><br>Even if lets say a baby... his concept of self is more subtle than us, his identity is 'one with the physical world' but nevertheless very egocentric. He thinks that everyone will understand him, in a way. Because if he is such and such, others is such and such. His 'one with the physical world' is not the enlightened kind of oneness, but because his level of intelligence has not developed to the point where he could differentiate between himself and the physical world.<br><br>You need to finish reading Ken Wilber's A Brief History of Now, he discussed this. Between falcrum 1 to 9, he speaks of the differences between the level of consciousness as one ages and developes, and then at an even more advanced level (falcrum 7 onwards) transcends his self identity (i.e transpersonal consciousness), and 'falcrum 10' which is not really another state but the 'ground reality' of all states is non-duality.</div>
