I think you have met my masterÂ’s high standard for enlightenment. Love or great compassion is an indispensable element to it. As a result of our natural compassion and love, one would feel that everything is so beautiful, on would tolerate others with great capacity, one would also feel the inner aspiration to help others. ThatÂ’s the spirit of Mahayana Buddhism. Although you are not a Buddhist, but you certainly got the spirit already. But from my experience, itÂ’s not easy to maintain it for good because we are not used to it yet. So what we need to do is to trust it, get used to it, like it, keep it and sweep away all distractions.<br><br>My best.<br></div>
