            <div class='col-md body'>Right view, seeing thing as they truly are... can be explained in terms of 4 noble truths, 4 seals, 3 dharma seals, etc. When we completely understand those truths, then we will be liberated in whatever we do. Then we will have true merits because merits is not merely virtous conduct but liberated conduct. But we also must not be caught up with any views. Otherwise it will become dharma-attachment (fa3-zhi2), then that is also wrong. If we are attached to emptiness, it is also extreme because emptiness is also empty.<br><br>--------------------------<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no3c.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no3c.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'All phenomena arise by the aggregation of causes and conditions; all phenomena cease by the dispersion of causes and conditions.' How do we apply this Law of Causality?<br>Using the family to illustrate the Law of Causality, a family is established as a result of the aggregation of causes and conditions. Since the family has already been brought about by these various causes and conditions, we should therefore live peacefully and joyfully as a family. Fulfilling this positive causality for the family will leave us with no regrets in the future.<br><br>We shouldn't reckon presume that 'all forms are empty' (Buddhist philosophy that all things and phenomena are empty because they don't have an independent nature of their own.); you are 'empty', I am also 'empty' and we are all 'empty', and so we don't care about anything. This is wrong. Since all things result from aggregations of causes and conditions we must make good use of these causes and conditions.<br><br>As another example, it is only because I am here to give a Dharma talk that this bouquet of flowers has been prepared. Therefore, we should place these flowers nicely on the table so that people can appreciate them. If while we are admiring the flowers, a person comes by and declares, "Sigh, all phenomena arising from causes and conditions are empty. What use is there in having such a beautiful bouquet of flowers?" He then removes it and throws it away. This person may not be of sound mind, because by now you know about the Law of Causality, and you say that the flowers are empty. But, you are still physically here. You, as a 'person' have not emptied away! So how could you say that the flowers are empty? Therefore, you should diligently learn and practise what the Buddha taught, and cultivate. First of all empty the sentient being (i.e. the arising and ceasing of thoughts and feelings) within you, and then you will not find that things in the world are contradictory.<br><br>So from this, we see how that which is seemingly contradictory in the world, stems from failure to properly grasp the principles. <strong>Because when the principles have not been correctly understood, there cannot be coherence in their application to matters of the world.</strong> This leads to lack of roundedness and harmony in the way we deal with things.</span><br><br></div>

I think Padmasambhava is reminding us not to get lost in conduct, thinking that there is "something truly virtuous" to adopt and "something truly nonvirtuous" to abandon in our conduct/actions. This means, while we are adopting virtues and abandoning nonvirtuous we should bear the View of Emptiness in mind, that NO truly existing person is performing any truly existing action towards any truly existing party.<br><br>However, having embraced this View of Emptiness, as what Longchen said, we should not think that we don't need to care about performing virtuous or nonvirtuous actions, because for us the unenlightened beings, we're still bound by karma. So though aware of the "lack of an inherent truly existing nature" of virtues and nonvirtues, we should still try to adopt virtuous behaviour and abandon nonvirtuous behaviour.<br><br>Thanks for all the sharing Longchen, Sinwei and Eternal Now. I found it kinda surprising and very interesting that diff pple have diff interpretations. I believe such sharings can help all of us sharpen our understanding of the Dharma and motivate one another to apply and actualize them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
