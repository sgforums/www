              <p>I personally think AEN's answer can elaborated further.</p>
              <p>All Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are given the highest respect and admiration by all sentient beings, especially those who truly understand the all their virtues and efforts made in delivering all sentient beings from endless cycles of birth and death.</p>
              <p>All Buddha and Bodhisattvas do not crave a single bit, the worldly status and power enjoyed by or entitled to kings, rulers, CEO, etc.</p>
              <p>Hence when Buddhists say Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are higher than all worldly kings and rulers, this actually means that their great virtues, their countless skilful means used in helping all sentient beings to attain true and ultimate bliss, places them above all known titles of power and authority. This is the kind of status given out of utmost respect and admiration for their countless contributions to serving all sentient beings. This is not something any human can attain by birth, academic or any worldly achievements known to man.</p>
              <p>The above is my own personal understanding from what I learnt so far from talks in audio-visual formats and books by Venerables and the Buddhist community.</p>
              <p>I may be wrong in my understanding, so if there's any one who has a correct and much better understanding and explanation of the above issue, I would be most happy to learn from him/her.</p>

              <p>May I elaborate a little on AEN's answer. The above proclamation by the Buddha as soon as he was born, was actually done so in praise of the Buddha nature in all of us. Essentially speaking, in Buddhism, there is no highest, lowest, or any absolute comparisons. For all things, in its innermost nature, are 'empty' of self and ego; meaning they are <strong>not</strong> permanent, unchanging states or bodies with strong and fixed notion of 'I', 'You' and 'Me'.</p>
              <p>Hence the "I" that is used by the Buddha in the above quote and in all the teachings he taught, refers to the true <strong>Awakened</strong> state of mind, which is free from ego, greed, anger, hatred or unwholesome views towards life and the workings of Cause and Effect.</p>

              <p>This 2 quote isnt it what most buhddist have heard of?</p>
              <p>Apply it to the topic and give some thinking, so is it that important in ranking since dharma says all being is equal. We are not different from our status, physical appearance and.. but by our character and heart.</p>
              <p>So since the above 2 quotes have rendered the purpose of topic meaningless, so why not say we are all the same.</p>
              <p>We respect buhdda for who he is</p>
              <p>You say he is big, but is he really big? You say he is weak but is he really weak.( we know ourself best like buhdda never need pple to say he is good, he know himself well enough )</p>
              <p>Lol, really amusing when pple start bringing in ranking and stuff to buhddism. It only add on to your suffering which is not accordance to the purpose of buhddism.</p>
              <p>Buhddism is not about karma and stuff but about relieving from suffering. If you cant see the point, no point wasting time.</p>
              <p>I think buhddism is great but i am not great enough for it.</p>

              <p>" Emptiness is a form, Form is empty "</p>
              <p>" To exist or not to exist have no difference "</p>
              <p>This 2 quote isnt it what most buhddist have heard of?</p>
              <p>Apply it to the topic and give some thinking, so is it that
                  important in ranking since dharma says all being is equal. We are
                  not different from our status, physical appearance and.. but by our
                  character and heart.</p>
              <p>So since the above 2 quotes have rendered the purpose of topic
                  meaningless, so why not say we are all the same.</p>
              <p>We respect buhdda for who he is</p>
              <p>You say he is big, but is he really big? You say he is weak but
                  is he really weak.( we know ourself best like buhdda never need
                  pple to say he is good, he know himself well enough )</p>
              <p>Lol, really amusing when pple start bringing in ranking and
                  stuff to buhddism. It only add on to your suffering which is not
                  accordance to the purpose of buhddism.</p>
              <p>Buhddism is not about karma and stuff but about relieving from
                  suffering. If you cant see the point, no point wasting time.</p>
              <p>I think buhddism is great but i am not great enough for it.</p>

              <p>Buddha is the greatest in terms of perfections of virtues, wisdom, liberation.</p>
              <p>All Aryas are worthy of veneration because they have become liberated from Samsara (and most of us have not), and among the Aryas (enlightened beings) the Buddha is the highest because he has accomplished all virtues and skillful means.</p>
