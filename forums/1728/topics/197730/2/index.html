It had been widely expected to protest his visit. Beijing responded to the Dalai Lama's 2002 visit to Mongolia by cutting off rail links for two days.<br><br>But asked whether China was planning a new protest, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Ulan Bator referred reporters to a statement issued Monday night by the Mongolian Foreign Ministry describing the Dalai Lama's visit as a "purely religious matter and nonpolitical."<br><br>"We do not have any additional statements or comments on the issue at present," said the spokesman, who declined to give his name as is common practice among Chinese bureaucrats.<br><br>That stance appeared to indicate a wait-and-see attitude to the visit _ the seventh to Mongolia by the Dalai Lama since 1979 _ a likely result of Mongolia's efforts to keep the weeklong trip low-key.<br><br>Organizers didn't publicize the visit until last week and have kept the Dalai Lama's schedule under tight wraps. He is being housed at a secluded guest house 45 miles from the capital and much of his time here will be spent in closed meetings with local Buddhist clergy hoping to settle factional disputes.<br><br>China routinely calls on countries not to let the Dalai Lama visit, often hinting at possible diplomatic or commercial retaliation. Communist Party newspapers this month have criticized such trips as an effort to rally anti-China forces and realize Tibetan independence.<br><br>Beijing claims to have ruled Tibet for centuries, though the country was effectively independent when communist troops arrived in 1950.<br><br>The Dalai Lama fled to India following an abortive 1959 uprising against Chinese rule. A recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, he travels widely as a speaker on religion and morality and a representative of Tibetan culture.<br><br>Earlier Tuesday, the Dalai Lama arrived at the temple, smiling and waving to the crowd, many of whom held up silk scarves as a sign of greeting. A group of elderly women chanted Buddhist scripture while other visitors spun prayer wheels.<br><br>The Dalai Lama then entered an inner compound where he walked up a yellow silk carpet beneath a yellow parasol amid swirling incense smoke as monks blew trumpets and crashed cymbals. Entering a prayer hall, he mounted a raised dais while bowing monks chanted, receiving food offerings and bestowing blessings.<br><br>"Every time he visits, he brings good fortune to Mongolia," said Baamba, a retiree who like many Mongolians uses just one name.<br><br>Mongolians have strong historical links to Tibet and have traditionally followed Tibet's esoteric, or Tantric, school of Buddhism. A 16th-century Mongolian king is thought to have bestowed the first Dalai Lama title _ a designation which means "Ocean of Wisdom." In 1904, the 13th Dalai Lama took refuge in Mongolia, a landlocked nation sandwiched between China and Russia, when the British invaded Lhasa, Tibet's capital.<br><br>On Wednesday, the Dalai Lama was due to lecture to a public audience in Ulan Bator's main stadium.<br></div>

The Buddhist spiritual leader, who arrived in Vancouver Thursday for a three-day visit, said the force that brings the deepest satisfaction to the world is the tender embrace between mother and newborn child.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/picture/upload/dl-premier.jpg"><br><strong>The Dalai Lama shares a moment with Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan at city hall on Thursday.<br>Photograph by : Bill Keay, Vancouver Sun</strong><br><br>"I am now 71 years old [but] I feel, still, deep in my mind, my first experience, my mother's care. I can still feel it," the Dalai Lama told a small audience at city hall, after a private meeting with Mayor Sam Sullivan.<br><br>"That immediately gives me inner peace, inner calmness," he added.<br><br>The challenge in modern society is to hang on to that deep sense of connection later in life. "When we grow up, when our brain develops, then our intelligence causes short-sightedness," he said. "And I think also the influence of the environment [plays a role]: then aggressiveness, fear, jealousy, anger, frustration -- these things arise, and [cause our potential to] become submerged."<br><br>The Dalai Lama said his No. 1 priority is to promote this quality of human bonding, a force he calls "human value."<br><br>"After birth, our first experience is mother's affection," he said. "Mother's care. The child at that time, just after birth, may not have the idea 'This is my mother.' But [will have a connection] because of the biological system or need, feeding, relying on that person. And on the mother's side there is also that sort of tremendous feeling of care -- and with that milk, also comes [the connection]. This is not due to religious faith, but because of the biological factor. That is the basis of our life breath, how our life started.<br><br>"So, now the time has come, I feel, that as a result of discussion -- of exchange, different ideas, different views -- and as a result of listening to others' problems, and noticing the global-level problems, including terrorism, I feel, if we make more effort to sustain our basic value, I think humanity may become more peaceful. More compassionate. As a result, differences can be easily solved through dialogue. Through talk. Through mutual understanding. So that is my number-one commitment: the promotion of human value."<br><br>The Nobel Peace Prize laureate is in Vancouver for three days of public discussions and events around the inauguration of an education centre being built here in his honour. During his first stop, at city hall, he answered a wide range of questions with humility, insight and humour.<br><br>Smiling at a mannerly scrum of reporters and photographers, the Dalai Lama expressed his admiration for the media, and then grinning broadly, explained how he often says that reporters should have long noses like an elephant's, miming a long trunk-like proboscis that gently snuffled at his interpreter's elbow. "[You need a nose like this to] smell everywhere, he said to sustained laughter. "I think, with respect [to Mayor Sullivan], you should use it to smell politicians, mayors, prime ministers, religious heads, businessmen, scientists. I think everywhere. I think we should know the reality."<br><br>The 14th Dalai Lama was awarded honourary Canadian citizenship this summer, a rare distinction granted only twice before -- to Nelson Mandela and Swedish diplomat and Second World War war hero Raoul Wallenberg.<br><br>At the time, the Chinese government made its disapproval clear, with a sharp comment from an embassy official in Ottawa. "We said that Dalai Lama is a separatist, so I don't think he should be honoured with that," Chinese diplomat Zang Wei-dong said. "That will harm the Canadian image and also harm the relationship between China and Canada."<br><br>The Dalai Lama, who left Tibet with a 100,000 followers in 1959 to establish a government-in-exile in India, was asked about those comments.<br><br>He suggested that China's bark in this regard is sometimes worse that its bite, citing a situation where Norway was criticized for its dealings with him. "I think on one occasion . . . the Chinese government made some serious protest. But then afterward, not much consequence," he said.<br><br>"But, I'm very sorry. Wherever I go, it always creates some inconvenience. I'm very sorry. But hopefully, not [by] my mistake."<br><br>He drew more laughter when he wondered aloud what the rights and privileges of being an honourary Canadian might include, because, he said, smiling, he didn't want to miss out on any.<br><br>He turned serious when he said that being an honourary Canadian made him feel as if he were being treated like a brother by Canadians. "Actually, entire six billion human beings are brothers, sisters. You have to share, our common world, our one world.<br><br>"I think the time has come: We must educate in that respect. These quarrels here and there, in the name of religion, in the name of different races, different countries, different political system, economic system. Fighting [is] useless. Suicide."<br><br>Before China exerted its territorial claim to the ancient mountain kingdom, the Dalai Lama was considered by his subjects to be a god-king, the living embodiment of compassion in the world. His struggle to preserve Tibetan culture was taken up 40 years ago by the late George and Ingeborg Woodcock, two prominent Vancouver intellectuals. He has made three previous visits here, in 1980, 1993 and 2004.<br><br>Since taking up exile in Dharamsala, India, in 1959, the Dalai Lama has made education a priority, both to preserve Tibetan culture against a dangerous and uncertain future; and as a way to reach out to the world.<br><br>Of Tibet's current population of 300,000, about 200,000 are ethnic Chinese, resettled there by China, since 1959. "That means we have already become a minority," the Dalai Lama said. "As a result those Tibetans in the towns, in their daily life, they use Chinese language more, in shops, in restaurants, in addition to the government official language. On every occasion they have to speak Chinese. And then music, songs, also now more Chinese. Also, I've heard that Tibetans are very fond of Indian popular songs. So their way of life and also their [cuisine], eventually their mentality, their way of thinking, these are changing.<br><br>"So usually I [say], whether intentionally or unintentionally, some kind of cultural genocide is taking place.<br><br>With what he sees as a decline in the moral authority of organized religion in the West and in the effectiveness of the family, the Dalai Lama believes it is up to schools to look after the spirit of warm-heartedness he advocates.<br><br>"In modern times, the influence of the church has a little bit declined," he said. "And family value also [is] declining. So now education institutions should take full responsibility, not only for brain development but also for morals and ethics."<br><br>The challenge comes when the development of a young person's ethical outlook becomes tied up with religious belief. "The question [then] is what religion [to chose]," he says. "Difficulties. And also, frankly speaking, there are quite a substantial number of non-believers. So I think the mistake is that those people who have not much interest in religion are also negligent about the value of spiritual qualities such as love, compassion, forgiveness, these things.<br><br>"So we must now find a different way, on the basis of scientific findings and our common experiences. I think that on this basis we can educate. [Certainly] brain development very important. [But also] warm-heartedness, is extremely important. Otherwise [you will find] a very educated, very brilliant person, but deep inside a very unhappy person. And also billionaires, or leaders, big power, big money, good education, big fame. But as an individual person, very unhappy."<br><br>"Sufficient money, sufficient power, sufficient affairs, sufficient friends, but still unhappy. Why? Something is wrong here."<br><br></div>

Shouldn't we be paying more attention to elevating motherhood as the most sacred profession? And if we make motherhood the most sacred profession on our planet, is there hope for world peace?" he asked, to thunderous applause.<br><br>"Long-term, that's the answer to deal with violence. Violence is usually motivated by hate, anger, fear, so the opposite of these emotions are compassion," replied His Holiness, with a smile.<br><br>Later that day, the Dalai Lama graciously accepted his honourary Canadian citizenship in front of a sell-out crowd of 12,000 at GM Place.<br><br>The Dalai Lama now joins African leader Nelson Mandela and Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg as the third recipient of an honourary Canadian citizenship.<br><br>Presented with a scroll to mark the occasion by federal immigration minister Monte Solberg, His Holiness expressed eagerness to discover the benefits of being a Canadian citizen, but if it also meant taking on more responsibilities, he'd have to give it back, he said with an infectious laugh and beaming smile.<br><br></div>

Also among the throng of Tinseltown executives and luminaries were Robert Downey Junior and Laurence Fishburne.<br><br>Speaking in English and with the help of a translator at times, the Dalai Lama urged his audience to consider making a biopic on the life of Buddha. Hollywood has the power to affect the world through cinema and spread compassion, His Holiness told them. "From Buddha's life story, maybe you'll get inspiration. Our intention is not the propagation of Buddhism, but helping the world."<br><br>After the lunch Sharon hosted a screening of the film Milarepa for another holy man, Lama Neten Chokling.

Illustration for TIME by Michelle Chang</strong><br><br><strong>New York, USA</strong> -- In its issue, Vol. 168, No. 20, dated November 13, 2006, Time said, "The most tumultuous decades of the most populous continent on earth have produced an astonishing array of heroes." "In this special anniversary issue, we pay tribute to the remarkable men and women who have shaped these times," it continued.<br><br>Time listed the heroes in five categories: Nation Builders; Artists and Thinkers; Business leaders; Athletes and Explorers; and Inspirations. The Dalai Lama is listed under the Inspirations category. Tenzing Norgay, the ethnic Tibetan, who ascended Mount Everest with Edmund Hillary in 1953, is listed under the Athletes and Explorers category.<br><br>Time had special writers report on each of the more than 50 heroes that they had listed. The essay on the Dalai Lama is written by Deepak Chopra, the popular writer and speaker on spirituality. Chopra writes, "It's the fate of great spiritual leaders to be both lighthouses and lightning rods.<br><br>No one has endured this double act more gracefully than the Dalai Lama. As a lighthouse he represents Buddhism for most of the world outside Asia.<br><br>Welcomed everywhere but in his own homeland, revered beyond the narrow limits of sectarianism, his visits bring out throngs of people. What they crave is his presence and his peacefulness. He travels the globe to remind us of our better selves. Yet the presence of the Dalai Lama is also immediate and worldly. He's the lightning rod for Tibet, and a symbol of its subjugation under Beijing's rule. As long as that injustice persists, the Dalai Lama will remain peaceful and poignant at the same time."<br><br>Following is the full text of Deepak Chopra's essay.

With remarkable subtlety, he teaches patience, humility and compassion By Deepak Chopra<br><br>It's the fate of great spiritual leaders to be both lighthouses and lightning rods. No one has endured this double act more gracefully than the Dalai Lama. As a lighthouse he represents Buddhism for most of the world outside Asia. Welcomed everywhere but in his own homeland, revered beyond the narrow limits of sectarianism, his visits bring out throngs of people. What they crave is his presence and his peacefulness. He travels the globe to remind us of our better selves. Yet the presence of the Dalai Lama is also immediate and worldly. He's the lightning rod for Tibet, and a symbol of its subjugation under Beijing's rule. As long as that injustice persists, the Dalai Lama will remain peaceful and poignant at the same time.<br><br>Over the centuries, Buddhism has spread more quietly than any other faith or philosophy. In that quietist tradition, the current Dalai Lama stands firm. Buddha said, "Whoever sees me sees the teaching, and whoever sees the teaching sees me." Whenever I have the privilege of sitting with the Dalai Lama, I feel that I am, indeed, seeing the teaching - and that it sees me. Benign as His Holiness is, one senses detachment, which isn't the same as indifference. This is a detachment born of immense patience. It's rooted in a deep belief in the power of consciousness. No one I've ever met is so involved in the material world without actually believing in it.<br><br>He is also insidious, if you can use that word about such an innocent man. If you ask his opinion, he invariably murmurs, "Ah, I'd rather listen to you." Instantly you feel a bit of your own egotism fall away, and, despite yourself, the presence of humility is felt deep inside.<br><br>So I salute the Dalai Lama as a great spiritual seducer. We will never know how much he has changed the world - and us - because we never see it coming until the change has already occurred. He is a time bomb of compassion, and that is the source of his greatness.<br><br></div>
