            <div class='col-md body'>I don't mean everyone is stupid and I am clever. Stupid people include me because I am not enlightened yet. In fact I wrote this partly to myself as a reminder. But just to share some of the things my dharma teacher said.. I recall from memory so many things will not be accurate.<br><br>Every lifetime we are the same person in the movie, but the characters revolving around us are constantly changing. Different story, same main character. Who asked you to come into this life? Nobody, you came here yourself. Since you came here, you should be willing to accept our life as it is. If you suffer, then it is 'huo2 gai1'.. What's worse, we are so ignorant. We are so caught up in relationships. When we are born, our parents soon teach us to call 'pa pa', 'ma ma', 'ge ge'. Then we plant the seed of name and forms of our parents in our consciousness and become deeply attached, and the next time we recognise 'pa pa', 'ma ma', 'ge ge' and so on. Then later our parents pass away, we become extremely sad because the form of our parents has passed away. The same goes to all the other people and the things we are attached on. All these are due to our ignorance and attachment to names and forms.<br><br>Some people may say, isn't that 'lack of feelings'? But do you know the person you love today, you will not recognise or remember him in your next life? You will simply walk pass each other without even recognising each other. You will be caught up in another cycle, another story, another drama with the same main character (you) but different people revolving around you. If you could remember your past lives, you will find it an extremely boring show. It is like a never ending drama. But each time a new chapter starts we completely forgot the last one. Nothing could be more boring as repeating the cycles of rebirth again and again. Yet people are still so caught up in them. If people persist in their old ways, they will be bound to continue to be trapped in the miseries of life and the sufferings of samsara. The enlightened person is different, he is free from the miseries of samsara and can even access your past lives. He will know which realm another person comes from the last life. They will know what are the conditions and affinity you had with them and will be able to help that person be liberated.<br><br>Therefore I think we all should practise the ways of Bodhisattva. Their love is not the limited sentient love based on their own personal feelings and attachments but the great unconditional love for all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>(part 2)</strong><br><br>Many of us have excuses, and continue to have excuses for not practising the dharma. For example when someone asks us to start learning the buddhadharma and practising, we may say, no, I am so busy now and I have to take care of my children who are very young. Then when the children have grown a little older you say, now I have to take care of my children because they are having exams. After the children graduated and finished their education, you say, I don't have time now.. I'm preparing for my children's marraige, they are in a relationship now and are going to be married soon. Then after the children got married, they tell us "I think now is the time.... your children have already finished their education and are happily married, you should be free". But we may say.. "No, now I am even busier than ever, my children has given birth to many grand-children and I have to take care of them"<br><br>Then what? Your life has about to reach an end and there is no more time for you to practise anymore. No more hope <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> This is all full of stupid excuses. Whatever we are doing, there is absolutely no excuse for us not to learn the dharma and practise. Buddhist practice is also not merely chanting or meditation although we should try our best to find time for that. But essentially, the dharma is not separate from our daily lives.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Those who see worldly life as an obstacle to Dharma<br>see no Dharma in everyday actions.<br>They have not yet discovered that<br>there are no everyday actions outside of Dharma.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dogen</span></div></blockquote>And we really have to practise now because if not now, we never will. And we may not even live to see another day.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Life Is Uncertain</strong><br><br>One day, Buddha questioned a number of his students,<br><br>"How long can a human life be certain?"<br>One of the students answered, "For a few days."<br>Buddha replied, "No, you have not yet understood life."<br>Buddha then repeated,<br><br>"How long can a human life be certain?"<br>Another student answered, "For a meal."<br>Again, Buddha replied, "No, you have not understood life either."<br>Buddha repeated one third time,<br><br>"How long can a human life be certain?"<br>A third student answered, "Only for a breath."<br>Buddha praised, "Great! You've started to understand life."[/quote]<br><br>Seriously ponder, would anything you do or think, or your worries and problems, matter at all a century from now? Life is only at most a few decades. Don't waste it and regret at the last moment. Life and death is an important matter. If you are not liberated now, don't expect to be liberated at death. The chances are much harder. Know what is priority, those that you can bring to the next life are priority, not those that only last a few decades.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">"To find a buddha, all you have to do is see your nature. Your nature is the buddha. And the buddha is the person who's free, free of plans, free of cares. If you don't see your nature and run around all day looking somewhere else, you'll never find a buddha. The truth is there's nothing to find. Life and death are important. Don't suffer them in vain. There's no advantage in deceiving yourself. Even if you have mountains of jewels and as many servants as there are grains of sand along the Ganges, you see them when your eyes are open. But what about when your eyes are shut? You should realize that everything you see is like a dream or illusion."<br><br>--Bodhidharma </div></blockquote>Meanwhile, of course, we must continue to engage in what is necessary in life, and practise the dharma in the midst of living. But just do not become lost in material pursuits.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">By all means attend to your duties. Action, in which you are not<br>emotionally involved and which is beneficial and does not cause<br>suffering will not bind you. You may be engaged in several directions<br>and work with enormous zest, yet remain inwardly free and quiet, with<br>a mirror like mind, which reflects all, without being affected. (50)<br><br>- Nisargadatta Maharaj</div></blockquote>In reality there are only 4 things that can be brought over to the next life. They are Wisdom, Blessings (fu2 de2), Cause and Conditions (yin1 yuan2), and Karmic Strength. Therefore to cultivate Zhi4 (Wisdom), Fu (Blessings), Yin Yuan (cause and conditions) is most important.<br><br>More info, see: <a href="http://www.humanbliss.com.sg/knowledge_article_details.asp?articleNo=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanbliss.com.sg/knowledge_article_details.asp?articleNo=14</a><br><br>Click on 'Xia Zai' (download), and read from page 10 to 24.</div>

One will also begin to see the illusoriness, dream-like and transiency of worldly phenomena.<br><br>When one becomes angry.. observe the anger without labeling. You do not have to deny the anger, but observe. Just observe it like you observe any other things, without reacting or analysing the content of the anger.<br><br><blockquote>When you fully experience any negative emotion, with no story, it instantaneously ceases to be. If you think you are fully experiencing an emotion and it remains quite intense, then recognize that there is still some story being told about it - how bit it is, how you will never be able to get rid of it, how it will always come back, how dangerous it is to experience it. Whatever the story of the moment may be, the possibilities of postponing direct experience are endless.<br><br>For instance, when you are irritated, the usual tendency is to do something to get rid of the irritation or to place blame either on yourself or someone or something else as the cause of irritation. Then the storylines around the irritation begin to develop. It is actually possible to do nothing with the irritation, to not push it out of awareness or try to get rid of it, but to directly experience it. In the moment that irritation arises, it is possible to simply be completely, totally, and freely irritated, without expressing it or repressing it. ~ Gangaji</blockquote><blockquote>One of the most common expressions of violence is anger. When my wife or sister is attacked I say I am righteously angry; when my country is attacked, my ideas, my principles, my way of life, I am righteously angry. I am also angry when my habits are attacked or my petty little opinions. When you tread on my toes or insult me I get angry, or if you run away with my wife and I get jealous, that jealousy is called righteous because she is my property. And all this anger is morally justified. But to kill for my country is also justified. So when we are talking about anger, which is a part of violence, do we look at anger in terms of righteous and unrighteous anger according to our own inclinations and environmental drive, or do we see only anger? Is there righteous anger ever? Or is there only anger? There is no good influence or bad influence, only influence, but when you are influenced by something which doesn't suit me I call it an evil influence.<br><br>The moment you protect your family, your country, a bit of coloured rag called a flag, a belief, an idea, a dogma, the thing that you demand or that you hold, that very protection indicates anger. So can you look at anger without any explanation or justification, without saying, `I must protect my goods', or `I was right to be angry', or `How stupid of me to be angry'? Can you look at anger as if it were something by itself? Can you look at it completely objectively, which means neither defending it nor condemning it? Can you?<br><br>Can I look at you if I am antagonistic to you or if I am thinking what a marvellous person you are? I can see you only when I look at you with a certain care in which neither of these things is involved. Now, can I look at anger in the same way, which means that I am vulnerable to the problem, I do not resist it, I am watching this extraordinary phenomenon without any reaction to it?<br><br>----------------<br><br>To investigate the fact of your own anger you must pass no judgement on it, for the moment you conceive of its opposite you condemn it and therefore you cannot see it as it is. When you say you dislike or hate someone that is a fact, although it sounds terrible. If you look at it, go into it completely, it ceases, but if you say, `I must not hate; I must have love in my heart', then you are living in a hypocritical world with double standards. To live completely, fully, in the moment is to live with what is, the actual, without any sense of condemnation or justification - then you understand it so totally that you are finished with it. When you see clearly the problem is solved. ~ J.Krishnamurti</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion is that it's easy to put all in theory, but when it comes to putting in practice in our daily life, we are very much at the mercy of our "attachment".  Why I said so? Maybe to use one exampled listed by AEN.  We formed attachment towards our parents, our siblings friends and so on.  When they eventually pass on, no body in this present era will not feel the effect of that attachment when they have to send the body of their love ones to the crematorium.  Some will show their emotions, some won't .  But those who won't doesn't necessary means that they have learnt how to let go.<br><br>I have friends who have love ones battling against cancer, and some of them are walking towards the end of their lifespan.  While watching their love ones wilther away, it's not hard to feel the effect of Bu She De.<br><br>The real test is not when one explicitely spell out in theory, rather, when the actual incident happens.  So if you thought you have attained that, think again.  Cos when the time comes, can you really let go?</div>

Why I said so? Maybe to use one exampled listed by AEN.  We formed attachment towards our parents, our siblings friends and so on.  When they eventually pass on, no body in this present era will not feel the effect of that attachment when they have to send the body of their love ones to the crematorium.  Some will show their emotions, some won't .  But those who won't doesn't necessary means that they have learnt how to let go.<br><br>I have friends who have love ones battling against cancer, and some of them are walking towards the end of their lifespan.  While watching their love ones wilther away, it's not hard to feel the effect of Bu She De.<br><br>The real test is not when one explicitely spell out in theory, rather, when the actual incident happens.  So if you thought you have attained that, think again.  Cos when the time comes, can you really let go?</div></blockquote>i felt worse when my grandmother was being tortured by cancer. I was kinda glad when she finally died when i was 11. i didnt feel anything when she was sent for burning because she was already dead so she wont feel the pain of the burning and i wasnt planning to hug her corpse to sleep every night.</div>
