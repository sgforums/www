              <p>Here is the fast divination technique using a mala.<br><br>You
              visualize the deity Manjushri and pray one japa of the mantra.
              You then hold the mala in your lap, and with each hand grasp a bead at
              random. You then count off in threes, moving the hands toward each
              other, until one, two, or three beads remain. You do this three times.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">One remaining bead is called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Falcon</span>.
              If you have a Falcon on your first round, it indicates support from
              protectors, luck in new endeavors, and success in lawsuits. If you have
              a Falcon on the second round, this indicates general good luck, with
              small risk of misfortune. If you have a Falcon on the third round
              indicates expected guests will arrive imminently, or you will have news
              of them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Two beads remaining is called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Raven</span>.
              A Raven on the first round means little support from the protectors,
              nothing can be accomplished, lawsuits will be unsuccessful, and enemies
              have the upper hand. A Raven on the second round indicates serious
              illness and a decline in force. Things will be lost or stolen. A Raven
              on the third round indicates bad luck for travelers, and sicknesses
              will not be cured.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">Three beads remaining is called <span style="font-weight: bold;">Snow Lion.</span> A Snow Lion on the first round indicates middling support from the
              protectors, slow accomplishment, and weak enemies. This is generally a
              neutral result. A Snow Lion on the second round indicates dangers to
              health that could nevertheless be resolved. Things lost or stolen can
              be found. A Snow Lion on the third round indicates late arrival for
              travellers, and some difficulty finding the right treatment for illness</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">So, what is the conventional wisdom about the Iron Tiger?</span></span><br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"> <br> </span></span><br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">The folk
              astrology of Tibet indicates that Tigers in general are brave, daring,
              ferocious, intelligent, and often audacious, with a tendency toward
              harsh speech and risk taking, i.e. gambling and business adventures.
              The ideal companions are those born in the year of the Dog, Horse, and
              Pig. Those to avoid are born in the year of Ox, Monkey, and to a lesser
              degree, Snake. Many people will try to have sons this year.<br> </span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">In particular,
              Iron Tigers are generous to the poor, and protective of the underdog,
              but can become wrathful and bloody minded, and without moral
              instruction may become fond of killing. </span></span><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">Somebody
              better tell Jamgon Kongtrul II, and Orgyen Thinley Dorje -- to give but
              two examples-- both Tigers, but neither of whom were or are bloody
              minded and fond of killing, as far as anyone knows.</span></span><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;"> </span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">Iron Tigers
              greatly enjoy meat, alcohol, the opposite sex, and comfortable living
              circumstances. They speak directly, with an authoritarian air of
              command. They are  to some extent vulnerable to haunting spirits (<em>bstan</em>) and <em>gyalpos</em>,  particularly those <em>gyalpos</em> associated with knives and other weapons. They will have two to four
              children. Their average lifespan is sixty years. They will face five
              major obstacles. </span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">Iron Tiger dharma
              practitioners are known to be highly stable and extremely faithful,
              with unusual powers that are expressed in unconventional ways. As such,
              their actions are often liable to misinterpretation. </span></span><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">They
              have the potential to exist in this lifetime as reborn spirits, i.e.
              they were not precisely human in their immediately previous lifetime.
              In the lifetimes prior to that, they were kings or princes, and in most
              lifetimes previous to that, they were siddhas, acharyas, or wandering
              yogis. In this lifetime, they are often characterized by wide learning
              and extreme intelligence. However, they may be prone to
              procrastination, and indecision brought on by physical ailments.<br> </span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">As 2010 is the
              fourth of a five year run of inauspicious element combinations for
              Tigers, (2011 will be incredibly troublesome) one is advised to take
              practice to heart. Speaking very personally, I would recommend that
              Tigers <em>vigorously save the lives of beings otherwise marked for death</em>.
              I would also recommend the creation of images, printing of dharma
              books, and other good works. In particular,  and at all costs, one
              should cause at least one statue of Shakyamuni Buddha to be made. If
              conditions permit, Tigers should seriously consider going into retreat
              until 2012 at the earliest. What is wrong with that? </span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">If you are born
              in the Year of the Iron Tiger, you are in the closing chapters of an
              extremely troublesome Mercury-Ketu transit, but if you survive, you are
              at the threshold of an extremely auspicious run of good luck. The
              operative word in that last sentence is "if." In Tibetan astrology, the
              Mercury-Ketu transit is described as "certain death." Of course, as an
              Iron Tiger, you don't care, but let me say the beginning of the
              transit, circa 2006, while no picnic, had the elements showing mercy.
              For the end of the transit, which begins now, the elements show no
              mercy. Are you impressed yet? </span></span><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">Again
              and again, I want to emphasize that spiritual practice throws all
              astrological indications to the winds. This is why even very great
              lamas go into retreat for obstacle years, and live to tell the tale. </span></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">You should also
              be aware that people who have formerly been good friends may turn into
              bitter enemies. I hate to say this, but Iron Tigers have an
              astrological propensity to fall victim to murder. </span></span><span style="color: red;"><span style="color: black;">Stay
              away from weapons of all kinds: indeed, be extremely careful of sharp
              instruments such as knives, axes, saws, and so forth. Taking this
              energy as a clue, all persons should beware of accidents, misadventure,
              assault, robbery, and so forth in this wild year of sudden surprises.</span></span></p>
