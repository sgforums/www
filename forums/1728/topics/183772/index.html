            <div class='col-md body'>I won't post anymore in this topic, this will be my last.<br><br>Falungong is actually not a religion, it is just a Qigong practice and even more powerful than Qigong, because they don't practise qi but practise gong.<br><br>Gong means divine energy, qi means energy. Qi is everywhere, and only practised by mortals.<br><br>Buddhas, great Buddhist masters who live in mountains, some hundred or more years old, they all practise gong, not qi. People who practise qi will still age and die, like normal mortals. I am not saying FG (Falungong) learners won't die, what I am saying is they practise something more powerful than qigong.<br><br>People with super power, such as able to extinguish candle metres away, have coarse gong developed from refined qi, this requires years of practice. But FG straightway practice gong, but superpowers are all locked as using superpowers is doing bad deeds in society.<br><br>Qi indeed can move from one place to another, and appears in living beings, even in rocks, but many great saints, including taoist immortals don't possess qi, because qi is actually useless, these people have gong, or divine energy. With divine energy, divine powers, some innate, some given by masters, are strengthened. That's is why imortals, saints and sages have dvine and righteous powers.<br><br>But there are also demons, animals, spirits and others who possess superpower, I won't go into detail already...that's all.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">URL removed by AEN as it is not allowed in our forum.

Meaning we do not allow people to post URLs here. Similarly, of course, we do not allow Christian, Muslim, Hindu flooding of their own URLs in our forum, because they are Non-Buddhist. Falungong does <strong>NOT</strong> claim to be Buddhism, and we do not recognise it to be Buddhism.<br><br>Does that mean we have prejudices against non-Buddhist? Nope. It simply means that there is clear distinct differences with their teachings, and this forum is the wrong place for them to post their own things here.<br><br>I think you are being too paranoid, seeing little things as a direct insult to you.</div>
