              <p>1) Since all of us already inherit perfect Buddha Nature, but is only temporarily obscured like clouds (i.e. ignorance) covering the bright sun, all of us will eventually reveal it fully and attain full enlightenment.</p>
              <p>2) Hell is a realm of various sufferings, one of the 3 lower realms, and rebirth there is due to the fruition of unwholesome, bad karma. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraka_(Buddhism)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraka_(Buddhism)</a></p>
              <p>3) Nothing of the 6 realms is eternal, whether hell or heaven, or ghost, animal, human, asura realms. All are temporal and all have finite lifespan in samsara.</p>
              <p>4) It is a Chinese myth, not Buddhist.</p>
              <p>5) Rebirth happens according to one's karma. It is a fruition of our karma. There is no divine judgment and punishment in Buddhism, only the natural result of causes and conditionings.</p>

              <p>A sidenote about nirvana and 'eternity'... what is sometimes said as "eternity" of nirvana
                                                                              should not be conceptualised as eternal in the sense of time, it does
                                                                              not mean infinite duration of time. Rather, Nirvana is TIMELESS.
                                                                              Nirvana is beyond time and space. In reality time is only relative
                                                                              truths, it works by measurement. It seems real due to the notion of a
                                                                              persisting self or observer (which is an illusion), and with the
                                                                              arising of the notion of a separate observer one observes and measures changes to
                                                                              'objects' which are perceived as external to 'oneself' as if they have inherent existence and are
                                                                              happening and persisting in time... thus giving rise to the notion of time and movement.</p>
              <p>But once ultimate reality
                                                                              is realised and one sees through the illusion of a separate
                                                                              self/observer or external objects as having an inherent existence
                                                                              (which persists in time), and one realises the emptiness of both self
                                                                              and phenomena, one experiences reality as timeless and unmoving,
                                                                              luminous (aware) and empty. He no longer perceives time or movement but
                                                                              a "non-moving sensation" that is pure luminous/aware-emptiness that
                                                                              contains and IS all <em>apparent</em> "change" or "movement". Everything
                                                                              is vividly experienced but without a sense of observer/separation and
                                                                              without the sense of 'movement' (which only occurs when there is

You are not a separate permanent observer of the movements of 'external objects'... rather you ARE the flow of phenomenality (which means there is no 'you'), just the pure experience itself, as it happens, and thus there is no sensation of movement. I only had brief glimpses of such
                                                                              nondual experiences but I am not yet enlightened and have not
                                                                              stabilised these experiences... but I know of people who had.</p>
              <p>So
                                                                              anyway.. when the illusion of the 'persisting/separate self' or
                                                                              'external world' is seen through... time no longer seem more real than
                                                                              it actually is -- merely a concept, a form of measurement, a kind of
                                                                              relative truth... not ultimately real, not having any experiential reality... because one no longer experiences separation of subject and object or believe in inherent existence. No movement... There is only THIS... or rather, This Is, That Is... which is whatever happens according to conditions... And that is enormously liberating and blissful! It is seen that there is no separate, persisting self, nor are there objects that are "external" in reference to self that have inherent existence. Then one will not be bothered
                                                                              by notions of eternity or non-eternity, because he has seen that
                                                                              reality is empty and luminous and goes beyond such notions which works
                                                                              only in presumed subject/object duality. That is why when asked notions
                                                                              such as 'eternity' or 'not eternity' Buddha usually never entertain or
                                                                              answer and simply remains his noble silence, not because it can't be
                                                                              answered but because it is often so confusing when one still perceives
                                                                              in a dualistic frameworks, and is also really not helpful or relevant
                                                                              to one's path which is to seek the end of suffering. Ultimately nothing of an essence can be found to persist indefinitely in time or to annihilate... all 'self' and phenomena are essenceless, empty of inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Nirvana
                                                                              is non-reversible -- once a person awakens fully and attains nirvana,
                                                                              he cannot fall back again into samsara. If he is a Buddha or a
                                                                              Bodhisattva and returns to samsara, he is still in nirvana
                                                                              "simultaneously" -- he experiences samsara as nirvana. They experience
                                                                              the nirvana of non-abiding and sees all phenomena and the whole of
                                                                              samsara as being in the state of cessation. Arhats however may not
                                                                              manifest in samsara and enter into their personal cessation/nirvana for
                                                                              a very long time. For Theravada, that is the end, for Mahayana and

Ultimately all is unborn, nothing has arisen, nothing will persist, nothing is eternal and nothing will annihilate... there is no birth and no death. <em><strong>Appearances</strong></em> of samsara continue to arise which are all manifestations of luminous(aware)-emptiness, like vivid reflections of the moon in the water or the flower in the mirror... vivid/luminous/aware and yet dream-like and empty of inherent existence.</p>

              <p>1) The same way why do you not remember what you did while you are 3 years old, or 2 year old, or 1 year old, or when you were just born? When we are reborn we undergo lots of changes and tend to forget memories from past lives just as we have generally forgotten what we were like while we were 3 years old, 2 years old or 1 year old. We usually can't even remember much of what we did while we were 4 or 5 years old except a few impressionable events. However, there are people who can remember past lives, especially when they were still children (when they grow old their memories may tend to fade). There are many such cases, and I've posted a video in this forum before, in it there are two interesting cases which I posted -- <a href="/forums/1728/topics/287720">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/287720</a></p>
              <p>Those who practice deep meditation can also easily remember what they did while they were 3 years old, 2 years old, 1 year old, when they were just born. They know how it feels like to be a baby. They have developed the mental strength through samadhi to be able to recall what is happening, just like when you develope certain level of mental strength and concentration you can even 'replay' what your teacher said in the lecture in your mind while you are doing your exams. Whenever you have mental strength, you can remember events in GREATER CLARITY and you can remember MORE things... than if you do not have mental strength. If you have great mental strength in meditation you can even remember events as if you are Re-Living the event itself with your entire body, there can be no doubt in it... it is clearer to you than the memory that you had a cup of coffee this morning.</p>
              <p>So when these people have developed this mental strength and capacity through meditation... when they ask the question "what is my earliest memory?" They can trace back and back... to when they are young... to when they are baby... and then they can even remember themselves as an old person in his/her past life. Gradually as they trace in deep meditative absorption they can remember MULTIPLE and not just one past life! There are a lot of people who can do this, including some in our forums. So this is a possibility but requires profound mental strength and concentration through meditation, if you do not have mental strength you may not even remember what your teacher said in the lecture. So this mental strength can help even in your exams... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>2) Shakyamuni Buddha continues to manifest in other worlds to help and guide sentient beings. A Buddha or a Bodhisattva is no longer trapped in the cycle of rebirth and can choose to enter into their personal cessation or nirvana like an arhat, and not take any rebirth. However, a Buddha and Bodhisattva chooses to continue saving other sentient beings out of great compassion. However he no longer suffers the sufferings we suffer. He may manifest bodily birth and death but it does not affect him mentally (he does not suffer mentally). To him there is ultimately no birth and death, since he realises that self and phenomena are both empty, like a dream, like reflections on the mirror or the mirage of the moon in the water, vividly appearing yet ultimately not real, empty of inherent existence.</p>
              <p>So the question "where is he" or "does he exist after his passing" is not really relevant, and the Buddha would sometimes remain silent on such questions, because such notions are based on the idea that there is an existing self with a fixed entity, personality or form that can "go somewhere" or "exist". Anyone who is enlightened realises there is no such separate or permanent self. His physical appearances are only appearances like reflections -- ultimately not real or existent... so is everything that we experience, including our body. But with his power he can manifest anywhere in any way he like for the benefit of sentient beings.</p>
              <p>A Buddha has three bodies -- Nirmanakaya, Sambhogakaya, Dharmakaya. His Nirmanakaya manifested in our human realm as Shakyamuni Buddha taught us the dharma in a human appearance with 32 major marks and 80 minor marks. So, Shakyamuni Buddha continues to manifest in various ways in Niramanakaya and Sambhogakaya to other sentient beings and continues to be in charge in our world system until the next Buddha appears in our world, Maitreya Buddha. But his True Body, which is Ultimate Reality itself as Dharmakaya has no coming and going. Dharmakaya is omnipresent, all-pervading, formless/empty and is the ultimate reality of all appearances.</p>

                                          often asked, "Will the world end someday; and if so, when?" Perhaps, we 
                                          can get a better perspective by looking at what scientists have discovered. 
                                          Out there in the vast universe, changes take place continuously, many 
                                          of which science has only recently come to learn about. For example, in 
                                          1967, scientists detected unusual signals of violent bursts of gamma-ray 
                                          radiation caused by titanic explosions at the far edges of the universe. 
                                          This was the beginning of our knowledge on the birth of the very first 
                                          stars. Einstein's Theory of Relativity led to the discovery of black holes 
                                          or extremely high energy regions in space which are created when stars 
                                          die. The current exploration of the planet Mars has found ample evidence 
                                          that water - the source of life - was once flowing on the planet (New 
                                          York Times, June 8, 2004). Yet, today Mars is a dead planet.</em></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"> </span> </em></p>

              <p><em><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">According to a 
                                          Nobel laureate, religious beliefs were stand-ins for the mysteries that 
                                          science is still unable to explain. But, by the time the world ends, who 
                                          will be here to unravel the mysteries? The wisdom of Buddhism is different; 
                                          it addresses the end from the beginning. When will it be the "End of the 
                                          World"? Venerable Shen-Kai explains…</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">The expression "End 
                                          of the World" originated from Christianity or religious groups which agree 
                                          with the notion that an almighty god created the world. But when asked 
                                          when the world will end, no one can give a clear answer! They would only 
                                          say that the morals of people have deteriorated and disasters are occurring 
                                          everywhere, so the world will be destroyed soon and we will then see the 
                                          end of the world. It is commendable that efforts have been made to use 
                                          the potential suffering of the "Three Small Calamities" to guide people 
                                          and persuade them to be upright. </span></p>
              </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Another unorthodox 
                                          version emphasizes the coming of the "Three Periods of the End Kalpa" 
                                          and claims that the "End" is already here. This group further persuades 
                                          that if one is quick enough to embrace their teachings, one can be saved; 
                                          drawing an analogy of "having your name struck off from the Roll of Hell 
                                          and instead submit an early registration for a place in Heaven." Such 
                                          an argument is superficially attractive, but is in fact also baseless 
                                          and false. In addition to using fear as a means to urge people to believe 
                                          in them, the doctrine also contradicts the factual concept of the evolution 
                                          of the world, viz. "Formation, Existence, Destruction and Void". Therefore, 
                                          we should not be erroneous in our belief.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Instead of equating 
                                          the planet Earth with the "world", in Buddhism, the term "world" goes 
                                          beyond the Earth. </span></p>

                                          There are many other planets within this world which are incomplete or 
                                          lacking the essential elements necessary to sustain life. Existing beneath

                                          of worlds are classified as follows:- <br> 1,000 Small Worlds = 1 Small Chilocosm <br> 1,000 Small Chilocosm = 1 Medium Chilocosm <br> 1,000 Medium Chilocosm = 1 Great Chilocosm </span></p>

                                          comprises Small Chilocosm, Medium Chilocosm and Great Chilocosm, and is 
                                          termed a "Three Thousand Great Chilocosm".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">A Great Chilocosm 
                                          comprises 1,000,000,000 "small worlds". When the other space systems have 
                                          also been taken into account, then the sum of planetary worlds of the 
                                          Three Thousand Great Chilocosm becomes innumerable. All of the above constitute 
                                          a Buddha's sphere for teaching and guidance. The Buddhist scriptures state 
                                          that within the Ten Directions (The ten directions of space, i.e. the 
                                          eight points of the compass and the nadir and zenith), there are numerous 
                                          Buddhas who are "presently speaking the Dharma". In one Buddha's sphere 
                                          for teaching and guidance there are 1,000,000,000 suns. When there are 
                                          innumerable worlds, there are countless suns, and consequently, even more 
                                          moons and planets. In the entire universe, the magnitude of planets is 
                                          even more incalculable; hence, the Buddha's analogy of the sands of the 
                                          Ganges River. The sand deposits in India's Ganges River is greater than 
                                          all other rivers in the world; hence, Buddha always used this example 
                                          whenever he needed to illustrate a large number. In our current space 
                                          age, astronomers use the most powerful telescopes to observe space. But 
                                          the distance reachable by these means is limited to a few larger planets. 
                                          As for the stellar systems lying beyond the scope of view, they use the 
                                          terms "galaxies" and "Milky Way". In the future when more of the stellar 
                                          systems are discovered, they will have to use terms such as "galactic 
                                          ocean" to describe them more appropriately.</span></p>

                                          of Three Thousand Great Chilocosm will tremble". A question is often asked, 
                                          "Why should it be that after the nirvana of Sakyamuni Buddha, 5,670,000,000 
                                          earth years must pass before the appearance of the next Buddha (Maitreya

                                            died. In fact, Buddha has been liberated from birth and death, being

                                          undergoes the same number of kalpa stages. (Kalpa : 1 small kalpa = 16.8 
                                          million years, 20 small kalpas = 1 medium kalpa = 336 million years, 80

              <blockquote>

                                            war: The people of this time are lawless, irresponsible, poisonously 
                                            hateful and instinctively murderous. At an instant, the people can pick 
                                            up a leaf and use it as a knife. They can utilise any item at will as 
                                            a deadly weapon for killing. Between human beings, there are not only 
                                            strife and fighting, but also cruel injuring and killing. Human life 
                                            is worth less than that of ants and insects. At the end of the life-span 
                                            shortening period of the kalpa's cycle, such calamities take place frequently. 
                                            Occurrences are intermittent, each lasting a period of 7 days. </span></p>

                                            plagues and epidemic diseases are commonplace. People suffer from a 
                                            myriad of incurable illnesses. Because people's minds are poisoned with 
                                            evil, their internal organs also become intoxicated. Moreover, their 
                                            exhalations are so venomous that people die immediately upon contact. 
                                            These disasters occur frequently at the end of the life-span shortening 
                                            period of the kalpa's cycle, approximately lasting 7 months and 7 days. </span></p>

                                            famine: When people's minds are exceedingly vicious and evil, unfavourable 
                                            seasonal changes result. Lengthy droughts occur, destroying the harvests. 
                                            People suffer from hunger. Even feeding on roots and bark will not sustain 
                                            life. There is no livestock remaining. People resort to cannibalism. 
                                            The duration of such calamity is longer, persisting for 7 years, 7 months 
                                            and 7 days. During this period, there is almost 100% human mortality

                                          and performing virtuous deeds for aeons of lifetimes are repulsed by the 
                                          immoral state of society. They withdraw and live in solitude in the mountains. 
                                          They only just manage to escape the calamities and survive. In time, when 
                                          people have suffered enough and are seeking deliverance, these survivors 
                                          will emerge and return to society. They will advise and encourage whomever 
                                          they encounter, so that these people may learn to lead wholesome lives 
                                          and perform virtuous deeds. As a result, people are inspired to develop 
                                          their virtuous minds, conduct and karma, which in turn allows their societies 
                                          to once again thrive and prosper. The life-span of human beings will then 
                                          begin to increase, lengthening a year per century, until the average person's 
                                          life-span reaches 84,000 years. At this point, the cycle repeats such 
                                          that the human life expectancy decreases again. This marks the beginning 
                                          of the shortening life-span phase of the 10th small kalpa of the Existence 
                                          Kalpa. At this time, the next Buddha, Maitreya Buddha will come down to 
                                          be born into this world.</span></p>

                                                there are also 20 small kalpas. During the 19th small kalpa, sentient 
                                                beings in every world, including the earth world, of the Three Thousand 
                                                Great Chilocosm will be the first to be destroyed. Then, through 
                                                aeons of kalpas, as a result of the efforts of many Buddhas and

                                                to change their wicked ways and lead virtuous lives instead. When 
                                                many sentient beings transmigrate from the six realms of existence 
                                                into the human realm and successfully received the guidance, and 
                                                when hell has emptied so that there isn't a single sentient being 
                                                left there, then the 20th small kalpa of the Destruction Kalpa starts.

                                                vowed: "As long as hell is not empty, I shall not become Buddha. 
                                                Only when all sentient beings are guided and saved, will I attain

                                                Bodhisattva can be accomplished. All sentient beings can be guided

                                          Calamities" occur, destroying all the material worlds. These three calamities 
                                          of fire, water and wind will not occur simultaneously, but each will take 
                                          its turn. At that time, balance in space will be lost, planets of all 
                                          the worlds will leave their orbits, and looking from the earth, one will 
                                          see seven suns appear in the sky at the same time. The suns' fiery heat 
                                          will burn up all the worlds. The destruction will reach the farthest depths

                                          World of Forms.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">After the passing 
                                          of the "Great Fire Calamity" comes the "Great Water Calamity". The worlds 
                                          from the 2nd Jhana Plane in the World of Form down through the Hell of 
                                          Ceaseless Suffering will be engulfed by floodwaters.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Next, the Great Wind 
                                          Calamity follows. All the worlds below the 3rd Jhana down to the Hell 
                                          of Ceaseless Suffering will be blown away like dust. All the materials 
                                          will be dispersed into oblivion.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">When the above-described 
                                          Three Great Calamities destroy the world, each calamity will not be over 
                                          in the passing of a single event. Each event will recur one after another. 
                                          First, there will be seven Great Fire Calamities followed by one Great 
                                          Water Calamity. This sequence of seven Fire and one Water Calamities will 
                                          recur seven times, after which the Great Wind Calamity will finally occur. 
                                          So altogether, there will be 56 Great Fire Calamities, seven Great Water 
                                          Calamities, and one Great Wind Calamity, making a total of 64 calamities. 
                                          When all the worlds go through the course of these Great Calamities and 
                                          enter the Void Kalpa, then it is truly "End of the World". </span></p>

              <p>No.<cite><br> 2) how does buddhism view hell</cite>?</p>
              <p>Buddhism is based on the cause and effect theory.If someone do the bad things it causes the bad karma.This bad karma will send him to hell.<br> 3) in buddhism, there is eternal like aka nirvana…but is there
              eternal damnation?</p>
              <p>This nirvana can be found in body by doing the correct meditation procedure.The nirvana is no changes ,no rebirth,no sufferings and no death<cite><br> 4) is the meng po tang part of buddhism or is it juz a
              fairytale</cite>?</p>
              <p>I don't know meng po tang.</p>
              <p>5) who/wad determines the living being we will be reborned into for
              our next life??? eg…i am a guy tis lifetime…who determined i would
              be reborned as a guy??</p>
              <p>In this world, every body has craving , desire and wrong mindset.Because of having these,they will cause the good or bad karma in the life. This karmawill decide to go next life. The good karma will create good life.The bad karma will lead to bad life.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There are many different types of Buddhism, because the emphasis changes from 
              country to country due to customs and culture. What does not vary is the essence 
              of the teaching — the Dhamma or truth.</span></p>
              <p>I got it from true original version of buddha script(Theravada buddhism) below this link.</p>
              <p>This script is written with ancient language called Par Li</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World's_largest_book</p>
              <p>http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/guide.htm</p>
              <p>Buddha means he is the first person who found the fourth noble truth</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #666666; font-size: small;"><strong>The Four Noble Truths</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">The 
              first sermon that the Buddha preached after his enlightenment was about the four 
              noble truths. The first noble truth is that life is frustrating and painful. In 
              fact, if we are honest with ourselves, there are times when it is downright 
              miserable. Things may be fine with us, at the moment, but, if we look around, we 
              see other people in the most appalling condition, children starving, terrorism, 
              hatred, wars, intolerance, people being tortured and we get a sort of queasy 
              feeling whenever we think about the world situation in even the most casual way. 
              We, ourselves, will some day grow old, get sick and eventually die. No matter 
              how we try to avoid it, some day we are going to die. Even though we try to 
              avoid thinking about it, there are constant reminders that it is 
              true.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: xx-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">The 
              second noble truth is that suffering has a cause. We suffer because we are 
              constantly struggling to survive. We are constantly trying to prove our 
              existence. We may be extremely humble and self-deprecating, but even that is an 
              attempt to define ourselves. We are defined by our humility. The harder we 
              struggle to establish ourselves and our relationships, the more painful our 
              experience becomes.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: xx-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">The 
              third noble truth is that the cause of suffering can be ended. Our struggle to 
              survive, our effort to prove ourselves and solidify our relationships is 
              unnecessary. We, and the world, can get along quite comfortably without all our 
              unnecessary posturing. We could just be a simple, direct and straight-forward 
              person. We could form a simple relationship with our world, our coffee, spouse 
              and friend. We do this by abandoning our expectations about how we think things 
              should be.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: xx-small;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: x-small;">This is the fourth noble truth: the way, or path to end the cause of 
              suffering. The central theme of this way is meditation. Meditation, here, means 
              the practice of mindfulness/awareness, <em>shamata/vipashyana </em>in Sanskrit. We 
              practice being mindful of all the things that we use to torture ourselves with. 
              We become mindful by abandoning our expectations about the way we think things 
              should be and, out of our mindfulness, we begin to develop awareness about the 
              way things really are. We begin to develop the insight that things are really 
              quite simple, that we can handle ourselves, and our relationships, very well as 
              soon as we stop being so manipulative and complex</span></p>

              <p>Hi Justdoit77 and despondent</p>
              <p>Finally I find out the notes for questions.</p>
              <p>1) does buddhism believe tat everyone will eventually become a
                                      buddha?</p>
              <p>Besides human beings and other living beings which are visible to us, there are
              many other kinds of beings in the world. The following are the various
              categories of the beings in the whole world:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>The <em>Brahmas</em>, or Higher Spiritual Beings. </li>
              <li>The <em>Devas</em> or Lower Spiritual Beings.</li>
              <li>Human Beings. </li>
              <li>Animals. </li>
              <li>Peta or Departed Spirits or Beings in a state of continual misery. </li>
              <li><em>Asuraka</em> or Fallen Woeful Spiritual Beings. </li>
              <li><em>Nerayika</em> or Beings in the Nethermost Plane of existence. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>          These
              beings come into existence and after their span of life they die. When they
              die, it does not mean they are annihilated. The <em>Brahmas </em>or Higher
              Spiritual Beings on their death may be reborn as<em> Devas</em> (Lower Spiritual
              Beings), or human beings. And when they die as <em>Devas </em>or human beings
              they may be reborn as beasts, or <em>Petas</em>, or <em>Asurakas</em>, or
              <em>Nerayikas</em>. The <em>Devas</em>, or human beings, or animals, or
              <em>Petas</em>, or <em>Asurakas</em>, or the beings in the Nethermost Plane of
              Existence, also on their death may be reborn as one of the above beings
              according to the good or bad deeds they have performed. They are not
              annihilated but are certain to be reborn.</p>
              <p>          For
              all these beings, whether they are <em>Brahmas</em>, or <em>Devas</em>, or Human
              Beings, or animals, or <em>Petas</em>, or <em>Asurakas</em>, or Beings in the
              Nethermost Plane, to be reborn again and again, and to have to undergo old age,
              disease and death again and again are indeed dreadful ills.</p>
              <p>          Only
              on the rare occasion of the Enlightenment of a Buddha do many of these beings
              get the opportunity to listen to the dhamma which could liberate them from
              these ills. Only then can they practise in accordance with this dhamma, and
              escape from rebirth, old age, disease and death. This dhamma too disappears
              some time after the death, <em>(Parinibbana)</em>, of the Buddha and it reappears
              only on the Enlightenment of another Buddha.</p>
              <p>         
              Therefore, persons with great compassion in their nature resolve to attain
              Buddhahood with the intention of liberating the beings from those ills.
              However, by mere resolution they cannot become Buddhas. After they have made
              their resolutions they have to dedicate themselves to the task and to persevere
              in it for innumerable existences. For instance, a person who through compassion
              wishes to cure people suffering from disease, will first have to resolve to
              become a doctor, but mere resolution will not make him a doctor. For several
              years he must go through a strenuous course of training and study before he can
              become a doctor.</p>
              <p>          There
              are ten major undertakings, called <em>Parami</em> in Pali, for those who aspire
              to Buddhahood, and these are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Giving away one's own possessions, such as one's own property, sons,
              daughters, wife and even one's life. This is <em>Dana Parami</em>.</li>
              <li> Guarding oneself from evil action and evil speech. This is <em>Sila
              Parami.</em></li>
              <li>Renunciation of the worldly life. This is<em> Nikkhama Parami</em>. </li>
              <li>Acquisition of knowledge which can be beneficial to beings, and through
              this knowledge bringing about their welfare. This is <em>Panna Parami.</em></li>
              <li>Exerting oneself to the ulmost for the welfare and happiness of beings.
              This is <em>Viriya Parami.</em></li>
              <li>Being patient and forbearing under all circumstances. This is <em>Khanti
              Parami</em>.</li>
              <li> 7. Speaking the truth even at the cost of one's life. This is<em> Sacca
              Parami</em>.</li>
              <li> 8. After making a resolution , carrying out the resolution even at the
              cost of one's life. This is <em>Adhitthana Parami</em>.</li>
              <li> 9. Having an attitude of benevolent goodwill towards all beings without
              distinction of any kind. This is <em>Metta Parami.</em></li>
              <li> 10. Guarding oneself from elation or depression in times when one's wishes
              are fulfilled or not fulfilled, thus cultivating equanimity of mind. This is
              <em>Upekkha Parami.</em></li>
              </ol>
              <p>         These
              are the ten major undertakings for one who aspires to Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>          Each
              of these ten undertakings is graded in three degrees of minor excellence,
              average excellence, and noblest excellence. It is not at all an easy matter to
              carry out to perfection all these ten undertakings, in all the three degrees.
              It is not possible to do so within a single lifetime, nor is it possible to
              accomplish them to perfection within a hundred or a thousand existences. It
              requires exertion and perseverance in an innumerable number of existences to
              fulfil these obligations to perfection.</p>
              <p>          To
              explain these Paramis in an easy way, we may take the <em>Jataka </em>or
              Birth-Story of the Future Buddha, usually called the Bodhisattva, when he was
              born a forest ape. A Brahmin, who later was to become a Devadatta, while
              searching for stray cattle, lost his way in a forest and fell into a deep pit.
              He was found there by the Bodhisattva Forest Ape.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>As soon as the Ape saw the Brahmin's plight, his heart went out to him, and
              he felt full of love and pity, as if it had been his own offspring that had
              fallen into the pit.</li>
              <li>Then the Bodhisattva Ape gave a promise to save the brahmin at the risk of
              his life. He kept his promise by helping the Brahmin to safety. The manner of
              it was as follows:</li>
              <li> The Bodhisattva had to consider ways and means of saving the brahmin, and
              came to the conclusion that only by leaping up from the bottom of the pit to
              its top-edge with the brahmin on his back, would he be able to save the
              brahmin.</li>
              <li>But there was a risk that the leap would not be high enough, and that the
              brahmin would be killed in the case of failure. Therefore, the Bodhisattva made
              several experiments of leaping up to the edge of the pit carrying a stone the
              weight of which about that the brahmin. Only when these experimental leaps
              showed that he could do it, did the Bodhisattva Ape made a leap with the
              brahmin on his back and thus saved the brahmin from dying of starvation and
              thirst in the pit.</li>
              <li>In thus saving the brahmin's life the Bodhisattva knew that he might die in
              the attempt; nevertheless, he was ready to give his life to save the brahmin. </li>
              <li>When they got to safety out of the pit, the Bodhisattva felt very tired and
              rested with his head on the lap of the brahmin. The ungrateful brahmin had the
              idea that he would kill the forest ape so as to take home meat, and therefore
              struck the bodhisattva on the head with a stone. The latter was not killed,
              though his head was broken, and he ran up a tree. Though the Bodhisattva was in
              great pain, he felt no anger or enmity towards the brahmin. </li>
              <li>Neither did he show by deed or word any hostility or unpleasantness to the
              brahmin.</li>
              <li>The Bodhisattva completely ignored the fact that an attempt on his been
              made, and kept his equanimity of mind.</li>
              <li>Moreover, the Bodhisattva knew that the Brahmin would be lost in the forest
              if left by himself, and so he guided the Brahmin out of the forest by leaping
              from tree to tree and leaving a trail of blood which dripped from his wound in
              the head, and which the Brahmin followed on the ground. Thus the Bodhisattva
              saved the Brahmin to the end in keeping with his determination to save him. </li>
              <li>In thus saving the life of the Brahmin, the Bodhisattva had no of gain of
              any kind, and he did it completely renouncing any worldly or meritorious gain. </li>
              </ol>
              <p>          In
              this story,</p>
              <ol>
              <li>the fact that the Bodhisattva saved the life of the Brahmin, while being
              ready to give his life in the attempt, is <em>Dana Parami. </em></li>
              <li>the fact that, inspite of being struck on the head with a stone, the
              Bodhisattva showed no hostility or enmity by deed or word is <em>Sila
              Parami.</em></li>
              <li>the fact that he did not wish for any gain or benefit for himself for
              saving the Brahmin is <em>Nikkhama Parami</em>;</li>
              <li>the fact that the Bodhisattva considered ways and means of saving the
              Brahmin is<em> Panna Parami;</em></li>
              <li>the fact that the Bodhisattva made repeated experiments of leaping up to
              the top of the pit, thus endeavouring to ensure the Brahmin's safety, <em>Viriya
              Parami;</em></li>
              <li>the fact that although the Bodhisattva was in great pain after being struck
              on the head with a stone, he did not feel anger or enmity towards the Brahmin
              is <em>Khanti Parami;</em></li>
              <li>the fact that the Bodhisattva kept his promise to save the Brahmin, even at
              the risk of his life, is <em>Sacca Parami;</em></li>
              <li> the fact that the Bodhisattva continued to the end to fulfil his
              determination to save the Brahmin, inspite of the latter's attempt to kill him,
              is <em>Adhitthana Parami</em>;</li>
              <li>the fact that the Bodhisattva felt a surge of pity and love on seeing the
              Brahmin's plight in the pit is <em>Metta Parami</em>; and</li>
              <li> the fact that the Bodhisattva entirely ignored the attempt on his life and
              kept his equanimity of mind is <em>Upekkha Parami.</em></li>
              </ol>
              <p>          A person who had made
              a resolution for the attainment of Buddhahood has to exert himself to
              accomplish either all the ten undertakings or one of them. However small the
              extent of his exertion may be, it is never in vain. This small exertion in this
              life will serve as a foundation for further exertion in the next existence,
              with a cumulative effect. Thus continuing to exert from existence to existence,
              the perseverance of that person in these undertakings reaches perfection after
              many existences. When the time for the consummation of that exertion is reached
              that person attains the Buddhahood.</p>
              <p>         Then,
              what is a Buddha?</p>
              <p>         A
              Buddha is one</p>
              <ol>
              <li>who, has discovered by himself, in completeness and without having to
              acquire it from any one else, the dhamma which is capable of liberating the
              beings from the ills of old age, disease and death;</li>
              <li>who, after having practised according to this dhamma, has personally
              arrived at the last existence, after which there is no further birth;</li>
              <li>who can teach and explain the dhamma which he has discovered, to the
              <em>Brahmas, Devas</em> and men, so that they can understand it;</li>
              <li>who, after thus teaching and explaining the dhamma, urges the beings to
              practise it so as to reach the endmost birth after which there is no more
              existence.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>         These
              are the qualities of Buddha.</p>
              <p>         
              Personages with such qualities have appeared in innumerable numbers in the
              incalculable world-cycles of the past. And in this world-cycle of ours also,
              the Buddha Kakusanda, Gonagamana, Kassapa and Gotama have appeared.</p>

              <p>Some questions and answers for Dhamma</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1. 
                        <em> How can we avoid addictions like smoking cigarettes?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                        are so many different types of addictions. When you practise Vipassana, 
                        you will understand that your addiction is not actually to that particular 
                        substance. It seems as if you are addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, 
                        <em>paan </em>(betel leaf). But actually, you are addicted to a particular 
                        sensation in the body, a bio-chemical flow caused by that particular 
                        substance. Similarly, when you are addicted to anger, passion etc, these 
                        are also related to body sensations. Your addiction is to the sensations. 
                        Through Vipassana you come out of that addiction, all addictions. It 
                        is so natural, so scientific. Just try, and you will experience how 
                        it works. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>2. 
                        Why is drinking only one glass of wine a breakage of sila?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                        glass becomes more. So why not come out it from the very beginning? 
                        Once one becomes addicted, it is so difficult to come out of the addiction. 
                        Why not refrain from anything that is addictive?<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If 
                        someone who has come out of all kinds of intoxicants and is progressing 
                        in meditation takes even a very small quantity of alcohol, that person 
                        will immediately feel that it creates agitation and will feel unhappy. 
                        They can't take it. Ignorance causes impurities to develop and intoxicants 
                        are closely associated with ignorance. They drown all your understanding. 
                        Come out of them as quickly as possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>3. 
                        The method you have just described is very practical, but can everybody 
                        benefit from it-even those who suffer from severe addictions, such as 
                        to drugs or alcohol?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When 
                        we talk of addiction, it is not merely to alcohol or to drugs, but also 
                        to addiction to impurities such as passion, to anger, to fear, to egotism. 
                        At the intellectual level you understand very well: "Anger is not 
                        good for me, it is dangerous, so harmful." Yet you are addicted 
                        to anger, keep generating anger because you have not been working at 
                        the depth of the behavior pattern of your mind. The anger starts because 
                        of a particular -chemical that has started flowing in your body, and 
                        with the interaction of mind and matter-one influencing the other-the 
                        anger continues to multiply.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">By 
                        practicing Vipassana, you start observing the sensation which has arisen 
                        because of the flow of a particular chemical. You do not react to it. 
                        That means you do not generate anger at that particular moment. This 
                        one moment turns into a few moments, which turn into a few seconds, 
                        which turn into a few minutes, and you find that you are not as easily 
                        influenced by this flow as you were in the past. You have slowly started 
                        coming out of your anger.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">People 
                        who have come to these courses go back home and apply this technique 
                        in their daily lives by their morning and evening meditation and by 
                        continuing to observe themselves throughout the day-how they react or 
                        how they maintain equanimity in different situations. The first thing 
                        they will try to do is to observe the sensations. Because of the particular 
                        situation, maybe a part of the mind has started reacting, but by observing 
                        the sensations their minds become equanimous. Then whatever action they 
                        take is an action; it is not a reaction. Action is always positive. 
                        It is only when we react that we generate negativity and become miserable. 
                        A few moments observing the sensation makes the mind equanimous, and 
                        then it can act. Life then is full of action instead of reaction. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong><a name="atma"></a>Atma 
                        (soul)</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1. 
                        <em>What is 'atma', 'soul' ?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> Practice 
                        Vipassana, and you will find the reality of what is happening inside 
                        you. What you call <em>soul </em>, <em>atma, </em>you will notice, is just 
                        a reacting mind, a certain part of the mind. Yet you remain under the 
                        illusion that "this is 'I' ". Through practice of Vipassana, you will 
                        realize that this 'I' is not permanent. It's always changing, always 
                        ephemeral. It's nothing but a mass of sub-atomic particles, always in 
                        a state of flux and flow. Only by directly experiencing this, the illusion 
                        of 'I' will go away, and then the illusion of the 'soul'. With no illusions, 
                        delusions, all miseries go away. But this has to be experienced. This 
                        does not happen by merely accepting philosophical beliefs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><strong><a name="anger"></a>Anger</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">1. 
                        <em>How does one escape anger?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">With 
                        the practise of Vipassana! A Vipassana student observes respiration, 
                        or the bodily sensations caused when angry. This observation is with 
                        equanimity, with no reaction. The anger soon weakens and passes away. 
                        Through continued practise of Vipassana, the habit pattern of the mind 
                        to react with anger is changed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">2.<em> I can't suppress my anger, even if I try.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Don't 
                        suppress it. Observe it. The more you suppress it, the more it goes 
                        to the deeper levels of your mind. The complexes become stronger and 
                        stronger, and it so difficult to come out of them. No suppression, no 
                        expression. Just observe. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Certainly. 
                        This is the purpose of Vipassana - to liberate you from all miseries. 
                        Anxiety and worry are the biggest miseries, and they are there because 
                        of certain impurities deep within you. With practise of Vipassana, these 
                        impurities will come on the surface and gradually pass away. Of course, 
                        it takes time. There is no magic, no miracle, no gurudom involved. Somebody 
                        will just show you the correct Path. You have to walk on the Path, work 
                        out your own liberation from all miseries. </span></p>

                        What is wrong with wanting material things to make life more comfortable?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If 
                        it is a real requirement, there is nothing wrong, provided you do not 
                        become attached to it. For example, you are thirsty, you need water-so 
                        you work, get it, and quench your thirst. But if it becomes an obsession, 
                        that does not help at all; it harms you. Whatever necessities you require, 
                        work to get them. If you fail to get something, then smile and try again 
                        in a different way. If you succeed, then enjoy what you get, but without 
                        attachment.</span></p>

                        You spoke about non-attachment to things. What about persons?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Yes, 
                        persons also. You have true love for the person, compassionate love 
                        for this person, this is totally different. But when you have attachment, 
                        then you don't have love, you only love yourself, because you expect 
                        something -material, emotional etc - from this person. With whomever 
                        you have attachment, you are expecting something in return. When you 
                        start truly loving this person, then you only give, a one-way traffic. 
                        You don't expect anything in return, then the attachment goes. The tension 
                        goes. You are so happy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">3.<em>How 
                        can the world function without attachment?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If 
                        parents were detached then they would not even care for their children. 
                        How is it possible to love or be involved in life without attachment? 
                        Detachment does not mean indifference; it is correctly called "holy 
                        indifference". As a parent, you must meet your responsibility to care 
                        for your child with all your love, but without clinging. Out of pure, 
                        selfless love you do your duty. Suppose you tend a sick person, and 
                        despite your care, he does not recover. You don't start crying; that 
                        would be useless. With a balanced mind, you try to find another way 
                        to help him. This is holy indifference : neither inaction or reaction, 
                        but real, positive action with a balanced mind.</span></p>

                        <em>Isn't performing a right action a kind of attachment?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">No. 
                        It is simply doing your best, understanding that the results are beyond 
                        your control. You do your job and leave the results to nature, to Dhamma.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>.....then 
                        it is being willing to make a mistake?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If 
                        you make a mistake you accept it, and try not to repeat it the next 
                        time. Again you may fail; again you smile and try a different way. If 
                        you can smile in the face of failure, you are not attached. If failure 
                        depresses you and success makes you elated, you are certainly attached. </span></p>

                        Do you think that U Ba Khin taught exactly what the Buddha taught? Did 
                        he adapt the Buddha's teachings to modern times? And if so, how and 
                        what did he change from the original teachings?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                        was no change in the teaching, but U Ba Khin certainly made the way 
                        of presenting the teachings of the Buddha more adapted to the people 
                        who came to him. To the non-Buddhist, English-speaking Western people, 
                        who were more scientific minded, he would present the teaching in a 
                        more scientific way. So the explanation was made more palatable to those 
                        who were coming to learn, but the actual practical teaching remained 
                        the same. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>2. 
                        Why is your teaching called "in the tradition of Sayagyi U Ba Khin"? 
                        Did he inaugurate a tradition of Buddhism?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">He 
                        always referred to the tradition of the Buddha, the tradition that was 
                        transferred to Myanmar and was continued down through the three generations 
                        of teachers we spoke about: Ledi Sayadaw, his disciple Saya Thetgyi, 
                        and finally U Ba Khin. We use the term "in the tradition of U Ba 
                        Khin" because he was the last teacher and was very well-known in 
                        his country, but this does not mean that this is a technique invented 
                        by him. It's an old -technique which he was teaching in a modern way.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>3. 
                        Can you explain the Buddha's concept that the entire universe is contained 
                        within this very body?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Indeed, 
                        within this body turns the wheel of becoming. Within this body is the 
                        cause that puts into motion the wheel of becoming. And so within this 
                        body is also found the way to attain liberty from the wheel of suffering. 
                        For this reason investigation of the body - correct understanding of 
                        the direct physical reality within - is of utmost importance for a meditator 
                        whose goal is liberation from all conditioning. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>4. 
                        Is this part of Buddhist religion? Can people of other religions practice 
                        it, or does it interfere with other kinds of religious practices? Why 
                        would Christians, for instance, want to do this?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">One 
                        thing should be clear-this definitely is not Buddhist religion. At the 
                        same time it is definitely the teaching of Buddha. One should understand 
                        that Buddha means an enlightened person, a liberated person. Enlightened, 
                        liberated persons will never teach a religion, they will teach an art 
                        of life that is universal. They will never establish a sect or religion. 
                        So there is no such thing as "Buddhist religion"; it is an 
                        art of life. So anybody belonging to any community, to any sect, to 
                        any religious group can easily practice it because it is an art.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Peace 
                        of mind is sought by everyone; purity of mind is sought by everyone. 
                        Christ was a wonderful person who taught not only peace and harmony 
                        but also purity of mind, love, compassion. So those who follow the teachings 
                        of Christ certainly like to develop this good quality of purity, love, 
                        compassion. When they come to courses, they don't feel that they are 
                        coming to any foreign religion. A number of times very senior priests 
                        and nuns have told me that we are teaching Christianity in the name 
                        of Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Was 
                        it necessary for Buddha to practice meditation even after enlightenment?<br> Yes, it was necessary. Even when one becomes a Buddha, it does not mean 
                        that the law of nature will be different for this person. The law of 
                        nature of this body is that it is decaying, dying. The body requires 
                        strength, and when a Buddha goes in this meditative state of nibbana 
                        and comes out, he finds that the whole body has become healthier. It 
                        helps, he can serve much more.<br> There is so much work for the body of one who works all the twenty-four 
                        hours, except for two or two-and-a-half hours when he lies down. Some 
                        rest is needed. The mind is peaceful, but to rest the body the mind 
                        has to go to the depth and reach the nibbanic stage. When one comes 
                        out of the nibbanic experience one is physically refreshed.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><br> </span></p>

                        <em>You keep referring to the Buddha. Are you teaching Buddhism?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">I am 
                        not concerned with 'isms'. I teach Dhamma, and that is what the Buddha 
                        taught. He never taught any 'ism', or any sectarian doctrine. He taught 
                        something from which people of every background, every religion, can 
                        benefits. He taught the way with which one can to live a life full of 
                        benefits for oneself and other. He didn't merely give empty sermons 
                        saying, ' Oh, People. You must live like this, you must live like that". 
                        The Buddha taught practical Dhamma , the actual way to live a wholesome 
                        life. And Vipassana is the practical know-how to lead a life of real 
                        happiness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">6. 
                        <em>All Buddhist meditation techniques were already known in yoga. What 
                        was new in meditation as taught by the Buddha?</em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What 
                        is called yoga today is actually a later development. Patanjali lived 
                        about 500 years after the time of the Buddha, and naturally his <em>Yoga 
                        Sutra</em> shows the influence of the Buddha's teachings. Of course, 
                        yogic practices were known in India even before the Buddha, and he himself 
                        experimented with them before achieving enlightenment. All these practices, 
                        however, were limited to <em>sila </em>(morality) and <em>samadhi </em>(concentration 
                        of the mind), concentration up to the level of the eight <em>jhana, </em>the 
                        eight stage of absorption, which is still within the field of sensory 
                        experience. The Buddha found the ninth <em>jhana</em>, and that is Vipassana, 
                        the development of insight that will take the meditator to the ultimate 
                        goal beyond the misery of sensory experience.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> The Buddha said that understanding the Dhamma is nothing other than 
                        understanding the law of cause and effect. You have to realize this

                        and intellects cannot clearly find it, but that does not mean that there

                        certainly our past actions will give fruit, good or bad. They will determine 
                        the type of life we have, the general situation in which we find ourselves. 
                        But that does not mean that whatever happens to us is predestined, ordained 
                        by our past actions, and that nothing else can happen. That is not the 
                        case. Our past actions influence the flow of our life, directing them 
                        towards pleasant or unpleasant experiences. But present actions are 
                        equally important. Nature has given us the ability to become masters

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Chakras</em> are nothing but nerve centres on the spinal cord. Vipassana takes you 
                        to the stage where you can feel activity in every little atom of your 
                        body. <em>Chakras</em> are just a part of that. This activity can be experienced 
                        in the entire body.</span></p>

                        We have young children and it is very difficult to find time to meditate. 
                        What should I do?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">A 
                        householder is bound to face such difficulties. But if you wait for 
                        the time when there are no hindrances, you will not meditate for your 
                        whole life. For a woman, motherhood is good. And if you have children, 
                        you have the responsibility to look after them-very good. Along with 
                        the responsibility of looking after the child, you must find time to 
                        meditate. When the child is asleep, meditate. The child has awakened: 
                        all right, again start nursing the child. In this way, even if you don't 
                        get a fixed time or place, it doesn't matter, do it in intervals. But 
                        meditate, don't stop. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>2. 
                        At what age could I start to teach my child to meditate?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Before 
                        birth. Meditation should be taught when the child is growing in the 
                        womb. The child needs good vibrations while in the womb, so practise 
                        Vipassana. Every pregnant mother should practise more Vipassana because 
                        then you are helping two beings simultaneously. You are helping yourself, 
                        and you are helping the being which has not yet come out. Help them.<br> After that, when the child grows to five or six you can start teaching 
                        Anapana. Just be aware of the respiration for a few minutes; two, three, 
                        five minutes, enough. Don't push too much. A few minutes of awareness 
                        of respiration, and then say; "All right, play." After that, 
                        again a few minutes of respiration. So it will become like playing for 
                        the child. Later on, as he or she grows, increase the time. In this 
                        way you start giving the seed of Dhamma, and the child develops in an 
                        atmosphere of Dhamma. <br> You have started giving training in Anapana in some schools. How will 
                        this training benefit children?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Actually 
                        the entire teaching has only one purpose: One should live peacefully 
                        and harmoniously in accordance with the law of nature-not harming oneself 
                        or others. Now this art of living is difficult to learn in old age, 
                        so the training should start at a young age. In the schools children 
                        should learn the art of living a healthy life. Their entire life is 
                        ahead of them.<br> You start by teaching them how to control their minds. Along with this 
                        awareness of respiration it is explained that you have to live a moral 
                        life, so they understand, "I must not kill, I must not steal, etc. 
                        But how can I abstain from that? I must have control over my mind. And 
                        look, this helps." The object that is given is universal so a student 
                        from any caste, any community, any religion can work on this.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">You 
                        also tell them that they can develop in this awareness of respiration 
                        and then they will live a good life. At further stages they can purify 
                        their minds to such an extent that they will live a perfect life, so 
                        there is a goal. In school for example, when they learn the alphabet 
                        the goal is that they will become very learned people later on. Now 
                        they have started with this base of s²la and respiration. <br> </span></p>

                        Do you think that by this training children can become good citizens?</span></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">What 
                        is a good citizen? A good citizen is one who does not harm himself or 
                        herself and also does not harm other members of society. The whole teaching 
                        shows how to live a life of morality. If children start learning this 
                        in childhood, when they become adults they will naturally live healthy, 
                        good lives. This is how they will become good citizens. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><br> </span></p>

                        What is your feeling about teaching Dhamma to children?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">The 
                        best time for that is before birth of the child. During pregnancy the 
                        mother should practise Vipassana, so that the child also receives it 
                        and is born a Dhamma child. But if you already have children, you can 
                        still share Dhamma with them. If your children are very young (below 
                        age 8), direct your metta (the technique of Metta-Bhavana to share the 
                        vibrations of goodwill and compassion to all beings, taught on the 10th 
                        morning of the Vipassana course ) to them after every sitting and at 
                        their bedtime. In this way, they also benefit from your practice of 
                        Dhamma. And when you are older, explain a little about Dhamma to them 
                        in a way that they can understand and accept. If they can understand 
                        it a little more, then teach them Anapana for a few minutes. Don't pressure 
                        the children in any way. Just let them sit with you, observe their breath 
                        for a few minutes, and then go and play. The meditation will be like 
                        play to them; they will enjoy it. And the most important is that you 
                        must live a healthy Dhamma life yourself, you must set a good example 
                        for your children. In your home, you must establish a peaceful and harmonious 
                        atmosphere which will help them grow into healthy and happy people. 
                        This is the best thing you can do for your children. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Why 
                        should there be a problem? The child is on the lap and still you can 
                        practise. You can give metta to the child. You can give metta to others. 
                        You must learn how to carry on your Dhamma in every situation. So use 
                        Dhamma for all your duties. A mother's duty is to look after the child 
                        in a Dhamma way.</span></p>

                        <em>Is it necessary to introduce Vipassana into education?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Certainly. 
                        Vipassana is the practical science of living. The next generation must 
                        learn this science at a very young age, so that they can live a very 
                        healthy life, a harmonious life. If they understand pure Dhamma, the 
                        law of nature, they will live according to the law of nature. When children 
                        are taught Vipassana in the schools and colleges, as it is being done 
                        now in some cities, there are very good results. </span></p>

                        is what Vipassana does. Every complex is an impurity of the mind. As 
                        that impurity comes to the surface, you observe it at the level of body 
                        sensations. It passes away. It arises again. Again you observe. Again 
                        it passes away. Like this, these complexes weaken and ultimately do 
                        not rise again. Just observe. Suppression or expression is harmful. 
                        Vipassana helps one come out of all complexes.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Vipassana 
                        is not merely concentration. Vipassana is observation of the truth within, 
                        from moment to moment. You develop your faculty of awareness, your mindfulness. 
                        Things keep changing, but you remain aware - this is Vipassana. But 
                        if you concentrate only on one object, which may be an imaginary object, 
                        then nothing will change. When you are with this imagination, and your 
                        mind remains concentrated on it, you are not observing the truth. When 
                        you are observing the truth, it is bound to change. It keeps constantly 
                        changing, and yet you are aware of it. This is Vipassana. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> On 
                        the contrary, Vipassana is a process of de-conditioning. Instead of 
                        imposing anything on the mind, it automatically removes unwholesome 
                        qualities so that only positive, wholesome qualities remain. By eliminating 
                        negativities, it uncovers the positivity which is the basic nature of 
                        the pure mind. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">It 
                        is wrong. You will never get enlightenment if you have a craving for 
                        enlightenment. Enlightenment just happens. If you crave for it, you 
                        are running in the opposite direction. One cannot crave for a particular 
                        result. The result comes naturally. If you start craving, " I must get 
                        nibbana, I must get nibbana", you are running in the opposite direction 
                        of nibbana. Nibbana is a state which is free from craving, and you want 
                        to reach that state with craving - not possible. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">2. 
                        <em>Is a strong desire the same as craving?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">There 
                        is a difference. Whether there is craving or not, will be judged by 
                        whatever you desire. If you don't get it, and you feel depressed, then 
                        it was craving. If you don't get it, and you just smile, then it was 
                        just a desire. It didn't turn into craving. Whenever there is a craving 
                        and clinging and you don't get something, you are bound to become miserable. 
                        If you are becoming miserable, then there was some craving. Otherwise, 
                        no craving. </span></p>

                        injustice, desiring freedom, fearing physical harm? </em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Cravings 
                        and aversions can never be wholesome. They will always make you tense 
                        and unhappy. If you act with craving or aversion in the mind, you may 
                        have a worthwhile goal, but you use an unhealthy means to reach it. 
                        Of course, you have to act to protect yourself from danger. If you do 
                        it overpowered by fear, then might you develop a fear complex which 
                        will harm you in the long run. Or, if with hatred in the mind, if you 
                        are successful in fighting injustice, then that hatred becomes a harmful 
                        mental complex. You must fight injustice, you must protect yourself 
                        from danger, but you can do so with a balanced mind, without tension. 
                        And in a balanced way, you can work to achieve something good, out of 
                        love for others. Balance of mind is always helpful, and will give the 
                        best results.</span></p>

                        it is a real requirement, there is nothing wrong, provided you do not 
                        become attached to it. Whatever necessities you require, work to get 
                        them. If you fail to get something, then smile and try again in a different 
                        way. If you succeed, then enjoy what you get, but without attachment.</span></p>

                        the criterion is whether you are attached to your plan. Everyone must 
                        provide for the future. If your plan does not succeed and you start 
                        crying, then you know that you were attached to it. But if you are unsuccessful 
                        and can still smile, thinking, " Well, I did my best. So what if I failed? 
                        I'll try again !" - then you are working in a detached way, and you

                        one's mind contains, at this moment, is Dhamma. Dhamma is everything 
                        there is.</span></p>

                        What is the relevance of Dhamma to a person on the street, whose stomach 
                        is empty?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"> A 
                        large number of people living in slums come to Vipassana courses and 
                        find it very helpful. Their stomachs are empty, but their minds also 
                        are so agitated. With Vipassana, they learn how to be calm and equanimous. 
                        Then they can face their problems. It is noticed their lives improve. 
                        They come out of addictions to alcohol, gambling etc. Dhamma is helpful 
                        to everyone, rich or poor.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">3. 
                        <em>How can a truly Dhammic person face this adhammic world?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Don't 
                        try to change the adhammic world. Try to change the adhamma in yourself 
                        - the way in which you are reacting and making yourself miserable. For 
                        instance, when somebody is abusing you, understand that this person 
                        is miserable. It is the problem of that person. Why make it your problem? 
                        Why start generating anger and making yourself miserable? Doing that 
                        means you are not your own master, you are that person's slave; whenever 
                        that person wants to, he can make you miserable. Be your own master. 
                        Then you can live a Dhammic life, in spite of all the adhammic situations 
                        all around. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">4. 
                        <em>How do you equate religion and Dhamma?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If 
                        religion is taken in a sectarian sense, like Hindu religion or Muslim 
                        religion or Buddhist religion and so on, then it is totally against 
                        Dhamma. But if religion is taken as the law of nature, the universal 
                        law of nature, then it is the same as Dhamma. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>5. 
                        Do you believe the Dhamma can guide you?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Yes. 
                        Certainly, the Dhamma starts guiding you. As the mind gets more and 
                        more purified, your pannya, your own experiential wisdom will get stronger 
                        and stronger. When any problem comes in the world, in your life, then 
                        you just go a little deep inside and you get the answer yourself. So 
                        this becomes your guide. You should not depend on anyone else. You depend 
                        on yourself, and depend on Dhamma. </span></p>

                        Are there Dhamma forces that support us as we develop on the Path?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Certainly 
                        – visible as well as invisible ones. For example, people tend to associate 
                        with those of similar interest, background and character. When we develop 
                        good qualities in us, we naturally attract people who have such good 
                        qualities. When we come in contact with such good people, naturally 
                        we get support from them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">If 
                        we develop love, compassion and goodwill, we will get tuned up with 
                        all beings, visible or invisible, that have these positive vibrations, 
                        and we will start getting support from them. It is like tuning a radio 
                        to receive waves of a certain meter band from a distant broadcasting 
                        station. Similarly, we tune ourselves to vibrations of the type we generate; 
                        and so we receive the benefit of those vibrations. But all this happens 
                        only if we work hard and correctly.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At 
                        the time of death - death of other people - then you just sit and give 
                        metta. And when your own death comes, observe it, at the level of sensations. 
                        Everyone has to observe one's death : coming, coming, coming, going, 
                        going, going, gone ! Be happy !</span></p>

                        You speak of the ego 'I' only in negative terms. Hasn't it a positive 
                        side? Isn't there an experience of 'I' which fills a person with joy, 
                        with peace and rapture?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Through 
                        practice of Vipassana you will find that all such sensual pleasures 
                        are impermanent; they come and pass away. If this 'I' really enjoys 
                        them, if they are 'my' pleasures, then 'I' must have some mastery over 
                        them. But they just arise and pass away without my control. What 'I' 
                        is there?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>I'm 
                        speaking not of sensual pleasures, but of a very deep level.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">At 
                        that level, 'I' is of no importance at all. When you reach that level, 
                        the ego is dissolved. There is only joy. The question of 'I' does not 
                        arise then. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;"><em>Well, 
                        instead of 'I' , let us say the experience of a person.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Feelings 
                        feel; there is no one to feel it. Things are just happening, that's 
                        all. Now it seems to you that there must be an 'I' who feels, but after 
                        beginning to practice Vipassana, you will reach the stage where the 
                        ego dissolves. Then your question will disappear!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">For 
                        conventional purposes, yes, we cannot run away from using words like 
                        'I' or 'mine' etc. But clinging to them, taking them as real in an ultimate 
                        sense will only bring suffering. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Come 
                        out of it by meditating. If the ego is strong, one will try to belittle 
                        others, to lower their importance and increase one's own. But meditation 
                        naturally dissolves the ego. When it dissolves, you can no longer do 
                        anything to hurt another. Meditate and the problem will automatically 
                        solved.</span></p>

                        is what the mind is conditioned to do, out of ignorance. But Vipassana 
                        can liberate you from this harmful conditioning. In place of always 
                        thinking of the self, you can learn to think of others. </span></p>

                        call them 'natural' human emotions, but the mind by nature is very pure. 
                        This is a very common mistake. The true, pure nature of the mind is 
                        so much lost that the impure nature of the mind is often called 'natural'! 
                        The true natural mind is so pure, full of compassion, goodwill. </span></p>

                        you are saying the same thing! It is the wrong nature in which you are 
                        involved. If somebody dies, no crying. Crying doesn't solve any problem. 
                        All those moments when you have been crying you are sowing seeds of 
                        crying. Nature wouldn't see why you are crying, nature only sees what 
                        seed you have sowed and the seed of crying will only bring more crying..</span></p>

                        are harming that person also because wherever this person has taken 
                        his next birth, wherever this person may be, you are sending vibrations 
                        of crying. So poor person, so much agitated. He gets vibrations of misery. 
                        Instead of that, at the end of a 10-day Vipassana course, you are taught 
                        how to send metta, the vibrations of love and compassion. He or she 
                        will be happy. Wherever you are, your metta vibrations will touch this 
                        person. By giving metta, instead of crying, you will be helping this 
                        person. </span></p>

                        Life is to enjoy wholesome things. But not with an attachment to anything. 
                        You remain equanimous and enjoy, so that when you miss it you smile 
                        : " I knew it was going away. It has gone away. So what? " Then only 
                        are you really enjoying life. Otherwise, you get attached, and if you 
                        miss it, you roll in misery. So no misery. In every situation be happy. </span></p>

                        seems so if you have experienced only the wrong habit-pattern of an 
                        impure mind. But it is natural for a pure mind to remain fully equanimous. 
                        An equanimous, pure mind is full of love, compassion, healthy detachment, 
                        goodwill, joy. Equanimity is purity. Learn to experience that. </span></p>

                        of reacting you learn to act, to act with a balanced mind. Vipassana 
                        meditators do not become inactive, like vegetables. They learn how to 
                        act positively. If you can change your life pattern from reaction to 
                        action, then you have attained something very valuable. And you can 
                        change it by practising Vipassana. </span></p>

                        can be without equanimity. With the base of craving one becomes fully 
                        concentrated. But that kind of samadhi is not right samadhi. That is 
                        with the base of impurity. But if the samadhi is with equanimity, then 
                        it gives wonderful results, because the mind is pure and concentrated, 
                        so it is powerful with purity. It cannot do anything that will harm 
                        you or harm others. But if it is powerful with impurity, it will harm 
                        others, it will harm you. So equanimity with samadhi is helpful. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">First 
                        of all, don't try to change the other person. Try to change yourself. 
                        Somebody is trying to make you miserable. But you are becoming miserable 
                        because you are reacting to this. If you learn how to observe your reaction, 
                        then nobody can make you miserable. Any amount of misery from others 
                        cannot make you miserable if you learn to be equanimous deep inside. 
                        Vipassana will help you. Once you become free from misery inside, this 
                        will also start affecting others. The same person who was harming you

                        no. Total fasting is not good for this technique. Neither total fasting 
                        nor overeating. It is a middle path. Eat less - what is necessary for 
                        the body - that's all. Fasting you can do later on just for your body's 
                        sake - that's another question. But for meditation, fasting is not necessary. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When 
                        you eat meat or something, then this being - animal or fish or whatever 
                        it is - for its whole life was generating nothing but craving, aversion, 
                        craving, aversion. After all, human beings can find some time when they 
                        can come out of craving and aversion. These beings cannot come out of 
                        it. So every fibre of their body is vibrating with craving and aversion. 
                        And you yourself want to come out of craving, aversion and you are giving 
                        an input to all of that. So what sort of vibrations you will have. That 
                        is why it is not good. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">When 
                        you come to a Vipassana course, only vegetarian food is served. But 
                        we don't say that if you take non-vegetarian food, you will go to hell. 
                        It is not like that. Slowly, you will come out of eating meat, like 
                        thousands of Vipassana students have. You will naturally find there 
                        is no more need for you to have non-vegetarian food. Your progress in 
                        Vipassana will certainly be better if you are vegetarian. </span></p>

              <p>According to some credible sources, it is more likely that Buddha died of reasons other than food poisoning. The translation from the sutra is not clear cut and subject to interpretation, and it is often wrongly misunderstood. But one thing for sure, it wasn't a painless death. The Buddha suffered pain like the rest of humanity, but he has transcended all sufferings. Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional. Also, he undergoes clinical death like all of us.</p>
              <p>Also, you must have forgotten our earlier discussion.... the goal of a Buddhist is not to ascend to heaven, because to us any material or even non-material <strong>conditioned </strong>realms are impermanent, and all births are subject to birth and death. We do not seek a temporary enjoyment in heaven, even though it is possible through cultivation of good karma. But that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>not</strong></span> our ultimate goal.</p>
              <p>Our goal is the final end of suffering, it is to realise our Buddha Nature and abide in the awareness of ultimate reality, freed from all ignorance, afflictions, and sufferings. It is like a bright sun uncovered when the clouds dissipates. The bright sun is a metaphor of our nature which is pure awareness and emptiness inseparable.</p>
              <p>When an Arhat achieves Nirvana, it is likened to the subsiding of all ocean waves. Samsara and the cycle of rebirth in the six realms is ended right there. (note that heaven is still a realm within the 6 realms, it is the highest realm) All thoughts and experiences are like waves on the ocean. When the Arhat achieves the personal cessation without remainder (nirvana without remainder), it is as if all waves subsides and stops arising, because the winds (conditions) stopped blowing. In this case, the winds of ignorance and afflictions has been eradicated (through insight/awakening) and no longer serves as a condition for birth and death -- hence, nirvana is the absence of further conditions (for birth, and suffering). But the ocean has no coming and no going, nirvana is not a movement elsewhere, only a subsiding back into our true nature, our Buddha-Nature, our Source reality, even though it has never really left.</p>
              <p>(btw,
                  Nirvana has two levels: Nirvana with remainder, experienced after
                  Arhatship is attained where ignorance and afflictions has ceased but
                  not the body/mind functioning, and Nirvana without remainder,
                  experienced after the Arhat experiences clinical death where the
                  body/mind functioning stops -- yet he has already achieved the
                  deathless)</p>
              <p>So, questions such as "Where does the liberated person goes after death?" does not apply. 'Coming', 'going' are all impressions, all illusory mental constructs and projections without any reality, yet we are under a spell and can't see the unreality of it all (that they are just our false projections without any reality), just like we cannot see we are dreaming and that the dream character are actually just mental projections, while we are in the dream. <strong>It is identification with the waves on the ocean as separate, finite entities that we ignorantly perceive coming and going.</strong> In actuality, our true nature (Buddha-Nature) is likened to the entire vast ocean without separation, there is no coming and going. It is flowing and everchanging according to conditions, and yet it is a <span style="font-family: arial;">happening without movement, change without going anywhere. Life is </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">timeless continuity
                                                          (timeless as in vividness in present moment but change and continue
                                                          like a wave pattern). There is no changing thing, only change.</span><span style="font-family: arial;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">In your pure direct experience in every moment, you have not and will never experience coming and going, unless you cross reference your experience, and through the cross referencing creating the false impression of a solid entity 'self', of 'duality', of objective reality, which in your imagination are real objects/entities subject to birth and death, coming and going -- that is how the fear comes in. This cannot be understood logically but only through intuitive awareness of your direct experience. But if your true nature is realised, you will overcome all conceptual fear including even the fear of eventual physical death because the false view of a separate self is seen through, eradicated, through awakening of insight.</span></p>
              <p>But, the ocean has always been the ocean regardless of how many waves arise and subsides. All experiences, regardless whether a waveless ocean or an ocean full of wave, are all just made of wetness. Our Buddha-Nature is like that. It is the entirety of the ocean as a seamless whole, it is the luminous-emptiness nature of all experiences and even when there is no experience, it is so.</p>
              <p>In Mahayana's understanding, we do not seek personal nirvana of an Arhat but to come back with this spiritual awareness of our true nature, devoid of sufferings, to guide and save other sentient beings with a Great Compassion for all sentient beings. This is the practice of the Bodhisattva. The final culmination is the goal of Buddhahood. The Buddha is not only awakened, liberated and freed from sufferings, but is also omniscient and has all skillful means to guide sentient beings to Nirvana. A Buddha is not just an ordinary Arhat, for he has attained Anuttarasamyaksambodhi.</p>

              <p>Thusness, 22 Jun 2006, <a href="/forums/1728/topics/196664">Is God A Thing?</a></p>
              <p>This is an interesting topic and since it is allowed to discuss
                                              more about God in a Buddhism forum, I would like to talk a little
                                              more about the experience of 'AMness" in all things. <img title="Razz" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz"><br> <br> Like a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into
                                              nothingness. When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the
                                              illusionary nature of the individuality, subject-object division
                                              does not take place. A person experiencing Â“AMnessÂ” will find
                                              Â“AMness in everythingÂ”. What is it like?<br> <br> Being free individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all
                                              phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness.
                                              The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ residing anywhere,
                                              neither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground
                                              reality for all phenomenon to take place. Even the moment of
                                              subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that
                                              reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it can be. We cannot
                                              lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and
                                              re-emerges from it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming
                                              and going. This "AMness" is Â“GodÂ”. <img title="Smile" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>
              <p>-------------</p>
              <p>Note: AMness is still not the final realisation, is still not the realisation of non-duality and emptiness. It is the beginning of realising our Buddha-Nature.</p>

              <p>No traditions in Buddhism practices idol worshipping, or in fact any worshipping.</p>
              <p>All traditions however have made representatives of Buddha in figures and images, but they are not worshipped. Just like bowing to an image is just a form of respect but not 'worshipping'.</p>
              <p>Also, when people talk about 'Mahayana Buddhism', they usually mistake/relate it to be Chinese folks tradition, but they are really a world apart. This is due to their ignorance of Buddhism.</p>
