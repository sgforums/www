Theravadin--The Buddha took a vow before a previous Buddha eons ago to follow the path of the bodhisattva (basically "Buddha-in-training) and become a Buddha himself. With this strong vow and aspiration he went through many many lifetimes accumulating merit, performing virtuous deeds, and dedicating the merit so that he may benefit beings by becoming a Buddha. So, when the Buddha took his final birth, he was not an ordinary person, but one who had an enormous store of merit and wisdom, and was inclined to practice that path. The circumstances were right, and he finished the path in his life as Gautama.<br><br>2. Mahayana/Vajrayana--The Buddha is basically an emanation of the Buddha Vairocana, who goes through the drama (as all Buddhas do) of being born a prince, renouncing his kingdom, and realizing in order to train sentient beings.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is more that another "religion" or "spiritual path". The Lord Buddha Gotama's greatest contribution was not the introduction of yet another system of thought or practices but rather a way of life with the view of seeing things as they Truly are. Man was now released from the clutches of some unseen forces that he could not understand or harness.<br><br>The Greatness of the Lord Buddha Gotama is reflected by His magnanimous contributions to the world that was then beset with <strong>social injustices, political turbulences, economic inequalities, spiritual decadences and religious dogmatism</strong>. While the very fabric of society was being pulled asunder and lead to confusion by economic, cultural, political and religious forces beyond the control of many, His teachings and methods reveal attempts to heal rather than hurt; determination to freedom rather than shackling; endeavoring to release rather than restrict; consolidation rather than fragmentation; unifying rather than diversifying; the promotion of peace rather than discord; wisdom rather than intellectualization.</div>

What the Buddha taught is that we ourselves can get enlightened ourselves, and that is the point... our Buddha Nature is already wholly complete.. just that it is obscured by a layer of illusions.. and Buddhist practise is to see through that illusion, to purify the mind, clear the layer of dust on the bright round mirror (our buddha nature)<br><br>Studying of scripture is quite important but not essential, I mean you need to know what Buddhism is teaching about, you need to know the fundamentals, but pretty much most of the sutras are for you to <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>authenticate</strong></span> your experience with it. So the main point is to practise.. and authenticate your experiences with the scriptures. But if you realise the Essence of Buddhism, which is timeless, you will know it all... Buddhism isn't something you can just intellectually understand and 'that's it', and just gaining more academic knowledge without  experience and insights may even bring more confusion. So practising is most important... no enlightened persons reach realisation through academic studies alone..<br><br>As my experienced friend (Thusness) said... <span style="font-style: italic;">If you can't understand and see all of the teachings taking place right Now, then it is not true knowledge.</span></div>

Many people don't even know what is a Buddhist. A Buddhist is one who follows the Buddhadharma and has taken refuge in the triple gems: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. Many of them are merely 'IC-Buddhist' who mistaken what they are practising as Buddhism, even though they are Chinese Folks tradition or Taoist. These people usually have no knowledge at all of Buddhist teachings.<br><br>The custom of not eating beef is linked with Hinduism and Chinese folks culture. Because they do not forget the hard work that cows have helped in their agriculture. Also, the Hindus treat cows as holy animals.<br><br>Actually Buddha did not particularly single out beef as not to be eaten. However, non-vegetarian Buddhists should eat meat under 5 conditions:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm</a><br><br>....Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter .....</blockquote>In this way, the meat is karmically purer.</div>

In fact, there are places whereby it's only served by one feeder bus, which will probably take up to 1 hour or more to come by.<br><br>Driving a car is just a mode of transportl for them to get from point A to point B in the shortest possible time.  In fact, if you noticed, most of the time, they were ferried by their followers rather than driving a car.  They will drive only when necessary.<br><br>Most of the Sanghas practises prudent when it comes to devotee's donations.  Of course, I can't deny that there were few who don't, but who are we to judge them when we, practising buddhist, don't even follow the teachings of budda in the first place.</div>
