Does that mean I will be sent to Hell or be punished for harming the animals?</div></blockquote>No lah, not sent to hell. I also eat meat.. though I don't eat a lot lah. Like I said earlier on...<br><br><blockquote>There is karma for eating meat... and it is recommendable that we become vegetarian... but if we are not vegetarian (like myself) we can follow the five clean meat:<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter...</span><br><br>In this way, the karma is not as strong as if we eat 'impure meat' because we have not directly caused or witnessed the killing.</blockquote>------------<br><br><blockquote>Also , is it true that if you do more good deeds than bad ones, you will be reborn as human?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></blockquote>In general it might be like this... but it also depends. Lets say in your life you did many good deeds, but one day out of anger you killed someone... or caused a lot of suffering to others. In this case you will still create the karma of falling into the 3 lower realms including hell. That's why there's a Buddhist saying that one thought of anger can destroy all our merits. On the other hand there's a saying 'if you put down the knife, you attain Buddhahood instantaneously'... actually one is still far from Buddhahood, but in that very moment, your intrinsic, radiant and pure Buddha Nature which is already wholly complete and ever-present but never noticed, your awakened nature/pure awareness, shines through and reveals itself... thus the meaning of 'attain Buddhahood instantaneously'. Which is why a total transformation of ourselves is very important... and that is to bring the awakened, awareness of the Buddha into our lives... which my master calls it 'yu fo tong zai' or <span style="font-style: italic;">'be with Buddha'</span>.. and to be with Buddha (Buddha is a sanskrit word which means 'Aware' or the 'Awakened One') is to be at one with our Buddha Nature, which is pure awareness. This awareness is like the lamp that can dispell thousands of years of darkness (ignorance). With this awareness in our lives, we will not create further unvirtuous karma, and will be on the path towards enlightenment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Blessed Buddha once took up a little bit of soil on his fingernail<br>and asked: What do you think, Bhikkhus, which is more: The little bit<br>of soil on my fingernail or this great planet earth?<br>Venerable Sir, the great planet earth is much more. The little bit of<br>soil that the Blessed One has taken up on his fingernail is a trifle...<br>It is not calculable, does not bear any comparison, does not amount<br>even to a minute microscopic fraction of this great planet Earth!!!<br>The Blessed Buddha then made his forceful point clear by saying:<br>Similarly, Bhikkhus: So few humans are reborn among human beings!</span><br><br>If we can choose where we want to be reborn in samsara, human realm would be the best choice because we have the best opportunity here to practise the dharma and awaken. Through practising the dharma, purifying our minds and attaining insights into  our true nature, we can gain enlightenment and liberation from the cycles of samsara and samsaric rebirth, and we can attain liberation from all sufferings into the highest bliss of nirvana.</div>

It is not surprising that people will tend to become more rational in thinking, and i don't see anything wrong or bad in becoming more rational rather than being more superstitious. In fact, i find that it is better to be more rational than rely on very personal 'feelings' or 'impulses', which actually arise from emotional thoughts and can be very unpredictable. Rational people tend to be atheists for the same reason. Rational people tend to score higher in IQ tests, and there is an inverse correlation between being religious and being intelligent - i.e. the more intelligent a person is, the less likely he is religious. It's no wonder that an overwhelming majority of scientists are not religious.<br><br>It is quite unlikely that a rational person will reject an idea if the evidence is placed before him. For example, if a person suggests that he can read my mind and he actually is able to do it accurately every time, then no matter how doubtful it sounds, i will seriously consider whatever he has to say.<br><br>Did Jesus and Prince Siddartha ever existed? I think they did, although i have no way to be 100% sure, since i can only rely on historical records. Is it very important? I would say not at all.<br><br>Whatever happened in the past may seem important to some people, but i'd prefer to think that whatever that is said is much more important - what can we learn from what was left behind? Is what was being said/taught correct?<br><br>IMHO, based on what was taught, i would tend to agree more with what the Buddha taught - he appears to be much more wise and understanding than his counterpart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I also agree to a certain extent that some scientific studies seem to be in-line with what the Buddha had taught - although IMHO it was too vague (perhaps not meant to be in detail watever...).<br><br>@AEN:<br>I would very much like to know more about 'enlightened people' and 'psychics' that you mentioned. How do you distinguish a person as being enlightened? When u said 'enlightened', are they on par with the Buddha? As for psychics, exactly what abilities do they have? Can you give more details, or better yet more solid evidence?<br><br></div></blockquote>How would a person even begin to understand the scientifically-proven 4 dimensional space if he or she needs to physically "see" (with eyes) in order to believe it exist? Taking this to the extreme, string theory (yes, still controversial but avantgarde no doubt) suggests there are actually 11 dimensions altogther. It does make me think about the limitation of human senses to understand the world around us. Thus this is the basis for my suggestion that those who rely too much on their senses are relatively lower (to be politically correct) on the intelligence pecking order.</div>

You get sick of Buddhism because you never practise, so nothing good comes out of it. You may know certain things, but you never practise, then there is no use. As I posted in the Daily Buddhist Verses:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">"If you're completely new, then it's good to have information. Good to study, good to be academical and critical. But the point of studying &amp; being academical &amp; critical, is so that you can find the path, and then practice."<br><br>Dharma joke: Meditation without study is like handicapped person trying to climb a mountain.<br><br>DKR replied, "But [those who study without meditating] try to grow 1000 arms, but they don't climb mountain, so what's the point?"<br><br>- DKR @ Kalu Rinpoche's monastery opening ceremony, 16 April 2007</div></blockquote>Another thing is meditation must not only be limited to sitting meditation, because if you only practise meditation in sitting, then what about the rest of the 23 hours of the day? We have to practise in daily living as well.. be constantly meditative.<br><br>2) Take part in dharma activities and attend dharma classes and talks regularly. Like an electronic device running on batteries will eventually run on low power and die out, it needs to be recharged regularly. Attending dharma talks and activities will keep us inspired and learn how to apply our dharma knowledge in everyday living. You haven't been going any dharma activities for a year or more.<br><br>3) Read dharma books and listen to dharma CDs. It also has similar functions as 2), and reminds you of the dharma teachings so we can be constantly reminded, as well as refine our understanding of the dharma.<br><br>I think other forummers can add on to the list... including yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With regards to those posts saying 3rd dimension cannot perceive 11th dimension.. in a way that is true... which is why modern science has its limitations.<br><br>Please read this article by Longchen who is an experienced practitioner:<br><br><a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/science-limitation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamdatum.com/science-limitation.html</a><br><br><strong>The Limitation of science in dealing with Reality</strong><br><br>As Beings, the conventional mind only sees interpretations of Ultimate Reality.<br><br>Why is this so? This is because, firstly, sensory data are interpretations (manifested form) of reality. Why are they interpretations and are not the direct experiencing of it (reality)? To illustrate this point let's consider the perception of 2 persons: a color-blind person and one with normal vision. The color-blind person may see images differently from one who is not. So... who is seeing the truth? None. Both are seeing interpretations (manifested form) of the truth. Likewise animals may see and sense things differently from humans.<br><br>Sensory data that are being perceived are in turn cognated by the conventional mind. Again, the conventional mind sees interpretations collected by sensory perception. From the sensory data, the conventional mind conceives the information into things, environments and people, etc.<br><br>Here's a simplified example to illustrate this point:<br><br>By differentiating the changes in colours on the vision sight, the conventional mind cognate edges. Perceiving that the edges are connected, an enclosed area becomes recognised. Next, the enclosed area become perceived as objects, things, entities...<br><br>The conventional mind can only theorizes from its interpretations. Science is based on the theory and concepts derived from the conventional mind.<br><br>Science is just that... conceptual framework for understanding the dynamics of Ultimate Reality... But it can only theorizes using concepts.<br><br>To truly experience Ultimate Reality...one must go beyond thinking (which is theorising) about Reality. We must experience it directly.<br><br>From the way that I have written, some people might have the misconceptions that the Source(Reality) is separated from us. This is clearly not so. It is only the conventional discriminating mind that think in terms of separation and duality. However, the conventional discriminating mind itself is not an entity, but is just the dualistic function of cognition.<br><br>For your necessary discernment.
