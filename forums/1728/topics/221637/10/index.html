The act of reciting Amida's Name is NOT lacking in any way, virtuous roots, blessings and merits, because the Name IS the culmination of Amida's merits and is directed to us. Master Yuan Chao (å…ƒç…§æ³•å¸«) writes in his commentary on the Amitabha Sutra:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Master Yüan-chao's Commentary on the Amida Sutra states:</span>

              <p></p>
              <p>The Tathagata seeks to clarify the excellence of virtue of holding to the Name. First, other good acts are criticized and labeled "small roots of good." If performed without true trust, all meritorious acts - including charity, observance of the precepts, temple construction, making images, worship and chanting, seated meditation, repentance, and ascetic practices - are only small good acts, even though they are directed toward birth with aspiration for the Pure Land. They are not the cause of birth. If one holds steadfast to the Name in accord with this sutra, one will definitely attain birth. We know then that saying the Name is possessed of many roots of good and many merits.</p>
              <p>I formed this understanding long ago, but people hesitated to accept it because of their doubts. Recently, I have obtained a copy of the sutra as engraved on a stone monument at Hsiang-yang and find that this text corresponds perfectly with the truth. Thus people have begun to embrace a deep faith. The inscribed text states:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Good sons and daughters, hearing the teaching of Amida Buddha, solely say the Name single-heartedly, without being disturbed by other thoughts. Because one says the Name, all one's evils are eradicated. It is the act of many roots of good, many virtues, and many merits.</p>

              <p>This is not a personal biased view, this is the state all sentient beings are in, and can be seen and observed.<span><br> ..................<br> <br> What does it mean to shatter our usual way of seeing our life? My
                                      ordinary experience of life is centered around myself. After all, I
                                      am experiencing these ongoing impressions - I can't have your
                                      experience of your life. I always have my own. And what inevitably
                                      happens is that I come to believe that there is an "I" central to
                                      my life, since the experiences of my life seem to be centered
                                      around "I". "I" see, "I" hear, "I" feel, "I" think, "I" have this
                                      opinion. We rarely question this "I." Now in the enlightened state
                                      there is no "I"; there is simply life itself, a pulsation of
                                      timeless energy whose very nature includes -or is - everything.<br> <br> ..................<br> <br> To talk on the razor's edge is to do that; we have once again to be
                                      what we basically are, which is seeing, touching, hearing,
                                      smelling; we have to experience whatever our life is, right this
                                      second. If we're upset we have to experience being upset. If we're
                                      frightened, we have to experience being frightened. If we're
                                      jealous we have to experience being jealous. And such experiencing
                                      is physical; it has nothing to do with the thoughts going on about
                                      the upset.<br> <br> ..................<br> <br> It's not that "I" hear the birds, it's just hearing the birds. Let
                                      yourself be seeing, hearing, thinking. That is what sitting is. It
                                      is the false "I" that interrupts the wonder with the constant
                                      desire to think about "I." And all the while the wonder is
                                      occurring, the birds sing, the cars go by, the body sensations
                                      continue, the heart beating - life is a second-by-second miracle,
                                      but dreaming our I-dreams we miss it. So let's just sit with what
                                      may seem like confusion. Just feel it, be it, appreciate it. Then
                                      we may more often see through the false dream which obscures our
                                      life. And then, what is there?</span></p>

              <p>(By Lama Surya Das)</p>
              <p>Tuesday, June 7th, 2005</p>
              <p>I
              have noticed that if I can change the frame, the picture always looks
              quite different. I wonder what new and high tech specs or special
              eyewear can provide us with Buddha Vision. And more importantly, as my
              wife would want to know: How do they look on me?!</p>
              <p>How would Buddha see this is a good question to ask. Buddhism
              actually has some practices to help us see things through such a divine
              iye.</p>
              <p>My favorite practice of this kind is called Pure Perceptions.
              Cultivating this kind of sacred outlook — dak-nang in Tibetan–helps us
              see the Buddha, the light, the divinity in everyone and everything, and
              to experience this very world we live in as a Buddha field, a Pure Land
              or paradise. Actually this isn’t just something we superimpose upon
              reality, like donning the proverbial rose-colored glasses; instead it’s
              more akin to seeing things as they actually are.</p>
              <p>Pure perception or sacred outlook is something we can practice
              daily, and even moment to moment, as a way of cultivating BuddhaVision,
              a way which purifies and transforms our way of relating to everyone and
              everything. As the Buddha himself said, according to Zen Buddhist
              teaching: “When I was awakened, all were awakened, even the rocks and
              the trees.” We may hear about sacred vision or we may read about it in
              the sutras, in teaching tales or personal anecdotes; we may believe or
              we may wonder and doubt. Yet, we can each come to know that there
              really is a there right here, and sacred vision is accessible, even
              from just a brief visit. A genuine glimpse or spiritual epiphany can
              help.</p>
              <p>An authentic awakening experience — a glimpse of Reality — can
              become our inner guide or pole star. Yet that infinite emptiness — the
              shining void mystics talk about, which is none other than the intrinsic
              Buddha-nature of one’s own heart and mind — is not the end of the path,
              but the beginning of the true path. There is no substitute for such an
              awakening experience — one that gives us a naked glimpse into there.
              This one experience alone can cut through and uproot many of the
              illusions and delusions we have about the nature of reality. Our
              awareness, understanding and perspective fundamentally shifts and we
              come to know pure vision, Buddha vision — just as we know the sun
              exists — firsthand, without needing to see it all of the time. We know
              it’s there from one glimpse. As the poet Kabir sang, “I glimpsed it for
              fifteen seconds and it made me a servant for life.” One glimpse of pure
              vision, sacred outlook, was enough to transform my life and my world.</p>
              <p>Guru Padma Sambhava said, long ago: “Let go into the clear light,
              trust it, merge with it. It is your own true nature. It is home.”</p>
              <p>I myself was once vouchsafed a sacred glimpse of this earth as an
              altar and all who walk upon it as gods and goddesses, dakas and
              dakinis. In fact, this pure vision was so strongly impressed upon my
              consciousness twenty-five years ago, that I can still see it in some
              way right now! Believing is seeing. It was spring in the Catskills,
              1977. My guru the Gyalwa Karmapa was giving an empowerment and blessing
              of land for a new monastery to be built in Putnam County, New York. I’d
              come from my cabin on Woodstock’s Mount Guardian for the day–and what a
              day it was!</p>
              <p>This was the first time that I was literally transported to another
              place, another plane, another reality entirely. His Holiness sat
              radiating infinite light, which both poured out of him and into me, and
              from me into him, at one and the same time, more powerful than a
              thundering waterfall. I was electrified, transformed and I was no more.
              The page had been turned, the binding consumed. When I returned, the
              chanting was winding down and everything fell back into place. Jamgon
              Rinpoche smiled knowingly, and all was well. I heard a voice in my head
              whisper: The Buddha of Infinite Light is not in the Western Pure Land;
              he is right here in the world. I knew my guru was that Buddha, and
              forever with me and within me. Infinite light was before my eyes for
              several days before I drifted back to my normal state of
              semi-consciousness. I was in this world but definitely not of it. This
              must be what Sakyamuni Buddha meant when he said, in the Diamond Sutra,
              that life is like a dream, a mirage, a sitcom. For things are not what
              they seem to be; nor are they otherwise.</p>
              <p>I have learned, it’s easier to visit the Pure Lands than to live
              there. Although I can still see it before me, I find myself trying to
              return. Undoubtedly I am looking Upwards when I should be looking
              Inwards, seeing more deeply. What we seek, we are - it is all within!
              From that single glimpse, I know as Kabir knew. We are all Buddhas at
              heart–we simply have to recognize that fact. Turn the searchlight, the
              spotlight, Inward.</p>
              <p>I can still hear the voice: This land where we stand is the Pure
              Land, this very body the body of Buddha! So turn the searchlight
              inward, catch a glimpse, and know.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Theravada Buddhist countries like 
                                  Sri Lanka and Burma had no legal statutes against homosexuality 
                                  between consenting adults until the colonial era when they were 
                                  introduced by the British. Thailand, which had no colonial experience, 
                                  still has no such laws. This had led some Western homosexuals 
                                  to believe that homosexuality is quite accepted in Buddhist countries 
                                  of South and South-east Asia. This is certainly not true. In such 
                                  countries, when homosexuals are thought of at all, it is more 
                                  likely to be in a good-humored way or with a degree of pity. Certainly 
                                  the loathing, fear and hatred that the Western homosexual has 
                                  so often had to endure is absent and this is due, to a very large 
                                  degree, to Buddhism's humane and tolerant influence.</span></p>

              <p>Follow and understand the four noble truth and eightfold path.Read the heart sutra,emptyness, or should i say persistency in knowing the so call truth is ignorance, the truth is on ourselves, the truth of our mindfulness, when you understand your truth, you will be enlightened.So I think there is no need to debate on or exchange views as such, as one who practise the Dharma will have many ways to gain knowledge, just that the time has not reach a person to see things more clearly yet.</p>
