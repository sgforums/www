            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by despondent:<br>hello i am back wif more qns...<br><br>1) from buddhism perspective, who will go to heaven?</blockquote>Welcome back <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One who has accumulated lots of virtuous karma -- by practising the 5 precepts, 10 virtuous deeds, filiality to parents, generosity, etc. These are the ways to create the karmic causes for rebirth in celestial realms. However, heaven is not nirvana and is not the ultimate aim of Buddhists.<br><br>The Five Precepts are to refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, consumption of intoxicants, and the Ten Virtuous Deeds are to refrain from killing, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, frivolous and meaningless talk, tale bearing, abusive speech, covetousness, ill-will, perverted views.<br><br><blockquote>2) is there a known number of rebirth cycles b4 someone reaches eternity(nirvana or eternal condemnation in hell)?</blockquote>Certainly, anyone is able to, and eventually will, attain Nirvana but there is no fixed date and time. If one earnestly learns and practises the dharma, then one can attain enlightenment, nirvana, quickly.<br><br>There is no eternal condemnation in hell, because hell is part of the 6 realms of samsara. Nothing is eternal, everlasting in these mundane realms. Although if one may commit extremely heavy karma as to fall into hell for billions of years, at one point his karma will be exhausted and will be able to reborn in other realms.<br><br><blockquote>3) does buddhism teach evolution at all? i have met buddhists who tell me man came from monkeys...</blockquote>Personally I don't think that humans came from monkeys, but I do not reject evolution. You may want to read the URL I provided earlier.<br><br><blockquote>4) who wrote the buddhist scriptures? was it buddha himself?</blockquote>Ananda, the one who has the best memory among all of Buddha's disciples, remembered all the things that Buddha said, and recited it among an assembly of 500 other disciples of the Buddha who were enlightened. This took place shortly after Buddha entered Parinirvana/passed away. It is not written by the Buddha himself.<br><br><blockquote>5) wad r the criterias one muz meet to be considered a buddhist?</blockquote>One must take refuge in the Three Treasures/Triple Gems: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. All Buddhist monasteries/dharma centers do have such taking refuge ceremonies, just as all churches will have baptism taking place from time to time.</div>

The Buddha said:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"There are these six dangers attached to gambling: the winner makes enemies, the loser bewails his loss, one wastes one's present wealth, one's word is not trusted in the assembly, one is despised by one's friends and companions, one is not in demand for marriage, because a gambler cannot afford to maintain a wife.</span><br><br>Regarding drinking, the Buddha said:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There are six dangers attached to addiction to strong drink and sloth-producing drugs.<br><br>* Destruction of oneÂ’s wealth<br>* Involvement in increased quarrelling<br>* Prone to various sicknesses<br>* Subject to disgrace and loss of good name<br>* Subject to indecent exposure of oneÂ’s person<br>* Weakening of the intellect</span><br><br>Smoking have certain degrees of 1), 2), 3), 4), 5)... and even though it is not intoxicating, it causes addiction and strong craving, thus may disturb one's calmness and practise.<br><br><blockquote>wil be back wif moer qns if i have any, thanx to anyone who answer my qns...</blockquote>Will be glad to answer any of your questions, and discuss if necessary. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Cultures and superstitions are cultures and superstitions, in the first place they come from the Chinese folks, while the Buddha's teachings come from India  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> So, it is absolutely clear that they nothing whatsoever to do with Buddhism. Cultures and religions are two different things. Such superstitions are also against the Buddhist teachings, and the Buddha taught none other than the liberation from suffering, finding the highest bliss of Nirvanam, attaining Wisdom, being compassionate, etc. Anything other than that (i.e cultures, superstitions, useless rituals) which do not lead to liberation are shunned and may even be condemned by Buddha.<br><br>Also if need be, I can provide more veritable sources like Eric suggested.<br><br>Oh yes, the definition of a real Buddhist is one that has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. That is the requirement given by Buddha. Most so called Buddhist merely call themselves Buddhist by name but have no idea about Buddhist teachings, and neither have they taken refuge or undergone the refuge ceremony... the closest in Christianity would be baptism.</div>

Celestial/heavenly beings are also inferior to Enlightened ones like Buddha, and take Buddha as their teacher.<br><br><blockquote>See: <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html</a><br><br>Teacher of the Devas<br><br>* I.

Liberation for Humans, Devas, and Brahmas<br>* Notes<br>* Abbreviations<br>* Bibliography</blockquote>In Buddhism heaven is one of the 6 realms of Samsara, it is not eternal, impermanence being the nature of all compounded phenomena.. while Nirvana is the liberation from all Samsaric sufferings and delusions... one who attains nirvana is liberate from rebirth and the 6 realms, rests in the highest bliss of Nirvana beyond time and space.<br><br>Liberation and enlightenment can be attained in this very lifetime through practising Buddhism, and there are countless persons who become enlightened since Buddha's era till this day, some of whom are posting in this forum as well (not me).</div>

First of all, you need to get the facts correct.<br><br>While arguing, argue according to buddhism facts and not personal point of view of a religion unless you are qualified enough. Do not assult each other's religion and have respect for one another's belief.<br><br>U can show them basic buddhism facts with a dharma book while explaining. You have to understand that the mindset of certain people are tough to change and it take patience to explain to them. Thus one without much control over their temper could easily lose their patience and start arguing.Rem to be awared of your state of mind and the feeling arise while explaining to your parents &gt; This is to prevent anger from arising or exploding. As one can take preventative measures before anger or unpleasant feelings escalates towards bursting point.<br><br>And of course, you must have a right intention to begin with while talking to them about buddhism. Erh what is your intention?<br><br>Stay open to other's point of views as the other might be right. Values are judgemental because they are based on individual's conviction of what is right and wrong but it does not represent the balanced and ultimate truth. It is important not to get too attached to your values or gettin too personal while explaining as it might clouded your perception.<br><br>just my 1 ct of opinion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by despondent:<br>to: an eternal now<br><br>hey i understand tat buddha once said tat do nt worship him for he is nt the greatest..there is one greater than him...1stly, did he say sth like tat?</blockquote>The Buddha, born with 32 major marks and 80 minor marks, proclaimed at the moment of his birth that he is the highest, the greatest, the chief of the world... and this is because he is already completely above all the cycles of samsara and all the beings still trapped in the cycles of samsara. Which is why even all the celestial kings, and Brahmas are inferior to him, and treats him as Teacher. He also said <span style="font-style: italic;">'I, the great Seer, am the protector and father of all beings, and all creatures who, childlike, are captivated by the pleasures of the triple world, are my sons.<br><br>- Saddharma Pundarika Sutra'</span><br><br>More on his birth account:<br><br><blockquote>Queen Mahaa Maayaa decided to visit her mother so that she could be with her at the time of the birth of her baby.On the way she stopped at the Lumbini Pleasure Garden to rest. Under a sweet-scented Sal tree, on a full moon day in the month of May, in the year 623 B.C., the Prince was born. The baby Prince took seven steps, and a lotus flower burst through the ground to receive His feet. He made the following announcement:<br><br>"Aggo hamasmi lokassa - "I am the Chief in the world<br>Jettho hamasmi lokassa - There is no equal to me<br>Settho hamasmi lokassa - I am Supreme<br>Ayamanthima jathi - This is my last birth<br>Natthi dani punabbhavo. - " No rebirth for me."<br><br>It is said in the Anagata Vamsa that the next Buddha, Maithreya, will make a similar announcement at His birth.<br><br>The ministers took the Queen and the baby back to Kapilavatthu and King Suddhodana. Many wise men came to see the baby. They said that one day the Prince would either be a King of the world or a Supreme Buddha. The baby Prince was named Siddhaartha Gotama. Siddhaartha means "wish fulfilled" and Gotama was His family name. Seven days after the birth of the Prince, Queen Mahaa Maayaa died. She was born as a Deva by the name of Matu-deva putta in the Tusita Heaven. Her sister, Mahaa Prajaapathi Gotami, took care of the Prince.</blockquote>But at the same time, Buddhists do not worship him, we respect him and treat him as our honoured teacher.. but not seen as a godly, divine figure (celestial beings are inferior to enlightened beings, and also Buddha did not accept the idea of a personal 'Creator' -- I will post on that later and the story of Maha Brahma, the heavenly king who proclaimed himself as all mighty, omniscient God). The Buddha also never claimed divinity -- he said,<br><br><blockquote>"My friend, what are you?<br>Are you a celestial being<br>or a god?"<br><br>"No,"<br><br>said the Buddha.<br><br>"Well, then, are you some kind of magician<br>or wizard?"<br><br>Again the Buddha answered,<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Are you a man?"<br><br>"No."<br><br>"Well, my friend, then what are you?"<br><br>The Buddha replied,<br>"I am awake."</blockquote>The Buddha to us is more an enlightened teacher and role model whom we take refuge in, learn and practise the dharma that the Buddha taught,  and eventually <strong>become enlightened ourselves</strong>. The Buddha was compassionate, he came to spread the dharma leading to liberation and enlightenment, and told everyone that their buddha nature is already wholly complete but yet to unfold and show itself.. and that we could, too, become a perfectly enlightened Buddha.<br><br><blockquote>2ndly, when he said tat was it purely out of humility or was it cos he truly believed tat there was one greater tham him?</blockquote>As said above, he never said that anyone was greater than him. Regarding the idea of God which Buddha did not accept, I am going to post on that in the next post.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all Buddhism does not accept the Judeo-Christian or Hindu (Hindu however considers the personal God to be under the influence of Maya or Illusion and that the true God is beyond the personal Creator, much like Gnostic Christianity) or other world religions' idea that there is a personal Creator, means the Old Testament kind of God that has a personality of its own.. and you can actually meet him up for coffee <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">. If there is a personal Creator it brings a lot of questions into mind. Therefore, Albert Einstein said,<br><br><strong>"Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it transcends a personal God</span>, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural &amp; spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity"</strong><br><br>and..<br><br><strong>Â“If there is any religion that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism.Â”</strong><br><br>Regarding the question of Personal God in Buddhism,<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><br>Slightly edited from the first topic in our forum regarding Creationism: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=141185" rel="nofollow"> How the Brahma believed He was God?</a><br><br>In Buddha's days there were many many different teachings, one popular one was Brahmanism. In fact the Brahma was still worshipped nowadays. Brahma was known to be "The Supreme One, the All-mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of All".<br><br>In Buddhism, the Mahabrahma resides in the 1st Jhana plane, the first plane among the 8 jhanic planes. There were higher realms above where he lives that he was unaware of, and above it all, beyond the 8 Jhanic planes and all Samsaric planes, is Nirvana. Nevertheless all the devas below the 1st Jhana planes considered him as the Creator God. Buddha did not subscribe to the belief of such a notion that the Universe and its Inhabitants were the Creation of the Mahabrahma. He met with the Brahma, asked him questions which he could not answer. Eventually he has taken refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.<br><br>The Buddha was also known to have said this,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create?<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail!</span><br><br>When the previous universe was destroyed and this universe was formed, the Mahabrahma was first to be reborn. Other subsequent brahmas/devas were to be reborn.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'On this, brethren, the one who was first reborn thinks thus to himself: " I am BrahmÃ , the Great BrahmÃ , the Supreme One, the Mighty, the All-seeing, the Ruler, the Lord of all, the Maker, the Creator, the Chief of all, appointing to each his place, the Ancient of days the Father of all that are and are to be. 'These other beings are of my creation. And why is that so? A while ago I thought, 'Would that they might come!' And on my mental aspiration, behold the beings came." DN 1 2:5</span><br><br>In reality, the universe works by the law of Karma and he has no control over the system of karma.<br><br>The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br><br>from <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When he came to know about Sakyamuni Buddha in the human world who speaks of the universal truth, he was curious and arrived at the human world with the intention to debate with the Buddha. The Buddha, with his ability to know another's mind, knew his intention and asked, "You claim to be the creator of the human race and all things in the universe, is this a fact?"<br><br>The king replied, "Yes, it is."<br><br>Buddha continued to question him, "Since you created life, why did you also create death? Is death created by you too?"<br><br>The king paused for while, and thinking that everyone loves life and nobody welcomes death, he replied, "I did not create death."<br><br>Buddha asked him again, "All human beings experience sickness, did you create sickness also?" The king knew that nobody likes to be ill, and he replied, "I did not create illness."<br><br>Buddha asked many questions in succession, but the king denied that he created them. Eventually, he admitted that he did not create the universe and all things in it, and certainly not the human race. The king of heavens was full of regrets and he felt ashamed. Finally, he accepted Buddha as his teacher and invited Him to spread the Dharma in the heavens.</span></blockquote></div>

Instead, like a scientist, the Buddha encouraged the Buddhist practitioners to find out for themselves the truths that the Buddha said, to put it to test, and to see for ourselves, and to get enlightened. Buddhism does not encourage any blind belief and dogmas (see Kalama Sutra), and also encourages analytical questioning -- whether this teaching actually helps us.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Kalama Sutra</strong><br><br>"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching.

Beliefs in divine etc are not important and irrelevant in Buddhism, Buddhism being a man-centered (means having great love and compassion for all sentient being, as well as to practise for one's own spiritual development) rather than God-centered teaching, which is a reason why it is the only religion that does not have a history of having fought religious wars, --<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism.
