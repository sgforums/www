These monks are either:<br><br>1) Vajrayana Monks -- Tibetan monks usually wearing red (and yellow) robes such as these:<br><img src="http://www.cosmicharmony.com/Tibet/DalaiLama/DalaiLama.jpg"><br>(The 14th Dalai Lama)<br><br>2) They are fake monks. These types of "monks" are very common nowadays, they wear monks robes and beg for money out there. No real monks will beg for money outside.<br><br>Can you describe the kind of robes you saw?<br><br>In Buddhism, there are three traditions of Buddhism: Theravada (Thai, Sri Lanka, Burmese traditions), Mahayana (Chinese) and Vajrayana (Tibetan). Monks from the Theravada and Vajrayana traditions are allowed to eat meat, however Theravada monks only receive food by alms giving and not by buying food from coffeeshops. Mahayana monks are vegetarians due to Bodhisattva practices. Tibetan/Vajrayana monks are allowed to eat meat in their culture because Tibet is a very remote, mountainous region which is not suitable for vegetation.<br><br>Even though Buddhists whether from Theravada, Mahayana or Vajrayana traditions are allowed to eat meat, we only eat meat under 5 conditions:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no4a.htm</a><br><br>...Buddha understands the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with an expedient means of embracing Buddhism, those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term basis are permitted to consume meat provided:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter...</blockquote>Under these conditions, the meat is considered 'karmically purer'... because it is not due to direct killing, no direct link with you, the karma is generally lighter. Of course vegetarianism is still recommended. However personally I am not a vegetarian yet. I am from the Mahayana tradition.</div>

Anyway logically speaking Theravada monks should eat in their monastery, not outside.. since they receive alms at their temples. (In Thailand they may receive outside, don't know) Another thing is, Theravada monks <strong>cannot buy food</strong>, they can only receive alms, food, medicine, in a begging bowl from lay Buddhists. They usually do that in their own monastery in Singapore. Also people interested in donating to these Theravada "monks" should always remember that <strong>Theravada monks are not allowed to receive money, and if people donate money to him, that means he is fake.</strong><br><br>Fake monks are so common nowadays on the street.

However most monasteries and dharma centers have activities/services every week.. like Dharma Talks and other activities. To listen and learn from a dharma teacher is very important.. it would help a lot if we have a very enlightened teacher to guide us on our path to enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>4) wif regards to the fake monks...is there any kind of judgment or punishment tat awaits ppl like them???</blockquote>In Buddhism, karma is not judgement but a natural law. They are intentional action (karma), and these intentional action will all bear consequences in the future. But these fake monks have committed unwholesome karma and therefore they will indeed suffer bad consequences as a result. I am not sure of what kind of results, but not as bad as some people have suggested in the forum (like going to hell for a kalpa).</div>

The Buddha can only point the way to the moon.. we have to go there ourselves.<br><br><blockquote>btw, since buddha is perfect, then does tat mean tat no one in the past, present n future will ever join him as a perfect being? in other words, there will be no one ever who can be exactly like buddha?</blockquote>Every single person will eventually attain Buddhahood and our Buddha Nature is already wholly complete, only that we have yet to realise it. It is like a clear bright mirror which is obscured due to a layer of dust - of mental defilements. Practising Buddhism is like using a cloth and wipe the mirror of the dust to reveal the clear shining mirror beneath... our Buddha Nature.<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha is not the first Buddha, and neither will he be the last. The next Buddha to appear will be Maitreya Bodhisattva, who is currently still waiting, residing in Tush1ta Heaven. However even before the next Buddha, there are uncountable other enlightened beings who have lived/are living in this planet. For example during the Buddha's period alone there are thousands of Arhants. Arhats are those who realised the ultimate truth and attained Liberation from samsara and all sufferings of life and Samsara, and the cycle of rebirth, and enters the highest bliss Nirvana. Even today, there are many many enlightened people... and they are not just the Buddhist masters, dharma teachers and so on.. they are ordinary practitioners of the Buddhadharma. Even in my forum, there are also several forummers who post here who have attained enlightenment. This is something that is definitely achievable, and the aim of every Buddhist is of course to attain Enlightenment. That is why we practise Buddhism.<br><br>The difference between an Arhat and a Buddha is that an Arhat only strived for his own liberation, and therefore after attaining Arhatship he just rests in his Nirvanic bliss. A Bodhisattva practitioner (famous examples are like Guan Yin) who have awakened to the Ultimate Truth but does not simply rest in Nirvana, has great compassion and great vows to help and save other sentient beings and practise the Bodhisattva way that eventually leads to Buddhahood. This is of course a much longer and harder task than to simply attain self liberation as an Arhat, but is the way leading to perfect Buddhahood. There are many Bodhisattvas living today as well.</div>

Such Insights gained through Buddhist practise will completely shatter your previous illusions and perspective of yourself and the world... and you will be in awe that reality is really quite different from our everyday consciousness and what we used to think reality is. They will describe an awakening into non-duality of subject and object, where the illusion of a separate permanent 'self' is seen as an illusion, and an all pervading infinite pure Presence/pure awareness is experienced, transcending thoughts and perception, time and space, space-like, like the vast sky, boundless, etc etc... and that Buddha Nature is ONE with all sentient being's, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas' Buddha Nature and the Dharma Nature of the entire universe.. we, all phenomena, are EQUAL in essence... like clouds, vapour, ocean, river, are all made of the same substance... water. It has One Taste... and that is our true self, who we really are, pure awareness, the clear light that illuminates everything but itself featureless, formless, and many other endless descriptions, etc. Buddhist teachings such as "Emptiness", "No Self", "Non-Duality", "Intrinsic Luminosity", "Nirvana", or even other descriptions such as "Consciousness", "Pure Awareness", "Tao", "Brahman", "Keter", "Buddha Nature", "Buddha Mind", "One Taste", "Christ Consciousness", "God", "Godhead", "Allah", "The Kingdom of Heaven Within", "Spirit", the "I AM that I AM" or our "true self that is no self", whatsoever, and all these poetic metaphors and attempts as descriptions are finally directly understood at an experiential and intuitive level, with no possibility of doubts. As a result of such insights/awakening one attains liberation, bliss, clarity which is lasting and carries on throughout one's life and forever. Therefore, an enlightened person will know he is enlightened. A Bodhisattva practitioner however does not stop at his own liberation, but vows to help other sentient beings and complete his training in the perfections of the 10 paramitas (the ten virtues) and eventually to attain perfect Buddhahood.<br><br>I am not enlightened yet (I've only been a Buddhist for a few years... and just turned 17 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">)... so I can only paraphrase others' descriptions. But even before this great awakening, we can see many benefits from Buddhist practise.. including more awareness of ourselves (i.e our own thoughts and behaviors) and others (compassion, love, forgiveness, etc), more calmness, happiness, more liberated, fearless (like overcoming your fears of death), etc. Life wld be different if one practises the dharma. As I said before, "Once you have a taste of how practicing dharma results in, you will never be able to resist the path, you can't forget it, you can't discard it. There is a natural compulsion to continue practicing all the way to enlightenment."</div>
