                          contradicts original buddhism…original buddhism which is embraced

                          reincarnation of a man n since he became buddha, he has ceased to

              <p>there was a small portion abt zen buddhism…wad r ur comments on
                          it n how different/similar it is from original buddhism???</p>

              <p>10th
                  incarnation of Vishnu? That's some tales the Hindus came up with to fit
                  Buddha into their pantheon of gods, but it is not true. No Buddhist believe in it, and
                  Buddha has never claimed that. Buddha has gone beyond
                  gods/devas/brahmas/celestial planes, he has awakened and is liberated
                  from all the cycle of rebirth in all planes of existence.</p>
              <p>Also,
                  Guan Yin never contradicts Theravada Buddhism. Why? Though Guan Yin is
                  not mentioned in Theravadin scriptures, they accept the idea that one
                  can practice as a Bodhisattva and attain Buddhahood. However, they put
                  more focus on attaining personal liberation, the path leading to
                  Arhatship.</p>
              <p>Whereas, Guan Yin is a Bodhisattva role model in
                  Mahayana Buddhism, Mahayana being the school of Buddhism which
                  emphasizes on great compassion for all beings, emphasizes not just
                  personal liberation but liberation for all beings through practicing as
                  a Bodhisattva, eventually attaining Buddhahood. This path is spoken in
                  Theravada but just not focused.</p>
              <p>But then, Guan Yin has
                  become very universal and even the Taoists fit Guan Yin into their
                  pantheon and treated him/her like a god. Guan Yin is not a deity, is
                  not a god, he/she is a great Bodhisattva on the path to Buddhahood and
                  we as Buddhists wants to follow her example... she symbolizes great
                  compassion and so we all must practice that.</p>
              <p>As for Zen: it is just as valid as any other orthodox schools of Buddhism. Zen emphasizes on directness and intuitive experience of our Buddha-Nature transcending words, concepts and theory. 'Directness' is perhaps what is unique about Zen, but it is in essence the same as any other schools.</p>

              <p>When they see a buddhist bowing to a buddha statue, they only see the physical appearance, they can't see our mind and attitude. They treat this physical appearance as the essence that's why it leads to wrong view.<br>People salute to national flag, is the flag just a flag?<br>Christian also pray in front of cross, can we say they pray to idol?<br>When one bow to buddha statue, he treat it as a real buddha. The physical movement is a method to help the person visualize, at the same time reduce his self attachment and develop devotion to buddha.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">It is stated in the 
                          Diamond Sutra, “He who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in 
                          sounds is on a heterodox path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).” 
                          It further states that, “All forms are but illusions, in seeing 
                          that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata”. It is only 
                          when we have attained a certain advanced level in the learning and practising 
                          of Buddhism that we will be able to understand the profound meaning of 
                          these verses. If you were to tell a person who has just started to learn 
                          Buddhism that learning Buddhism is like these verses, then he would find 
                          them too profound. He would not be able to make out what Buddha is like. 
                          Of course, he knows what human beings are like and quite naturally he 
                          will assume that only those who are similar in form to human beings are 
                          Buddhas. We can say that this is correct, but we can also say that this 
                          is wrong. For example, kindergarten teachers may use drawings of an old 
                          man and old woman when teaching the young children about grandfathers 
                          and grandmothers. Thereafter, when the children see other old folks in 
                          such resemblance they know that they are someone else’s grandparents. 
                          But, to university students it would be inappropriate for professors to 
                          use the same approach when talking about such blood relationships. <br> <br> It is the same in learning Buddhism. When we encourage a new student of 
                          Buddhism to pay respect to the Buddha in the temple or monastery, he will 
                          not be frightened when he sees that the Buddha is the same as a human 
                          being. At the same time, when he sees that the Buddha and Bodhisattva 
                          images are so dignified and compassionate, it will give rise to a feeling 
                          of joy and reverence and lead him to learn Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Often we come across 
                          people who have been learning Buddhism for a long time saying that they 
                          saw this Buddha or that Bodhisattva in their dreams. Initially, when we 
                          do not know about their level of understanding of Buddhism, we may praise 
                          them by saying, “Oh! You have such good affinity with Buddha and 
                          Bodhisattva that you can even see their images!” But it is wrong 
                          if we always praise them like this. If they report dreams like this for 
                          more then 3 times, you have to tell them, “The Mara is here, you 
                          have seen the Mara! All the Zen masters advise to obliterate the Buddha 
                          when the Buddha appears, and obliterate the Mara when the Mara appears 
                          [1].” We cannot praise them any more because they have already developed 
                          an attachment to forms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the same way, when 
                          we are dealing with people who are already advanced in Buddhism, we should 
                          use the method of the Diamond Sutra rather than the kindergarten method: </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: normal;">“He 
                          who sees me (Buddha) in forms or seeks me in sounds is on a heterodox 
                          path and cannot see the Tathagata (Buddha).”<br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #cc3300; font-size: normal;">“All 
                          forms are but illusions, in seeing that all forms are illusory, one sees 
                          the Tathagata.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At this level, people 
                          will realize that Buddhism is the only religion that eradicates superstition 
                          and attachment to all forms. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Critics often say 
                          that the Buddha image is an idol. They criticize that Buddhism worships 
                          idols. In reality, the cross, the Jesus Christ image and Mother Mary, 
                          they are also idols. In this sense, is there a religion that does not 
                          worship idols? Therefore, we cannot say that Buddhism is the only religion 
                          that worships idols. The fact is that only Buddhism does not worship idols. 
                          The Diamond Sutra states, “All forms are but illusions, in seeing 
                          that all forms are illusory, one sees the Tathagata.”! </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The essence of the 
                          Buddha, the Buddha Nature is omnipresent in the space of the Dharma realm, 
                          and the Dharma Nature is omnipresent in the space. </span></p>
