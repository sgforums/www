              <p>I agree totally that there are many unenlightened people who are
                  selfless. However for easy secular (and/or for beginner Buddhists)
                  understanding, using the word 'selfless' to explain enlightment of
                  the most basic level by any man is better
                  than explaining concepts like prajna wisdom, anatta
                  or emptiness. It is more straightforward, more direct than having
                  to spend two or more pages on the subject or more than a few days
                  to properly explain them.</p>
              <p>Any person who truly understands emptiness and is able to
                  practice non-attachment in every aspect of his/her life will
                  essentially be a Arahant or a Buddha. Ask him/her any question, he
                  will be able to answer you in a way that never leaves any doubts
                  and has the utmost consideration for your level of understanding
                  and acceptance. He/she will not be agitated by your stubborness,
                  impatience or insults.</p>
              <p>If you meet someone like that who can behave like that to
                  everyone throughout his/her lifetime, that person can be considered
                  to be enlightened, but whether he is an Arahant, Bodhisattva or
                  Buddha, no one can tell except for those who are fellow Arahants
                  and above.</p>

              <p>I actually really disagree the use of terms such as 'selflessness'
              to explain the state of enlightened beings, because the truth is
              selflessness is just a virtue that may be present in non-enlightened
              beings as well, and many of these 'selfless' people have accumulated
              the wholesome karma to be reborn in celestial abodes. But no
              enlightenment.</p>
              <p>When we guide people on Buddhism, it is best
              not to mislead and confuse them... No-self and Emptiness may sound
              confusing to a beginner, but even if we were not to explain in detail,
              at least we should make our stance clear that enlightenment has to do
              with realisations of the ultimate nature of reality, and not merely
              some virtues that belongs to the 4 brahma viharas.</p>

                              Buddha's time, it will not be so in our Dharma-Ending age.</p>

                              liberation. Only by reciting/contemplating the Buddha's way or
                              name, can one gain deliverance from endless cycles of birth and
                              death)</p>
              <p> This well-known Buddhist quote is supported by the Larger
                              Amitabha sutra (æ— é‡�å¯¿ç»�). The verse is as follows:</p>
              <p>The Buddha further said, "I have expounded this teaching for the
                              sake of sentient beings and enabled you to see Amitayus and
                              all in his land. Strive to do what you should.</p>
              <p>After I have passed into Nirvana, do not allow doubt to arise.
                              <span style="color: #0000ff;">In the future, the Buddhist
                              scriptures and teachings will perish.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">But, out of pity and compassion, I
                              will especially preserve this sutra and maintain it in the world
                              for <em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">a hundred years
                              more</span></strong></em>. Those beings who encounter it will
                              attain deliverance in accord with their
                              aspirations</span>.</span></p>

              <p>All teachings will disappear except for those that preaches the
                              Amitabha Buddha's Pureland and the methods to achieve rebirth in
                              that Buddhaland.</p>
              <p>This is how severe the situation is in our Dharma-ending age. It
                              is not to scare anyone or to discourage anyone, but to see the real
                              alternatives before us.</p>
              <p>Although many have gained enlightenment as
                              pointed out by AEN, this is still considerably very
                              insignificant when compared to the Buddha's time or considering the
                              total population of the world or true Buddhist practitioners
                              in our era.</p>
              <p>Those enlightened beings that we may or may not know or heard
                              from others, we do not know if all of them has indeed attained
                              complete liberation from countless cycles of birth and death,
                              for which in my opinion and from Buddhist sutras would be
                              considered least basic and true achievement of one's
                              enlightment.</p>
              <p>If any dharma door that you learn at this lifetime cannot
                              guarantee that you gain liberation from life and death for future
                              lifetimes, then it can be considered to be irrelevant or useless
                              for you.</p>
              <p>All dharma doors preached by the Buddha are right in that they
                              all lead to liberation; but it is dependent on the individual's
                              karmic affinity and good karma. Choosing the wrong dharma door will
                              mean you may take an unnecessarily long time to be finally free
                              from rebirth, enlightment in the form of Arahant or Bodhisattva is
                              just a convenient reference point.</p>

              <p>What is shown in Amitabha Sutra clearly does NOT apply to this times, because the true dharma and all the sutras has not been lost. We can only say that we are in the process of dharma ending, but not reached the true ending of dharma. As my taiwanese teacher said when dharma is truly reachings its ends, the signs will appear -- robed sangha is lost, sutra is lost (Amitabha Sutra is the last to survive). Clearly this is not the time yet and true dharma is still flourishing, so all the more we should cherish.</p>
              <p>I think enlightenment is a real possibility, and there are many (not few as you said) that have attained enlightenment. And I happen to know that a number of them are fully liberated from Samsara (that means they are Arhants or great Bodhisattvas). If you commit yourself to your path and practice, and best if you have guidance by an enlightened person, being enlightened in a few years or 10+ years is not difficult.</p>
              <p>Of course there are other alternatives, that is why we should practice both Wisdom and Blessings at the same time. My Taiwanese teacher said even those who don't attain enlightenment in this present life, if they have the blessings to gain rebirth in Tushita heaven and see Maitreya Bodhisattva in the inner court they will certainly attain enlightenment there.</p>
              <p>Another thing is IMHO, there is no contradiction between self-power and other-power practice. My understanding of pure land differs from the Jodo Shinshu description (the link you gave are from Jodo Shinshu). Pure land has many levels/grades, so your practice helps even if you wish to be reborn in Pure Land. If you are true Bodhisattva, you may enter not only Amitabha pure land at will but any Buddha's pure land. The highest of all, those who realises their empty and luminous clear light nature, can enter into 'Ji Guang Jing Tu' at death, which is the highest level of Pure Land, equivalent to Dharmakaya. There is an article by my Master on this.</p>
              <p>Bodhisattvas however will not abide long in this state and return to samsara due to vows.</p>

              <p>I do not think that it is misleading and confusing to say enlightened people are selfless. We can introduce non-self and emptiness when we observe that the person has high capacity to understand things beyond intellectual reasoning.</p>
              <p>Before any person can consider to take the leap beyond intellectual reasoning, we need to help him cross the bridge to a inner world beyond words and human logic, but yet not against human logic and knowledge in any way. It's merely a deeper exploration.</p>
              <p>Yes, we should make clear that enlightment has to do with realisations of the ultimate nature of reality, but true virtues cultivated in non-enlightened beings will eventually lead to virtues that comes from realising true non-self and emptiness.</p>
              <p>Selflessness is one stage or one of many paths to realising non-self and emptiness preached by the Buddha. For the definition of selflessness is very different in Buddhism and hence it is necessary to help secular people to embrace Buddhism more easily than to be strictly factual for the sake of it.</p>

                            infinite brightness, infinite life and infinite merits. Indeed, it means 
                            infinity of all that is good. Generally, people only know that Teacher of 
                            the Western Pure Land (or Western Paradise) is Amitabha Buddha. But they 
                            do not know that they also have within themselves a Pure Land and Amitabha. 
                            This is known as the 'Pure Land of the Mind' and the 'Own-Nature Amitabha'.

                            Buddha". By this I mean, "thank you very much". Therefore, 
                            not only do we have infinite brightness in our heart, by virtue of giving 
                            the giver shall have infinite blessings and merits as well. In this way, 
                            we are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha.<br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><em>iii.</em></strong> If I see someone who is well endowed, good-looking, kind and peaceful, I

                            for having such attributes similar to the Amitabha Buddha. I compliment

                            I see a student studying, I shall say "Amitabha Buddha". It is 
                            also acceptable if you say that he is very hardworking or very clever. However, 
                            sometimes an intelligent person may be fooled by his own intelligence. There 
                            is no guarantee that a student who does well in his studies now will definitely 
                            grow up to be good. But, when we use the name "Amitabha Buddha" 
                            to compliment him, then we evoke the brightness to illumine in him. Not 
                            only will he do well in his studies and his career, he will also be a Bodhisattva 
                            when he grows up, or even become Buddha someday.<br> <br> <em><strong>v.</strong></em> If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, 
                            cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the 
                            effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make 
                            a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know 
                            whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, 
                            but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. 
                            Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, 
                            we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If we say 
                            "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines 
                            in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in our mind.<br> <br> <em><strong>vi.</strong></em> If we come across two parties bickering, quarrelling or 
                            fighting with each other, we do not join in. By our participation, we plant 
                            the cause to be reborn in the realm of the Asura, which is not a desirable 
                            thing. We only need to have Amitabha Buddha in our mind and say "Amitabha 
                            Buddha" just once, and then in future we will not be in spiritual union 
                            with the beings of the Asura realm.<br> <br> <em><strong>vii.</strong></em> If we chance on seeing some traders in the market cheating 
                            on the scales, we immediately say "Amitabha Buddha". Because cheating 
                            arises from greed which resonates with the realm of the ghosts, it is a 
                            cause for rebirth in such a realm in future. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" 
                            just once, then not only do we not resonate with the realm of ghosts but 
                            also we are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha and we become illumined 
                            with infinite brightness.<br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><em>viii.</em></strong> People in general have a curious nature. If we stumble upon someone else's 
                            secrets, we are driven by our curiosity to peek into it to find out more. 
                            If this person is committing a crime, this may spell trouble: our life may 
                            be in danger. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" in our mind and we quickly 
                            distance from it, then we are in union with all that are virtuous and bright. 
                            We do not resonate with darkness.<br> <br> <em><strong>ix.</strong></em> If we come across a drowning man, of course, we save him 
                            if we have the ability. However, if we could not be of help and in the meantime 
                            someone else is saving him, we say "Amitabha Buddha". By calling 
                            out "Amitabha Buddha" just once, it strikes resonance with the 
                            drowning person and he immediately attain the brightness and accomplishment 
                            of Amitabha Buddha. Then, our mind is also in spiritual union Amitabha Buddha.<br> <br> </span>

                            person tells you tales about someone else, those tales are not your business. 
                            The Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch states, "I see someone engaging in 
                            gossip-mongering, I do not participate. If I participate in the gossiping, 
                            then I have done wrong." That the person is wrong is his own business. 
                            Your participation means that you have also done wrong. If this person speaks 
                            a lot of ills about another person and in the end you say just once "Amitabha 
                            Buddha", that is good enough. If you participate in the gossiping, 
                            this person may go around speaking ill of you too. But, when you say "Amitabha 
                            Buddha", then you are in resonance with brightness and that person 
                            would not be able to invent gossips and speak ill of you. Therefore, "Amitabha 
                            Buddha" is indeed really very useful. Regardless of whether the situation 
                            is good, bad or neither good nor bad, when we say "Amitabha Buddha", 
                            our mind will be at ease and we attain brightness, and in this way we resonate 
                            with brightness. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #003399;">3. 
                            How do we cultivate this habit of chanting or reciting "Amitabha Buddha"?<br> <br> </span></strong>It is not easy to acquire the habit of chanting or reciting "Amitabha 
                            Buddha". If you say "Amitabha Buddha" but Amitabha Buddha 
                            is not in your heart and mind, then that would not do. We should have brightness 
                            in our mind all the time so that we are in spiritual union with Amitabha 
                            Buddha. In that way, when you say "Amitabha Buddha" and your actions, 
                            speech and mind are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha, then that is 
                            good enough. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <br> </span>

                            How do we cultivate to have brightness in our mind?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Actually, 
                            it is quite easy to cultivate brightness in our mind. We must carry out 
                            the principle behind "The mind of the past cannot be grasped; the mind 
                            of the present cannot be grasped; the mind of the future cannot be grasped." 
                            (The Three Minds; Vol 6, Issue no. 4) The past is already gone and you cannot 
                            bring it back; the future is not here yet, and there is no way you can bring 
                            it here at this moment; and, whatever you have in your mind at this moment 
                            will not stay because as soon as the next thought arises in your mind, the 
                            previous thought ceases.<br> <br> Therefore, we have to cultivate non-ego-form (i.e. not self-centred; not 
                            having the notion of "I" or "mine"). The ego gives rise 
                            to the notion of possession, for example, my wife, my husband, my houses 
                            and assets, my children, etc. And, we are not even clear about where actually 
                            is this "I". <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #003399; font-size: small;"><strong>5. 
                            What is "I"? Is it real?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">Can anybody 
                            find the "I" in you? It is not an easy task. If you say "I 
                            can see you", who is this "I" that you are referring to? 
                            You may reply that the "I" is in fact your eyes. If you say, "I 
                            can hear you speaking of the Dharma", it is your ears not the "I" 
                            that heard me. Not only are the eyes and ears not the "I", even 
                            if they are, what about the nose, mouth, tongue, limbs, body, head or hair? 
                            They are not the "I" too. Since we cannot locate it, it does not 
                            seem meaningful to attach to this ego. Therefore, a Buddhism practitioner 
                            should comprehend this non-ego-form and maintain non-ego at all times. One 
                            will then realise that all forms are false (an illusion), including the 
                            ego-form. The "I" is false.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><br> The "human-form" refers to the notion of a relative opposite when 
                            we encounter another person. Since we cannot find the ego-form or "I-form", 
                            how then can we find the human-form? We cannot. This is because the ego-form 
                            of the person whom we encounter is also not real; it is empty. The ego-form 
                            is empty, therefore, and naturally the human-form is also empty. Since the 
                            ego-form and the human-from are empty, it follows that the "sentient 
                            being-form" is also empty.<br> <br> Thus, the sense of time, or the time-form is also empty. A Buddhism practitioner 
                            should cultivate to be detached from the 'Three Minds'[1] and the 'Four 
                            Forms'[2]: not grasping the mind of the past, the present and the future, 
                            and not attached to the notion of the ego-form, the human-form, the sentient 
                            being-form and the time-form. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <em>Notes:<br> [1] The Three Minds: (i) the past is gone and cannot be grasped. (ii) After

                            yourself from all forms, you will realise that all things are in fact empty. 
                            Within this emptiness there is infinite brightness. When you realise this 
                            infinite brightness, then the Amitabha Buddha in fact resides in your mind.

                            for today. We did them in the past, we do them presently and we will do 
                            them in the future. We have ethics and our code of ethics must prevail in 
                            the past, present and future. Since we have infinite brightness and infinite

                            of space, i.e. the eight points of the compass and the nadir and zenith) 
                            is called Pure Land. Where does a Pure Land come from? It comes from a pure 
                            mind; first and foremost, the mind must be purified, only then will there 
                            be Pure Land. Our mind is like the great earth because like the great earth, 
                            many things can grow from the mind. The mind is often likened to a planting 
                            field or land. Therefore, when a person is kind-hearted, he is said to have 
                            a "virtuous mind-land", "virtuous mind-field" or "bright 
                            mind-land". Our every decision and idea are all born of the mind. Therefore, 
                            whether it is heaven or hell, they are solely created by the mind. When 
                            the thoughts of the mind are virtuous, then they lead to virtuous actions. 
                            In this way, people ascend to heaven. If on the other hand, the mind thinks 
                            of evil, makes evil decisions and evil deeds are committed, then one descends 
                            to hell. Thus, heaven and hell are created by the mind.<br> <br> </span>

                            on the kind of karma. If it is virtuous, then rebirth takes place in a good 
                            realm, a higher realm. If it is evil, then it takes place in an evil realm, 
                            a lower realm. It is only when the karma is pure that rebirth can take place 
                            in the Western Pure Land.<br> <br> Karma refers to whatever that we do - the actions of our body, what we say

                            are pure, that people can be reborn in the Western Pure Land. It is possible 
                            for us to be pure in the three karma's (actions, speech and thoughts) by 
                            reciting "Amitabha Buddha". It only takes one person's mind to 
                            be pure for it to bring about a positive effect on one's surroundings. When 
                            all the members of the family have purified their minds, all members of 
                            the society have purified their minds, the entire human race across the 
                            world has purified its mind, then a Pure Land on earth is achieved. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br>

                            of the method of chanting the Buddha's name not only recite "Amitabha 
                            Buddha", but in addition should also cultivate merits. It is stated 
                            in the Amitabha Sutra that rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible 
                            via conditions that are lacking in virtuous roots, blessings and merits. 
                            For instance, when we have practised and perfected the Six Parameters (1. 
                            Observing the Precepts, 2. Endurance, 3. Giving, 4. Zeal and Progress, 5. 
                            Meditation, and 6. Wisdom), then to be reborn in the Western Pure Land is 
                            a simple matter. If you have accomplished a mind that is as pure as the 
                            Amitabha Buddha's, then there is no necessity for Amitabha Buddha to come 
                            and guide you to the Western Pure Land. At that time you are already a great 
                            Bodhisattva. Not only can a great Bodhisattva go the Western Pure Land; 
                            he can go to any pure land as he pleases.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #003399; font-size: small;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"> </span></td>

              <p>What is shown in Amitabha Sutra clearly does NOT apply to this times, because the true dharma and all the sutras has not been lost. We can only say that we are in the process of dharma ending, but not reached the true ending of dharma. As my taiwanese teacher said when dharma is truly reachings its ends, the signs will appear -- robed sangha is lost, sutra is lost (Amitabha Sutra is the last to survive). Clearly this is not the time yet and true dharma is still flourishing, so all the more we should cherish.</p>
              <p>I think enlightenment is a real possibility, and there are many (not few as you said) that have attained enlightenment. And I happen to know that a number of them are fully liberated from Samsara (that means they are Arhants or great Bodhisattvas). If you commit yourself to your path and practice, and best if you have guidance by an enlightened person, being enlightened in a few years or 10+ years is not difficult.</p>
              <p>Of course there are other alternatives, that is why we should practice both Wisdom and Blessings at the same time. My Taiwanese teacher said even those who don't attain enlightenment in this present life, if they have the blessings to gain rebirth in Tushita heaven and see Maitreya Bodhisattva in the inner court they will certainly attain enlightenment there.</p>
              <p>Another thing is IMHO, there is no contradiction between self-power and other-power practice. My understanding of pure land differs from the Jodo Shinshu description (the link you gave are from Jodo Shinshu). Pure land has many levels/grades, so your practice helps even if you wish to be reborn in Pure Land. If you are true Bodhisattva, you may enter not only Amitabha pure land at will but any Buddha's pure land. The highest of all, those who realises their empty and luminous clear light nature, can enter into 'Ji Guang Jing Tu' at death, which is the highest level of Pure Land, equivalent to Dharmakaya. There is an article by my Master on this.</p>
              <p>Bodhisattvas however will not abide long in this state and return to samsara due to vows.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, that time mentioned in the Sutra may not have arrived and we should cherish the Dharma that we have heard now. However, I'm not sure if you are aware that the Dharma we have now are not exactly pure in its interpretations as you know that after Buddha's passing into nirvana, his disciples disagreed on various interpretations of Buddha's words and teachings, hence leading to the formation of Theravad tradition and Mahayana tradition. And later the ten different sects with Buddhism: Zen, Pureland, Tien-Tai and so on.</p>
              <p>I have not said enlightment is not a possibility for all, but from scriptures and namely teachings from Master Chin Kung, I have gathered that it is impossible for all Buddhist practitioners, diligent or not, to attain Arahant or Bodhisattvahood in one lifetime, unless their past good karma ripens in this present lifetime. This is to say you can cultivate seriously, very properly in this lifetime, but there is no guarantee whatsoever that you will definitely become an Arahant. And if you do not, forget about liberation in this lifetime and continue in the next or more lifetimes till your store of good karma and spiritual wisdom ripens.</p>
              <p>We are disagreeing because the Buddha has not given us clear figures on what will really happen to those practise Buddhism seriously, half-seriously or whatever before the period when all scriptures disappear comes.</p>
              <p>These are the questions in my mind:</p>
              <p>1) Will they, the hardworking ones make it, if yes, how many will make it? And then how many will not make it among these hardworking ones due to other karmic factors like suddenly becoming very ill, senile or returning to bad ways due to ripening of bad karma?</p>
              <p>2) And then for those who are half-serious or not serious at all, how long will it take for most of them to gain complete liberation from samsaric existence, before or after the period of true Dharma-Ending has come?</p>
              <p>I do not belong to the Jodo Shinshu practise or any Japanese Pureland practice. I follow mainly Master Chin Kung and Master Fa Xuan (ä¸Šæ³•ä¸‹å®£ï¼‰'s Pureland practices.</p>
              <p>What your Taiwanese teacher says is completely right, but does every Buddhist know what amount of blessings one needs to accumulate in just one lifetime to gain rebirth into inner palace of Tusita Heaven to listen to Maitreya Bodhisattva's preaching of dharmma in person?</p>
              <p>I think not many Buddhists know about the criteria to enter just the outer palace of Tusita Heaven, let alone the inner palace.</p>
              <p>I too do not see any contradiction between self-power and other-power practice. But I am only concerned about what is really most relevant, most easy and fast for all masses to learn about as a matter of interest or for serious cultivation.</p>
              <p>You can read works from ancient  Amitabha Pureland practitioners, Master Yin Kuang from Post Qing or Master Oh Yi from Qing dynasty.</p>

              <p>I do not think that it is misleading and confusing to say
                          enlightened people are selfless. We can introduce non-self and
                          emptiness when we observe that the person has high capacity to
                          understand things beyond intellectual reasoning.</p>
              <p>Before any person can consider to take the leap beyond
                          intellectual reasoning, we need to help him cross the bridge to a
                          inner world beyond words and human logic, but yet not against human
                          logic and knowledge in any way. It's merely a deeper
                          exploration.</p>
              <p>Yes, we should make clear that enlightment has to do with
                          realisations of the ultimate nature of reality, but true virtues
                          cultivated in non-enlightened beings will eventually lead to
                          virtues that comes from realising true non-self and
                          emptiness.</p>
              <p>Selflessness is one stage or one of many paths to realising
                          non-self and emptiness preached by the Buddha. For the definition
                          of selflessness is very different in Buddhism and hence it is
                          necessary to help secular people to embrace Buddhism more easily
                          than to be strictly factual for the sake of it.</p>
              <p>I respect your views and your position as a moderator and I
                          shall not comment further on the approaches to explaining
                          enlightenment.</p>

              <p>It is ok to say talk about selflessness, as long as we do not make 'selflessness' as a virtue that only Enlightened beings have, and that it is the 'speciality' of being enlightened. The most we can say is -- enlightened beings uncovered wisdom into the nature of reality, and hence they no longer are attached to the false notion of 'self'. He may become more selfless as a result of the wisdom.</p>
              <p>I am not saying we should not make things simpler for beginners, I'm saying we cannot confuse them by relating selflessness and enlightenment in a way that makes them have a false idea of what enlightenment is. What is essential is not just cultivating selflessness but uncovering our wisdom into the nature of reality.</p>

              <p>The thing is that you can cultivate the merits to gain enlightenment. If you have noticed there was one post that I posted before many months back... where Thusness has been asking me to do a few things, and I asked him why don't you do it (as I thought it was more appropriate)? He changed into a serious tone and told me simply that I do not have sufficient merits for enlightenment. So I suddenly realised all along he was trying to (as I understand it) help me accumulate merits.</p>
              <p>And then some months back I had some minor meditative experience... he asked me do you know why you had such experience? He then told me it was due to the ripening of certain merits I have accumulated the last time he told me to do something.</p>
              <p>So while we are still pre-bhumi practitioners, we are on the path of accumulation, the first stage. Which means the accumulation of wisdom and merits. According to Tibetan teachings the first stage is the path of accumulation, before we can reach the path of juncture, path of seeing, and path of non-meditation.</p>

              <p>2) And then for those who are half-serious or not serious at
                          all, how long will it take for most of them to gain complete
                          liberation from samsaric existence, before or after the
                          period of true Dharma-Ending has come?</p>
              <p>I do not belong to the Jodo Shinshu practise or any Japanese
                          Pureland practice. I follow mainly Master Chin Kung and Master Fa
                          Xuan (ä¸Šæ³•ä¸‹å®£ï¼‰'s Pureland practices.</p>
              <p>What your Taiwanese teacher says is completely right, but does
                          every Buddhist know what amount of blessings one needs to
                          accumulate in just one lifetime to gain rebirth into inner palace
                          of Tusita Heaven to listen to Maitreya Bodhisattva's preaching of
                          dharmma in person?</p>
              <p>I think not many Buddhists know about the criteria to enter just
                          the outer palace of Tusita Heaven, let alone the inner palace.</p>
              <p>I too do not see any contradiction between self-power and
                          other-power practice. But I am only concerned about what is really
                          most relevant, most easy and fast for all masses to learn about as
                          a matter of interest or for serious cultivation.</p>
              <p>You can read works from ancient  Amitabha Pureland
                          practitioners, Master Yin Kuang from Post Qing or Master
                          Oh Yi from Qing dynasty.</p>

              <p>I'm saying only when you choose to after you have truly understood Buddhism. But whatever it is, it is your personal choice, and I have no wish to comment further on it.</p>
              <p>"Song zhong" is both an Asian and mainly Chinese tradition. It is also a proper way of showing filial piety, showing gratitude for your parent's love for you.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you this way: Would you allow your children to believe in another religion? If your only one son/daughter chooses to believe in another religion right now or later in life, would you worry about how your funeral rites would be handled?</p>
              <p>Would you worry how you would be comforted or taken care of when sick?</p>
              <p>I can see that you are frustrated with such parents because they are preventing their children from believing in Christianity, but if their children chooses another religion like Islam, would you be equally concerned?</p>
              <p>If you are, what would you do? Would you continue to blame the parents, forcing them to change their views and ways?</p>
              <p>When it comes to religion, it is not something every external party can do to help, if yes, not much. The outsider has to know where and when to toe the line.</p>
              <p>True Buddhist parents would indeed have no problems with their children believing in other religions. That much I can say and believe in, no matter when and where.</p>

              <p>All these are yuan, no right and wrong. Perhaps a particular teaching suits the people at that time. As long as it suits the sentient beings, it is of help. As my master said this is also the wisdom of the patriarches.</p>
              <p>The thing is that you can cultivate the merits to gain enlightenment. If you have noticed there was one post that I posted before many months back... where Thusness has been asking me to do a few things, and I asked him why don't you do it (as I thought it was more appropriate)? He changed into a serious tone and told me simply that I do not have sufficient merits for enlightenment. So I suddenly realised all along he was trying to (as I understand it) help me accumulate merits.</p>
              <p>And then some months back I had some minor meditative experience... he asked me do you know why you had such experience? He then told me it was due to the ripening of certain merits I have accumulated the last time he told me to do something.</p>
              <p>So while we are still pre-bhumi practitioners, we are on the path of accumulation, the first stage. Which means the accumulation of wisdom and merits. According to Tibetan teachings the first stage is the path of accumulation, before we can reach the path of juncture, path of seeing, and path of non-meditation.</p>

              <p>According to Master Chin Kung or some verses in scriptures, even the most shallow level of hell is quite unconceivable in degree and length of period of suffering.</p>

              <p>The above example refers only to hell sufferings after death. What about while we are alive? Is there no hell on earth? There is. Famine, drought, earthquakes, tsunamis and so on..</p>

              <p>From my understanding sex that does not break the precepts is sex between two faithful partners. Means, faithful, serious partners and not casual sex partners or extramarital affairs and so on.</p>
              <p>Marriage is not spoken much by the Buddha, mainly because it is a formality that is intrinsically linked to cultures and traditions which differs from places to places. Maybe a particular culture don't even require marriage? What Buddha is more concerned is whether sexual activities is strictly between faithful partners and not 'anyhow anyhow'.</p>
              <p>Of course, there are other areas of consideration that falls under conventional wisdom -- such as, you are ready to raise a family? Whether you are married or not, if you are still studying, or whatsoever, it is best to avoid circumstances that end up in pregnancies. It is a really bad karma to have to abort a baby -- abortion is killing.</p>

              <p>No matter what path you take, you will still have to practice to attain Buddhahood. And it depends on how you practice -- if you do evil, of course you end up in hell. But not every practitioner will do evil such as Devadatta.</p>
              <p>Of course, being reborn in pure land is much better than to be reborn in hell. As my dharma teacher said it depends on one's capacity also, if a person is dying and is not enlightened or liberated, it is best to ask him to chant Amitabha and seek rebirth in pure land. If that person's practice is already there, my dharma teacher wld simply remind him/her of the dharma and chant heart sutra mantra for him. He wld be liberated into clear light at the time of death.</p>
              <p>Also... I do not think going to pure land means you no longer need to practice. Pure land simply provides the favourable conditions for you. If you did not attain enlightenment while you are still living, you will still have to practice for a very long time in pure land before the lotus flower opens and you meet Amitabha and realise the unborn. Those who realised the unborn in this lifetime may not need to go through this period of time, and immediately see Amitabha, or simply enter into Ji Guang Jing Tu immediately after death and not having a 7th consciousness or 'zhong yin sheng'.</p>

                                          of the method of chanting the Buddha's name not only recite "Amitabha 
                                          Buddha", but in addition should also cultivate merits. It is stated 
                                          in the Amitabha Sutra that rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible 
                                          via conditions that are lacking in virtuous roots, blessings and merits. 
                                          For instance, when we have practised and perfected the Six Parameters (1. 
                                          Observing the Precepts, 2. Endurance, 3. Giving, 4. Zeal and Progress, 5. 
                                          Meditation, and 6. Wisdom), then to be reborn in the Western Pure Land is 
                                          a simple matter. If you have accomplished a mind that is as pure as the 
                                          Amitabha Buddha's, then there is no necessity for Amitabha Buddha to come 
                                          and guide you to the Western Pure Land. At that time you are already a great 
                                          Bodhisattva. Not only can a great Bodhisattva go the Western Pure Land; 
                                          he can go to any pure land as he pleases.</span></p>

              <p>No matter what path you take, you will still have to practice to attain Buddhahood. And it depends on how you practice -- if you do evil, of course you end up in hell. But not every practitioner will do evil such as Devadatta.</p>
              <p>Of course, being reborn in pure land is much better than to be reborn in hell. As my dharma teacher said it depends on one's capacity also, if a person is dying and is not enlightened or liberated, it is best to ask him to chant Amitabha and seek rebirth in pure land. If that person's practice is already there, my dharma teacher wld simply remind him/her of the dharma and chant heart sutra mantra for him. He wld be liberated into clear light at the time of death.</p>

              <p>I have not said anything about not practising. But the way of practising need not be say, if I keep on failing on contemplative meditation of thoughts or understanding non-duality, etc, I should give up, for Buddhism is too hard for me.</p>

              <p>Actually, my Master said before when asked if he should practice self-power or other-power. He told him try self-power, if cannot then other-power. Of course it also depends on the person's 'yuan'.</p>
              <p>And of course if you are going to die and you are not enlightened, the wisest thing is to seek rebirth in pure land. My dharma teacher in Singapore asks her mother to do pure land practice and chanting to seek rebirth in pure land, her mother is already very old. She did not ask her to do meditation etc. I do not think 'self power' suits her mother, so it depends on the person's 'yuan'. If you ask the old ah mah to gain liberation or do meditation or study the dharma, they may not quite 'click' with it. But if you tell them to chant daily, they may chant happily.</p>
              <p>BTW my master is not a Zen master... but neither is he a non-Zen master. He holds lineage in Linji Ch'an/Zen under Zen Master Dongchu (who is also the master of Ven Sheng Yen). He also follows another Mahayana master prior to moving to Taiwan, who to my understand focuses more on pure land.</p>
              <p>My Master personally taught pure land when he first started teaching. It is only due to the growing conditions in the West that he feels teaching 'ren cheng buddhism' will be of great benefit there.</p>
              <p>As for Ren Cheng itself, it is 'fei chan fei jing' (neither zen nor pure land), 'ji chan ji jing' (yet both zen and pure land), 'xian mi shuang xiu' (practices both silent/esoteric and exoteric, but the 'esoteric' here doesn't mean vajrayana), 'xing jie xiang yin' (practice and understanding converges).</p>
              <p>My master himself has personally led many ju shi to rebirth in pure land... it's say those who die with a high monk around who can guide the dying person may have more chances to be reborn in pure land, I think this is true. It's said all those who died with my master around all got reborn in pure land, except a few who due to unfortunate circumstances such as being distracted and mesmerised by the devas, unfortunately got led to the heaven realm instead. Of course to have such a person to guide one at the time of death is also not very easy to come by and requires one's fu bao/blessings. And also... <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;">It
                                      is stated in the Amitabha Sutra that rebirth in the Western Pure
