              <p class="mainText" style="color: #8e8e8e;"><strong><em>May, 2003</em><br><span class="articleHeader">A Mind Like Sky</span></strong></p>
              <p class="mainText">Meditation
              comes alive through a growing capacity to release our habitual
              entanglement in the stories and plans, conflicts and worries that make
              up the small sense of self, and to rest in awareness. In meditation we
              do this simply by acknowledging the moment-to-moment changing
              conditions—the pleasure and pain, the praise and blame, the litany of
              ideas and expectations that arise. Without identifying with them, we
              can rest in the awareness itself, beyond conditions, and experience
              what my teacher Ajahn Chah called jai pongsai, our natural lightness of
              heart. Developing this capacity to rest in awareness nourishes samadhi
              (concentration), which stabilizes and clarifies the mind, and prajna
              (wisdom), that sees things as they are.</p>
              <p class="mainText">We can
              employ this awareness or wise attention from the very start. When we
              first sit down to meditate, the best strategy is to simply notice
              whatever state of our body and mind is present. To establish the
              foundation of mindfulness, the Buddha instructs his followers "to
              observe whether the body and mind are distracted or steady, angry or
              peaceful, excited or worried, contracted or released, bound or free."
              Observing what is so, we can take a few deep breaths and relax, making
              space for whatever situation we find.</p>
              <p class="mainText">From this
              ground of acceptance we can learn to use the transformative power of
              attention in a flexible and malleable way. Wise
              attention—mindfulness—can function like a zoom lens. Often it is most
              helpful to steady our practice with close-up attention. In this, we
              bring a careful attention and a very close focus to our breath or a
              sensation, or to the precise movement of feeling or thought. Over time
              we can eventually become so absorbed that subject and object disappear.
              We become the breath, we become the tingling in our foot, we become the
              sadness or joy. In this we sense ourself being born and dying with each
              breath, each experience. Entanglement in our ordinary sense of self
              dissolves; our troubles and fears drop away. Our entire experience of
              the world shows itself to be impermanent, ungraspable and selfless.
              Wisdom is born.</p>
              <p class="mainText">But sometimes in meditation
              such close focus of attention can create an unnecessary sense of
              tightness and struggle. So we must find a more open way to pay
              attention. Or perhaps when we are mindfully walking down the street we
              realize it is not helpful to focus only on our breath or our feet. We
              will miss the traffic signals, the morning light and the faces of the
              passersby. So we open the lens of awareness to a middle range. When we
              do this as we sit, instead of focusing on the breath alone, we can feel
              the energy of our whole body. As we walk we can feel the rhythm of our
              whole movement and the circumstances through which we move. From this
              perspective it is almost as if awareness "sits on our shoulder" and
              respectfully acknowledges a breath, a pain in our legs, a thought about
              dinner, a feeling of sadness, a shop window we pass. Here wise
              attention has a gracious witnessing quality, acknowledging each
              event—whether boredom or jealousy, plans or excitement, gain or loss,
              pleasure or pain—with a slight bow. Moment by moment we release the
              illusion of getting "somewhere" and rest in the timeless present,
              witnessing with easy awareness all that passes by. As we let go, our
              innate freedom and wisdom manifest. Nothing to have, nothing to be.
              Ajahn Chah called this "resting in the One Who Knows."</p>
              <p class="mainText">Yet at times this middle level of attention does not serve our practice
              best. We may find ourself caught in the grip of some repetitive thought
              pattern or painful situation, or lost in great physical or emotional
              suffering. Perhaps there is chaos and noise around us. We sit and our
              heart is tight, our body and mind are neither relaxed nor gracious, and
              even the witnessing can seem tedious, forced, effortful.</p>
              <p class="mainText">In this circumstance we can open the lens of attention to its widest
              angle and let our awareness become like space or the sky. As the Buddha
              instructs in the Majjhima Nikaya, "Develop a mind that is vast like
              space, where experiences both pleasant and unpleasant can appear and
              disappear without conflict, struggle or harm. Rest in a mind like vast
              sky."</p>
              <p class="mainText">From this broad perspective, when we sit
              or walk in meditation, we open our attention like space, letting
              experiences arise without any boundaries, without inside or outside.
              Instead of the ordinary orientation where our mind is felt to be inside
              our head, we can let go and experience the mind's awareness as open,
              boundless and vast. We allow awareness to experience consciousness that
              is not entangled in the particular conditions of sight, sound and
              feelings, but consciousness that is independent of changing
              conditions—the unconditioned. Ajahn Jumnien, a Thai forest elder,
              speaks of this form of practice as Maha Vipassana, resting in pure
              awareness itself, timeless and unborn. For the meditator, this is not
              an ideal or a distant experience. It is always immediate, ever present,
              liberating; it becomes the resting place of the wise heart.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Fully absorbed, graciously witnessing, or open and spacious—which of
              these lenses is the best way to practice awareness? Is there an optimal
              way to pay attention? The answer is "all of the above." Awareness is
              infinitely malleable, and it is important not to fixate on any one form
              as best. Mistakenly, some traditions teach that losing the self and
              dissolving into a breath or absorbing into an experience is the optimal
              form of attention. Other traditions erroneously believe that resting in
              the widest angle, the open consciousness of space, is the highest
              teaching. Still others say that the middle ground—an ordinary, free and
              relaxed awareness of whatever arises here and now, "nothing special"—is
              the highest attainment. Yet in its true nature awareness cannot be
              limited. Consciousness itself is both large and small, particular and
              universal. At different times our practice will require that we embrace
              all these perspectives.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Every form of genuine
              awareness is liberating. Each moment we release entanglement and
              identification is selfless and free. But remember too that every
              practice of awareness can create a shadow when we mistakenly cling to
              it. A misuse of space can easily lead us to become spaced-out and
              unfocused. A misuse of absorption can lead to denial, the ignoring of
              other experiences, and a misuse of ordinary awareness can create a
              false sense of "self" as a witness. These shadows are subtle veils of
              meditative clinging. See them for what they are and let them go. And
              learn to work with all the lenses of awareness to serve your wise
              attention.</p>
              <p class="mainText">The more you experience the power of
              wise attention, the more your trust in the ground of awareness itself
              will grow. You will learn to relax and let go. In any moment of being
              caught, awareness will step in, a presence without judging or
              resisting. Close-in or vast, near or far, awareness illuminates the
              ungraspable nature of the universe. It returns the heart and mind to
              its birthright, naturally luminous and free.</p>
              <p class="mainText">To
              amplify and deepen an understanding of how to practice with awareness
              as space, the following instructions can be helpful. One of the most
              accessible ways to open to spacious awareness is through the ear door,
              listening to the sounds of the universe around us. Because the river of
              sound comes and goes so naturally, and is so obviously out of our
              control, listening brings the mind to a naturally balanced state of
              openness and attention. I learned this particular practice of sound as
              a gateway to space from my colleague Joseph Goldstein more than 25
              years ago and have used it ever since. Awareness of sound in space can
              be an excellent way to begin practice because it initiates the sitting
              period with the flavor of wakeful ease and spacious letting go. Or it
              can be used after a period of focused attention.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Whenever you begin, sit comfortably and at ease. Let your body be at
              rest and your breathing be natural. Close your eyes. Take several full
              breaths and let each release gently. Allow yourself to be still.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Now shift awareness away from the breath. Begin to listen to the play
              of sounds around you. Notice those that are loud and soft, far and
              near. Just listen. Notice how all sounds arise and vanish, leaving no
              trace. Listen for a time in a relaxed, open way.</p>
              <p class="mainText">As you listen, let yourself sense or imagine that your mind is not
              limited to your head. Sense that your mind is expanding to be like the
              sky-open, clear, vast like space. There is no inside or outside. Let
              the awareness of your mind extend in every direction like the sky.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Now the sounds you hear will arise and pass away in the open space of
              your own mind. Relax in this openness and just listen. Let the sounds
              that come and go, whether far or near, be like clouds in the vast sky
              of your own awareness. The play of sounds moves through the sky,
              appearing and disappearing without resistance.</p>
              <p class="mainText">As you rest in this open awareness, notice how thoughts and images also
              arise and vanish like sounds. Let the thoughts and images come and go
              without struggle or resistance. Pleasant and unpleasant thoughts,
              pictures, words and feelings move unrestricted in the space of mind.
              Problems, possibilities, joys and sorrows come and go like clouds in
              the clear sky of mind.</p>
              <p class="mainText">After a time, let this
              spacious awareness notice the body. Become aware of how the sensations
              of breath and body float and change in the same open sky of awareness.
              The breath breathes itself, it moves like a breeze. The body is not
              solid. It is felt as areas of hardness and softness, pressure and
              tingling, warm and cool sensation, all floating in the space of the
              mind's awareness.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Let the breath move like a
              breeze. Rest in this openness. Let sensations float and change. Allow
              all thoughts and images, feelings and sounds to come and go like clouds
              in the clear open space of awareness.</p>
              <p class="mainText">Finally,
              pay attention to the awareness itself. Notice how the open space of
              awareness is naturally clear, transparent, timeless and without
              conflict—allowing all things, but not limited by them.</p>
              <p class="mainText">The Buddha said, "O Nobly Born, remember the pure open sky of your own true nature. Return to it. Trust it. It is home."</p>
              <p class="mainText">May the blessings of these practices awaken your own inner wisdom and
              inspire your compassion. And through the blessing of your heart may the
              world find peace.</p>

              <p>Great excerpt from <a href="http://www.greatfreedom.org/faq.html">http://www.greatfreedom.org/faq.html</a>  (a very good read!)</p>
              <p>....What has no cause and what requires no effort cannot be brought
              about by trying to cause it or effort for it. It’s already
              accomplished, already naturally present effortlessly in the here and
              now, the pure presence of the here and now, the complete perceptual
              openness of the here and now. This is the basis of everything.
              <br> <br> To have complete perceptual openness means to relax our perception
              into wide-open spaciousness with no need to close in on any thought,
              emotion, object, or experience to make sense of what’s happening. When
              we completely relax our attention from its habitual pinpointed focus,
              we see everything as it is: a limitless, seamless expanse of changeless
              pure awareness, in which myriad ephemeral forms of awareness appear and
              disappear. Most of us have learned to fix our attention on whatever is
              appearing and to describe it as if it had a separate existence.
              However, when we do so, we immediately disconnect from our natural
              openness and collapse into the idea of a separate self that relies on
              thought to describe what’s going on. When we have this individualized
              thinking and the fear-based emotional field that thinking creates, then
              we’re very restricted and limited to that emotional field. We live on
              the head of a pin when we do that, and that’s a very cramped and
              uncomfortable space!
              <br> <br> We keep it simple: we keep it totally simple. Everything that
              appears is a point of view appearing within the pure view of awareness.
              That’s it...</p>

              <p><em>....</em><em>Candice
              began formulating the Great Freedom teachings 25 years ago, after a
              profound and permanent awakening unexpectedly occurred in her life. She
              had been raised Catholic, but as a child she intuitively rejected
              substantial portions of what she was taught through that religion, yet
              she had a strong, natural faith in God, and prayed every day for many
              years to be “able to see the face of God”. Her deep connection with
              nature in her childhood brought about a profound experience of “the
              oneness of all things”, but she never practiced any kind of formal
              meditation, and had never met a guru or had any esoteric spiritual
              training prior to her awakening. As a young adult she was highly
              successful in many ways, “efforting and achieving” as a way of life,
              and receiving many accolades; in fact, at age 28 she was named one of
              100 outstanding women in America. But her successes gave her no real
              satisfaction, and by the time she was 34 she realized that no matter
              how hard she tried, or how many successes she had, they never would
              satisfy her.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 10.5px; padding-right: 10.5px; text-indent: 1.8em; text-align: justify;"><em>She
              then went through an profound personal crisis which led her into states
              of intense fear, alienation and despair. During that period she found
              that everything she had learned through psychology, philosophy,
              religion, and all other belief systems she had studied were of no help
              to her whatsoever.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 10.5px; padding-right: 10.5px; text-indent: 1.8em; text-align: justify;"><em>Furthermore,
              every remedy she had previously relied on to give her relief, including
              alcohol and marijuana, now gave her no relief at all. During that
              extended period of being overwhelmed by negative emotional states, she
              somehow discovered that beneath all those states, there was a “basic
              space of pure awareness” which was free from suffering, a space of
              complete relief. She gradually familiarized herself with that basic
              space by resting as awareness for short moments, repeated many times,
              and soon she was able to rest in that awareness for 10 continuous days.
              At that point “awareness rose like the sun”, and from then on that
              unchanging space of pure awareness became her primary reality, and the
              painful thoughts and emotional states which had tormented her faded
              away like stars in the light of day. Her discovery of all-encompassing
              pure awareness, and the complete relief that comes with it, proved to
              be permanent. From this profound awakening the Great Freedom teachings
              have come, offering a simple and direct path for others to gain the
              same realization, and the same permanent relief from suffering.</em></p>
              <p style="padding-left: 10.5px; padding-right: 10.5px; text-indent: 1.8em; text-align: justify;"><em>The
              Great Freedom teachings are designed to be acceptable to the largest
              audience possible, and therefore do not rely on the word ‘God’ (which
              would surely alienate some people), nor are they aligned with any
              religion or based on traditional concepts such as original sin, karma,
              reincarnation, or ego. Candice doesn't even use the word
              ‘Enlightenment’, saying it has been so tarnished through years of
              misuse and misinterpretation that it often just creates confusion.
              Although after her teachings were formulated she discovered that they
              are similar to the Tzogchen teachings of Tibetan Buddhism, and share
              the same essence as ‘The King of Samadhi Sutra’ given by Lord Buddha,
              the Great Freedom teachings are not presented as Buddhist, and are not
              called religious, spiritual, philosophy or psychology; they are simply
              presented as being “about the ultimate truth of what it means to be
              human”. Unlike most paths, which might require the acceptance of some
              culturally-specific set of religious beliefs, or faith in some kind of
              cosmological system, the Great Freedom teachings are based solely on
              the direct experience of awareness, which is always present within
              everyone....</em></p>

              and so natural that it can never be complicated, corrupted, or stained,
              so pure that it is beyond even the concept of purity and impurity.

              <p><em>"Mind is like space, because it has no limitation. When there are no
              clouds, when it is completely clear, space is like our 'ordinary' state
              of mind. Then, all of a sudden, clouds come from nowhere. Our emotional
              problems and mental chaos are like the clouds. When they take over, we
              can't see space any more, we only see the clouds! However space never
              goes anywhere, it's always there. It's just our mind getting into
              darkness so that, for us, the clouds become our only reality. It means
              we give more solidity to our emotional upheavals, to all the things
              going on in our mind, so that they become more real for us than the
              true essence of our mind."<br><br><br>"In the same way as clouds come
              from nowhere, our emotions and all the chaos we go through also somehow
              appear from nowhere and disappear into nowhere. Understanding this
              process, we should give it less value. Even if we've been under the
              clouds for seven days, we should always remember that space is there!"<br><br><br>"We
              can never find a solution to our investigation by just listening to
              teachings or reading books. The only way we can get closer to the
              nature of mind is through direct experience, and that is through
              meditation."<br></em> <br> <br>(Extracts from Living Dharma - Ven. Lama Yeshe Losal)</p>

              <p>I like how A.H.Almaas describes it:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Only stillness is left—fresh, clear, crisp and empty. 
                                  Thoughts pass through it. Emotions pass through it. Experiences 
                                  pass through it. But the stillness stays immaculate, just 
                                  as the clear sky stays untouched as the clouds pass through 
                                  it.</em></p>
              <p><em>The winds blow<br> The rivers flow<br> The fires gnaw<br> But stillness is still still.</em></p>
              <p><em>There is a feeling of lightness, of joy, of freedom. There 
                                  is a sense of naturalness with a crystal kind of clarity, 
                                  just as snow-covered mountains feel natural and clear. Awareness 
                                  is no longer tense. It loses its attachment and active bent. 
                                  It becomes more passive, like a receptacle. Everything comes 
                                  to it. This is an important transition, for usually we exert 
                                  a lot of effort to pay attention, and <a href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/l/letting_go.htm">letting 
                                  go</a> and just being feels scary. I always thought before 
                                  that I would miss seeing something if I did not actively look. 
                                  But I saw that I only created strain this way, and also this 
                                  active awareness is really more paranoia than anything else. 
                                  When I let go, and trust that awareness is naturally there 
                                  and I don’t have to make an effort, awareness becomes 
                                  bigger, brighter, and easier. It’s like seeing everything, 
                                  being aware of everything at the same time, effortlessly. 
                                  It’s like a panoramic view, but not from above, nor 
                                  from any direction. It’s like awareness is everywhere, 
                                  and nothing is missed or overlooked. There is no concern or 
                                  fear of missing something.</em></p>
              <p><em>All kinds of experiences happen. Many new regions and spaces 
                                  of the mind. Deep spaces, empty spaces, spacious spaces, soft 
                                  spaces, dark spaces, light spaces, joyous spaces. The space 
                                  itself, like stillness, becomes the object of awareness, and 
                                  awareness goes deeper and deeper into it. Sometimes there 
                                  is an uninterrupted space of stillness, or openness, without 
                                  thoughts or feelings or any kind of content. It’s like 
                                  a totally empty sky. </em></p>

              <h2>Receptive Awareness</h2>
              <em> adapted from a talk by Gil Fronsdal, 
                          January 1st, 2002</em>
              <p>Our awareness is like the air around us: we rarely notice it. It functions 
                          in all our waking moments, and a form of awareness may even continue in 
                          sleep. Some people don’t recognize the functioning of awareness 
                          because it has never been pointed out to them. Even when we know about 
                          it, we easily take it for granted and don’t appreciate it fully.</p>
              <p>Perhaps 
                          the prime reason we don’t notice awareness is that we are caught 
                          up in the content of our awareness, that is, we are preoccupied with what 
                          we think, feel, and experience. Usually daily life entails negotiating 
                          our way through what awareness knows, the content of our thinking and 
                          perception. An important part of Buddhist practice involves being aware 
                          of the other half of perception, receptive awareness itself. Becoming 
                          aware of awareness itself is a capacity we all have. Meditation offers 
                          a powerful opportunity to discover and rest in a receptive mode of knowing.</p>
              <p>Receptive 
                          awareness is very close to the idea of a witnessing consciousness. Beginners 
                          in meditation often assume that our ability to witness means that there 
                          is someone who is witnessing; a particular, unique, and lasting subject 
                          or agent within us that is the witness. We have a strong tendency to dichotomize 
                          our world, especially between the perceived and the perceiver. Similarly, 
                          we often make a distinction between the doer and the action:</p>
              <p>I’m the doer and I am doing something, I am the speaker who is speaking. 
                          Most of us consider the idea that there is a perceiver or a doer to be 
                          simple common sense.</p>
              <p>Buddhism challenges this assumption.</p>
              <p>These 
                          dichotomies are the cornerstone of the huge edifice of self. As soon as 
                          we have a perceiver, we have a concept of self, which becomes a magnet 
                          for all sorts of culturally
                          conditioned ideas about what a self should be like. Our sense of self 
                          can be closely and painfully related to ideas of what is worthy, what 
                          is good, and what is required from the world around us.</p>

                          can arise directly from the way we conceive our “self.” If 
                          our self-image is threatened, we can easily get angry or fearful. Guilt 
                          can come from relating a self-image</p>
              <p>to ideas of good and bad, right and wrong. Both praise and blame can energize 
                          us when they affect the way we define and represent ourselves. And when 
                          our sense of self is neither supported nor threatened, some people get 
                          bored— bored with the people they are with or bored with the situation.</p>
              <p>Resting 
                          in receptive awareness is an antidote to our efforts of building and defending 
                          a self. As this capacity develops and we begin to trust it, the assumption 
                          that there is “someone who is aware” falls away. Self-consciousness 
                          falls away. Sometimes this is called an experience of non-dualistic awareness: 
                          the distinctions between self and other, inside and outside, perceiver 
                          and perceived disappear. There is no one who is aware; there is only awareness 
                          and experience happening within awareness.   Part 
                          of what we learn to do in practice is to steady our attention, to develop 
                          a simple, receptive awareness. We</p>
              <p>aren’t necessarily abandoning the world of ideas or even the idea 
                          of self. Instead, we learn to hold our lives, our ideas, and ourselves 
                          lightly. We rest in a spacious and compassionate sphere of awareness that 
                          knows but is not attached. In this way our response to life can arise 
                          from our direct experience rather than our abstract ideas and
                          attachments.</p>

              <p>"Nondual consciousness is not a state of attention. It is experienced without effort of any kind. It is the mind completely at rest. In fact, there is not even a sense that the mind is resting, for that is still an activity of sorts. Rather, one experiences a simple lucid openness in which the phenomena of the world appear, and through which experiences such as thoughts, emotions, and sensations move without obstruction.</p>
              <p>There is also a sense that one's consciousness is pervading all of the content of one's experience. Rather than an encounter between one's own head and the objects outside of one's head, as experienced in intentional, dualistic consciousness states, nondual consciousness is experienced globally. It pervades and subsumes one's whole body and everything in one's environment at the same time. "Consciousness is encountered as something more like a field than a localized point, a field that transcends the body and yet somehow interacts with it" (Forman, in Gallagher &amp; Shear, 1999, p. 373).</p>
              <p>One of the main characteristics of nondual realization is that it is discovered, rather than created, as rigid subjective organizations are released. Constructivists may insist that nondual consicousness is itself a conceptual construct. Speaking both from my own experience as well as from traditional accounts, I can attest that nondual realization is a process of gradually letting go of one's grip on oneself and one's environment -- as if opening a clenched fist. It does require concentrated effort and time to achieve a certain degree of letting go. But the expanse of nondual consciousness, pervading oneself and one's environment as a unified whole, appears of its own accord as a result of this letting go, and continues to appear, without any effort on one's own part."</p>

              <p>There's a difference between 'presence prevading everything' that Judith Blackstone, with 'everything entering our awareness'.</p>
              <p>First of all when we say awareness, what is awareness? The question of what Awareness really is has always been the fundamental of spiritual practice.  Therefore insight into our pristine nature is most important.</p>
              <p>When we have certain glimpses of the "I AM" or the "Eternal Witness" (see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a>), awareness seems to be the eternal witness/watcher or constant opening where things comes and go within that awareness but that constant background or witnessing awareness remains... unchanged, unmoved, without coming and going.</p>
              <p>I have asked Thusness a few times... because I myself am confused at times due to the seeming unmovability of this awareness, this sense of presence and being.... I asked him does this sense of presence, awareness ever fade in and out? It seems that everything else, every thought, every experience appears to fade in and out, or enter and go within my awareness and yet this awareness, this being is the Only constant and unmoving 'thing' or 'non-thing'.</p>
              <p>To which his reply was that there is indeed that 'unmoving' sensation but it should not be dualistically understood like what I described. Instead it should be seen as momentary mind-moments. (because each moment is distinct, disjoint, and yet complete in itself, there is no sensation of movement) In any case there should be no separation between awarenes and content of awareness, if there is anything 'coming and going' against a background of unchanging awareness that becomes the Advaita/Hindu teachings. I do not have the chat log with me but will paste that part when I find it.</p>
              <p>In non-dual reality there is no watcher watching anything -- when seeing people and cars, there is just people and cars, there is no seer. When hearing sound there is just sound, there is no hearer. When thoughts arise there is no thinker of thoughts nor a knower/watcher of thoughts -- each thought is itself a self-luminous, 'knowing' phenomenon. And this is not an 'experience' -- this is the nature of reality, this is the Dharma Seal of Anatta which means this is an ever-present characteristic or seal at all moments.</p>
              <p>The reason why Judith Blackstone spoke of 'presence pervading everything' is because she has deep non-dual insight. She does not see any separation at all between awareness and the content of awareness. She does not does not see awareness as an unchanging background to which everything else comes and goes from it or within it. To her there is no 'entering and exiting', 'coming and going', which is why her expression is 'presence pervading everything'.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Firewood becomes ash, and it does not become 
                                  firewood again. Yet, do not suppose that the ash is future and the firewood 
                                  past. You should understand that firewood abides in the phenomenal expression 
                                  of firewood, which fully includes past and future and is independent of past 
                                  and future. Ash abides in the phenomenal expression of ash, which fully includes 
                                  future and past. Just as firewood does not become firewood again after it 
                                  is ash, you do not return to birth after death.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;"><br> This being so, it is an established way in buddha-dharma to deny that birth 
                                  turns into death. Accordingly, birth is understood as no-birth. It is an unshakeable 
                                  teaching in Buddha's discourse that death does not turn into birth. Accordingly, 
                                  death is understood as no-death.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;"><br> Birth is an expression complete this moment. Death is an expression complete 
                                  this moment. They are like winter and spring. You do not call winter the beginning 
                                  of spring, nor summer the end of spring. (Dogen 70-1)</span></p>

              <p>Next thing I want to talk about... is the state of 'no memory' the condition where clarity arise? I would say, not necessarily. Even without memory and thoughts there may not be clarity, one could be blanked out, be in a trance, etc.</p>
              <p>From my understanding, 'no memory' isn't really the important condition... whatever arise is fine. If you are remembering things, that is fine too. If you are thinking about the past, 'when' does that thought occur? In this present moment awareness. "Past" thoughts really too, occur in the present. So remembering is fine.</p>
              <p>I think the real issue is not whether we are remembering things... but whether we are so fixated on our thoughts that we feel contracted as an individual, our attention is so fixated on the thoughts we are chasing after that we lose 'sight' of 'spacious awareness' that is always here, like air, but not noticed... even though it is still here. If we let go of our fixation into the larger ground of open awareness, memories, thoughts, emotions that arise are not a problem just like seeing a flower and touching the keyboard is not a problem -- all just manifestation of intrinsic awareness.</p>
              <p>Without fixation, naturally there is no compulsive thinking and
                          labeling, and so there is a basic equanimity there, but still thoughts are allowed to arise as well just as hearing and
                          seeing and tasting are embraced and allowed by awareness (but actually
                          the act of seeing and tasting is itself awareness choicelessly
                          manifesting, there is ultimately not even an 'allowing').</p>
              <p>But one thing I should also point out is that... luminosity is always there. Always. Even when you are not paying attention. Pure awareness has never been lost at all in samsara and nothing is gained in nirvana. And contrary to what we might think... we cannot 'increase' awareness (nor decrease it). Awareness is always happening like it or not.... just that due to our pinpointed fixation we miss it all. As John Welwood says: "<span style="font-family: Book Antiqua;"><strong>This larger awareness is self-existing: it cannot be fabricated 
                      or manufactured because it is always present, whether we notice it or not."</strong></span></p>

                                                      Awareness is effortlessly happening right now, whether you like it or

                                                      Reality. Before you think that this awareness is a 'thing' -- a Mirror

              <p>It is not so much that our presence pervade everything but rather everything gets to enter our awareness. This is the state of choicelessness. We don't engage with anything that flows into our awareness.</p>

              <p>I like how A.H.Almaas describes it:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Only stillness is left—fresh, clear, crisp and empty. Thoughts pass through it. Emotions pass through it. Experiences pass through it. But the stillness stays immaculate, just as the clear sky stays untouched as the clouds pass through it.</em></p>
              <p><em>The winds blow<br>The rivers flow<br>The fires gnaw<br>But stillness is still still.</em></p>
              <p><em>There is a feeling of lightness, of joy, of freedom. There is a sense of naturalness with a crystal kind of clarity, just as snow-covered mountains feel natural and clear. Awareness is no longer tense. It loses its attachment and active bent. It becomes more passive, like a receptacle. Everything comes to it. This is an important transition, for usually we exert a lot of effort to pay attention, and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ahalmaas.com/Glossary/l/letting_go.htm">letting go</a> and just being feels scary. I always thought before that I would miss seeing something if I did not actively look. But I saw that I only created strain this way, and also this active awareness is really more paranoia than anything else. When I let go, and trust that awareness is naturally there and I don’t have to make an effort, awareness becomes bigger, brighter, and easier. It’s like seeing everything, being aware of everything at the same time, effortlessly. It’s like a panoramic view, but not from above, nor from any direction. It’s like awareness is everywhere, and nothing is missed or overlooked. There is no concern or fear of missing something.</em></p>
              <p><em>All kinds of experiences happen. Many new regions and spaces of the mind. Deep spaces, empty spaces, spacious spaces, soft spaces, dark spaces, light spaces, joyous spaces. The space itself, like stillness, becomes the object of awareness, and awareness goes deeper and deeper into it. Sometimes there is an uninterrupted space of stillness, or openness, without thoughts or feelings or any kind of content. It’s like a totally empty sky.</em></p>

              <p>There's a difference between 'presence prevading everything'
                                      that Judith Blackstone, with 'everything entering our
                                      awareness'.</p>
              <br></blockquote>
              <p>         Yes definitely.  You were suggesting that the our true nature is like "presence pervading everything". What I was saying was that our true nature is like a valley where all things flow to. It doesn't flow out or pervade anything. It is an undivided state of being.  Upon focus our mind could arise from this pristine awareness.</p>
              <blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>First of all when we say awareness, what is awareness? The
                                      question of what Awareness really is has always been the
                                      fundamental of spiritual practice.  Therefore insight into our
                                      pristine nature is most important.</p>
              <p>When we have certain glimpses of the "I AM" or the "Eternal
                                      Witness" (see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a>),
                                      awareness seems to be the eternal witness/watcher or constant
                                      opening where things comes and go within that awareness but that
                                      constant background or witnessing awareness remains... unchanged,
                                      unmoved, without coming and going.</p>
              </blockquote></blockquote>
              <p>      There are a lot of graphic description of awareness and its many attributes but I think the best description of what this is came from Buddha himself. </p>
              <p>      Once Buddha was asked what's the difference between concentration and awareness. He suggested a simple experiential exercise and i.e. to fill up a cup with water to the brim. Look at it intensely and then walk along the road and try not to spill the water.  The mind applied at looking at the level of the water is concentration and as we walk along the road we also "notice" objects and things along the road. The objects noticed were not interpreted i.e. we know "something" is there but we don't know what it is.  That is awareness.</p>
              <p>        The moment you know what it is you have already engaged with the sense objects.  All manner of perceptual interpretation and emotive responses would then follow.  Neuroscientists found that in order for memory to be created it needs to be able to pigeon-hole the sense impressions. This means prior to memory there must be a process of interpreting and storing.  If we look out to the world with our awareness where can these memory hooks be created without any interpretation ?</p>
              <p>        Clarity is about seeing things clearly and not through the mind's eye of prejudices, pre-knowledge, historical conditioning, learning etc.  True and direct clarity arise when it is unimpeded by all our perceptual, conceptual and emotive garbages.</p>

              <p>Just my own understanding... you or others might have a better understanding.</p>
              <p>Letting
                          go of our interpretation and go pre-symbolic, pre-conceptual into the
                          direct experience of sensations, sights, smells, etc... is very
                          important. At the same time 'remembering' and 'thinking' can be
                          directly experienced -- not its labels but the direct experience. This
                          happens when we let go of our fixation to our own concepts,
                          interpretations, and submerge into the direct experience of this
                          moment, pure, open, vivid. Submerge into that pure experience/pure
                          awareness, whatever it is including remembering -- as Lama Surya Das
                          wrote:</p>

                                                  all the nondual teachings: Sustaining present awareness.
                                                  Recognizing the Buddha-nature through the present moment, this very
                                                  moment of awareness. If it's awareness taking the form of thinking,
                                                  recognize the present awareness component of the thought. If you
                                                  are remembering the past, recognize the present awareness component
                                                  of the memory. You're not in the past. How could you be in the
                                                  past? It is present awareness remembering. If you feel distracted
                                                  when remembering, bring the mind back to the present awareness. You
                                                  don't have to stop remembering. Recognize present awareness, which
                                                  is remembering. If you are dreaming, fantasizing about the future,
                                                  about what you are going to do when you leave here, how you are
                                                  going to tell everybody how wonderful it was and how great Dzogchen
                                                  view and meditation is, that's fine-recognize present awareness
                                                  fantasizing, planning, dreaming. Recognize who or what is doing
                                                  that present awareness. Know the knower; see through the seer; go
                                                  beyond me and mine, and be free.</p>

              <p>When
                          we find ourselves distracted and lost in our thinking, remembering,
                          fantacizing, worrying, and so on... there is no need to suppress them,
                          which will not work because any attempts to stop or suppress them is
                          still continuing the mechanism of reacting to experience and fixation
                          to our experience... due to the illusion of an agent, a thinker, a doer, a controller. In truth thoughts arise without a thinker, it arises and subsides in its own accord. So we can just 'let go' into direct experience
                          and 'let it be'. Whatever arises due to conditions eventually pass away.</p>
              <p>So whatever arises is perfectly ok, and is just a manifestation of our true nature - what
                          needs to happen is just an immediate 'shift' into the open, spacious
                          Presence that embraces, permeates, and allows all thoughts and
                          experience to arise by itself in its own accord but remains
                          'unaffected' -- it feels like there is an undercurrent of equanimity
                          that does not grasp and chase after experiences. Like the sky that
                          allows all clouds to float by, open awareness allows all thoughts and
                          experiences to arise and subside by itself without grasping and
                          reacting to them. It remains naked and pure amidst concepts and even in
                          the concept which is itself a luminous-empty display. Yet not only is
                          pure awareness space-like with no fixation, there is vivid
                          clarity/awareness everywhere. The 'knowingness' that knows everything
                          and is 'in' everything. This becomes 'noticed' when we gently
                          relinquish our pinpointed fixation of thoughts and feelings into the
                          larger ground of awareness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said: <em>"Yes
                                                  definitely.  You were suggesting that the our true nature is
                                                  like "presence pervading everything". What I was saying was that
                                                  our true nature is like a valley where all things flow to. It
                                                  doesn't flow out or pervade anything. It is an undivided state of
                                                  being.  Upon focus our mind could arise from this pristine
                                                  awareness."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Presence does not "flow out", but it pervades everything because the everything is presence. All there is is presence.</p>
              <p>When
                          you look at a flower, without any thoughts and labels, what is it? What
                          is that pure experience? Just a sheer presence itself.</p>
              <p>As
                          Thusness mentioned, even when we have this experience we might still
                          mistake Awareness as an unchanging unmoving essence where impermanent
                          things flow in and out. Therefore Non-Dual experience is not the same
                          as the insight into Anatta. Therefore as Thusness said there are many
                          degrees of nondual experience/insight.</p>
              <p>When Anatta (No-Self) is realised, Awareness is realised to be Essenceless, Agentless, Dynamic/Verb-Like and Non-Dual.</p>
              <p>No watcher needed, the process itself knows and rolls as Venerable Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga.</p>
              <p>If
                          we see awareness as the flow of phenomenality itself, we see the
                          'essenceless' and the 'dynamic' nature of awareness. There is no
                          unchanging essence which things flows in and out of because the flow
                          itself is it.</p>
              <p>Hence, by 'verb-like', this is what is meant - Thich Nhat Hanh wrote:</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">"When
                          we say I know the wind is blowing, we don't think that there is
                          something blowing something else. "Wind' goes with 'blowing'. If there
                          is no blowing, there is no wind. It is the same with knowing. Mind is
                          the knower; the knower is mind. We are talking about knowing in
                          relation to the wind. 'To know' is to know something. Knowing is
                          inseparable from the wind. Wind and knowing are one. We can say,
                          'Wind,' and that is enough. The presence of wind indicates the presence
                          of knowing, and the presence of the action of blowing'."</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">"..The
                          most universal verb is the verb 'to be'': I am, you are, the mountain
                          is, a river is. The verb 'to be' does not express the dynamic living
                          state of the universe. To express that we must say 'become.' These two
                          verbs can also be used as nouns: 'being", "becoming". But being what?
                          Becoming what? 'Becoming' means 'evolving ceaselessly', and is as
                          universal as the verb "to be." It is not possible to express the
                          "being" of a phenomenon and its "becoming" as if the two were
                          independent. In the case of wind, blowing is the being and the
                          becoming...."</p>

              <p>It is indeed important to directly experience without the super-imposition of concepts on phenomena.  Just not to mistake the path as the cause of clarity.  It is like "counting breath" into focus attention, but 'counting' is not the cause of focus attention.</p>
              <p>Therefore it is crucial to understand why anatta, impermanence and dependent orgination and how do all these teachings relate to the pristine and non-dual nature of awareness.  Firmly established the views and the path of being 'bare' in attention or 'naked' in awareness or direct in perception will become clear.</p>

              <p>Hi djhampa,</p>
              <p>Diect experience does not imply consciousness being detached from whatever arises. Experiences are "direct" because the common misunderstanding of an agent that can be attached or detached from whatever arises is thoroughly seen through; thefore nothing to divide to begin with, thus, direct.  That is why it is an "insight" and it is this arising of anatta insight that leads a practitioner to direct seeing.  Even the complete cessation of thoughts or perceptions do not make experience direct without the arising of this anatta insight.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the path we take, whether by way of renunication in Theravada and Mahayana or Tantra path of transformation or direct path of Dzogchen and Mahamudra, they only differ in path due to differing capacities and conditons of practitioners, the views do not diviate from the dharma seals and dependent origination.<br></p>

              <p>Originally I wrote a long post but I have shortened it to a few points based on what Thusness said, which makes it much clearer. (but there are further posts next page)</p>
              <p>In short: there is no false self nor true self, there is only 5 aggregates.</p>
              <p>Do not think that that there is a problem in the five aggregates. There is no problem with the aggregates, the 'problem' lies only in the illusion that there is a self. The 5 aggregates when experienced without the agent (watcher, thinker,
                      doer, etc) is a completely new dimension. They are the Buddha Nature.
                      (see next page for references)</p>
              <p>However, when experienced with a sense/illusion of self, whatever arises (all the aggregates and 18 dhatus) appears to be problematic. In truth there are no problems whatsoever, only the wrong understanding that self exist.</p>
              <p>It should be noted furthermore, that even while the sense of self is present, there is still in truth no-self/perceiver apart from perceived. No-self is a dharma seal, an ever-present nature of reality.</p>
              <p>On the most direct path, there is no one to let go and no-thing to be let go of and hence no 'how to let go'. Reality is 'letting go' at all moments. There is only what arises and subsides (self-liberates) every moment according to conditions, luminous-empty phenomena roll on with no one at the center that can seek nor distant himself (since there is no 'self') from the self-knowing transience.</p>
              <p>However if we are unable to arise this insight and with the tendencies still strong, then we have no choice but resort to the gradual path of practice. Resorting to watching the arising and ceasing of the 5 aggregates as if there is a separate watcher but with the right view that there is no self apart from the aggregates. By practicing this way, insight into Anatta can still arise eventually.</p>
              <p>But if the path consists of practice without the right view, almost without fail it will result in Advaita sort of experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. for a long and concise description of the different 'levels' of the path (from witnessing, to transmutation and self-liberation, and more), you can refer to <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/John%20Welwood">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/search/label/John%20Welwood</a></p>
