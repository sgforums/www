              <p>   It is well to talk about dropping of concepts
                                              and "direct experience" will arise. But pristine awareness is not
                                              about having "direct experience" of the sense objects and
                                              phenomenon but rather a detachment from sense objects, feelings,
                                              perception and volition (the 4 skandha).</p>
              <p>    A totally aware person can have a lot of
                                              thoughts flowing by but the person will not be caught up by it.</p>
              <p>     How does one detach one's consciousness
                                              from all these skandhic objects ?</p>

              <div class="entry">Only when we see Consciousness as something distinct from all other phenomena, watching it, do we see the need to distant ourselves from all phenomena. That distancing is in fact the very strong yet subtle sense of a 'self' as the 'watcher'. This is the second stage of dropping that Thusness wrote.<br></div>
              <div class="entry"><br></div>
              <div class="entry">Otherwise, everything simply manifests in its own accord according to conditions and self-liberates choicelessly without the need of a separate self intervening. After nondual insight there is no 'efforting' and no attempt to dissociate oneself from all phenomena. It is seen that there is no self (including a watcher) apart from all manifestation, no one who can distant himself from or seek manifestation because manifestation is all there is.<br></div>

              page for references)</p>
              <p>However, when experienced with a sense/illusion of self,
              whatever arises (all the aggregates and 18 dhatus) appears to be
              problematic. In truth there are no problems whatsoever, only the
              wrong understanding that self exist.</p>
              <p>It should be noted furthermore, that even while the sense of
              self is present, there is still in truth no-self/perceiver apart
              from perceived. No-self is a dharma seal, an ever-present nature of
              reality.</p>
              <p>On the most direct path, there is no one to let go and no-thing
              to be let go of and hence no 'how to let go'. Reality is 'letting
              go' at all moments. There is only what arises and subsides
              (self-liberates) every moment according to conditions,
              luminous-empty phenomena roll on with no one at the center that can
              seek nor distant himself (since there is no 'self') from the
              self-knowing transience.</p>
              <p>However if we are unable to arise this insight and with the
              tendencies still strong, then we have no choice but resort to the
              gradual path of practice. Resorting to watching the arising and
              ceasing of the 5 aggregates as if there is a separate watcher but
              with the right view that there is no self apart from the
              aggregates. By practicing this way, insight into Anatta can still
              arise eventually.</p>
              <p>But if the path consists of practice without the right view,
              almost without fail it will result in Advaita sort of
              experience.</p>

              <p>If our attention were now to be drawn to the screen on which these
              words are written, we would experience the uncanny sensation of
              suddenly becoming aware of something that we simultaneously realise is
              so obvious as to require no mention. And yet at the moment when the
              screen is indicated, we seem to experience something new.<br><br>We
              have the strangely familiar experience of becoming aware of something
              which we were if fact already aware of. We become aware of being aware
              of the screen.<br><br>The screen is not a new experience that is
              created by this indication. However, our awareness of the screen seems
              to be a new experience. <br><br>Now what about the awareness itself,
              which is aware of the screen? Is it not always present behind and
              within every experience, just as the screen is present behind and
              within the words on this page?<br><br>And when our attention is drawn
              to it, do we not have the same strange feeling of having been made
              aware of something that we were in fact always aware of, but had not
              noticed? <br><br>Is this awareness not the most intimate and obvious
              fact of our experience, essential to and yet independent of the
              particular qualities of each experience itself, in the same way that
              the screen is the most obvious fact of this page, essential to and yet
              independent of each word?<br><br>Is this awareness itself not the
              support and the substance of every experience in the same way that the
              screen is the support and the substance of every word?<br><br>Does
              anything new need to be added to this page in order to see the screen?
              Does anything new need to be added to this current experience in order
              to become aware of the awareness that is its support and substance?<br><br>When
              we return to the words, having noticed the screen, do we lose sight of
              the screen? Do we not now see the two, the apparent two, simultaneously
              as one? And did we not always, already experience them as one, without
              realising it?<br><br>Likewise, having noticed the awareness behind and
              within each experience, do we lose sight of that awareness when we
              return the focus of our attention to the objective aspect of
              experience? Do we not now see the two, the apparent two, Awareness and
              its object, simultaneously as one? And has it not always been so?<br><br>Do
              the words themselves affect the screen? Does it matter to the screen
              what is said in the words? Does the content of each experience affect
              the awareness in which it appears? <br><br>Every word on this page is
              in fact only made of screen. It only expresses the nature of the
              screen, although it may describe the moon. <br><br>Every experience only expresses Awareness or Consciousness, although experience itself is infinitely varied.<br><br>Awareness or Consciousness is the open Unknowingness on which every experience is written. <br><br>It is so obvious that it is not noticed.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>All things are your own mind.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>      Our entire existence center around our mind. The mind takes in all the sense impressions, impressed upon it our delusions and voila our reality. This reality arise from causes and conditions. We can't control the causes but it is within our spiritual practice to influence the condition.  Due to different conditions we create different reality.  Many spiritual practices encourage this - particularly the mahayana practice of 6 paramitas.  All these are still within the domain of our delusions.</p>
              <p>      When I asked the "how" I was merely throwing the spanner into the works. Many writers wrote about what emptiness is or what the state of mahamudra is. A thousand poems and a few thousand words can be written about it but how do you convince someone what is sweetness when the person have never tasted sweet in his entire life.</p>
              <p>      So we arrive at methods. Those in the mahamudra camp or zennist group will argue and even quote and cite countless teachers talking about the methodless method. And yet we are no where closer to understanding the mechanics of this methodless method.</p>
              <p>       Essentially, to my mind, there are 2 approaches. One uses concentration to exclude everything else to arrest the general flow of "reality formation."  The second approach is what the mahamudra and the zennist called the "gateless gate" or "methodless method" or some inane and confused labelling  8-).  The approach is basically to create more and more space within our conscious being. The progressive relaxation from the mind created reality that we held on for dear life.  The reality that is totally shattered by the shimmering within the matrix(you have to watch the movie to understand this 8-)).</p>
              <p>      In order for the second approach to be used one has to taste what is "awareness". No amount of words can substitute for it. This is why the "pointing out" in mahamudra practice is so important.  Buddha gave a very good way for us to "know" what is "awareness" or "mindfulness" in the absence of such "pointing out".  Get a glimpse of it and the whole song of mahamudra would come alive. </p>

              <p>A direct glimpse is precious and yet dangerous, hence it's important to have the right view of anatta and emptiness and practice accordingly.</p>

              <p><br>....Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct
                                              ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more
                                              dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.</p>
              <p>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly
                                              understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of
                                              Anatta and Emptiness as antidote....</p>

                                              experience for 3.2 and 3.3 are transcendental and are
                                              precious.<span> </span> However these experiences are
                                              commonly misinterpreted and distorted by objectifying these
                                              experiences into an entity that is “ultimate, changeless and
                                              independent”.<span> </span> The objectified
                                              experience is known as Atman, God or Buddha Nature by  the

                                              non-conceptuality.<span> </span> Usually
                                              practitioners that have experienced 3.2 and 3.3 find it difficult

              <p>....Of all teachings, no teaching is more important then a direct
                                      ‘touch’ of our Buddha essence; but of all dangers, none is more
                                      dangerous than misinterpreting our essence after the ‘touch’.</p>
              <p>The ‘touch’ of the pure sense of existence is often wrongly
                                      understood due to our karmic tendencies.  Use the doctrine of
                                      Anatta and Emptiness as antidote....</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>     In order to interpret/misinterpret one has to superimpose a set of learning, belief system, training etc.  Basically we work ourselves into a state of excitement and frenzy.</p>
              <p>      What if the person has no knowledge or belief system and yet had a "direct touch" of the Buddha ?  There is no knowledge or conceptual framework for such misinterpreting - there is only clarity beyond knowledge.  Krisnamurthi's experience is best understood as such.</p>
              <p>      The use of techniques of meditating on anatta and emptiness are another superficial superimposition on "an experience" which without proper guidance and understanding will lead to harm and damage to the person having such an experience.  In the days of old when many had such spontaneous opening and expansion of consciousness they were considered as nut-cases and many were thrown into institutions for the mentally deranged.  Even today we could find numerous cases of people, particularly in the west, with huge ego superimposing their will upon something that they themselves had no experience nor understanding.</p>
              <p>    Perhaps and I think far more important is to first acknowledge, if we ourselves do not have the experience, that we do not know or cannot make a proper judgement if someone's experience is valid or not. In this way we suspend judgement - neither rationalising if it is valid or if it is not.  With such space in our heart and mind then there is a capacity to understand.  If not then what we are doing is merely to sweep it aside as "something else."  </p>
              <p>      It seems quite strange that in recent years, the hindus would call it the age of aquarius or something, where there is an explosion of spiritual awakening, that many had reported such spontaneous kundalini awakening. Some very mild to very intense and many really didn't know what they had experienced until they met a teacher who could explain to them and guide them. </p>

                                      experience is characterised by a non-judging watcher observing the

                                      that true non-duality is distinctively different from this. The
                                      witness/watcher is really not separated from the rest of the world
                                      . It (this witness) is not unchanging, but is simply a knowingness
                                      that is not apart from the flow of phenomenality.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>   In a non-dual presence the phenomenal world do not exist however will remains. Within such a presence focus could be brought, by will, to bear on phenomenon. The level of engagement could be determined by will. One could remain watching but detached or one could penetrate phenomena wherein insights, deep penetrating insights would arise. A buddha's omniscience is only upon focus, unlike the omniscience of theistic religion such christianity. </p>

                                      came back from a talk and somewhere in there my taiwanese teacher said
                                      in the talk that all six sense faculties are buddha-nature.</p>
              <p>This is also what Thusness have always said - 5 Skhandas, 18
                                                                                                                                      Dhatus is Buddha-Nature.)</p>
              <p>So actually... the five skhandas are all buddha-nature. We

                                                                                                                                  dualistic and is not what Anatta is.</p>
              <p>Anatta means: in the seen only the seen, no seer. In the heard only sound, no hearer. Thought is, no thinker. See Bahiya Sutta (very good article on this: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/ajahn-amaro-on-non-duality-and.html">The Buddha on Non-Duality</a>) or Kalaka Sutta.</p>
              <p>Anatta should not be seen as a Self (i.e. Consciousness) detaching from the Non-self.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Tuvataka Sutta (Sn 4.14):<br><br>[W]hen a person is inwardly quiet there is nowhere a "self" (atta) can be found.  Where then, could a "non-self" (niratta) possibly be found?<br></strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please note -- that when Buddha talk about 5 Skhandas, every skhanda is by nature Anatta, Anicca, and Dukkha -- if you're say Consciousness detach from the other skhandas then are you saying Consciousness here is ultimately real, permanent etc? If you are, then you are contradicting what Buddha taught regarding all the skhandas including consciousness -- <strong>as arising dependent on conditions, as impermanent, as not making up a self.</strong></p>
              <p>Reprimanding the Bhikkhu Sati who held the false view of Consciousness as the Witness, Buddha replied:</p>

              <p> ....Then the Blessed One said: "Sati, is it true, that such an

              <p>"Sati, what is that consciousness?"</p>
              <p>"Venerable sir, it is that which feels and experiences, that
                                              which reaps the results of good and evil actions done here and
                                              there."</p>
              <p>"Foolish man, to whom do you know me having taught the Dhamma
                                              like this. Haven’t I taught, in various ways that consciousness is
                                              dependently arisen. Without a cause, there is no arising of
                                              consciousness. Yet you, foolish man, on account of your wrong view,
                                              you misrepresent me, as well as destroy yourself and accumulate
                                              much demerit, for which you will suffer for a long time."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, what do
                                              you think, has this this bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, learned
                                              anything from this dispensation?" "No, venerable sir."</p>
              <p>When this was said the bhikkhu Sati became silent, unable to
                                              reply back, and sat with drooping shoulders and eyes turned down.
                                              Then the Blessed One, knowing that the bhikkhu Sati had become
                                              silent, unable to reply back, and was sitting with drooping
                                              shoulders and with eyes turned down, told him: "Foolish man, you
                                              will be known on account of this pernicious view; now I will
                                              question the bhikkhus on this."</p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you
                                              too know of this Teaching, the wrong view of the bhikkhu Sati, the
                                              son of a fisherman, on account of which he misrepresents us and
                                              also destroys himself and accumulates much suffering?"</p>
              <p>"No, venerable sir. In various ways we have been taught that
                                              consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause there is no
                                              arising of consciousness."</p>
              <p>"Good, bhikkhus! Good that you know the Dhamma taught by me. In
                                              various ways I have taught that consciousness arises dependently.
                                              Without a cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet, this
                                              bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, by holding to this wrong view,
                                              misrepresents us and destroys himself and accumulates much demerit,
                                              and it will be for his suffering for a long time.</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the condition dependent
                                              upon which it arises. If consciousness arises on account of eye and
                                              forms, it is reckoned as eye consciousness. If on account of ear
                                              and sounds it arises, it is reckoned as ear consciousness. If on
                                              account of nose and smells it arises, it is reckoned as nose
                                              consciousness. If on account of tongue and tastes it arises, it is
                                              reckoned as tongue consciousness. If on account of body and touch
                                              it arises, it is reckoned as body consciousness. If on account of
                                              mind and mind-objects it arises, it is reckoned as mind
                                              consciousness. Bhikkhus, just as a fire is reckoned based on
                                              whatever that fire burns - fire ablaze on sticks is a stick fire,
                                              fire ablaze on twigs is a twig fire, fire ablaze on grass is a
                                              grass fire, fire ablaze on cowdung is a cowdung fire, fire ablaze
                                              on grain thrash is a grain thrash fire, fire ablaze on rubbish is a
                                              rubbish fire - so too is consciousness reckoned by the condition
                                              dependent upon which it arises. In the same manner consciousness
                                              arisen on account is eye and forms is eye consciousness.
                                              Consciousness arisen on account of ear and sounds is ear
                                              consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of nose and smells
                                              is nose consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of tongue
                                              and tastes is taste consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account
                                              of body and touch is body consciousness. Consciousness arisen on
                                              account of mind and mind-objects is mind consciousness.</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, do you see, This has arisen?" "Yes, venerable sir".
                                              "Do you see it arises supported by That?" "Yes, venerable sir."
                                              "Bhikkhus, Do you see if the support ceases, the arising too
                                              ceases?" "Yes, venerable sir."...</p>

              <p>When you talk about Buddha-Nature, you cannot talk about it as the 5th Skhanda. This doesn't make sense in Buddhist context. There is no transcendent element in the skhandas: skhandas means heaps, and what Buddha is saying is that what 'we' are -- our life, our entire experience is only made up of heaps and combinations of conditioned experiences which are categorised into the 5 skhandas... out of which no self could be found within nor apart from the skhandas. i.e. Our 'existence' (not a good word) is only a bunch of transient sensations which are aware where they are, without a separate watcher.</p>
              <p>If you want to treat 5th Skhanda as Buddha-Nature, please take note how Buddha treated the 5th skhanda: just like any other skhandas -- conditioned, impermanent, empty.</p>
              <p>There is another problem when you are trying to reify the 5th skhanda of consciousness into a transcendental element untouched by phenomena, the eternal witness etc (and anyway consciousness is a conditioned phenomena in Buddhism). The Buddha taught that our experience is made up of 18 dhatus (elements), which are the 6 sense doors, 6 sense dust, and 6 sense consciousness. When Buddha spoke of 'consciousness', he is directly refering to the 6 sense consciousnesses: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and mental consciousnesses. That is all! Notice that none of these consciousness is reified into a transcendental Witness, Atman, etc -- they are just conditioned, transient phenomena. And then the Buddha, having taught about the 18 dhatus, said that this is the totality of life, and there is no other totality apart from what he has just explained.</p>
              <p>Note that each moment consciousness is taught in Buddhism as a distinct manifestation when causes and conditions combine. Consciousness is not a watcher, an untouched agent, or even a mirror reflecting -- it is a manifestation due to aggregation of causes and conditions. This is the meaning of the central teachings of Buddhism: Dependent Origination. (See Thusness's Stage Six experience)</p>

              <p>Then what about Buddha Nature or True Self or whatever you want to call it?</p>
              <p>Buddha Nature is either all (like in Mahayana/Vajrayana teachings of Buddha-Nature) or nothing (i.e. nothing as in, in Theravada they do not talk about Buddha-Nature directly, yet they talk about non-duality). Both are actually talking about the same insight in different perspectives. In Shurangama Sutra, Buddha Nature is being presented as being ALL -- 5 Skhandas, 18 Dhatus, 6 Entrances, 12 Places..... it is not distinct and separated from transient, arising and subsiding phenomena.</p>

              <p>Lots of people who have no spiritual background, like Ramana Maharshi and Eckhart Tolle (and I'm sure many others), have a direct glimpse and yet stays at the I AM stage. (Stage 1 and 2 of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a>)</p>
              <p>It's not just a matter of belief system or training -- whether you have a background belief, or system of spiritual thought, or no system of spiritual thought... (unless one has a strong understanding of Anatta and Emptiness) the experience will most likely be misinterpreted due to the deep dualistic and inherent view that is planted deeply in our minds, not just over the years of conditioning in this lifetime, but for countless lifetimes. The bond of the 'Self' is subtle, and almost 100% of the waking and dreaming time affecting the way we perceive reality (in terms of subject/object, perceiver/perceived relationship). We are unable to perceive the truth of 'in the seen only the seen, in the heard only the heard, never a seer/hearer'. We always relate to experience dualistically. And after certain glimpses we will still always sink back, relate back, to a Self, a Source, a 'center', 'witness', 'purest state' or a background reality not knowing there is no observer apart from observed and all appearances are equally the Source/Witness and there's nothing to choose. You should read this article to understand how Karmic Propensities work: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">The Spell of Karmic Propensities</a></p>
              <p>The way everyone (before deep non-dual and emptiness insight) perceive is dualistically and inherently -- whether spiritual or non spiritual people, whether they have previous spiritual training or not. And when someone without the right views and understanding and practice and gains an initial glimpse of awareness, it will almost certainly be distorted.</p>
              <p>It also depends on how one glimpses awareness. For Eckhart Tolle and Ramana they experienced their pure sense of existence - I AM, through dissociating from all thoughts and the body as 'not me' and then realising the remaining consciousness as being the 'purest' and the 'most ME'. Because of this, they experience Consciousness as being dissociated from all phenomena. And as Longchen said at this stage there is an erroneous concept that '<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>there is a relative world

                                                                              and hearing it click shut. It wasn't I who woke up: inquiry woke
                                                                              up. The two polarities, the left and right of things, the

                                                                              the delight of it. I saw that it was all backward. It's not a foot;

                                                                              felt like a lie. It was absurd. And the laughter kept pouring out
                                      
                                                                              of me. I saw that <em>cockroach</em> <em>foot</em> are names for

              <p>That said even though there is nondual insight, without the View of Dependent Origination or Emptiness to give rise to the further insight of non-inherency, the mind is still not able to sync nondual experience with right views. When insight of non-inherency/emptiness arises, that is Thusness's Stage 6.</p>
              <p>The view of D.O./Emptiness is important and most people think 'resting as awareness' 'being naked in awareness' and nondual experience is enough -- it is not enough to dissolve our dualistic and inherent view, see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/02/thusnesss-reply-to-longchen-at.html">The Link Between Non-Duality and Emptiness</a>. Hence the View of Dependent Origination is still important even though it is a raft and ultimately is dissolved (along with all dualistic and inherent views). The teaching of Dependent Origination and Emptiness is peculiar to Buddhism.</p>

              <p>What you said is very right. We must acknowledge everyone's experience and not dismiss them without our knowledge. If we have not had transcendental experience, we should not dismiss them as nut-cases. If we already have certain transcendental experiences/insights but have not attained the higher levels of insight, we should not dismiss those that have.</p>
              <p>Every transcendental experience is valid in their own ways, and precious in their own ways. Yes, the majority of people have distorted understandings of their experience, and there are depths of insight in everyone's experience which can be correlated to <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a> , but whatever one's experience and insight is valid, important, in its own ways. Even the initial experience of "I AMness" is important in its own ways and paves the way for further insights if the person is a humble, sincere, diligent practitioner.</p>
              <p>When Thusness experienced I AMness, and the conviction in the I AM is very strong, he was still humble enough to enter Buddhism and investigate the Buddha's teachings and that is why he attained further insights into No-Self and Emptiness. Even today he say he says he always keep the mindset that "I have not experienced everything the Buddha experienced" and hence there is always room for further progress.</p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;"><br>So
                                  in the Buddhist paradigm, it is not only not necessary to have an
                                  eternal ground for liberation, but in fact the belief in such a ground
                                  itself is part of the dynamics of ignorance. We move here to another to
                                  major difference within the two paradigms. In Hinduism liberation
                                  occurs when this illusory Samsara is completely relinquished and it
                                  vanishes; what remains is the eternal Brahma, which is the same as
                                  liberation. Since the thesis is that Samsara is merely an illusion,
                                  when it vanishes through knowledge, if there were no eternal Brahma
                                  remaining, it would be a disaster. So in the Hindu paradigm (or
                                  according to Buddhism all paradigms based on ignorance), an eternal
                                  unchanging, independent, really existing substratum (Skt. mahavastu) is
                                  a necessity for liberation, else one would fall into nihilism. But
                                  since the Buddhist paradigm is totally different, the question posed by
                                  Hindu scholars: “How can there be liberation if a Brahma does not
                                  remain after the illusory Samsara vanishes in Gyana?” is a non question
                                  with no relevance in the Buddhist paradigm and its Enlightenment or
                                  Nirvana.<br><br>First of all, to the Buddha and Nagarjuna, Samsara is
                                  not an illusion but like an illusion. There is a quantum leap in the
                                  meaning of these two statements. Secondly, because it is only ‘like an
                                  illusion’ i.e. interdependently arisen like all illusions, it does not
                                  and cannot vanish, so Nirvana is not when Samsara vanishes like mist
                                  and the Brahma arises like the sun out of the mist but rather when
                                  seeing that the true nature of Samsara is itself Nirvana. So whereas
                                  Brahma and Samsara are two different entities, one real and the other
                                  unreal, one existing and the other non-existing, Samsara and Nirvana in
                                  Buddhism are one and not two. Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in
                                  Nagarjuna’s words shunyata is the nature of Samsara. It is the
                                  realization of the nature of Samsara as empty which cuts at the very
                                  root of ignorance and results in knowledge not of another thing beyond
                                  Samsara but of the way Samsara itself actually exists (Skt.
                                  vastusthiti), knowledge of Tathata (as it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as
                                  it really is) of Samsara itself. It is this knowledge that liberates
                                  from wrong conceptual experience of Samsara to the unconditioned
                                  experience of Samsara itself. That is what is meant by the
                                  indivisibility of Samsara and Nirvana (Skt. Samsara nirvana abhinnata,
                                  Tib: Khor de yer me). The mind being Samsara in the context of
                                  DzogChen, Mahamudra and Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be substituted
                                  by dualistic mind. The Hindu paradigm is world denying, affirming the
                                  Brahma. The Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it only
                                  rectifies our wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. It does
                                  not give a dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara. Because
                                  such a dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to present such a
                                  dream would be only to perpetuate ignorance.</span></p>
              <p>......................</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;">Now
                                  let’s examine the Relative Truth (Skt. samvritti satya). In Hinduism,
                                  the Relative Truth is the fact that this world is an illusion (Skt.
                                  maya), it has no existence. In Buddhism, Samsara is interdependently
                                  arising. It has relative existence (Skt. samvritti satta) according to
                                  Tsong Khapa or it appears conventionally according to Gorampa Senge and
                                  Mipham. It is like an illusion (Skt. mayavat). Like all illusions, it
                                  appears interdependently based on various causes and conditions (Skt.
                                  hetu-pratyaya). It may be like an illusion but it is the only thing we
                                  have, there is nothing behind it or beyond it which can be called an
                                  ultimate thing or reality. The Ultimate Reality or Truth or fact in the
                                  Buddhist sense is the mode of existence of this illusion like Samsara
                                  i.e. (Skt. nihsvabhava) empty of real existence. So here too we find
                                  two different parameters to two different paradigms.</span></p>

                                                  water. It appears to be really a pool of water but is really just
                                                  vibrating energy. Vivid manifestation of luminosity -- yet

                                                  the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in

              <p>As I have written:</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">Awareness or
                                                  Buddha-Nature is not the same as focused attention or concentration.
                                                  Awareness is effortlessly happening right now, whether you like it or
                                                  not, and whether you are paying attention or not. When causes and

                                                  it, it's being awared. While paying attention to the breath, something
                                                  still hears sounds. That is Buddha-Nature. It is the sum of all our
                                                  parts, that which sees, hears, feels and tastes all at once as One
                                                  Reality. Before you think that this awareness is a 'thing' -- a Mirror
                                                  or a Witness, it's not separate -- it's just sound hearing, scenery
                                                  seeing, it's not a something tangible (a Mirror or a Witness) yet is

                                                  here in awareness! When there is a waking up from fantasy, there is no

                                                  open being is not something to be practiced methodically. Toni points
                                                  out that it takes no effort to hear the sounds in the room; it's all

                                                  the spaciousness is gone—the mind is occupied with a story and the

              <p> </p>
              <p>Judith Blackstone also nicely puts it:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>"Nondual
                                                  consciousness is not a state of attention. It is experienced without
                                                  effort of any kind. It is the mind completely at rest. In fact, there
                                                  is not even a sense that the mind is resting, for that is still an
                                                  activity of sorts. Rather, one experiences a simple lucid openness in
                                                  which the phenomena of the world appear, and through which experiences
                                                  such as thoughts, emotions, and sensations move without obstruction.<br></strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>There
                                                  is also a sense that one's consciousness is pervading all of the
                                                  content of one's experience. Rather than an encounter between one's own
                                                  head and the objects outside of one's head, as experienced in
                                                  intentional, dualistic consciousness states, nondual consciousness is
                                                  experienced globally. It pervades and subsumes one's whole body and
                                                  everything in one's environment at the same time. "Consciousness is
                                                  encountered as something more like a field than a localized point, a
                                                  field that transcends the body and yet somehow interacts with it"
                                                  (Forman, in Gallagher &amp; Shear, 1999, p. 373).</strong></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><em><strong>One
                                                  of the main characteristics of nondual realization is that it is
                                                  discovered, rather than created, as rigid subjective organizations are
                                                  released. Constructivists may insist that nondual consicousness is
                                                  itself a conceptual construct. Speaking both from my own experience as
                                                  well as from traditional accounts, I can attest that nondual
                                                  realization is a process of gradually letting go of one's grip on
                                                  oneself and one's environment -- as if opening a clenched fist. It does
                                                  require concentrated effort and time to achieve a certain degree of
                                                  letting go. But the expanse of nondual consciousness, pervading oneself
                                                  and one's environment as a unified whole, appears of its own accord as
                                                  a result of this letting go, and continues to appear, without any
                                                  effort on one's own part."</strong></em></span></p>

              <p>At the I AM stage, Consciousness is seen as a boundless, void witnessing background container wherein phenomena arise from and subside to yet the void background container remains unmoved and unchanged, and Consciousness is distinct from the phenomena. Consciousness is seen as the 'source' or the 'ground reality' for everything yet is not everything. Yet the further (nondual) insight must be that all appearances is already the source -- there is no other witnessing background or source to fall back to. Everything is the ground reality. Ground reality is not a container for everything because everything is the groundless ground.</p>
              <p>As Douglas E. Harding said regarding his nondual insight:</p>
              <p><em><strong>Victim of a prolonged fit of madness, of a lifelong hallucination (and by "hallucination" I mean what my dictionary says: apparent perception of an object not actually present), I had invariably seen myself as pretty much like other people, and certainly never as a decapitated but still living biped. I had been blind to the one thing that is always present, and without which I am blind indeed -- to this marvelous substitute-for-a-head, this unbounded clarity, this luminous and absolutely pure void, <span style="color: #ff0000;">which nevertheless is -- rather than contains -- all that's on offer. For, however carefully I attend, I fail to find here even so much as a blank screen on which these mountains and sun and sky are projected, or a clear mirror in which they are reflected, or a transparent lens or aperture through which they are viewed -- still less a person to whom they are presented, or a viewer (however shadowy) who is distinguishable from the view. Nothing whatever intervenes, not even that baffling and elusive obstacle called "distance": the visibly boundless blue sky, the pink-edged whiteness of the snows, the sparkling green of the grass -- how can these be remote, when there's nothing to be remote from?</span> The headless void here refuses all definition and location: it is not round, or small, or big, or even here as distinct from there. (And even if there were a head here to measure outwards from, the measuring-rod stretching from it to that mountain peak would, when read end-on -- and there's no other way for me to read it -- reduce to a point, to nothing.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">In fact, these coloured shapes present themselves in all its simplicity, without any such complications as near or far, this or that, mine or not mine, seen-by-me or merely given. All twoness -- all duality of subject and object -- has vanished: it is no longer read into a situation which has no room for it.</span></strong></em></p>

              <p>"In", "out", "under", "over", "within", "without" are all labels that articulate our experiences into constructs for the thinking mind to understand.  Such labels obscure the mind from seeing directly'.  The subject/object dichotomy blinds us like a magic spell and usually requires decades of practices to break this bond.  Since you have already experienced this mirror clarity behind all transience phenomena and this experience is so real and precious to you, it will not be obvious that u have objectified it into a metaphysical essence for grasping.  At present just polish diligently the mirror so that no dust can alight.</p>

                                      disconcerting with the disconnection and then a new found freedom.
                                      With this realisation direct perception - by-passing sense
                                      impressions, perception and volition become possible.  Not
                                      before.</p>
              <p>     Anatta insight is when sense
                                      impressions, perception and emotions is seen to be separate from
                                      one's awareness...a kind of detached meta-cognition....where one is
                                      not moved to engage whatever that flows by. But one do have the
                                      choice to engage or disengage.Phenomenal world continue to reside
                                      in the mind. Direct perception is still not possible.</p>

              <p>Although the background mirror is “more free and boundless” than a
              mind full of chattering thoughts, as much as I would not like to say and sincerely,
              it is not the experiential insight of anatta. Therefore, it is still
              too early to say “not possible” at this point in time.
              Perhaps in the later phase of our practice it may reveal that this
              “detached meta-cognition” is the ultimate block that ‘dual’ our
              experiences; it is what that split the experiencer from his experiences
              and being the 'experiencer, it is not 'anatta'.  It is nothing more
              than a karmic tendency to divide.</p>
              <p>I will make this my last post for this thread as at present all words will proof futile and it is not healthy to engage in too many words for now.  Just let be.</p>
              <p>Nice chat and thanks for the sharing. :)</p>

              <p>an answer to this question would be taking a position with regard to reality, which is what the ego does, the ego is form, is limited, and can and does take a position and have an opinion on things</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but enlightenment is about being aware of the ego and it's workings, which includes taking positions, so anwering the above question is impossible for someone who knows that his thoughts and beliefs are just that, thoughts and beliefs, and are not to be taken as absolute truth</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>absolute truth, it seems to me, cannot be spoken about, because it holds no position, has no opinion, it simply is... and is not... in the conventional sense of existence</p>
