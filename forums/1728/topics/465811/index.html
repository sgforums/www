              <p>It is often I read about scandal news of religious leaders <span class="st">succumb to sexual temptation and unable to </span>abstain from sexual misconduct.  If a highly religious leader cannot resist sexual temptation, how about common people like us? Is this the most difficult precept to undertake?</p>
              <p>http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?_r=0</p>
              <p>Since arriving in Los Angeles from <a class="meta-loc" title="More news and information about Japan." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/japan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo">Japan</a> in 1962, the Buddhist teacher Joshu Sasaki, who is 105 years old, has 
              taught thousands of Americans at his two Zen centers in the area and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/us/09zen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">one in New Mexico</a>.
               He has influenced thousands more enlightenment seekers through a chain 
              of some 30 affiliated Zen centers from the Puget Sound to Princeton to 
              Berlin. And he is known as a Buddhist teacher of Leonard Cohen, the poet
               and songwriter.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sasaki has also, according to <a title="The report" href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/02/12/us/Joshu-Sasaki-investigation-report.html">an investigation</a> by an independent council of Buddhist leaders, released in January, 
              groped and sexually harassed female students for decades, taking 
              advantage of their loyalty to a famously charismatic roshi, or master.</p>
              <p>The allegations against Mr. Sasaki have upset and obsessed Zen Buddhists across the country, who are part of a <a id="_GPLITA_1" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?_r=0#">close</a>-knit world in which many participants seem to know, or at least know of, the principal teachers.</p>
              <p>Mr. Sasaki did not respond to requests for interviews made through <a href="http://siom.edu/core-faculty/26-paul-karsten-med-lac">Paul Karsten</a>,
               a member of the board of Rinzai-ji, his main center in Los Angeles. Mr.
               Karsten said that Mr. Sasaki’s senior priests are conducting their own 
              inquiry. And he cautioned that the independent council took the <a id="_GPLITA_0" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?_r=0#">accounts</a> it heard from dozens of students at face value and did not investigate any “for veracity.”</p>
              <p>Because Mr. Sasaki has founded or sponsored so many Zen centers, and 
              because he has the prestige of having trained in Japan, the charges that
               he behaved unethically — and that his supporters looked the other way —
               have implications for an entire way of life.</p>
              <p>Such charges have become more frequent in Zen Buddhism. Several other 
              teachers have been accused of misconduct recently, notably Eido Shimano,
               who in 2010 was asked to resign from the Zen Studies Society in 
              Manhattan over allegations that he had sex with students. Critics and 
              victims have pointed to a Zen culture of secrecy, patriarchy and sexism,
               and to the quasi-religious worship of the Zen master, who can easily 
              abuse his status.</p>
              <p>Disaffected students wrote letters to the board of one of Mr. Sasaki’s 
              Zen centers as early as 1991. Yet it was only last November, when Eshu 
              Martin, a Zen priest who studied under Mr. Sasaki from 1997 to 2008, <a title="Eshu Martin’s Letter to SweepingZen.com" href="http://sweepingzen.com/everybody-knows-by-eshu-martin/">posted a letter</a> to <a href="http://sweepingzen.com/">SweepingZen.com</a>, a popular Web site, that the wider Zen world noticed.</p>
              <p>Mr. Martin, <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?_r=0#">now</a> a Zen abbot in Victoria, British Columbia, accused Mr. Sasaki of a 
              “career of misconduct,” from “frequent and repeated non-consensual 
              groping of female students” to “sexually coercive after-hours ‘tea’ 
              meetings, to affairs,” as well as interfering in his students’ 
              marriages. Soon thereafter, the independent “witnessing council” of 
              noted Zen teachers began interviewing 25 current or former students of 
              Mr. Sasaki.</p>
              <p>Some former students are now speaking out, including seven interviewed 
              for this article, and their stories provide insight into the culture of <a href="http://www.rinzaiji.org/">Rinzai-ji</a> and the <a title="Albuquerque Journal article" href="http://www.abqjournal.com/main/2013/02/03/news/zen-master-molested-students-in-nm.html">other places</a> where Mr. Sasaki taught. Women say they were encouraged to believe that
               being touched by Mr. Sasaki was part of their Zen training.</p>
              <p>The Zen group, or sangha, can become one’s close family, and that aspect
               of Zen may account for why women and men have been reluctant to speak 
              out for so long.</p>
              <p>Many women whom Mr. Sasaki touched were resident monks at his centers. 
              One woman who confronted Mr. Sasaki in the 1980s found herself an 
              outcast afterward. The woman, who asked that her name not be used to 
              protect her privacy, said that afterward “hardly anyone in the sangha, 
              whom I had grown up with for 20 years, would have anything to do with 
              us.”</p>
              <p>In the council’s report on Jan. 11, the three members wrote of “Sasaki 
              asking women to show him their breasts, as part of ‘answering’ a koan” —
               a Zen riddle — “or to demonstrate ‘non-attachment.’ ”</p>
              <p>When the report was posted to SweepingZen, Mr. Sasaki’s senior priests 
              wrote in a post that their group “has struggled with our teacher Joshu 
              Sasaki Roshi’s sexual misconduct for a significant portion of his career
               in the United States” — their <a href="http://www.rinzaijioshos.org/">first such admission</a>.</p>
              <p>Among those who spoke to the council and for this article was Nikki 
              Stubbs, who now lives in Vancouver, and who studied and worked at <a href="http://www.mbzc.org/">Mount Baldy, Mr. Sasaki’s Zen center 50 miles east of Los Angeles</a>,
               from 2003 to 2006. During that time, she said, Mr. Sasaki would fondle 
              her breasts during sanzen, or private meeting; he also asked her to 
              massage his penis. She would wonder, she said, “Was this teaching?”</p>
              <p>One monk, whom Ms. Stubbs said she told about the touching, was 
              unsympathetic. “He believed in Roshi’s style, that sexualizing was 
              teaching for particular women,” Ms. Stubbs said. The monk’s theory, 
              common in Mr. Sasaki’s circle, was that such physicality could check a 
              woman’s overly strong ego.</p>
              <p>A former student of Mr. Sasaki’s now living in the San Francisco area, 
              who asked that her name be withheld to protect her privacy, said that at
               Mount Baldy in the late 1990s, “the monks confronted Roshi and said, 
              ‘This behavior is unacceptable and has to stop.’ ” However, she said, 
              “nothing changed.” After a time, Mr. Sasaki used Zen teaching to justify
               touching her, too.</p>
              <p>“He would say something like, ‘True love is giving yourself to 
              everything,’ ” she explained. At Mount Baldy, the isolation could hamper
               one’s judgment. “It can sound trite, but you’re in this extreme state 
              of consciousness,” she said — living at a monastery in the mountains, 
              sitting in silence for many hours a day — “where boundaries fall away.”</p>
              <p>Joe Marinello is a Zen teacher in Seattle who served on the board of the
               Zen Studies Society in New York. He has been openly critical of Mr. 
              Shimano, the former abbot who was asked to resign from the society. 
              Asked about teachers who say that sexual touch is an appropriate <a id="_GPLITA_0" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0#">teaching technique</a>, he was dismissive.</p>
              <p>“In my opinion,” Mr. Marinello said in an e-mail, “it’s just their 
              cultural and personal distortion to justify their predations.”</p>
              <p>But in Zen Buddhism, students often overlook their teachers’ failings, 
              participants say. Some Buddhists define their philosophy in contrast to 
              Western religion: Buddhism, they believe, does not have Christian-style 
              preoccupations about things like sex. And Zen exalts the relationship 
              between a student and a teacher, who can come to seem irreplaceable.</p>
              <p>“Outside the sexual things that happened,” the woman <a id="_GPLITA_2" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0#">now</a> in San Francisco said, “my relationship with him was one of the most important I have had with anyone.”</p>
              <p>Several women said that Zen can foster an atmosphere of overt sexism. 
              Jessica Kramer, a doula in Los Angeles, was Mr. Sasaki’s personal 
              attendant in 2002. She said that he would reach into her robe and that 
              she always resisted his advances. Surrounded almost entirely by men, she
               said she got very little sympathy. “I’d talk about it with people who’d
               say, ‘Why not just let him touch your breasts if he wants to touch your
               breasts?’ ”</p>
              <p>Susanna Stewart began studying with Mr. Sasaki about 40 years ago. 
              Within six months, she said, Mr. Sasaki began to touch her during 
              sanzen. This sexualizing of their relationship “led to years of 
              confusion and pain,” Ms. Stewart said, “eventually resulting in my 
              becoming unable to practice Zen.” And when she married one of his 
              priests, Mr. Sasaki tried to break them up, she said, even encouraging 
              her husband to have an affair.</p>
              <p>In 1992, Ms. Stewart’s husband disaffiliated himself and his <a href="http://www.nczencenter.org/">North Carolina Zen Center</a> from Mr. Sasaki. Years later, his wife said, he received hate mail from members of his old Zen group.</p>
              <p>The witnessing council, which wrote the report, has no official authority. Its members belong to the American Zen <a id="_GPLITA_1" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/asia/zen-buddhists-roiled-by-accusations-against-teacher.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0#">Teachers</a> Association but collected stories on their own initiative, although 
              with a statement of support from 45 other teachers and priests. One of 
              its authors, Grace Schireson, said that Zen Buddhists in the United 
              States have misinterpreted a Japanese philosophy.</p>
              <p>“Because of their long history with Zen practice, people in Japan have 
              some skepticism about priests,” Ms. Schireson said. But in the United 
              States many proponents have a “devotion to the guru or the teacher in a 
              way that could repress our common sense and emotional intelligence.”</p>
              <p>Last Thursday morning, at Rinzai-ji on Cimarron Street in Los Angeles, 
              Bob Mammoser, a resident monk, said that Mr. Sasaki’s “health is quite 
              frail” and that he has “basically withdrawn from any active teaching.” 
              Mr. Mammoser said there is talk of a meeting at the center to discuss 
              what, if any, action to take.</p>
              <p>Mr. Mammoser said he first became aware of allegations against Mr. 
              Sasaki in the 1980s. “There have been efforts in the past to address 
              this with him,” Mr. Mammoser said. “Basically, they haven’t been able to
               go anywhere.”</p>
              <p>He added: “What’s important and is overlooked is that, besides this 
              aspect, Roshi was a commanding and inspiring figure using Buddhist 
              practice to help thousands find more peace, clarity and happiness in 
              their own lives. It seems to be the kind of thing that, you get the 
              person as a whole, good and bad, just like you marry somebody and you 
              get their strengths and wonderful qualities as well as their 
              weaknesses.”</p>

              <p>Hello happy new year...!</p>
              <p>A bit confused which you are trying to say: the difficulty of observing precepts or the sexual misconduct of buddhist teachers?</p>
              <p>There are too many instances of misbehaviours to list down. What i think we should rely on buddhadharma but not the teachers.</p>
              <p>As for precepts, i strongly encourage you to accept and observe. Everytime when u are about to do something wrong, the precepts will pop into your mind and remind u.</p>

              <p>Well, happy new year,</p>
              <p>According the Buddha, we live in the desire realm and hence, such occurance is not unusual. It is just amazing that he has managed to maintain his libido at his age! He's very attached and doesn't seem to have internalized the Zen teachings. However, for such an exteemed member to the Zen community, it must be disheartening to many and it can lead many to lose faith in the teachings. When such an esteemed member commit sexual misconduct, it leads to many people losing faith in the Dharma. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Anyway, why look at one master who feel from grace when there are so many other great masters and practitioners that are exemplary in this practice and conduct?</span></p>

              <p>Why look at the black sheeps? There are so many monks and lay Buddhists who can observe the precepts, why look at those few who can't? The fact that there are so many monks and lay Buddhists who can observe the precepts just got to show that it is not difficult to observe. </p>
              <p>Guanyin Pusa's sutra states that anyone with high sexual desire, should recite her name. One of my friend told me that it is very effective. </p>

              Some will find keeping precepts very easy. Some will find it difficult. And I suspect some of those teachers are not even taking the precepts seriously including teachers. These are the people who overlook karma.
                          
              Indeed, why compare with teachers? Buddha never chose a patriarch. He never set up a pope or successor. Frankly I don't take positions of "lineage" seriously, I judge that person by his wisdom and qualities. People in lineage positions can be screwed up too.
                  
              Lineages teachers does not automatically mean enlightened or well practiced. And there are many practitioners who don't teach that are deeply enlightened and well practised.

              <blockquote>
              <p>If a highly religious leader
                  cannot resist sexual temptation, how about common people like us?
                  Is this the most difficult precept to undertake?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I can understand somewhat your reasoning behind the questions. I would sometimes ask myself questions like these when I hear or read about reports of misconduct by religious leaders.</p>
              <p>However, the most important issue is to remind oneself, what are the original core values of that particular religion that the leader is practising? The fact is, humans are not infallible, even for those who we perceive as highly religious.</p>
              <p>Comparison is not necessarily bad, unless your mindset is mainly to give yourself an excuse not to do your best in restraining from doing what you clearly know to be wrong.</p>
              <p>The question should not be whether any particular precept is the most difficult to undertake. We should ask ourselves to consider first, whether one already has the right understanding about the kind of undesirable outcomes that would come true for us if we are not putting in the right effort to observe any precept.</p>
              <p>Assuming you get the answer that refraining from sexual misconduct is the most difficult precept to undertake, would choosing not to undertake the precept make you any better in resisting sexual temptation now and in the future? Or would you rather tell yourself, even if every religious leader I know fails in observing any precept perfectly at any point in time, I would still continue to make whatever effort I can to undertake that precept because I understand what would happen if I choose not to.</p>
