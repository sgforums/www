              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">We visualize deities to connect
              with their enlightened energy, purity, and sacredness, which is our own nature
              as well. Anyen Rinpoche and Allison Choying Zangmo teach us how to visualize
              Avalokiteshvara, the embodiment of perfect compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>We are constantly
              thwarted by our own expectations. For most of us, fantasizing about how things
              “should be” is a constant source of anguish. We wish our parents, our children,
              our friends, our jobs, our own health, and even the person standing in line in
              front of us at the grocery store would be just so. We often bring this
              hard-headed mindset to meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>We may have had
              the romantic idea that meditation was about sitting in a candlelit, quiet room
              and “emptying” the mind of all of its conceptual thoughts, bringing us calm and
              blissful feelings. Meditation actually offers something much more
              revolutionary. If we do it right, it gives us new eyes, new senses, and a new
              world. It opens us up to a part of our own mind we’ve never seen or experienced
              before.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>If we have begun
              practicing the Vajrayana tradition seriously, we have probably found that this
              revolutionary approach entails much more than just sitting quietly in a dim
              room. Almost all Vajrayana meditation practice includes some component of
              visualization practice. It is also called “generation stage practice” (Tib.<span> </span><em>skyed
              rim</em>) because we generate each aspect of a particular visualization
              in stages, honing our ability to focus and concentrate with each stage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Generation stage
              practice can seem contradictory to our expectations. First, we might think that
              certain parts of Vajrayana Buddhism associated with this style of meditation
              practice—bright colors, ritual items,<span> </span><em>thangkas</em>, the recitation of mantras
              and prayer<em>sadhanas</em>—are
              merely parts of Tibetan culture and should be excised from the American
              Buddhist tradition. Another idea we might have is that meditation should empty
              the mind of concepts. When we work with visualization practice, aren’t we just
              piling more concepts on top of an already conceptual mind?  A third idea
              about visualization is that it is difficult, and that meditation should
              actually be natural, easy, and enjoyable. If we read the traditional sadhanas
              and texts that present the methods for visualizing deities—for example, the
              refuge tree or Vajrasattva—the instructions are extremely detailed; we feel
              incapable of even visualizing a very small part of what we are instructed to
              visualize. For that reason, we might think this practice is just not for us.
              However, in spiritual practice, as in life, our expectations are just
              that—projections and misunderstandings of how things actually are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>I teach generation
              stage practice to Western Buddhists who have a great desire to progress on the
              Buddhist path and who are also open and willing to try something new. I believe
              that many Western Buddhists haven’t understood the proper context in which to
              place this practice, and for that reason, it is contrary to their expectations.
              I should say up front that generation stage is a difficult practice. Becoming
              skillful at it entails the same amount of effort, if not more, that we put into
              our professional careers, families, and worldly obligations. We have to let go
              of the idea that meditation is easy and natural, along with all of the other
              fantasies we have about ourselves and the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Why is training
              in generation stage practice so essential to Vajrayana Buddhism? We can find
              the answer to this question within ourselves. It is likely that we became
              interested in meditation because we were tired of living with ourselves. The
              human mind is restless; it is unable to relax quietly even for an instant. The
              constant barrage of thoughts, emotions, judgments, criticisms, and obsessions
              is exhausting. Because the mind is dominated by conceptual thoughts and
              emotions, we aren’t open to other experiences. The mind cannot find even a
              moment’s peace, and neither can we.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Although it may
              appear to be merely a conceptual exercise, generation stage practice is an
              excellent method for helping the mind find rest and refuge from the unceasing
              landslide of thoughts and emotions. When we are working to generate a
              visualization, we are focusing so fully that the mind has no choice but to drop
              the things it normally chases after. And this is not just true of our visual
              sense. Visualization practice is a multisensory experience. For example, when
              we recite mantras, we work with the sensory experience of sound. If we are
              working at the full experience of the visualization, even the senses of touch,
              taste, and smell are absorbed into that experience.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>So, we should
              understand that the purpose of generation stage practice is tied to pacifying
              conceptual mind. We may have the idea that we are simply overlaying more
              concepts upon concepts, but actually we are using the mind’s ability to focus
              to cut through conceptual mind itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>But the purpose
              of generation stage practice does not end there. To deepen our understanding of
              this practice, let’s use the simple example of visualizing Avalokiteshvara, the
              quintessential bodhisattva of compassion. He is an example not just of ordinary
              compassion but also of immeasurable compassion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>You may have
              experience working with a sadhana, or a ritual practice, that helps you
              visualize Avalokiteshvara in stages. However, such experience isn’t necessary.
              For the purposes of this explanation, we will rely upon just one verse as an
              invocation and refer to an image of Avalokiteshvara in his ordinary form: white
              in color, with four arms, seated in vajra posture, with two legs, and
              ornamented in the sambhogakaya style.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>We start with the
              invocation:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>HRI   I prostrate to
              Avalokiteshvara,</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>Whose white body is uncontaminated
              by fault</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>Whose head is adorned by the
              perfect buddhas,</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>And whose compassionate eyes
              watch over beings!</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Next, we work at
              trying to “see” some of the details of Avalokiteshvara’s appearance, which are
              present in the illustration. Here, we use the word “see” metaphorically. We
              aren’t capable of visualizing in great detail in the beginning, because we
              haven’t trained and practiced in this technique. Instead we “see” with eyes of
              devotion, our own conviction that it is just so.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>In the very
              beginning, we may find that while we wish to visualize Avalokiteshvara, we are
              unable to concentrate on anything at all. In that case, we can start very
              slowly. We could begin by visualizing Avalokiteshvara’s face. Perhaps even that
              is too much, so we may want to concentrate on the shape of his eyes or his
              mouth. Once that becomes easier, we can move to another part of his body, such
              as his hands. Slowly, over time, we will develop the ability to see all of the
              details of Avalokiteshvara’s form.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Another method
              that we could use to train in visualization is to rely on an image of
              Avalokiteshvara: a painting on the wall above our shrine or a statue in our
              practice room. We could look at the image, concentrating on it deeply, then
              look away from the image and try to maintain what we saw. We can do this
              repeatedly, looking at the image and then turning away from it, in order to
              increase our ability to concentrate on Avalokiteshvara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>We are not just
              trying to connect with an image of Avalokiteshvara as an exercise in<em>shamatha</em>, or one-pointedness. We
              are trying to connect with Avalokiteshvara’s energy, his great compassionate
              nature. Avalokiteshvara’s four arms are symbolic of the four immeasurable
              qualities of loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity. Generation stage
              practice is about trying to connect with Avalokiteshvara’s energy and using the
              mind’s focus and concentration to bring forth that energy in ourselves. When we
              visualize Avalokiteshvara in front of us, we may also want to visualize
              ourselves as Avalokitesvara, cultivating that seed of great compassion in
              ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>If we want to
              take a break from focusing on the visualization, we can concentrate the mind by
              using a prayer to invoke the great, compassionate energy of the four
              immeasurable qualities:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>May all sentient beings have
              happiness and the cause of happiness!</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>May all sentient beings be free
              of suffering and the cause of suffering!</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>May all sentient beings not be
              separated from great happiness free of suffering!</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>May all sentient beings dwell in
              great equanimity free from passion, aggression, and prejudice!</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Then we can
              return to visualizing when we are ready. One misconception we may have is that
              we should be able to maintain a visualization for a long period of time.
              However, as with all practices of meditation, the experience of concentrated
              visualization will be momentary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>In generation
              stage practice, we are also connecting with the energy of purity. Our ordinary
              minds constantly see individuals and the world around us impurely. Working with
              visualization practice, we are connecting with something that is sacred and
              completely pure. Avalokiteshvara is not merely a cultural icon of Tibet. He is
              an embodiment of complete purity, of enlightened energy, and of compassion. His
              white color is symbolic of his perfectly pure nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Generation stage
              practice awakens the mind to what is called “pure perception.” Focusing on
              Avalokiteshvara’s pure nature can help us relate to the world in a less
              judgmental way. Our ordinary way of doing this is to avoid or push aside judgmental
              thoughts and ideas. However, when we engage in generation stage practice, the
              transformation of the mind is natural and very deep. We are not just
              superimposing some concept over our actual experience and saying, “Everything
              around us is good.” Instead, we are training in pure vision, in order to see
              the world’s pure nature. We are doing this through the mind’s concentration on
              a sacred expression of compassion and purity.</span></p>

              should not limit our practice of the generation stage to formal meditation
              practice. We should carry our connection to Avalokiteshvara out with us into
              the world. In the Vajrayana tradition, we say that when we finish practicing,
              we “carry the energy of the deity with us.” That means we carry
              Avalokiteshvara’s compassionate energy and pure vision with us into the world,
              and also try to see that nature in others. We can even try to see others as
              Avalokiteshvara. Ultimately, the goal of generation stage practice is to awaken
              to the reality that all beings are indivisible from Avalokiteshvara’s own
              nature.</span></p>

              others, and the world around us through pure eyes thoroughly transforms our
              experience of life. And the benefit doesn’t stop there. Generation stage
              practice creates a chain reaction as we bring warmth, compassion, and openness
              to others, and into the environment around us.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
