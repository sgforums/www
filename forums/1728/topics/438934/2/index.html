              <p>tot u already said, </p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"ghosts were also humans previously."</span></p>
              <p>so from 3rd eye's information, for those reborn <strong>after </strong>the human realm will appear exactly as the time of dead. as there's a form of attachment from the human realm that is brought forward to the ghost realm. and those died in accident where the body is deformed would also be like that - deformed.  previously an angmoh, will also be an angmoh. previously from 18th century, die also look like 18th century. i heard the 3rd eye saw japanese from the world war. they also saw those died from the tsunami in phuket. these are provided that they are born from human realm. those born from hell realm up, i'm not too sure. perhaps no difference. until they are born into animal and then into human, look then change. then cycle again. </p>
              <p>i also imagine they like zombies in the movies. walking aimlessly. when see fresh human(food), they move in greedily to attack /snatch. also imagine they like guppies i use to have when young, swimming aimlessly also. when u drop some food into the water, they also greedily attack /fight for the food. </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>

I also gave them a picture of the Vajrasattva Buddha and the verses for them to chant along with the recording. <span> </span>I was told that the being has since left and their home has been peaceful since.<span>  </span>There were no more strange sightings.</span></p>
