              <p>Practitioners of the method of chanting the Buddha's name not only recite "Amitabha Buddha",<strong> but in addition should also cultivate merits.</strong> It is stated in the Amitabha Sutra that <strong>rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not possible via conditions that are lacking in virtuous roots, blessings and merits.</strong> For instance, when we have practised and perfected the Six Parameters (1. Observing the Precepts, 2. Endurance, 3. Giving, 4. Zeal and Progress, 5. Meditation, and 6. Wisdom), then to be reborn in the Western Pure Land is a simple matter. If you have accomplished a mind that is as pure as the Amitabha Buddha's, then there is no necessity for Amitabha Buddha to come and guide you to the Western Pure Land. At that time you are already a great Bodhisattva. Not only can a great Bodhisattva go the Western Pure Land; he can go to any pure land as he pleases.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Pure Land School 
                          of Buddhism advocates that when people die, they bring with them the karma 
                          that they had committed to be reborn in the Western Pure Land. This led 
                          to a lively debate on the subject. Some people argued that it means that 
                          regardless of the virtuous or evil karma [1] that one has committed, a 
                          person only needs to wholeheartedly recite “Amitabha Budhha” 
                          to the extent that he resonates with the power of the Amitabha Buddha’s 
                          vow, then he will be reborn in the Western Pure Land. <br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">On the other 
                          hand, others advocated that people must bring with them virtuous karma 
                          in order to be reborn in the Western Pure Land, but not when they bring 
                          evil karma. Yet, others advocated that a person cannot be reborn in the 
                          Western Pure Land as long as he has karma and rebirth in the Pure Land 
                          can occur only when all the karma have been eliminated. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In reality, all people 
                          will be reborn according to their karma. The kinds of karma and the corresponding 
                          realms of rebirth are as follows: </span></p>
              <ul>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Karma of extreme 
                            evil leads one to be reborn in the hell realm</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Karma of ignorance 
                            and foolishness lead one to be reborn in the animal realm</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Karma of superstition 
                            leads one to be reborn in the ghosts and deities realm</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Blessings of observing 
                            the Five Precepts lead one to be reborn in the human realm </span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Blessings of performing 
                            the Ten Virtuous Deeds lead one to be reborn in the heaven realm</span></li>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> Actions or karma 
                            from hatred, anger and fighting lead one to be reborn in the asura realm </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">These are called “rebirth 
                          according to one’s karma”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">To be reborn in the 
                          Western Pure Land requires pure karma. Besides the pure karma, rebirth 
                          in the Western Pure Land is not possible at all with whatever kinds of 
                          virtuous and evil karma. Therefore, there is no basis to speak of rebirth 
                          in the Western Pure Land and then returning to this Saha world to bear 
                          the retribution of the karma that they had committed. Only the Bodhisattava, 
                          with the power of his vow, can return to this Saha world. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>

              <p>The Mahayana sutras were not expounded by the historical Nirmanakaya appearance of Buddha, but were expounded by Sambhogakaya. Mahayana accepts the validity of pure visions from Buddhas.</p>
              <p>Anyway many people have seen pure land, including Ven Shen Kai who is the author of those articles in JenChen.org.sg:</p>
              <p><br> <span style="font-style: italic;">Disciple: Master, how do we
                                      witness Sukhavathi?<br> <br> Master Shen Kai: That's easy. But Sukhavathi is very far away. How
                                      far? It's passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                      Buddhalands. In between this hundreds of thousands of millions of
                                      Buddhalands are not Buddhalands but Hui Tu. Buddhalands are pure
                                      where Buddhas dwell. Sukhavathi is hence very very far away. Far
                                      does not mean we don't believe.<br> <br> In the sutras, Buddha used to explain that it's very very near. So
                                      near that nobody believe it's true. There's no choice as sentient
                                      beings are too greedy, hence say it's very very far away and not
                                      easy to go or reach. So He expound the Amitabha Sutra, where Buddha
                                      spoke without people asking. If a person is not greedy, then
                                      Dharmakaya is very near as it encompass everything.<br> Since it's entire existence, it's so near to reach like space
                                      everywhere exist Dharmakaya. Without Dharmakaya, Earth cannot be in
                                      the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by
                                      Dharmakaya.<br> <br> When people do business, they need an initial funding, now Buddha
                                      say you don't need that initial funding, you believe in Amitabha
                                      and recite His name.<br> When one see people wearing a gold necklace, but it's just a piece
                                      of metal chain like the one you see in jail to chain prisioners.
                                      Then Buddha told sentient beings not to be obsess with gold, you
                                      just need to recite Amitabha and don't need any initial funding and
                                      you can reborn in a place where gold is use for building
                                      constructions.<br> So does Sukhavathi really exist? Yes. Don't think Buddha is lying.
                                      You can GO NOW and witness yourself and come back to tell people.
                                      Master tell you I been there before, you all might disbelieve. So I
                                      will describe it to you.<br> Sentient beings on Earth are very small, Bodhisattvas of Sukhavathi
                                      are really Big and tall. A person standing next to Amitabha only
                                      reach the height of Amitabha's toe! When I reached Sukhavathi, only
                                      wish to pay homage to Amitabha, and adore Amitabha.<br> Amitabha Buddha reply: What do you seek here in Sukhavathi?<br> Shen Kai: Honored One, i came to seek Dharma.<br> Amitabha Buddha ask: What kind of Dharma?<br> Shen Kai: i'm not sure. Seeing Amitabha's forehead is adorned with
                                      a curled hair. i wisk to seek that Dharma, Honorable One.<br> (Back to reality.) That's how I cultivate and got my curled hair,
                                      but this Dharma method cannot anyhow expound to people. It's is
                                      because you people have doubt in Sukhavathi. Thinking it doesn't
                                      exist. Hence I tell you my experience. Due to the busy schedule,
                                      the white hair is curled. When it grew longer to 3 inch, it will
                                      extend when i'm washing the face. That's the proof.<br> <br> How did Ocean of suffering (ku hai wu bian) come about? Because
                                      beings of samsara cannot sever emotion, love and greed. Sentinet
                                      beings cry a lot. Separation from friend, family, love ones, people
                                      cry. Son is leaving, mother crys, so does the son. Mother is dying,
                                      sons also crys. When people want's to eat, the mouth starts to
                                      water. This is greed. People need to work, they swear. In a life
                                      them, people generate so many water. One person, say one bucket of
                                      water, 100 pax, 100 bucket form a pool of water. If millions of
                                      millions of people cannot sever emotion, love and greed, form an
                                      Ocean of water.<br> <br> In our world there's male and female. Those who goes to jail, 99%
                                      are involve with female. But in Sukhavathi, there's not male nor
                                      female form.<br> <br> (translated by Sinweiy)</span></p>

It's passing through hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands. In between this hundreds of thousands of millions of Buddhalands are not Buddhalands but Hui Tu. Buddhalands are pure where Buddhas dwell. Sukhavathi is hence very very far away. Far does not mean we don't believe.<br><br>In the sutras, Buddha used to explain that it's very very near. So near that nobody believe it's true. There's no choice as sentient beings are too greedy, hence say it's very very far away and not easy to go or reach. So He expound the Amitabha Sutra, where Buddha spoke without people asking. If a person is not greedy, then Dharmakaya is very near as it encompass everything.<br>Since it's entire existence, it's so near to reach like space everywhere exist Dharmakaya. Without Dharmakaya, Earth cannot be in the space. Cars cannot works. Every thing is benefited by Dharmakaya.<br><br>When people do business, they need an initial funding, now Buddha say you don't need that initial funding, you believe in Amitabha and recite His name.<br>When one see people wearing a gold necklace, but it's just a piece of metal chain like the one you see in jail to chain prisioners. Then Buddha told sentient beings not to be obsess with gold, you just need to recite Amitabha and don't need any initial funding and you can reborn in a place where gold is use for building constructions.<br>So does Sukhavathi really exist? Yes. Don't think Buddha is lying. You can GO NOW and witness yourself and come back to tell people. Master tell you I been there before, you all might disbelieve. So I will describe it to you.<br>Sentient beings on Earth are very small, Bodhisattvas of Sukhavathi are really Big and tall. A person standing next to Amitabha only reach the height of Amitabha's toe! When I reached Sukhavathi, only wish to pay homage to Amitabha, and adore Amitabha.<br>Amitabha Buddha reply: What do you seek here in Sukhavathi?<br>Shen Kai: Honored One, i came to seek Dharma.<br>Amitabha Buddha ask: What kind of Dharma?<br>Shen Kai: i'm not sure. Seeing Amitabha's forehead is adorned with a curled hair. i wisk to seek that Dharma, Honorable One.<br>(Back to reality.) That's how I cultivate and got my curled hair, but this Dharma method cannot anyhow expound to people. It's is because you people have doubt in Sukhavathi. Thinking it doesn't exist. Hence I tell you my experience. Due to the busy schedule, the white hair is curled. When it grew longer to 3 inch, it will extend when i'm washing the face. That's the proof.<br><br>How did Ocean of suffering (ku hai wu bian) come about? Because beings of samsara cannot sever emotion, love and greed. Sentinet beings cry a lot. Separation from friend, family, love ones, people cry. Son is leaving, mother crys, so does the son. Mother is dying, sons also crys. When people want's to eat, the mouth starts to water. This is greed. People need to work, they swear. In a life them, people generate so many water. One person, say one bucket of water, 100 pax, 100 bucket form a pool of water. If millions of millions of people cannot sever emotion, love and greed, form an Ocean of water.<br><br>In our world there's male and female. Those who goes to jail, 99% are involve with female. But in Sukhavathi, there's not male nor female form.<br><br>(translated by Sinweiy)</span></p>

              <p>I know, but then why wasnt it included in the Pali canon?  If Buddha did expounded the sutra, it should be included in the canon isnt it. I see no reason why it was excluded and omitted purposelly, as the first council meeting was made up of enlightened arhats.</p>

               of the nice things about Buddhist texts, especially MahÄ�yÄ�na texts is 
              that one can study their evolution. Why? Becauase they were translated 
              into different languages over the period of a thousand years. How is the
               possible? For two reasons -- we have the Chinese canon and the Tibetan 
              canon. <br><br>Buddhist sutras in the Chinese canon clearly show textual
               development over the many recensions of their translations. The Tibetan
               forms of these sutras are always in more mature forms than the earlier 
              Chinese translations. And interestingly enough, the surviving Sanskrit 
              copies of many sutras and tantras too show evidence of textual 
              development subsequent to their translations into Tibetan. We can see 
              this type of development even between translations from the Imperial 
              period and the so called "later translation period" which begins with 
              Rinchen Zangpo in the late tenth century. <br><br>Another thing we 
              notice with Bon texts is that their orthography is solely post Ralpachen
               i.e. post 840 or so. In other words, we do not find the kinds of 
              archaic spellings in Bon canonical texts in general (such as the Zer 
              mig, etc) that one would expect to find in ancient, pre-Buddhist texts.<br><br>So
               you can speculate all you like about Ancient Buddhas in mythical 
              kingdoms writing down all the Buddhist sutras in independent form and 
              depositing them in Tibet in the some prehistorical period. But the 
              simple fact of the matter is that texts are plastic culture, they are 
              susceptible to evolution and emendation, and in the case of Buddhist 
              texts, these emendations are trackable to a very large degree until the 
              Chinese and Tibetans stopped translating Indic texts. Of course, even in
               Tibetan Buddhist treasure literature one can find clear evolution and 
              consolidation of language and terminology and very little in the way of 
              truly archaic spellings, etc., spellings we have actual evidence of from
               texts which clearly date to that time period. </em></p>

This may occur in a worldly setting or in one of the Buddhist Pure Lands.
