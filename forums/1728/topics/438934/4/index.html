              <p>there is a contradiction. Buddha taught Nirvana ie ceasation of rebirth but then when people go to pureland, they are not enlightened. also Buddha (only a teacher and guide) does not guarantee you will attain Nirvana, as he is a teacher and also depend on his past live cultivation as a practioner. so does it mean, all those who are reborn there will attain enlightenment one day? what if reborn there and still not attaining enlightenment, doesnt it contradict that pureland doesnt fall in samsara.</p>

              <p>reborn76, you must have chant a lot of om mani padme hum to Avalokitesarva Bodhisattva in your pastlifes to dream of her saving you in the nick of time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unfortunately i have to be frank and tell you that you are not a traditional or mainstream buddhist in your Japan sect.  You can ask around.  There are more than a chapter 25 from the Lotus sutra for the mainstream buddhism.</p>
              <p>There are various methods of practising the Guan Yin dharma door. You can find out more in person or through research.</p>

              <p>how can ability same as buddha? buddha perfected his perfections in many eons ago.so how can their ability be same when they have not practised their perfections in samsara.</p>
              <p>A Buddha cannot amend or change a person's karma, so how can a Buddha affect a person's rebirth on account of his creation of a pureland. creation of a pureland is akin to creating a heaven, no different to the concept of god's heaven. all these contradicted what the historical Buddha has taught the dhamma. A Tathagata is a teacher of god and men, you yourself has to make the effort to end your suffering. you dun think there is a contradiction in this?</p>

              <p>@rooney: i think, yea not easy to believe, how to explain even a 7th stage bodhisattva also cannot understand why.</p>
              <p>think generally u-all can see it as a "motivation tool", eventually, it's not real. it just give a person a target of single-mindfulness and detach themselves from worldly attachment. mostly for lay (or older folks) who had difficulty practicing the "standard" style Buddhism.</p>
              <p>eventually the highest understanding is å¼¥é™€å�³æˆ‘å¿ƒï¼Œæˆ‘å¿ƒå�³å¼¥é™€ . when u reached /attained "PL"(Nirvana in disguise), u realised that Amituofo is yourself. as everything is from the mind. å”¯å¿ƒå‡€åœŸï¼Œè‡ªæ€§å¼¥é™€.</p>
              <p>:) learn so many thing, eventually there's nothing to learn, nothing to practice. (in Mahayana, there's a Non-practice state). ignorance may be the factor of samsara, yet it's also the factor of nirvana. to know is not to know. contradiction is yet no contradiction. it's in the realised mind. zen call it the "don't know mind".</p>

              <p>çƒ¦æ�¼å�³è�©æ�� affliction and bodhi is one. this older folk, so innocent , so got the "don't know" mind. actually they have the same Buddha's mind. we say they never learn, never practice, but actually they had learned better than us. they are the one that got it right.</p>
              <p>ps: i heard there were 12 Infinity Life sutras that came from India, 6 were lost. 2 version of Amida sutra. Buddha expound many time of it (mostly to the lay people i believe) as it's difficult to believe. might not know, the "concept of god's heaven" originate from this, but it became twisted.</p>

              <p>reborn76, you must have chant a lot of om mani padme hum to Avalokitesarva Bodhisattva in your pastlifes to dream of her saving you in the nick of time.</p>
              <p> Unfortunately i have to be frank and tell you that you are not a traditional or mainstream buddhist in your Japan sect.  You can ask around.  There are more than a chapter 25 from the Lotus sutra for the mainstream buddhism.</p>
              <p>There are various methods of practising the Guan Yin dharma door. You can find out more in person or through research</p>

              <p>O I won't blame you for your misunderstanding on my practice. As Nichiren Shoshu has in way or another mislead others to view Nichiren Buddhism as otherwise.</p>
              <p>However, do note that Nichiren Shu is a mainstream Buddhist sect in Japanese Buddhist Federation <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/nippon/nippon_partIV.html">http://www.buddhanet.net/nippon/nippon_partIV.html</a> whereas Nichiren Shoshu and Soka are not due to their teaching.</p>
              <p>Hence if Nichiren Shu is not a mainstream sect, why would Taiwan Buddhist groups have spiritual and academic association with us?</p>

              <p>Personally for me, the essence of Buddhism is not in exterior ritual, words or sectarian differences. It is in within the compassionate call. Everyone will has their own affinity with the particular practice. As Buddhist, we should open our hearts before giving a judgement call.</p>

              <p><em><strong>Once a theologian Dr Leonardo Boff ask Dalai Lama, “Your holiness, what is the best religion?”</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>He thought he would say: “The Tibetan Buddhism” or “The oriental religions, much older than Christianity.”</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>The Dalai Lama paused, smiled and looked me in the eyes …. which surprised me because I knew of the malice contained in my question.</strong></em></p>
              <p><a href="http://inthefootstepsofthebuddha.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Hhdllerabgar.jpg"></a><em><strong>He answered:â€¨ “The best religion is the one that gets you closest to God. It is the one that makes you a better person.”</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>To get out of my embarrassment with such a wise answer, I asked: “What is it that makes me better?”</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>He responded:“Whatever makes you more compassionate, more sensible, more detached, more loving, more humanitarian, more responsible, more ethical. The religion that will do that for you is the best religion”</strong></em></p>

              <p>True, they are all around.     It is a matter we can see them or not.</p>
              <p>There are both friendly and harmful ghosts as well as the vicious ones.     If you are not harmed by the ghosts and they appear friendly, leave them alone, live in peace with them.   If they cause harm then something need to be done.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Rooney... sorry i just interrupt from here lol... (didn't notice the thread can develop so far lol)</p>
              <p>yup u r right... Buddha can't change one person's karma... But in the Pure land, Amituofo's merit is too vast, immeasurable... imagine we are a grain of impurity (e.g salt) and dipped into a ocean of crystal clean water. Not much effect to turn ocean into salty ocean.</p>
              <p>Basically, u just imagine it's a world that our negative karma canot take effect. That means we can learn Dharma there... without distractions/obstacle.</p>
              <p>Note: here the bad karma is not eradicated/amended. It's just that there is no condition for bad karma to take effect.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the previous post u mentioned that if we go pureland, but canot get enlightened, what difference is there from samsara...? Huge difference...</p>
              <p>(i copied pasted from the 10 doubts pureland thread)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">First, as Amituofo’s power of his great compassionate vows embrace and protect them, this is how Non-Retrogression is attained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Second, as the Buddha’s light always shines [upon them], their Bodhicitta constantly progresses [enhances] and never retrogresses.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Third, as sounds of the ponds, birds, forests, winds and [vocal] music all preach the Dharma of suffering (dissatisfaction) and emptiness, the listeners constantly give rise to mindfulness of the Buddha(s), mindfulness of the Dharma, and mindfulness of the Sangha, this is how there is Non-Retrogression.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Fourth, as being with all pure Bodhisattvas of that land as virtuous [spiritual] friends, without the environment of evil conditions, without evil gods, ghosts and demons outside, and without the Three Poisons et cetera within, afflictions  do not arise at all, this is how there is Non-Retrogression.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Fifth, as those born in that land immediately have life spans of eternal [unlimited] kalpas, together equally similar to that of the Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, this is how there is Non-Retrogression.</span></p>
              <p>it's good to have doubts... no doubts... no understanding lol but I not saying pureland is good or best u must accept... just to share with you how Pure land works</p>
              <p>btw: if you really want to know the truth (or the absolute truth etc) you may face many çƒ¦æ�¼... troubles</p>
              <p>coz u may end up nitpicking, whether the words are from Buddha, authenticity etc...</p>
              <p>U can learn the wisdom from Theravada, Tibetan, Mahayana etc... then u will not be too concerned with the authenticity...</p>

                  story of Shinran's meeting with a hungry ghost</a></h3>
              <div class="post-body">
              <p> </p>
              <div style="text-align: left;" dir="ltr"><br>
              <div class="separator" style="text-align: center; clear: both;"><a style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" href="http://blog.alientimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/46_4_4991.jpg"><img src="http://blog.alientimes.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/46_4_4991.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><br></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">This is a painting of Shinran and a Gaki on Mt Tsukuba ( 
                  from the Jofuku-Ji temple in Ozone Tsukuba).</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">As we know, unlike other Buddhist schools, in Jodo Shinshu 
                  there are no ceremonies to feed the hungry ghost (segaki). In relation with 
                  this, I recently found a story from Tsukuba and the surrounding area involving 
                  Shinran Shonin’s visit to Mt Tsukuba. </span></div>
              <span style="color: #888888;"><a name="more"></a><br> </span>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;"><br></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">It is said that Shinran was staying at some lodging house 
                  at the foot of Mt Tsukuba the night before his planned ascent of the mountain. 
                  While he slept he dreamed of a boy who announced himself as the messenger of 
                  Nantai Gongen ( the male god of the mountain). The boy went on to beseech the 
                  great priest to visit the middle one, of 3 caves he would find on the mountain`s 
                  slopes.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">Shinran found the cave and entered. First he found two jars 
                  with a little water in them. Then deeper into the cave he found a gaki (a hungry 
                  ghost).</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">The tormented spirit told Shinran that because of past evil 
                  actions he was now suffering terrible hunger and thirst. However, due to the 
                  merciful kindness of the deities of the mountain every day, he and the other 
                  gaki could drink one drop of water each day.The Gaki then went on to beg Shinran 
                  for relief in the form of food or water.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;"><br></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">Shinran, however, did not believe that just because one had 
                  a bad karma, one had to suffer so much. He was certain that ANYONE who said 
                  nembutsu would be saved.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">And this, according to the story, is exactly what happened. 
                  After saying nembutsu with the Gaki for a day- <strong>he was saved and taken to the 
                  Pure Land by a mysterious cloud.</strong></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;"><br></span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">It is said that this story was a proof for followers of 
                  Tsukuba area that it was not necessary to make offering to gaki because they can 
                  save themselves with nembutsu of faith.</span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #888888;">I am asking those who know more about this story and the 
                  Jofukuji temple, to share their knowledge here. Is this temple belonging to Jodo 
                  Shinshu? And if yes, to what branch?</span></div>

              <p><br> Hi Rooney... sorry i just interrupt from here lol... (didn't notice
              the thread can develop so far lol)</p>
              <p>yup u r right... Buddha can't change one person's karma... But
              in the Pure land, Amituofo's merit is too vast, immeasurable...
              imagine we are a grain of impurity (e.g salt) and dipped into a
              ocean of crystal clean water. Not much effect to turn ocean
              into salty ocean.</p>
              <p>Basically, u just imagine it's a world that our negative karma
              canot take effect. That means we can learn Dharma there... without
              distractions/obstacle.</p>
              <p>Note: here the bad karma is not eradicated/amended. It's just
              that there is no condition for bad karma to take effect.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, the previous post u mentioned that if we go
              pureland, but canot get enlightened, what difference is there from
              samsara...? Huge difference...</p>
              <p>(i copied pasted from the 10 doubts pureland thread)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">First, as Amituofo’s power of his
              great compassionate vows embrace and protect them, this is how
              Non-Retrogression is attained.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Second, as the Buddha’s light
              always shines [upon them], their Bodhicitta constantly progresses
              [enhances] and never retrogresses.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Third, as sounds of the ponds,
              birds, forests, winds and [vocal] music all preach the Dharma of
              suffering (dissatisfaction) and emptiness, the listeners constantly
              give rise to mindfulness of the Buddha(s), mindfulness of the
              Dharma, and mindfulness of the Sangha, this is how there is
              Non-Retrogression.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Fourth, as being with all pure
              Bodhisattvas of that land as virtuous [spiritual] friends, without
              the environment of evil conditions, without evil gods, ghosts and
              demons outside, and without the Three Poisons et cetera within,
              afflictions  do not arise at all, this is how there is
              Non-Retrogression.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Fifth, as those born in that land
              immediately have life spans of eternal [unlimited] kalpas, together
              equally similar to that of the Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, this is
              how there is Non-Retrogression.</span></p>
              <p>it's good to have doubts... no doubts... no understanding lol
              but I not saying pureland is good or best u must accept... just to
              share with you how Pure land works</p>
              <p>btw: if you really want to know the truth (or the absolute truth
              etc) you may face many çƒ¦æ�¼... troubles</p>
              <p>coz u may end up nitpicking, whether the words
              are from Buddha, authenticity etc...</p>
              <p>U can learn the wisdom from Theravada, Tibetan, Mahayana etc...
              then u will not be too concerned with the authenticity...</p>

              <p>It is not just a belief. I would say Amituofo is proven as many Purelanders have experienced  Amituofo. I shall not elaborate. There were Purelanders who were able to foretell the exact day of their passing because Amituofo told them when he would be fetching them to Pureland and many other experiences.</p>

              <p>With regards to authenticity, do u notice sutras begins with: Thus I have heard, "å¦‚æ˜¯æˆ‘é—»"  ? Are you going to question all sutras are not buddha's words...? U will face many çƒ¦æ�¼ (frustrations)... is it necessary...?</p>
