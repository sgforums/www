            <div class='col-md body'><p>Is the shifu a Buddhist shifu? If yes, did he advise you to do anything? It is important to cleanse the house or have prayers before shifting into a new house. It is very effective. You can even do it yourself by sprinkling “å¤§æ‚²æ°´" at all the corners of your house espcially toilets and store room. Reason for sprinkling at corners is according to people with 3rd eye, they say these spirits like to hang around at the corners. As you sprinkle, you chant Amituofo and ask the spirits to leave the house. I used to get the “å¤§æ‚²æ°´" from Buddhist Lodge. However, if the spirits are the fierce ones, I guess you have to ask the help from shifu to do it for you.</p></div>

              yea, the shifu is Buddhist monk or Taoist? 
              
              apart from asking a monk for help, do practice meritorious deeds, repenting and dedicate to them. keep doing, when they see that u turn "holy", they may even practice together and be liberated, if not they will leave.

              <p>If you believe in after life, then ghosts and spirits exist every where. It is not something you can get rid of.</p>
              <p>Your pregancy had complication. It happened in the hospital and not at home.Your ghosts dont come to hospital, although they are plenty in the hospital.</p>
              <p>When your house was on fire, it must be due to your carelessness. No ghosts would want to burn their house down with it.</p>
              <p>When you were stuck in the car, it was at the carpark. It was not likely the ghosts left their house and locked you on a broad daylight.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, you have been staying in the house for 4 years. You are still alive and kicking. So I think it should your imagination. Your ghosts may be total epic failure in getting rid of you from their house then.</p>
              <p>Things that ghosts might do to protect their own house or show their presences are, turning hot coffee to cold coffee, make the room cold like 16 degree on a sunny day, lock you out of the house when you never change the lock, move objects around, TV or radio become funny and things like that.</p>

              Keep playing - on repeat mode - The Shurangama Mantra. You can download this Chinese Mantra by googling "Shurangama Mp3" or download from the Youtube site.
              This Mantra has got 84 lines and many protectors' name in it. 
              
              My true experience - I was once cursed with bad luck a long story I won't put here for fear censored too. One day I face my laptop, sit in meditative posture, listen to the Shurangama Mantra in repeat mode, suddenly I felt dizzy, then I went to the toilet to vomit or something. At the toilet, immediately I saw a black shadow flying out from my body, out to the sky. Then I felt better. From then on, I started to chant this Mantra to clear out any negativity from my body daily. The first 3 nites I chanted in the night, I saw white clouds floating in the dark blue sky as I was chanting. Its because the 80 over protectors will hover around you when you chant.
              
              By the way, anyone wants to learn this Mantra can Private Message me your name and handphone please. I can teach you.

              <p>Sabrina, go search for help that best suit to remove the ghosts, not necessary to be buddhism.    If your mind is made up and you want to try buddhism, try it and if it does not work, try others.</p>
              <p>All I know about buddhism on removing of ghosts is they always ask the victims to chant.  According to them, chanting may take a long time to solve the problem.    If the problems is a persistent one that calls for immediate action to get rid of the ghosts, this is impractical.   </p>

              <p>If the spirits are her karmic debtors, no matter which religion she goes to will not get rid of them. It is only through Buddhism, it will help to mediate. However, if they are just wandering spirits, there are shifu who can provide immediate help.</p>

              <p>Hi Sabrina</p>
              <p>Normally, if a place is haunted, there will be tell tale sign like movement in electrical switches and sighting by people in the place. As I am not sure, if u r staying in the house alone or with ur family. It is good to check if they experience the same thing.</p>
              <p>Btw one of my temple friend who was an owner of a Klang factory has an haunting experience in their  factory. One of the worker was killed in an car accident a street away from the factory. After the incident, the factory workers start to experience weird occurence. The factory light and machines will automatically turn on by itself in wee hours. At first, the owner thought is short circuit, he get an electrican to check. Everything was okay. This keep going on and subsequently, some of the workers even heard  and seen the dead worker in the premise. In the end, he decided to seek for help since one of the Nichiren Shu priest is passingby Klang and he is an Italian Buddhist priest, Rev. Shoryo Tarabini <a href="http://nichirenshueuropa.com/en/renkoji-temple">http://nichirenshueuropa.com/en/renkoji-temple</a>. Some of the people were skeptical if this will work. The priest perform a <span style="font-family: MS Song;">è¶…åº¦ and a blessing cermony in the factory. Interestingly, after the cermony the werid occurence stopped. In fact, one of the Malay worker even dreamt that the dead worker has moved on to a better place.</span></p>
              <p>After sometime, when the worker death anniversary was around the corner, one of the female worker's family met a severe accident on the same spot. Hence she decided to made a confession to my friend. Actually, it was her husband who killed the worker by accident. He was too scared to face up to the law so he hit and run. However, the recent accident was so bad that resulted in her husband losing a leg and her son losing an arm.  </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: MS Song;">Hence, this is not a urban legend, it happen to my friend. All the people is still alive to tell the story. Anyway if Sabrina you really need help, you can always approach the local temple <a href="http://www.nichiren-shu.org/">http://www.nichiren-shu.org/</a>. At the meantime, stablise yourself with proper medical help and please chant å�—ç„¡å¦™æ³•è“®è�¯ç¶“, <em>Namu MyÅ�hÅ� Renge KyÅ�</em> whenever you are uncomfortable to change your environment. </span></p>
