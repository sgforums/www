              <p>First Council<br><em>Also known as 500 Council, Theravada Council", The First                        Compilation, etc. The assembly of 500 leading Bhikhus gathered for                        3 months after the Buddha's death to compile the Buddhist sutras.                        It was held at Cave of the Seven Leaves near Rajagaha.<br> In the assembly, Ananda recited the Sutta-pitaka, Upali recited the                        Rules of Disciplines of the Order, i.e., Vinaya-pitaka, and Kassapa                        recited the Abhidhamma. Thus, the Tripitaka was adopted as a unity                        of doctrines and opinions within the religious order, and also an                        orthodox teaching for the Buddhists to follow.<br> ---<br><br> Mahasanghika and Sthavira are known as two earliest sects in                        Hinayana. Mahasanghika is said to be the basis of the development                        of the Mahayana Buddhism, while Sthavira of the Theravada                        Buddhism.<br><br></em><em><span style="color: blue;">Mahasanghika<br> Literally means the Member of the Great Order, majority, community.                        During the First Council, when the Sthavira or elder disciples                        assembled in the cave after the Buddha's death, and the other                        disciples (called to be Mahasanghika) assembled outside the cave.                        Both compiled the Tripitaka. <strong>However, the former emphasized                        on the rules of disciplines in the monastic community, while the                        latter concerned the spread of the spirit of Buddhism in lay                        community. As sects, the principal division took place in the                        Second Council.</strong></span><br><br> Sthavirah<br> Also known as Sthaviranikaya or Aryasthavirah. Sthavirah and                        Mahasanghikah are the two earliest sects in Buddhism. At first,                        they were not considered to be different. Sthavirah merely                        represented the intimate and older disciples of Shakyamuni, while                        Mahasanghika being the rest. It is said that a century later, a                        difference of opinion arose on certain doctrines. Three divisions                        were named as a result (all in Ceylon):<br><br> 1)Mahaviharavasinah - A subdivision of the Sthavirah school,                        which<br> opposed to the Mahayana system.<br> 2)Jetavaniyah - Or Jetiyasailah, school of the dwellers on Mount                        Jeta, which is a sub division of the Sthavirah, one of the Hinayana                        sect. Also known as Caitya-vandana, who paid reverence to or                        worship a stupa. Caitya is a religious monument or stupa in which                        the relics of the Buddha or other reverend sages are placed. This                        sect held that the Buddha's discourse was transcendent, his                        enlightenment was already determined when he was born, that he                        could violate the<br> natural laws, and could be reborn wherever he wished (in his                        previous lives as a Bodhisattva).<br> 3)Abhayagiri-vasinah - A subdivision of early Sthavirah school.                        Abhayagiri, the Mountain of Fearlessness in Ceylon, where the                        disciples dwelled in a monastery.<br><br> In the course, the eighteen Hinayana sects were developed. From the                        time of Ashoka, four principal school are regarded as                        prevailing:<br><br><br> 1) Mahasanghika - Literally means the Member of the Great Order,                        majority, community.<br> 2) Sthavira<br> 3)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from                        Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct                        evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni.                        It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked                        with Vatsiputriyah.<br> 4) Mulasarvastivada - a branch of the Sarvastivadin sect, which                        asserted the doctrine of the reality of things. It held that all is                        produced by causative action, and everything is dynamic, not                        static. Mulasavastivada is a school of reality of all phenomena,                        one of the early Hinayana sects, said to have been formed, about                        300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. Later it subdivided into                        five:<br><br> a) Mulasarvastivadah ,<br> b ) Dharmaguptah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah, developed from                        Mahisasakah and located in northwest India and Central Asia.                        Literally means those who protect (or preserve) the Law. They were                        instrumental informing the cult of the stupa, and were expert in                        incantation.<br> c) Kasyapiyah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah.<br> d) Mahisasakah - a branch of Sarvastivadah founded 300 years after                        the Nirvana, but the doctrines of the school are said to be similar                        to those of the Mahasanghika. Literally means a ruler who converted                        or rectified his land or people. The school denied reality to past                        and future, but maintained the reality of the present. Similarly,                        the school rejected the doctrine of the void and the non-ego,                        the<br> production of taint by the Five consciousness, the theory of nine                        kinds of non-activity, and so on. They held that enlightenment came                        suddenly rathern than gradually.<br> e) Vatsiputriyah (most influential) - Vatsiputriyas in Sanskrit,                        Vajjiputtakas in Pali. Hinayanist sect often linked with                        Sammatiyah, which broke from the orothodox Sarvastivada. The                        founder was Vatsa. They may be classified as Pudgalavadins,                        accepting the pudgala transmigrated, and rejecting the theory of                        the Five Skandhas (the Five Aggregates comprising personality).                        They were considered schismatics through their insistence on the                        reality of the self. That individual self is neither the same nor                        different from the Five Skandhas. The doctrine challenged the                        Dharma exposition by the Sarvastivadah. The school was later                        dividied into four:<br><br> i)Dharmottariyah - a branch of Sthavirandin developed from                        Vatsiputriyah. Dharmottara is the Buddhist logician writing, an                        important commentary called the Nyayabindu-tika on Dharmakirtis                        Nyayabindu.<br> ii)Bhadrayaniyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from                        Vatsiputriyah.<br> iii)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from                        Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct                        evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni.                        It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked                        with Vatsiputriyah.<br> iv)Sannagarikah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from                        Vatsiputriyah.<br><br> As far as Sthavira is concerned, there are eleven sects                        reckoned.<br><br> The Sthaviravadins were reputed as nearest to early Buddhism in its                        tenets, though it is said to have changed the basis of Buddhism                        from an agonostic system to a realist philosophy.</em></p>

                      disciples dwelled in a monastery.<br> <br> In the course, the eighteen Hinayana sects were developed. From the
                      time of Ashoka, four principal school are regarded as
                      prevailing:<br> <br> <br> 1) Mahasanghika - Literally means the Member of the Great Order,
                      majority, community.<br> 2) Sthavira<br> 3)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from
                      Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct
                      evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni.
                      It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked
                      with Vatsiputriyah.<br> 4) Mulasarvastivada - a branch of the Sarvastivadin sect, which
                      asserted the doctrine of the reality of things. It held that all is
                      produced by causative action, and everything is dynamic, not
                      static. Mulasavastivada is a school of reality of all phenomena,
                      one of the early Hinayana sects, said to have been formed, about
                      300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. Later it subdivided into
                      five:<br> <br> a) Mulasarvastivadah ,<br> b ) Dharmaguptah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah, developed from
                      Mahisasakah and located in northwest India and Central Asia.
                      Literally means those who protect (or preserve) the Law. They were
                      instrumental informing the cult of the stupa, and were expert in
                      incantation.<br> c) Kasyapiyah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah.<br> d) Mahisasakah - a branch of Sarvastivadah founded 300 years after
                      the Nirvana, but the doctrines of the school are said to be similar
                      to those of the Mahasanghika. Literally means a ruler who converted
                      or rectified his land or people. The school denied reality to past
                      and future, but maintained the reality of the present. Similarly,
                      the school rejected the doctrine of the void and the non-ego,
                      the<br> production of taint by the Five consciousness, the theory of nine
                      kinds of non-activity, and so on. They held that enlightenment came
                      suddenly rathern than gradually.<br> e) Vatsiputriyah (most influential) - Vatsiputriyas in Sanskrit,
                      Vajjiputtakas in Pali. Hinayanist sect often linked with
                      Sammatiyah, which broke from the orothodox Sarvastivada. The
                      founder was Vatsa. They may be classified as Pudgalavadins,
                      accepting the pudgala transmigrated, and rejecting the theory of
                      the Five Skandhas (the Five Aggregates comprising personality).
                      They were considered schismatics through their insistence on the
                      reality of the self. That individual self is neither the same nor
                      different from the Five Skandhas. The doctrine challenged the
                      Dharma exposition by the Sarvastivadah. The school was later
                      dividied into four:<br> <br> i)Dharmottariyah - a branch of Sthavirandin developed from
                      Vatsiputriyah. Dharmottara is the Buddhist logician writing, an
                      important commentary called the Nyayabindu-tika on Dharmakirtis
                      Nyayabindu.<br> ii)Bhadrayaniyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from
                      Vatsiputriyah.<br> iii)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from
                      Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct
                      evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni.
                      It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked
                      with Vatsiputriyah.<br> iv)Sannagarikah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from
                      Vatsiputriyah.<br> <br> As far as Sthavira is concerned, there are eleven sects
                      reckoned.<br> <br> The Sthaviravadins were reputed as nearest to early Buddhism in its
                      tenets, though it is said to have changed the basis of Buddhism
                      from an agonostic system to a realist philosophy.</em></p>

              <p>It was definitely not rejected in first council, because Mahayana Sutras only appeared in 1st century BCE onwards. It did not exist at the time of the first council. To explain this, some Mahayana people believe in the legends of sutras being kept by naga, etc, but as Loppon Namdrol says - it is best not to take these stories as anything more than legends, in the same way as the story of Theravadin Abhidhamma coming from Buddha teaching in heaven is simply a nice legend but not a historical fact.</p>
              <p>When Mahayana sutras first appeared, the Hinayana schools could not accept the authority of texts claimed to be from pure visions, etc.</p>

              <p>Although I am more inclined towards Theravada, but I have no distinction between theravada or mahayana. I am a buddhist, period. whether you want to be a Buddha or arhat, it is your call.</p>
              <p>I am more inclined towards Theravada is due to the authenticity of the sutras taught by the Buddha. as for other teachings not taught by the Buddha, I do not close on them cos if I do that, I will be narrow and closed minded. There can be only 1 truth, no matter if you are theravada, mahayana or vajrayana. I will use what the Buddha's taught in the dhamma on the teachings, if they lead to enlightenment and insight. most importantly they should not go against or contrary what the Buddha has taught.</p>
