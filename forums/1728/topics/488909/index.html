              wonders what the purpose of his birth is. And then one day, by chance he finds
              out!</span></h2>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Day 15, Month of Chaithra, BCE 443, University of
              Takshasila</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Several times, over the years, Jivaka had wondered
              about his purpose in life. ‘<em>What was the point of his birth</em>?’ </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The first time he’d asked himself that question had
              been when he found out why he’d been named “Jivaka”. The second had been when
              Prince Abhaya had practically adopted him, and given him a home in the royal
              palace. The third had been when he’d been barred from certain sections of the
              self-same palace. The fourth had been when his mentor had informed him that it
              would be best if he trained himself in some profession. The fifth was when he’d
              finally arrived at the greatest university of those times, Takshasila, and
              found that no one was willing to train him as a physician. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now was the sixth time — when Acharya Athideva, a
              member of the Council of Examiners, refused to evaluate him after seven years
              of study. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I do not see the point of allowing him to be a
              physician,” he said now, surveying him coldly. “A brat without parents, or
              birth…”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I must beg to differ on both counts,” argued another
              member, his former teacher, Acharya Atreya. “This young man is a highly
              competent physician, and of immense comfort to his patients...”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“… born to a dancer, and thrown on a rubbish heap,”
              Athideva went on, as if there had been no interruption. “He would have been
              feasted on by crows and dogs if not for Prince Abhaya’s rescue — and you ask me
              to certify him as a physician!”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“To refuse a man his due, just because of his birth,
              is the most ridiculous piece of nonsense I’ve ever heard,” Atreya’s words
              dripped acid. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One more test</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jivaka stood in front of them both, head bowed, hands
              gripped tightly, mind in turmoil. What was going to be his fate? <em>‘What is
              the purpose of my life?’</em> </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Athideva regarded him thoughtfully. “You have passed
              the exams set by the Council, but you will not be considered a physician,
              unless you pass mine.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Tour the area outside Takshasila for a distance of a
              hundred miles, and bring me a plant that is not medicinal. That will decide
              your fate.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jivaka made his way outside the university, picking
              his way along roads, copses, forests and dry, barren fields. Over the next
              week, he picked this plant and that, breaking off tree branches, and smelling
              nuts and fruits. By the end of the seventh day, he had to admit defeat.</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I could find no plant without medicinal qualities,
              Acharya,” Jivaka said softly, the next morning, bowing in front of the Council
              of Examiners. “Even grass has some use. I have failed.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Athideva stared at him, speechless for a moment.
              Abruptly, he left the hall with a swish of his clothes. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As Jivaka stared at the departing teacher, his own
              teacher, Atreya, smiled at him. “On the contrary, Jivaka, you have passed. A
              true physician knows that every single creation on earth has some purpose. It
              will be my pleasure to certify you as a physician.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">‘Even grass has a reason to live</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">,’ Jivaka pondered, as he received accreditation. <em>‘But
              what’s mine?’</em></span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Day 23, Month of Vaishakha, BCE 421, Outskirts of
              Rajagriha (present-day Bihar)</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Years had passed, and Jivaka was still pondering that
              question. These days, he had no cause to complain, career-wise. He’d cured
              people on their deathbeds; found medicines for seemingly incurable diseases;
              performed complicated operations and was now physician to the king. Royals from
              kingdoms as far off as Ujjain sought him; his fame had now spread far and wide.</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">‘I suppose this is my purpose</span></em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">,’ Jivaka mused, as he travelled in a palanquin to his
              quarters in the royal palace. And yet … there was a strange restlessness inside
              him. There was a commotion on the road; the palanquin came to a stop. Loud
              voices reached him; Jivaka looked out. “What is it? Who…”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A lanky, gaunt ascetic dressed in saffron robes,
              pushed past the guards and came up. “Please, honoured Jivaka… I need your help.
              My master is ill, in the forest. I tried to heal him, but…”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Who is it?”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“If you will come with me, I will take you to him.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It didn’t even occur to Jivaka to refuse. His guide
              bade him to get down, and walk on a small path that led to a forest. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Why, I believe I know you,” Jivaka said, suddenly. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">His guide hesitated. “We have met — in Takshasila. I
              am…”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Acharya Athideva. And if <em>you</em> failed to cure
              him, then I…”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“He asked for you. And that makes me believe that you
              might succeed.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By this time, they had reached a clearing. In the
              distance, under a large tree lay someone, surrounded by several monks. They
              parted at Jivaka’s arrival, revealing the patient. Jivaka took a look at him,
              and stopped. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The man’s body showed signs of old age — but his eyes!
              Never, in his long career had Jivaka seen eyes of such gentleness, warmth, or
              knowledge. Jivaka’s feet took him to the man automatically, and the physician
              found himself bending over the patient. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I have waited a long time for you, Jivaka,” said the
              patient, softly. “Welcome.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The words stuck in Jivaka’s throat. He knew this
              person — no, this great person, of whom wonderful legends circulated, in many
              kingdoms. Suddenly, the question that had haunted him all his life cropped up. <em>‘What
              is my purpose in life?’</em></span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jivaka knew he’d found his answer. He pressed his
              forehead to the patient’s feet. </span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I am here to serve you to the best of my ability,
              Lord Buddha.”</span></p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Historical Fact</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="body" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddha Poornima, a festival that commemorates the
              birth, enlightenment, and death of Lord Buddha, was observed on May 4, this
              year. So acclaimed was Jivaka that he became known as the Founder of Buddhist
              medicine, and remained physician to the Buddha, until the end of his days. Even
              today, he is revered as the Father of Thai medicine. </span></p>
