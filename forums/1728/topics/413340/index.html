              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Arial;">THE BUDDHA SPEAKS THE ULTIMATE EXTINCTION OF THE DHARMA SUTRA</span></strong></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">From the Seng Yu Lu Translator anonymous.<br>Appended to the Sung Annals.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">English translation by Bhiksu Heng Sure<br>Edited by Bhiksuni Heng Yin</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">Thus have I heard. At one time the Buddha was in the state of Kushinagara. The Tathagata was to enter Nirvana within three months and the Bhiksus and Bodhisattvas as well as a great multitude of beings had come to pay homage to the Buddha and to bow in reverence. The World-honored One was tranquil and silent. He spoke not a word and his light did not appear. Worthy Ananda bowed and asked the Buddha,</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">"O Bhagavan, heretofore whenever you spoke the Dharma, awesome lights would naturally appear. Yet today among this great assembly there is no such radiance. There must be a good cause for this and we wish to hear the Bhagavan's explanation."</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">The Buddha remained silent and did not answer until the request had been repeated three times. He then told Ananda,</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">"After I enter Nirvana, when the Dharma is about to perish, during the Evil Age of the Five Turbidities, the way of demons will flourish. Demonic beings will become Shramanas; they will pervert and destroy my teachings. Wearing the garb of laypersons they will prefer handsome clothes and their precept sashes will be made of multi-colored cloth. They will use intoxicants, eat meat, kill other beings and they will indulge in their desire for flavorful food. They will lack compassion and they will bear hatred and jealousy even among themselves.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">At that time there will also be Bodhisattvas, Pratyeka Buddhas, and Arhats who will reverently and diligently cultivate immaculate virtue. They will be respected by all people and their teachings will be fair and egalitarian. These cultivators (of the Way) will take pity on the poor, they will be mindful of the aged and they will save and give counsel to those people they find in difficult circumstances. They will at all times exhort others to worship and to protect sutras and images (of the Buddha). They will do meritorious deeds, be resolute and kind and never harm others. They will forsake their bodies for others' benefit. They will hold no great regard for themselves but will be patient, yielding, humane and peaceful.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">If such people exist, the hordes of demonic Bhiksus will be jealous of them. The demons will harass them, slander and defame them, expel I them from their midst and degrade them. They will ostracize the good monks from the (monastic) community. Thereafter these demons will not cultivate the way-virtue. Their temples and monastic buildings will be vacant and overgrown with weeds. For want of care and maintenance their way-places will drift into ruin and oblivion. The demon is Bhiksus will only be greedy for wealth and will amass great heaps of goods. They will refuse to distribute any of it or to use it to gain blessings and virtue.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">At this time, the evil monks will buy and sell slaves to till their fields and to slash and burn the mountain forests. They will do harm to living creatures and they will feel not the least bit of compassion. These slaves will themselves become Bhiksus and maidservants will become Bhiksunis.   Totally lacking in way virtue, these people will run amok, indulging in licentious behavior. In their turbid confusion they will fail to separate the men from the women (in the monastic communities). From this generation on, the Way will be weakened. Fugitives from the law will seek refuge in my Way, wishing to be Sramanas but failing to observe the moral regulations. The precepts will continue to be recited twice a month, but in name alone. Being lazy and lax, no one will want to listen any longer. These evil Sramanas will be unwilling to recite the sutras in their entirety and they will make abbreviations at the beginning and at the end of the texts as they please. Soon the practice of reciting sutras will stop altogether. Even if there are people who recite texts they will be unlettered, unqualified men who will insist, nonetheless, that they are correct. Bumptious, arrogant, and vain, these men will seek fame and glory. They will display elegant airs in the hope of attracting offerings from other people.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">When the lives of these demonic Bhiksus come to an end their essential spirits will fall into the Avici Hells. Having committed the Five Evil Sins, they will suffer successive rebirths as hungry ghosts and as animals. They will know all such states of woe as they pass on through aeons as numerous as the sands on the banks of the Ganges River. When their offenses are accounted for they will be reborn in a borderland where the Triple Jewel is unknown.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">When the Dharma is about to disappear, women will become vigorous and will at all times do deeds of virtue. Men will grow lax and will no longer speak of the Dharma. Those genuine Sramanas they see will be looked upon as dung and no one will have faith in them. When the Dharma is about to perish, all the Gods will begin to weep. Rivers will dry up and the five grains will not ripen. Epidemic diseases will frequently take the lives of multitudes of people. The masses will toil and suffer while the local officials will plot and scheme. No one will adhere to principles. Instead, all people will take delight in the ensuing chaos. Evil people will be ever more numerous like the sands of the ocean-bed. Good persons will be hard to find; at most there will be one or two. As the aeon comes to a close, the revolution of the Sun and the Moon will grow short and the lifespan of men will decrease. Their hair will turn white at the age of forty years. Because of excessive licentious behavior they will quickly exhaust their seminal fluids and will die at a young age, usually before sixty years. As the lifespan of males decreases, that of females will increase to seventy, eighty, ninety, or one hundred years.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">The great rivers will rise up in disharmony with their natural cycles, yet people will not take notice or feel concern. Extremes of climate will soon be taken for granted. Beings of all races will mix together at random, without regard for the noble and the mean. They will alternately sink and float like feeding aquatic creatures.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">Then there will be Bodhisattvas, Pratyeka Buddhas and Arhats who will gather together in an unprecedented assembly because they will all have been harried and pursued by the hordes of demons. They will no longer dwell in the assemblies but the Three Vehicles will retreat to the wilderness. In a tranquil place they will find shelter, happiness, and long life. Gods will protect them and the moon will shine down upon them. The Three Vehicles will have an opportunity to meet together and the Way will flourish. However, within fifty-two years the Surangama Sutra and the <em>Pratyutpanna Samadhi</em> will be the first to change and then to disappear. The twelve divisions of the canon will gradually follow until they vanish completely, never to appear again. Its words and texts will be totally unknown ever after. The precept sashes of sramanas will turn white of themselves. When my Dharma disappears it will be just like an oil lamp, which flares, brightly for an instant just before it goes out. So too, will the Dharma flare and die. After this time it is difficult to speak with certainty of what will follow.</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">So it will remain for the next ten million years. When Maitreya is about to appear in the world to become the next Buddha, the planet will be entirely peaceful. Evil vapors will have dissipated, rain will be ample and regular, and crops will grow abundantly. Trees will grow to a great height and men will grow to be eighty feet tall. The average lifespan will extend to 84,000 years. It will be impossible to count all the beings who will be taken across to liberation."</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">Worthy Ananda addressed the Buddha, "What should we call this Sutra and how shall we uphold it?"</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">The Buddha said, "Ananda, this sutra is called <em>The Ultimate Extinction of the Dharma</em>. Tell everyone to propagate it widely; the merit of your actions will be measureless, beyond reckoning."</span></p>
                      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: 0.5in; "><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Courier New;">When the four-fold assembly of disciples heard this Sutra they grieved and wept. Each of them resolved to attain the true path of the Supreme Sage. Then bowing to the Buddha, they departed.</span></p>

              This Sutra was spoken by the Buddha so it will happen as he said.
              
              The Dharma Ending Age is considered as a whole - not just one person. Like say we take a look around and see how many people cultivate dharma, only a very small portion in this world.
              
              If however, we ourselves are vigourous in practice, it is not the Dharma ending age for us. If everyone is vigourous in practice then of course the Dharma Ending Age will delay. But throughout the world, not many people are Buddhists or will believe in Buddhism, and even as Buddhists, we may not be cultivating as vigourous as well.
              
              So it is important to work hard and leave samsara this life time, don't wait till the next life le, it is hard to say if we can even keep the human form in next life, less so to even hear the Dharma.

              <p>If you feel lazy, you should keep thinking and generating aspiration to gain enlightenment for yourself and all other sentient beings.</p>
              <p>When the mind that aspires for awakening increases, laziness reduces on its own accord.</p>
              <p>Like... if you really like to know the story of a drama, you will not be 'lazy' to catch all the episodes.</p>
              <p>Similarly if you have a strong desire for enlightenment, you will not be lazy in your own contemplative practice.</p>

              <p><br>i think one can be reborn in other world system that have no Dharma Ending Age. depending on one's karma and cultivation. like for avic hells, the life span of the beings "live" beyond the life span of our world system. then where they go? they continue reborn in another world system's avic hell. think it's also true for beings in formless heaven.</p>
              <p>think cultivated lamas can also choose whether to reborn here with the Dharma ending age or choose other more comfortable human world. but most would rather not. Our original Buddha Shakaymuni already very good to choose to born in Five Turbidities. but this now period of information explosion, even a Buddha were to come, in a real form of Buddha, also no use. People will not believe. too ignorant already. Maitreya choose a more comfortable age.</p>
              <p>we...purelanders...hehe...choose to born in PL...also out of this world system. :)</p>
              <p>so it's not logical, if a person practice very good and still be reborn in a terrible place, unless it's their vow.</p>
