              <p>Whatever we know about Buddhism are all originated from Buddha (Shakyamuni). For example, how do we know there are Kuan Shi Yin Pusa or Amitabha? We know because Buddha told us about their existence.</p>
              <p>Amitabha has 2 "assistance" (disciples), one of them is Goddess of Mercy (Kuan Shi Yin Pusa) and the other is å¤§åŠ¿è‡³pusa. You will always see Goddess of Mercy on the left hand side of Amitabha and  å¤§åŠ¿è‡³pusa on Amitabha's right hand side. Goddess of Mercy address Amitabha her master (å¸ˆçˆ¶).</p>
              <p>Below are the many versions of chanting Amitabha :</p>

              <p>So far I have not come across anybody who chants Amitabha died of a sudden death. Most of them die of old age or sickness, meaning there is still chance to recite Amitabha's name at deathbed. Like Master Chin Kong said, he witnessed many people who chant Amitabha, they are able to live and foretell their family members when Amitabha will be coming to fetch them to Pureland.</p>
              <p>We always pray to Amitabha to bless us that we remain concious till our last breath. This prayer can be seen  in some of scriptures but cannot recall exactly which scripture.</p>
              <p>It does not matter if the person die of a sudden death or been converted to other religion at his last breath. As long as he chant Amitabha regularly, these happenings will not affect his chances to be born in Amitabha's Pureland.</p>

              <p>What is  Theravada tradition in Chinese ? What I understand is there are 3 main traditions (å�—ä¼ (Sri Lanka, Thailand,Vietnam etc)ï¼Œè—�ä¼ (Tibetian)ï¼ŒåŒ—ä¼ (China,Korea etc. Amitabha's Pureland is one from åŒ—ä¼  ). When Buddhism spread to China, only part of the sutras (å¤§ä¹˜) were adopted. I understand that likewise for other places,  only part of the sutras spread to å�—ä¼ and è—�ä¼ .</p>
              <p>In these 2 sutras é˜¿å¯†é™€ç»�andæ— é‡�å¯¿ç»�, it recorded the  conversations between Buddha and Ananda. Buddha was telling Ananda about Amitabha's Pureland and how to practice in order to be reborn in Pureland.</p>
              <p>I understand that Buddha spoke of different traditions is to allow us to choose the one that suits us because everybody has different level of wisdom.</p>
              <p>Unlike other religion, Buddhists are free to go to any temples of different traditions. Meaning those who practice å‡€å®— is free to go to å�—ä¼  or è—�ä¼  temples.</p>
              <p>I have amazing experience with Amitabha, thus strongly believe in Pureland.</p>

              <p>Buddhists wish to be reborn in Amitabha's Pureland is because that place has no temptation and no sufferings, thus it is easier to attain nirvana.</p>

              <p>It is true that many Theravada Buddhists do not consider Mahayana sutras as authentic.</p>
              <p>Let me quote this passage from 'What Buddhists Believe' by Venerable Dr K Sri Dhammananda (4th Edition).</p>
              <p>"...Although Theravada Buddhists respect Bodhisatvas, they do not regard them as being in the position to enlighten or save others before their own enlightenment.  Bodhisatvas are, therefore, not regarded as saviours in a spiritual sense.  In order to gain their final salvation, all beings must follow the method prescribed by the Buddha and follow the example set by Him.  They must also personally eradicate their mental defilements and develop all the great virtues: no one can give them salvation.</p>
              <p>Theravada Buddhists do not subscribe to the belief that everyone must strive to become a Buddha in order to gain Nirvana.  However, the 'Bodhi' is used to refer to the qualities of a Buddha, or Pacceka Buddha and Arahant in expressions such as Samma Sam Bodhi, Pacceka Bodhi and Savaka Bodhi. </p>
              <p>In addition, many of the Buddhas mentioned in the Mahayana school are not historical Buddhas and are therefore not given much attention by Theravada Buddhists.</p>
              <p>The notion that certain Buddhas and Bodhisatvas are waiting in <em>Sukhavati</em> (Pure Land) for those who pray is a notion <strong>quite foreign</strong> to the fundamental Teachings of the Buddha.  Certain Bodhisattvas are said to voluntarily remain in <em>Sukhavati</em>, without gaining enlightenment themselves, until every living being is saved.  Given the magnitude of the universe and the infinite number of beings who are enslaved by ignorance and selfish desire, this is clearly an impossible task, since there can be no end to the number of beings in the whole universe.</p>
              <p>...The belief of some people that the Bodhisatvas exist in a particular world system as some sort of divine beings <strong>is not consistent</strong> with the teaching of the Buddha.  Bodhisatvas exist in any part of the world by cultivating the great virtues and precepts in order to gain enlightenment. They generally do so as human beings."</p>
              <p>- Pg 29 and 30, Life and Message of the Buddha</p>
              <p>To me, the above passage can or may have the effect of persuading a new Buddhist not to consider the Pureland teachings seriously.</p>

              <p>It is true that many Theravada Buddhists do not consider
                      Mahayana sutras as authentic.</p>
              <p>Let me quote this passage from 'What Buddhists Believe' by
                      Venerable Dr K Sri Dhammananda (4th Edition).</p>
              <p>"...Although Theravada Buddhists respect Bodhisatvas, they do
                      not regard them as being in the position to enlighten or save
                      others before their own enlightenment.  Bodhisatvas are,
                      therefore, not regarded as saviours in a spiritual sense.  In
                      order to gain their final salvation, all beings must follow the
                      method prescribed by the Buddha and follow the example set by
                      Him.  They must also personally eradicate their mental
                      defilements and develop all the great virtues: no one can give them
                      salvation.</p>
              <p>Theravada Buddhists do not subscribe to the belief that everyone
                      must strive to become a Buddha in order to gain Nirvana. 
                      However, the 'Bodhi' is used to refer to the qualities of a Buddha,
                      or Pacceka Buddha and Arahant in expressions such as Samma Sam
                      Bodhi, Pacceka Bodhi and Savaka Bodhi. </p>
              <p>In addition, many of the Buddhas mentioned in the Mahayana
                      school are not historical Buddhas and are therefore not given much
                      attention by Theravada Buddhists.</p>
              <p>The notion that certain Buddhas and Bodhisatvas are waiting in
                      <em>Sukhavati</em> (Pure Land) for those who pray is a notion
                      <strong>quite foreign</strong> to the fundamental Teachings of the
                      Buddha.  Certain Bodhisattvas are said to voluntarily remain
                      in <em>Sukhavati</em>, without gaining enlightenment themselves,
                      until every living being is saved.  Given the magnitude of the
                      universe and the infinite number of beings who are enslaved by
                      ignorance and selfish desire, this is clearly an impossible task,
                      since there can be no end to the number of beings in the whole
                      universe.</p>
              <p>...The belief of some people that the Bodhisatvas exist in a
                      particular world system as some sort of divine beings <strong>is
                      not consistent</strong> with the teaching of the Buddha. 
                      Bodhisatvas exist in any part of the world by cultivating the great
                      virtues and precepts in order to gain enlightenment. They generally
                      do so as human beings."</p>

                          <p> </p>The sutras account does not refer to historical happening in india, but latter masters' pure vision of buddha and his disciples. In the past, original Buddhism which we now know as the Theravada tradition, there are no such teachings. Hundreds of years later the mahasanghika school broke off after the first few great buddhist councils held by the elders from Theravada due to many differences, and it was from this school that Mahayana sutras originated from, and it was not accepted by the original school of elders known as the Theravadin due to authenticity issues since they only accepted the words of the historical Buddha. Also the way Mahayana sutras are composed are in a very different style from the original scriptures as the former were in a style that are orally recited since that is the sole mode of passing down the scriptures until 1 century B.C. but Mahayana sutras often resembles long literary written pieces. Also for example as namdrol points out, the real vulture peak can't even hold more than a small group of monks at the summit let alone more than a thousand as depicted in lotus sutra and hence it is not a historical account but the pure visions of latter masters.

               means 
                    infinite brightness, infinite life and infinite merits. Indeed, it
               means 
                    infinity of all that is good. Generally, people only know that 
              Teacher of 
                    the Western Pure Land (or Western Paradise) is Amitabha Buddha. 
              But they 
                    do not know that they also have within themselves a Pure Land and 
              Amitabha. 
                    This is known as the 'Pure Land of the Mind' and the 'Own-Nature 
              Amitabha'.

              cultivate 
                    so that we can manifest our Own-nature Amitabha?<br> <br> <em>i.</em></strong> If somebody scolds me with unkind words, I 
              shall respond 
                    by saying "Amitabha Buddha". By this, not only am I not accepting 
                    the abuse, in contrast the infinite brightness that illumines with
               the recital 
                    of "Amitabha Buddha" eliminates the darkness brought by the abuse.<br> <br> <em><strong>ii.</strong></em> If somebody gives me a present, I shall say 
              "Amitabha 
                    Buddha". By this I mean, "thank you very much". Therefore, 
                    not only do we have infinite brightness in our heart, by virtue of
               giving 
                    the giver shall have infinite blessings and merits as well. In 
              this way,

                    for having such attributes similar to the Amitabha Buddha. I 
              compliment 
                    him as Amitabha Buddha to mean that he is similarly well endowed.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><em><strong>iv.</strong></em> If 
                    I see a student studying, I shall say "Amitabha Buddha". It is 
                    also acceptable if you say that he is very hardworking or very 
              clever. However, 
                    sometimes an intelligent person may be fooled by his own 
              intelligence. There 
                    is no guarantee that a student who does well in his studies now 
              will definitely 
                    grow up to be good. But, when we use the name "Amitabha Buddha" 
                    to compliment him, then we evoke the brightness to illumine in 
              him. Not 
                    only will he do well in his studies and his career, he will also 
              be a Bodhisattva 
                    when he grows up, or even become Buddha someday.<br> <br> <em><strong>v.</strong></em> If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place 
              where pigs, 
                    cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand 
              that the 
                    effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, 
              and we make 
                    a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do 
              not know 
                    whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in
               hell, 
                    but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with 
              hell. 
                    Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of 
              the word, 
                    we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If 
              we say 
                    "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines
               
                    in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in 
              our mind.<br> <br> <em><strong>vi.</strong></em> If we come across two parties bickering, 
              quarrelling or 
                    fighting with each other, we do not join in. By our participation,
               we plant 
                    the cause to be reborn in the realm of the Asura, which is not a 
              desirable 
                    thing. We only need to have Amitabha Buddha in our mind and say 
              "Amitabha 
                    Buddha" just once, and then in future we will not be in spiritual 
              union 
                    with the beings of the Asura realm.<br> <br> <em><strong>vii.</strong></em> If we chance on seeing some traders in the 
              market cheating 
                    on the scales, we immediately say "Amitabha Buddha". Because 
              cheating 
                    arises from greed which resonates with the realm of the ghosts, it
               is a 
                    cause for rebirth in such a realm in future. By saying "Amitabha 
              Buddha" 
                    just once, then not only do we not resonate with the realm of 
              ghosts but 
                    also we are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha and we become 
              illumined 
                    with infinite brightness.<br> <br> </span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong><em>viii.</em></strong> People in general have a curious nature. If we stumble upon 
              someone else's 
                    secrets, we are driven by our curiosity to peek into it to find 
              out more. 
                    If this person is committing a crime, this may spell trouble: our 
              life may 
                    be in danger. By saying "Amitabha Buddha" in our mind and we 
              quickly 
                    distance from it, then we are in union with all that are virtuous 
              and bright. 
                    We do not resonate with darkness.<br> <br> <em><strong>ix.</strong></em> If we come across a drowning man, of course, we 
              save him 
                    if we have the ability. However, if we could not be of help and in
               the meantime 
                    someone else is saving him, we say "Amitabha Buddha". By calling 
                    out "Amitabha Buddha" just once, it strikes resonance with the 
                    drowning person and he immediately attain the brightness and 
              accomplishment 
                    of Amitabha Buddha. Then, our mind is also in spiritual union 
              Amitabha Buddha.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong><em>x.</em></strong> If a 
                    person tells you tales about someone else, those tales are not 
              your business. 
                    The Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch states, "I see someone engaging 
              in 
                    gossip-mongering, I do not participate. If I participate in the 
              gossiping, 
                    then I have done wrong." That the person is wrong is his own 
              business. 
                    Your participation means that you have also done wrong. If this 
              person speaks 
                    a lot of ills about another person and in the end you say just 
              once "Amitabha 
                    Buddha", that is good enough. If you participate in the gossiping,
               
                    this person may go around speaking ill of you too. But, when you 
              say "Amitabha 
                    Buddha", then you are in resonance with brightness and that person
               
                    would not be able to invent gossips and speak ill of you. 
              Therefore, "Amitabha 
                    Buddha" is indeed really very useful. Regardless of whether the 
              situation 
                    is good, bad or neither good nor bad, when we say "Amitabha 
              Buddha", 
                    our mind will be at ease and we attain brightness, and in this way
               we resonate 
                    with brightness. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong>3. 
                    How do we cultivate this habit of chanting or reciting "Amitabha

              reciting "Amitabha 
                    Buddha". If you say "Amitabha Buddha" but Amitabha Buddha 
                    is not in your heart and mind, then that would not do. We should 
              have brightness 
                    in our mind all the time so that we are in spiritual union with 
              Amitabha 
                    Buddha. In that way, when you say "Amitabha Buddha" and your 
              actions, 
                    speech and mind are in spiritual union with Amitabha Buddha, then 
              that is 
                    good enough. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <br> </span>

                    How do we cultivate to have brightness in our mind?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Actually,
               
                    it is quite easy to cultivate brightness in our mind. We must 
              carry out 
                    the principle behind "The mind of the past cannot be grasped; the 
              mind 
                    of the present cannot be grasped; the mind of the future cannot be
               grasped." 
                    (The Three Minds; Vol 6, Issue no. 4) The past is already gone and
               you cannot 
                    bring it back; the future is not here yet, and there is no way you
               can bring 
                    it here at this moment; and, whatever you have in your mind at 
              this moment 
                    will not stay because as soon as the next thought arises in your 
              mind, the 
                    previous thought ceases.<br> <br> Therefore, we have to cultivate non-ego-form (i.e. not 
              self-centred; not 
                    having the notion of "I" or "mine"). The ego gives rise 
                    to the notion of possession, for example, my wife, my husband, my 
              houses 
                    and assets, my children, etc. And, we are not even clear about 
              where actually 
                    is this "I". <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br> <br> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #003399; font-size: normal;"><strong>5.
               
                    What is "I"? Is it real?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Can 
              anybody 
                    find the "I" in you? It is not an easy task. If you say "I 
                    can see you", who is this "I" that you are referring to? 
                    You may reply that the "I" is in fact your eyes. If you say, "I 
                    can hear you speaking of the Dharma", it is your ears not the "I" 
                    that heard me. Not only are the eyes and ears not the "I", even 
                    if they are, what about the nose, mouth, tongue, limbs, body, head
               or hair? 
                    They are not the "I" too. Since we cannot locate it, it does not 
                    seem meaningful to attach to this ego. Therefore, a Buddhism 
              practitioner 
                    should comprehend this non-ego-form and maintain non-ego at all 
              times. One 
                    will then realise that all forms are false (an illusion), 
              including the 
                    ego-form. The "I" is false.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> The "human-form" refers to the notion of a relative opposite when 
                    we encounter another person. Since we cannot find the ego-form or 
              "I-form", 
                    how then can we find the human-form? We cannot. This is because 
              the ego-form 
                    of the person whom we encounter is also not real; it is empty. The
               ego-form 
                    is empty, therefore, and naturally the human-form is also empty. 
              Since the 
                    ego-form and the human-from are empty, it follows that the 
              "sentient 
                    being-form" is also empty.<br> <br> Thus, the sense of time, or the time-form is also empty. A 
              Buddhism practitioner 
                    should cultivate to be detached from the 'Three Minds'[1] and the 
              'Four 
                    Forms'[2]: not grasping the mind of the past, the present and the 
              future, 
                    and not attached to the notion of the ego-form, the human-form, 
              the sentient 
                    being-form and the time-form. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"><br> <br> <em>Notes:<br> [1] The Three Minds: (i) the past is gone and cannot be grasped.

              ten directions 
                    of space, i.e. the eight points of the compass and the nadir and 
              zenith) 
                    is called Pure Land. Where does a Pure Land come from? It comes 
              from a pure 
                    mind; first and foremost, the mind must be purified, only then 
              will there 
                    be Pure Land. Our mind is like the great earth because like the 
              great earth, 
                    many things can grow from the mind. The mind is often likened to a
               planting 
                    field or land. Therefore, when a person is kind-hearted, he is 
              said to have 
                    a "virtuous mind-land", "virtuous mind-field" or "bright 
                    mind-land". Our every decision and idea are all born of the mind. 
              Therefore, 
                    whether it is heaven or hell, they are solely created by the mind.
               When 
                    the thoughts of the mind are virtuous, then they lead to virtuous 
              actions. 
                    In this way, people ascend to heaven. If on the other hand, the 
              mind thinks 
                    of evil, makes evil decisions and evil deeds are committed, then 
              one descends 
                    to hell. Thus, heaven and hell are created by the mind.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">If the mind 
              does not 
                    attach to the thoughts of good or evil and in this way is 
              purified, then 
                    "a pure mind begets a pure land". If each and every person's mind 
                    is pure, then the land of our country will also be pure.<br> <br> Thus, it does not mean that people who seek to be reborn in the 
              Western 
                    Pure Land in their next life can do so by virtue of their karma. 
              It depends 
                    on the kind of karma. If it is virtuous, then rebirth takes place 
              in a good 
                    realm, a higher realm. If it is evil, then it takes place in an 
              evil realm, 
                    a lower realm. It is only when the karma is pure that rebirth can 
              take place 
                    in the Western Pure Land.<br> <br> Karma refers to whatever that we do - the actions of our body, 
              what we say 
                    and what goes on in our mind. It is only when the actions, speech 
              and thoughts 
                    are pure, that people can be reborn in the Western Pure Land. It 
              is possible 
                    for us to be pure in the three karma's (actions, speech and 
              thoughts) by 
                    reciting "Amitabha Buddha". It only takes one person's mind to 
                    be pure for it to bring about a positive effect on one's 
              surroundings. When 
                    all the members of the family have purified their minds, all 
              members of 
                    the society have purified their minds, the entire human race 
              across the 
                    world has purified its mind, then a Pure Land on earth is 
              achieved. </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><br> <br>

              practise?<br> <br> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Practitioners
               
                    of the method of chanting the Buddha's name not only recite 
              "Amitabha 
                    Buddha", but in addition should also cultivate merits. It is 
              stated 
                    in the Amitabha Sutra that rebirth in the Western Pure Land is not
               possible 
                    via conditions that are lacking in virtuous roots, blessings and 
              merits. 
                    For instance, when we have practised and perfected the Six 
              Parameters (1. 
                    Observing the Precepts, 2. Endurance, 3. Giving, 4. Zeal and 
              Progress, 5. 
                    Meditation, and 6. Wisdom), then to be reborn in the Western Pure 
              Land is 
                    a simple matter. If you have accomplished a mind that is as pure 
              as the 
                    Amitabha Buddha's, then there is no necessity for Amitabha Buddha 
              to come 
                    and guide you to the Western Pure Land. At that time you are 
              already a great 
                    Bodhisattva. Not only can a great Bodhisattva go the Western Pure 
              Land; 
                    he can go to any pure land as he pleases.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #003399; font-size: normal;"><strong> </strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/normalflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span> <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"> </span></td>

              <p>Can you advise me how humanbliss Buddhists practice in order to

              <p>Buddhists who practice Pureland teachings are told to do good
                      deeds sincerely so that we have accumulated enough merits to born
                      in Pureland. Besides that, most importantly we must recite the name
                      of Amitabha. What about HumanBliss Teachings ? I am interested to
                      know.</p>

              <p><br> Many people in Chinese Buddhism teach a mixture of Zen and Pure Land. As for my own Master, he used to learn from a pure land master (Ven Xue Song), then after that learnt from a zen master (Ven Dong Chu), he teaches chanting and meditation depending on the person's circumstance and conditions.</p>
              <p>Only in Japan is the distinction between pure land and zen very distinct, where Zennists don't practice pure land, pure landers don't practice Zen.
                      
                      Then again, in Vajrayana, pure land method is also taught and many people also get reborn in pure land through Tibetan/Tantric/Vajrayana Buddhism, though Tibetan Buddhism/Vajrayana does not have a sect that focuses solely on pure land.</p>
              <p>As for my Master's teachings, he puts it this way: é�žç¦…é�žå‡€ï¼Œæ—¢ç¦…æ—¢å‡€ï¼Œ<br>æ˜¾å¯†å�Œä¿®ï¼Œè¡Œè§£ç›¸åº”</p>

              <p>I think my thread in <a rel="nofollow" href="378306">Are Mahayana Sutras Taught by Buddha?</a> already answered it very clearly.</p>
              <p>The authorship isn't so important, it's the wisdom and content in the sutra that is more important.</p>
              <p>Just because the Nirmanakaya manifestation did not teach the Mahayana canon does not mean they are not valid as there is the Sambhogakaya level of Buddha vision. However the original Theravadins did not accepted this.</p>
              <p>Anyway there are indeed many people who have reborn in pure land and there were many signs, and my Master has been there and returned with evidence through the major mark of Buddha he developed.</p>
