              <p>Reiki is not Buddhism, but I think it can be helpful for one's own benefit. However my dharma teacher has warned before, don't anyhow use healing powers on others. If you heal yourself that's fine. But if you anyhow heal others and you do not have psychic powers and wisdom to discern the causes and conditions for a person's illness, sometimes you may end up offending certain spirits who are themselves using their own powers to cause diseases in that person out of revenge, and your powers are hence interfering and can be taken as confrontation. This is just one such cases. It is best not to interfere in people's karma and get yourself in trouble, however, it is fine to heal within your immediate family circle since your immediate family circle has certain shared karma.</p>
              <p>Hypnosis is also not a method used in Buddhism, but if you find it helpful, I don't think there's anything in Buddhism against it.</p>
              <p>However the Buddha's method to discover it is through meditation. If you want to remember past lives through meditation, it is not as easy and quick as hypnosis, as it does require some period of time to develope a deep enough level of absorption and samadhi. However the states of samadhi and jhanas, though not ultimate, can be helpful in one's practice, though states of samadhi are not the same as enlightenment or liberation. However, for me I don't focus on developing samatha jhanas. I am more concerned about the insight part.</p>

              <p>In the Nikayas, the concern wasn't over chakras. But it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, just as Buddha didn't taught about biology, astronomy, mathematics, but doesn't mean they are invalid. Chakras is related to Indian medicine. The Buddha in the Nikayas didn't teach the biological nor the astral/chakras aspect of the human being. He was just concerned about the liberation of suffering and limited to a specific type of teachings which he imparted, such as the four noble truths, the four foundations of mindfulness, etc etc, known as the first turning of the wheel, which has come down as the Nikaya teachings.</p>
              <p>However the reason why this is taught in Tantric Buddhism is because there are many energy-related practices that relates to specific chakras.</p>

                      lineage models as presented in the world's mystical practice traditions from 
                      various cultures around the planet since 1966, and experimenting with those 
                      methods as taught to me by masters of those traditions,  I can say that by now 
                      its become clear to at least myself, that there do exist methods and approaches 
                      that are more accurate and direct than others.  And among the most direct 
                      methods there also appears to be commonalities of result.</em></div><em>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">To super-summerize the entire path in one expression I 
                      would say:  The fastest route and approach would be to engage in a practice that 
                      opens the crown chakra easily.  When the crown chakra opens the sphere of 
                      Awareness that has its seat in the skull, experiences total unbounded spacious 
                      Awareness automatically.  Imagine this sphere of Awareness, which is your actual 
                      cognitive presence as though enclosed within the center of a lotus flower, 
                      situated towards the top of skull, yet centered in the skull.  The petals of the 
                      lotus flower surround your consciousness which sits directly above the center of 
                      the flower's stem.  The stem is the central channel of the subtle body of 
                      Light.  When the nourishing sap rises up the stem and reaches the flower at the 
                      top, the petals begin to open revealing that which is within the flower.  In 
                      this case the sap that rises up the stem is Kundalini.  The flower petals are 
                      actually an extremely fine network of web-like energy channels that are usually 
                      contracted and dormant.  This web of energy networks adds to the sense of 
                      solidity that makes the sphere of Awareness seem as though it is a solid entity 
                      attached firmly within the skull. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">At death this cocoon-like network of energy channels 
                      disintegrates and the sphere of Awareness floats away from the physical body.  
                      For a practitioner of Clear Light methods, like Dzogchen thogal and yang-ti, 
                      they will float out of the body through the eyes.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> For various other reasons at times, the sphere of 
                      Awareness breaks loose of the confining energy webbing and floats outside of 
                      the body.  This happens at times of near-death experiences caused by heart 
                      attacks, severe illnesses and sudden impacts.  However the sphere of Awareness 
                      is still connected to the body through the central channel connected to the 
                      heart chakra.  If normal death occurs, the Awareness will enter the central 
                      channel and will drift down through the central channel to the heart center.  
                      This is experienced as though one is floating through a tunnel of light.  At the 
                      end of the central channel at the heart a very bright light is observed.  As one 
                      moves closer to the Light it appears to be a Beingness of unconditional love, 
                      bliss and total wisdom... it is your true nature shining.  The Awareness 
                      may merge with the Light, if so that would be total Self-Realization.  In Tibet 
                      that is referred to as the merging of the son and mother lights.  The son would 
                      be Rigpa and the mother would be the pure Emptiness of the Dharmakaya.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">However, there is another method to enter directly into 
                      this dimension of Light, Being and Knowing through very specific practices.  By 
                      bringing the Kundalini energy up through the central channel into the crown 
                      chakra, the chakra energy field opens and expands.  At first one notices a 
                      sensation of no longer being connected to the body yet not yet away from it.  
                      Awareness becomes fully present to its nature as a beingness that is not located 
                      in a body nor even in the universe or located in space or time.  In this moment 
                      of illumination, if one deliberately notices the head or skull it will seem 
                      transparent or completely absent.  It seems instead of you being in your body, 
                      rather your body is in you as the unchanging field of Being/Awareness.  This is 
                      the first stage.  Most can come to this and do in their first retreat.  The 
                      experience leaves one without doubts and certainty of one's actual true 
                      nature.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Now, it is not necessary to raise the Kundalini up the 
                      central channel.  Actually in the center of the crown chakra there is a huge 
                      reservoir of Kundilini always present, due to the fact that the crown chakra is 
                      the seat of Awareness.  One can utilize a not well known method to activate the 
                      Kundalini directly in the crown chakra alone.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Here is the method:  sense a spot of energy like 
                      a luminous clear-white ball slightly below the crown of your skull, centered 
                      between the ears but slightly higher, yet centered in between.  Close your eyes 
                      and sense that the little luminous sphere is the center of your Awareness.  
                      Notice how the sphere is itself Awareness.  Be that sphere and just be.  
                      Concentrate on only that.  Notice the interior of your skull, as if it is 
                      hollow, remain with your eyes closed and sense a spacious clear light 
                      inseperable from your awareness.  If the interior of your skull seems foggy or 
                      densley dark instead of clear and empty, practice looking in a mirror at your 
                      eyes and at the clear glass of the mirror at your eyes in the reflection until 
                      your visual awareness seems crisp and transparent.  Then sit and do the practice 
                      again with your eyes closed, but noticing the crisp clearness of the interior 
                      light that offers a sensation of clear inner empty space.  You need to sense a 
                      dimension of spaciousness as luminous awareness.  Practice with this exercise 
                      until you begin to sense that the solidity of your skull is becoming transparent 
                      and your sense of being a sphere of Awareness has become pronounced.  At that 
                      moment, just rest as that Awareness.  The mind will have already vanished with 
                      all its thoughts and images... just rest in that Clear Light Awareness, that you 
                      are.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">After 20 to 30 minutes slowly open your eyes and begin 
                      to integrate the external spatial dimension of the room as you see it, into your 
                      Awareness.  Now with eyes fully open... just rest in total integration with the 
                      space of Being just as you are. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">If you don't then re-engage in conceptualizing and 
                      other mental meanderings, you will find great peace and stability in just being 
                      present effortlessly.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">To further open the crown chakra, practice with these 
                      exercises along with external sky-gazing and bringing your Awareness to your 
                      eyes, crisply and without moving your eyes, gaze straight into the space of the 
                      sky.  After 20 or 30 minutes of external sky gazing, immediately close your eyes 
                      and notice the vast inner space of your skull and the clarity of your inner 
                      spacious Awareness.  Now notice that the top of your crown appears transparent 
                      and open to the sky.  Your entire skull is becoming transparent... just rest in 
                      that luminous transparency which is the nature of your Being.  All sense of ego 
                      identity or self will vanish as those shadows are transformed into Light, the 
                      Clear Light of Awareness.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">There are many more details that I have left out, as 
                      they really are best suited to live guidence as given in the retreat setting.  
                      But this abbreviated form will definitely produce immediate results... its been 
                      well tested not only in my retreats but in my weekly practice sessions that I 
                      teach in Chicago.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">I would ask for those who want guidance and have 
                      questions, please post to the group lists, as your issues, challenges and 
                      questions will be beneficial to all of us.  If you are too shy to do so, then 
                      just email me directly. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">If those on these lists are serious about your practice 
                      success, then here you go!  Take advantage of my being able to mentor you 
                      through these steps of practice.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">At some point, as the crown chakra fully opens don't be 
                      surprised to notice that you have floated away from your body... usually only 
                      several feet away.  Just you, a sphere of Awareness, floating in the space of 
                      your room or outside looking back at your body.  In that moment you then know 
                      your body has no real connection to you in terms of identity... it is just like 
                      a car you have been driving around for awhile.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">The floating out of the body experience produces a 
                      permanent sense of true non-identity.  More doubts fall away... forever.  At 
                      least that's been my experience...</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">There are two more stages beyond this level of 
                      practice.  The next exercises open all the chakras and the energies of 
                      consciousness become stabilized in the central channel.  The third level opens 
                      all of the Light channels between the heart and the eyes, as well as Light 
                      channels through out the head and entire body.  Eventually, the heart chakra 
                      opens fully and completely revealing the Infinite Light of Unconditional Love 
                      and Compassion for the benefit of all beings...</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">We are actually doing part of the third level work on 
                      the first level exercises.... and that is why this approach is so powerful and 
                      rapid.  What is experienced has nothing to do with the mind and its 
                      endless</div>
              <div style="clear: none;">prattle and distraction.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">For those interested to experiment and explore... 
                      please do!  May you never be the same!</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>

              Chakra means "chi mai" in chinese, energy channel in english.

              <p>In the Nikayas, the concern wasn't over chakras. But it doesn't mean it doesn't exist, just as Buddha didn't taught about biology, astronomy, mathematics, but doesn't mean they are invalid. Chakras is related to Indian medicine. The Buddha wasn't purpose wasn't to teach the biological, and astral/chakras aspect of the human body. He was just concerned about the liberation of suffering.</p>
              <p>However the reason why this is taught in Tantric Buddhism is because there are many energy-related practices that relates to specific chakras.</p>

              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">However, there is another method to enter directly into this dimension of Light, Being and Knowing through very specific practices.  By bringing the Kundalini energy up through the central channel into the crown chakra, the chakra energy field opens and expands.  At first one notices a sensation of no longer being connected to the body yet not yet away from it.  Awareness becomes fully present to its nature as a beingness that is not located in a body nor even in the universe or located in space or time.  In this moment of illumination, if one deliberately notices the head or skull it will seem transparent or completely absent.  It seems instead of you being in your body, rather your body is in you as the unchanging field of Being/Awareness.  This is the first stage.  Most can come to this and do in their first retreat.  The experience leaves one without doubts and certainty of one's actual true nature.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Now, it is not necessary to raise the Kundalini up the central channel.  Actually in the center of the crown chakra there is a huge reservoir of Kundilini always present, due to the fact that the crown chakra is the seat of Awareness.  One can utilize a not well known method to activate the Kundalini directly in the crown chakra alone.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Here is the method:  sense a spot of energy like a luminous clear-white ball slightly below the crown of your skull, centered between the ears but slightly higher, yet centered in between.  Close your eyes and sense that the little luminous sphere is the center of your Awareness.  Notice how the sphere is itself Awareness.  Be that sphere and just be.  Concentrate on only that.  Notice the interior of your skull, as if it is hollow, remain with your eyes closed and sense a spacious clear light inseperable from your awareness.  If the interior of your skull seems foggy or densley dark instead of clear and empty, practice looking in a mirror at your eyes and at the clear glass of the mirror at your eyes in the reflection until your visual awareness seems crisp and transparent.  Then sit and do the practice again with your eyes closed, but noticing the crisp clearness of the interior light that offers a sensation of clear inner empty space.  You need to sense a dimension of spaciousness as luminous awareness.  Practice with this exercise until you begin to sense that the solidity of your skull is becoming transparent and your sense of being a sphere of Awareness has become pronounced.  At that moment, just rest as that Awareness.  The mind will have already vanished with all its thoughts and images... just rest in that Clear Light Awareness, that you are.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">After 20 to 30 minutes slowly open your eyes and begin to integrate the external spatial dimension of the room as you see it, into your Awareness.  Now with eyes fully open... just rest in total integration with the space of Being just as you are. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">If you don't then re-engage in conceptualizing and other mental meanderings, you will find great peace and stability in just being present effortlessly.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">To further open the crown chakra, practice with these exercises along with external sky-gazing and bringing your Awareness to your eyes, crisply and without moving your eyes, gaze straight into the space of the sky.  After 20 or 30 minutes of external sky gazing, immediately close your eyes and notice the vast inner space of your skull and the clarity of your inner spacious Awareness.  Now notice that the top of your crown appears transparent and open to the sky.  Your entire skull is becoming transparent... just rest in that luminous transparency which is the nature of your Being.  All sense of ego identity or self will vanish as those shadows are transformed into Light, the Clear Light of Awareness.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">There are many more details that I have left out, as they really are best suited to live guidence as given in the retreat setting.  But this abbreviated form will definitely produce immediate results... its been well tested not only in my retreats but in my weekly practice sessions that I teach in Chicago.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">I would ask for those who want guidance and have questions, please post to the group lists, as your issues, challenges and questions will be beneficial to all of us.  If you are too shy to do so, then just email me directly. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">If those on these lists are serious about your practice success, then here you go!  Take advantage of my being able to mentor you through these steps of practice.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">At some point, as the crown chakra fully opens don't be surprised to notice that you have floated away from your body... usually only several feet away.  Just you, a sphere of Awareness, floating in the space of your room or outside looking back at your body.  In that moment you then know your body has no real connection to you in terms of identity... it is just like a car you have been driving around for awhile.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">The floating out of the body experience produces a permanent sense of true non-identity.  More doubts fall away... forever.  At least that's been my experience...</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">There are two more stages beyond this level of practice.  The next exercises open all the chakras and the energies of consciousness become stabilized in the central channel.  The third level opens all of the Light channels between the heart and the eyes, as well as Light channels through out the head and entire body.  Eventually, the heart chakra opens fully and completely revealing the Infinite Light of Unconditional Love and Compassion for the benefit of all beings...</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">We are actually doing part of the third level work on the first level exercises.... and that is why this approach is so powerful and rapid.  What is experienced has nothing to do with the mind and its endless</div>
              <div style="clear: none;">prattle and distraction.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">For those interested to experiment and explore... please do!  May you never be the same!</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>

                  <p>In the Nikayas, the concern wasn't over chakras. But it doesn't
                  mean it doesn't exist, just as Buddha didn't taught about biology,
                  astronomy, mathematics, but doesn't mean they are invalid. Chakras
                  is related to Indian medicine. The Buddha in the Nikayas didn't
                  teach the biological nor the astral/chakras aspect of the human
                  being. He was just concerned about the liberation of suffering and
                  limited to a specific type of teachings which he imparted, such as
                  the four noble truths, the four foundations of mindfulness, etc
                  etc, known as the first turning of the wheel, which has come down
                  as the Nikaya teachings.</p>
                  <p>However the reason why this is taught in Tantric Buddhism is
                  because there are many energy-related practices that relates to
                  specific chakras.</p>
                  <p>Here's an example:</p>
                  <div style="clear: none;"><em><span class="" style="font-family: 'times new roman','new york',times,serif; font-size: 16px;">
                  Would it be possible for you to share with us here some of those
                  clear light abbreviated methods? Or maybe in private e-mails?
                  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to go to a retreat...<br>
                  <br>
                  Jax:  Thanks Lanusse!  I would be glad to share some
                  basic Clear Light practices that bring about a very pronounced
                  sense of Being rapidly.  From investigating most of the
                  lineage models as presented in the world's mystical
                  practice traditions from various cultures around the planet
                  since 1966, and experimenting with those methods as taught to
                  me by masters of those traditions,  I can say that by now its
                  become clear to at least myself, that there do exist methods and
                  approaches that are more accurate and direct than others.  And
                  among the most direct methods there also appears to be
                  commonalities of result.</span></em></div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">To super-summerize the entire path in one
                  expression I would say:  The fastest route and approach would
                  be to engage in a practice that opens the crown chakra
                  easily.  When the crown chakra opens the sphere of Awareness
                  that has its seat in the skull, experiences total unbounded
                  spacious Awareness automatically.  Imagine this sphere of
                  Awareness, which is your actual cognitive presence as though
                  enclosed within the center of a lotus flower, situated towards
                  the top of skull, yet centered in the skull.  The petals of
                  the lotus flower surround your consciousness which sits
                  directly above the center of the flower's stem.  The stem is
                  the central channel of the subtle body of Light.  When
                  the nourishing sap rises up the stem and reaches the flower at
                  the top, the petals begin to open revealing that which is within
                  the flower.  In this case the sap that rises up the stem is
                  Kundalini.  The flower petals are actually an extremely fine
                  network of web-like energy channels that are usually contracted and
                  dormant.  This web of energy networks adds to the sense of
                  solidity that makes the sphere of Awareness seem as though it is a
                  solid entity attached firmly within the skull. </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">At death this cocoon-like network of
                  energy channels disintegrates and the sphere of Awareness floats
                  away from the physical body.  For a practitioner of Clear
                  Light methods, like Dzogchen thogal and yang-ti, they will
                  float out of the body through the eyes.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> For various other reasons at times,
                  the sphere of Awareness breaks loose of the confining energy
                  webbing and floats outside of the body.  This happens at
                  times of near-death experiences caused by heart attacks, severe
                  illnesses and sudden impacts.  However the sphere of Awareness
                  is still connected to the body through the central channel
                  connected to the heart chakra.  If normal death occurs, the
                  Awareness will enter the central channel and will drift down
                  through the central channel to the heart center.  This is
                  experienced as though one is floating through a tunnel of
                  light.  At the end of the central channel at the heart a very
                  bright light is observed.  As one moves closer to the Light it
                  appears to be a Beingness of unconditional love, bliss and total
                  wisdom... it is your true nature shining.  The Awareness
                  may merge with the Light, if so that would be total
                  Self-Realization.  In Tibet that is referred to as the merging
                  of the son and mother lights.  The son would be Rigpa and the
                  mother would be the pure Emptiness of the Dharmakaya.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">However, there is another method to enter
                  directly into this dimension of Light, Being and Knowing through
                  very specific practices.  By bringing the Kundalini energy up
                  through the central channel into the crown chakra, the chakra
                  energy field opens and expands.  At first one notices a
                  sensation of no longer being connected to the body yet not yet away
                  from it.  Awareness becomes fully present to its nature as
                  a beingness that is not located in a body nor even in the
                  universe or located in space or time.  In this moment of
                  illumination, if one deliberately notices the head or skull it will
                  seem transparent or completely absent.  It seems instead of
                  you being in your body, rather your body is in you as the
                  unchanging field of Being/Awareness.  This is the first
                  stage.  Most can come to this and do in their first
                  retreat.  The experience leaves one without doubts and
                  certainty of one's actual true nature.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">Now, it is not necessary to raise the
                  Kundalini up the central channel.  Actually in the center of
                  the crown chakra there is a huge reservoir of Kundilini always
                  present, due to the fact that the crown chakra is the seat of
                  Awareness.  One can utilize a not well known method to
                  activate the Kundalini directly in the crown chakra alone.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">Here is the method:  sense a spot of
                  energy like a luminous clear-white ball slightly below the
                  crown of your skull, centered between the ears but slightly higher,
                  yet centered in between.  Close your eyes and sense that the
                  little luminous sphere is the center of your Awareness. 
                  Notice how the sphere is itself Awareness.  Be that sphere and
                  just be.  Concentrate on only that.  Notice the interior
                  of your skull, as if it is hollow, remain with your eyes closed and
                  sense a spacious clear light inseperable from your
                  awareness.  If the interior of your skull seems foggy or
                  densley dark instead of clear and empty, practice looking in a
                  mirror at your eyes and at the clear glass of the mirror at your
                  eyes in the reflection until your visual awareness seems crisp and
                  transparent.  Then sit and do the practice again with your
                  eyes closed, but noticing the crisp clearness of the interior
                  light that offers a sensation of clear inner empty
                  space.  You need to sense a dimension of spaciousness as
                  luminous awareness.  Practice with this exercise until you
                  begin to sense that the solidity of your skull is becoming
                  transparent and your sense of being a sphere of Awareness has
                  become pronounced.  At that moment, just rest as that
                  Awareness.  The mind will have already vanished with all its
                  thoughts and images... just rest in that Clear Light Awareness,
                  that you are.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">After 20 to 30 minutes slowly open
                  your eyes and begin to integrate the external spatial dimension of
                  the room as you see it, into your Awareness.  Now with eyes
                  fully open... just rest in total integration with the space of
                  Being just as you are. </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">If you don't then re-engage in
                  conceptualizing and other mental meanderings, you will find great
                  peace and stability in just being present effortlessly.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">To further open the crown chakra,
                  practice with these exercises along with external sky-gazing and
                  bringing your Awareness to your eyes, crisply and without moving
                  your eyes, gaze straight into the space of the sky.  After 20
                  or 30 minutes of external sky gazing, immediately close your eyes
                  and notice the vast inner space of your skull and the clarity of
                  your inner spacious Awareness.  Now notice that the top of
                  your crown appears transparent and open to the sky.  Your
                  entire skull is becoming transparent... just rest in that
                  luminous transparency which is the nature of your
                  Being.  All sense of ego identity or self will vanish as
                  those shadows are transformed into Light, the Clear Light of
                  Awareness.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">There are many more details that I have
                  left out, as they really are best suited to live guidence as given
                  in the retreat setting.  But this abbreviated form will
                  definitely produce immediate results... its been well tested not
                  only in my retreats but in my weekly practice
                  sessions that I teach in Chicago.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">I would ask for those who want guidance
                  and have questions, please post to the group lists, as your issues,
                  challenges and questions will be beneficial to all of us.  If
                  you are too shy to do so, then just email me
                  directly. </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">If those on these lists are serious about
                  your practice success, then here you go!  Take advantage of my
                  being able to mentor you through these steps of practice.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">At some point, as the crown chakra fully
                  opens don't be surprised to notice that you have floated away from
                  your body... usually only several feet away.  Just you, a
                  sphere of Awareness, floating in the space of your room or outside
                  looking back at your body.  In that moment you then know your
                  body has no real connection to you in terms of identity... it is
                  just like a car you have been driving around for awhile.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">The floating out of the body experience
                  produces a permanent sense of true non-identity.  More
                  doubts fall away... forever.  At least that's been my
                  experience...</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">There are two more stages beyond this
                  level of practice.  The next exercises open all the
                  chakras and the energies of consciousness become stabilized in the
                  central channel.  The third level opens all of the Light
                  channels between the heart and the eyes, as well as Light
                  channels through out the head and entire body. 
                  Eventually, the heart chakra opens fully and completely revealing
                  the Infinite Light of Unconditional Love and Compassion for the
                  benefit of all beings...</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">We are actually doing part of the third
                  level work on the first level exercises.... and that is why this
                  approach is so powerful and rapid.  What is experienced has
                  nothing to do with the mind and its endless</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">prattle and distraction.</div>
                  <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
                  <div style="clear: none;">For those interested to experiment and
                  explore... please do!  May you never be the same!</div>

                  I'll like to ask about the pineal gland, the focus between the eyes, it is said that when a person is born or dies the pineal gland releases DMT, also in Samadhi, when the nectar (DMT?) is secreted.
                  Also in Taoism(and Yoga, I suppose!) , at the right time onr releases concious out from the crown chakra. 
                  Does this have any relevance in Buddhist practice? Especially in death?

              <p>So far I have not come across anybody who chants Amitabha died of a sudden death. Most of them die of old age or sickness, meaning there is still chance to recite Amitabha's name at deathbed. Like Master Chin Kong said, he witnessed many people who chant Amitabha, they are able to live and foretell their family members when Amitabha will be coming to fetch them to Pureland.</p>
              <p>We always pray to Amitabha to bless us that we remain concious till our last breath. This prayer can be seen  in some of scriptures but cannot recall exactly which scripture.</p>
              <p>It does not matter if the person die of a sudden death or been converted to other religion at his last breath. As long as he chant Amitabha regularly, these happenings will not affect his chances to be born in Amitabha's Pureland.</p>
