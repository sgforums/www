              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">There are many methods for creating a mind that is one-pointed and
              joyful, the most important of which is meditation. The Buddhist tradition
              offers a multitude of diverse meditations. It is said the Buddha taught
              eighty-four thousand gates of <em>samadhi</em> [one-pointed concentration]. We
              first meditate on calm abiding [<em>shamatha</em>], as it is indispensable and
              easiest for those who are beginning to practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">In order to practice calm abiding, we need to know its characteristics,
              its essential nature, and its various categories. Unless we know these things,
              we will not know how to meditate. First, we take a posture that is different
              from our normal one: The legs are crossed; the hands rest relaxed on the knees
              or with the right hand on top of the left, thumbs touching at the level of the
              navel; the elbows are slightly raised away from the rib cage; the spine is
              lengthened; the chin is slightly tucked in; the mouth is closed and slightly
              relaxed with the tip of the tongue touching the palate; the gaze rests about
              eight finger-widths in front of the nose. A straight posture helps to keep a
              stable center while we are focusing on the mind, and for this reason, it is
              important. If our posture is good, calm abiding will go well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Generally, calm abiding is defined in this way: “Relying on a correct
              referent, the mind rests one-pointedly.” It can be divided into three ways of
              meditating: placing the mind using a support, placing the mind without using a
              support, and placing the mind on the essential nature itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">When using an external support or object, we place an article in front
              of our eyes—for example, a flower. By focusing one-pointedly on it, we keep
              numerous concepts from forming and revolving in our mind. This practice of
              focusing one-pointedly on an ordinary object is called “calm abiding with an
              impure external support.” When we focus in the same way on an object that is
              related to the dharma—a statue or image of the Buddha, a dharma text, and so
              forth—that is known as “calm abiding with a pure external support.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">When we have become familiar with these first practices and our mind can
              rest without moving from its object, then we can start the second type of calm
              abiding, which is without a support. Here, we turn our focus inward and bring
              to mind an image of the Buddha. If we begin this second practice before we can
              do the basic one, it will be difficult, since here there is no external object
              to serve as a referent. With our mind unable to remain focused, concepts will
              crowd in. So practice the first meditation until it goes very well, and then
              move on to the second.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The third kind of calm abiding is placing the mind on the essential
              nature itself. Here, there is neither an external nor an internal support. With
              our mind staying very focused, we meditate free of concepts, which is the
              highest level of calm abiding meditation. Mastery of the two earlier practices
              allows this one to be stable. When our mind is undisturbed by any concept that
              might arise, the natural joy and clarity of the mind will dawn. When we have
              this experience of calm abiding, we will appreciate its great value.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Many ways of placing the mind have been taught by the great lamas. They
              have taught, for example, that we should not run after the past, not call the
              future to us, and not be moved by the thought present in our minds now. We
              should remain completely focused on our reference point, abiding within the
              essential nature. When we become accustomed to this through study and practice,
              various meditative experiences will arise. The sutras and the tantras give many
              explanations of these, which can be condensed into five.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The first is known as the experience of movement. When we first begin
              practicing calm abiding, it seems that our afflictions multiply and our
              concepts increase. Is this a fault? No, this happens because now that we are
              practicing calm abiding, we begin to see all the afflictions and concepts in
              our mind. It is not that the practice has created more of them; by simply
              looking into our mind, we are noticing what was already there. The onrush of
              powerful concepts and afflictions is compared to a turbulent river plunging
              through a gorge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The second stage of calm abiding is known as attainment. Now concepts
              have decreased a little and the afflictions are somewhat reduced. Our
              experience, however, is not yet stable: Sometimes we have an onrush of concepts
              and afflictions, and sometimes we are freer of them. They are not constant as
              in the first stage; their appearances come more slowly. At this point, the
              river has exited the gorge and flows more slowly in a wider bed. The third
              stage refers to the experience of familiarization. Here afflictions and
              concepts do arise, but not with the force they had before. The feeling of an
              onrush has subsided, and the river moves leisurely along its course.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">Having practiced the first three stages, we come to the fourth, the
              experience of stability, where our practice of calm abiding has become
              constant: a vast ocean unmoved by waves. Within this wide expanse, the waves of
              concepts and afflictions have been stilled.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The fifth stage is known as the experience of complete stability. When
              we have become completely familiar with the practice of calm abiding, not only
              do we attain true stability, we also begin to have a slight experience of the
              clear, radiant aspect of the mind. The example here is an ocean that is not
              only free of waves but also clear and transparent. At this fifth stage, in
              addition to a steady mind, the clear and cognizant aspect of its ultimate
              nature starts to manifest. This is the fruition of the practice of calm
              abiding: temporary experiences of the clear, radiant nature of primordial
              wisdom, or the dharmata.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The Buddhist teachings move along a graduated path: first the stages of
              calm abiding and then the stages of deep insight. Through such gradual practices,
              lamas of the past gave birth to realization in their mental continuum and
              discovered primordial wisdom. All the qualities that the great masters found,
              we can attain as well. It all depends on our own efforts, our diligence, our
              deeper knowing, and our correct motivation.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;  ">The
              special mark of Buddhism is that it goes beyond study and reflection to
              emphasize meditation. In Buddhism, we study and reflect on the dharma; and
              then, fully blending what we have understood with our mind, we practice resting
              evenly in meditation. In the beginning, a tree needs strong roots. Similarly,
              what is most important for meditation is calm abiding. For this reason, I have
              explained it for those of us who are practicing meditation to help us find
              mental happiness and well-being. This is my great hope.</span></p>
