                  22: The leading rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) in their latest
                  report, ‘Detention and Prosecution of Tibetans under China’s Stability
                  Maintenance Campaign’, reported that the authorities’ tolerance towards any
                  forms of expression and assembly have diminished under the stability
                  maintenance policy.<br> <br> The report, which recorded Chinese detention, prosecution, and conviction
                  of Tibetans for peaceful activities from 2013 to 2015, stated that there
                  has been an increase in ‘state control over daily life’, ‘increasing
                  criminalization of nonviolent forms of protest’, and ‘disproportionate
                  responses to local protests’. <br> <br> “These measures, part of a policy known as weiwen (stability maintenance),
                  have led authorities to expand the range of activities and issues targeted
                  for repression in Tibetan areas, particularly in the countryside,” the
                  report stated.<br> <br> The analysis report is based on the assessment of 479 cases of Tibetans
                  either detained or tried from 2013 to 2015 for political offences, which
                  include political expression or criticism of government policy. The
                  assessment also comprises of cases as young as 11-years old currently in
                  prison.<br> <br> The report also highlighted the shift of epicenter of detentions from
                  Sichuan province to Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR). It also stated that
                  majority of those arrested and tried were community and religious leaders,
                  activists, writers, singers and villagers involved in social and cultural
                  activities.<br> <br> “Almost all the protests and detentions identified in this report occurred
                  in small towns or rural townships and villages rather than in cities, where
                  most protests and detentions in prior years were reported to have taken
                  place. This suggests that dissent has increased in rural Tibetan areas,
                  where nearly 80 percent of Tibetans live,” the rights group said in their
                  report.<br> <br> It also showed an increased presence of Chinese officials in the rural
                  areas of TAR since 2011 including over 21,000 officials deployed in the
                  villages and monasteries in the TAR region alone. <br> <br> With stability maintenance policy in its third phase in TAR, HRW also
                  stated that politicized detentions in Eastern Tibet (Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu,
                  and Yunnan provinces) has direct link with the policy. However, it is most
                  aimed at ‘stopping self-immolations by Tibetans’ in these regions.<br> <br> “The failure of the central government and local authorities to end these
                  abusive policies and roll back intrusive security and surveillance measures
                  raises the prospect of an intensified cycle of repression and resistance in
                  a region already enduring extraordinary restrictions on basic human
                  rights,” the report said.</span></p>
