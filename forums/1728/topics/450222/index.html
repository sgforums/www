              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">This verse is expounded by Buddha to sixty of his </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">ariyÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">disciples after a year of his buddha-hood, while residing at MighadÄ�vu</span></span><span style='font-family: "Courier New"; font-size: 12pt;  '>á¹ƒ</span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "> forest, almost two thousand-six hundred years ago. According to this, Buddha urged his disciples to make journeys in order to disseminate dharma for the benefit of all the sentient beings including humans, deities and brahmÄ�s. It was the very first mission assigned by Buddha to his </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">ariya sÄ�nghÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. Throughout two and a half millenniums, dharma has been taught and learned by Buddhists from generations to generations.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In this paper, three particular approaches for teaching dharma are explored and discussed in accordance with the PÄ�li Texts. The emphasis is made on teaching dharma in new lands where Buddhism is never known or little known.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Need to Export Teachings of Buddha</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In simple economic term, we export goods and services to other regions and countries in order to gain income in return. Regarding the export of teachings of Buddha, what can we expect in return? The return is greater than we can imagine. In simplest way, it reduces stress, tension and anxiety of every individual. This has ripple effect and as an accumulated output of this, society as a whole may become less aggressive and more peaceful which tends to be the ultimate goal of the present day global society which is more or less in turmoil.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Again, in terms of wealth, wealth can be classified into human-wealth and nonhuman wealth. Human wealth refers to aptitude and attitude of human beings whereas non-human wealth refers to capital stock. Both type of wealth can be income-generating, however, only the human wealth which is endowed with dharma can generate peace and harmony. It will also be the determinant of self-sustained growth.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We cannot deny the fact that socio-economic system across the globe produces many tensions in people’s life. With dharma we will be able to make intelligent choices without fear. Moreover, Dharma is adaptable and inclusive. That is why we should not be confined dharma or the Teachings of Buddha to ourselves, the Buddhists. It is needed to be spread as far as it can reach. Thus, we inevitably need to export dharma.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Defining What to Export</span></span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From the very first mission, Buddha stressed the importance of disseminating dharma on the grounds that apart from all its benefits and advantages towards the sentient beings, Buddhist Teachings have auspicious qualities from the beginning to the middle until the end. They are also flawless in meaning and in grammar. We can say that it is also an explicit practical guideline in formulating social ethics to address the never ending human problems.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Therefore, when defining what or which part of dharma to be exported, we should not miss the essence. All the Teachings of Buddha are grouped into Tri Pitaka- the three baskets. The PÄ�li word, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">BuddhasÄ�sanÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">, means Teachings of Buddha. The essence of </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">BuddhasÄ�sanÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">is </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">sÄ«la, samÄ�dhi </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. For </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">sÄ«la </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">(morality), </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">samÄ�dhi </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">(concentration) and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">(wisdom) – the buddha taught </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Vinaya, SuttÄ�nda </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Abhidhamma</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">SÄ«la </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">is expounded and explained through </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Vinaya </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">where as </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">samÄ�dhi </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">is expounded and explained through </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">SuttÄ�nda </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and likewise </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">is expounded and explained through </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Abhidhamma</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. Thus it is very clear that when disseminating </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">BuddhasÄ�sanÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">or the Teachings of Buddha, there should be no exclusion, but to teach all </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">sÄ«la, samÄ�dhi </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">through teaching of </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Vinaya, SuttÄ�nda </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Abhidhamma</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">In order to export the Teachings of Buddha to new lands as well as to non-Buddhist states, first we need exporters or the disseminators of dharma. In this paper, the disseminators of dharma are referred to as ‘Agents’. As the knowledge of </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">sÄ«la, samÄ�dhi</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; "> and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">needs to be disseminated, the role of agents is important. Agents can be Buddhist monks (</span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">bhikkhus</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">), nuns (</span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">bhikkhunis</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">), laymen and lay women. In Buddhism, there is no restriction that only those who are in Buddhist Order, that is, monks and nuns can teach the dharma nor is there such gender discrimination like only males are allowed to teach dharma. That is why in Myanmar history, it has witnessed that a royal princess by the name of Ma Soe Min taught dharma to many scholar monks in the royal court of 11th century Bagan Dynasty. She was also known as Than Byin Princess and was a famous figure in history. She was the chief instructor of dharma at the court not because she was a princess but because of her intellectual skills and solid knowledge in dharma. Regarding the recipients, they refer to both Buddhists and non-Buddhist people in </span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">new lands as well as in non-Buddhist states.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Even for people who claim themselves Buddhists in the non-Buddhist states, they have the potential to have different way of thinking and judgment from that of people from TheravÄ�da Buddhist countries. Thus, we need to clarify our approaches in a manner which most appropriately suit the situations and circumstances. The followings are some suggested approaches:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

These agents need certain tools to transfer what they have learned to the recipients. The two most important tools are </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. All the above mentioned agents can and must cultivate these two dimensions of attribute in them once they have decided to act as agents. The Buddha himself cultivated </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">to the highest level in him above all others in the universe. In other words, these tools are invincible armors against all obstacles of relative world. The mind of Buddha was ultimately purified by his greatness in </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ�. </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Whenever Buddha taught the beings, He spread </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">towards each being and used </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">to gauge their </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">anusaya </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">so that Buddha knew which discourse to deliver according to each individual’s </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">anusaya </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">in order to enlighten that person. In the light of this, agents who teach a way to purify minds need to develop as much compassion- </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and wisdom-</span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; "> as they are capable of.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Again if an agent has developed a successful level of wisdom, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ�, </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">it is easier for the agent to cultivate equanimity, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">upakkÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. As an empirical success story, the following is how a Myanmar monk named Ashin Ottama, very famous for his higher state of compassion, exported dharma to northern part of Myanmar where Buddhism was unknown before his time. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Ashin Ottama was born in 1910 in middle part of Myanmar. He was ordained at the age of nineteen. He started his missionary works since the British colonial era. At that time, Buddhist monks were not allowed to travel northern part of Myanmar as missionary because the colonial government encouraged Christian missionaries to do their missionary work at the remote and hilly regions of Myanmar. If a Buddhist monk was found by the colonial government authority there, the monk would be arrested. In such kind of situation, Ashin Ottama took the risk to disseminate the Teachings of Buddha in the hilly regions of the North after the World War II. He travelled on foot crossing the Rakhine Yoma mountain ranges. Then he decided to stay on the mountain, 7000 feet above the sea level.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">There the natives were ethnic tribal races. The majority of these people belonged to ethnic race called Chin. They had their own spoken language but it did not have written form. Thus, the British created written language for them by using English alphabets. At that time, the natives there were illiterate and they worshipped spirits, except some of them were converted into Christianity by the western missionaries. Ashin Ottama had a great compassion for these people and thus he decided to disseminate dharma there. First, the natives did not accept him and they regarded him as an evil because his head was shaved, he wore robe and carried alms bowl which they had never seen before. They were hostile to him and even tried to harm him. However, Ashin Ottama had mastered </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">mettÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; "> </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">BhavanÄ�. </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">He constantly radiated loving kindness, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">mettÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">towards all the beings. This again is a result of possessing a higher level of compassion and had developed wisdom in him. Those who have compassion, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">are easier to develop </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">mettÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and are also able to effectively radiate </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">mettÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">to the beings.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

Some of them offered him food and some repaired his little hut to be stronger and warmer. Because Ashin Ottama radiated </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">mettÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">to all beings, wild animals did not harm him as well. He was completely protected from men and beasts because of his </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">mettÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; "> towards all beings. Natives were surprised to see that even wild animals did not harm him but pay respect to him when they approached his hut. Eventually, these people came to him for healing of their wounds and to cure different kinds of illnesses. Ashin Ottama cured all the patients just by contemplating </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">MettÄ� BhavanÄ�</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; "><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

This water cured certain illness and released pain. Sometimes, they asked him for simple thing like weather forecasting, and Ashin Ottama always gave them very précised forecasting which was valuable for the farmers and hunters. This is not because he had possessed some kind of supernatural power, but because he was highly literate in Buddhist literature, he was very knowledgeable and he was endowed with wisdom. The villagers thought Ashin Ottama was more powerful than their gods and spirits they worshipped. Thus the natives came to believe in him and devoted him. They listened to him and the dharma he taught them. Their lives became more meaningful and more peaceful. They could change themselves from superstitious, primitive people to open-minded, adaptable people who came to believe in the Law of </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">KÄ�mma</span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">. When analyzing Ashin Ottama’s missionary work, first he gave the impression to the natives that he was harmless. The next impression he gave was that he was reliable and he cared for the welfare of these native people. And finally, he could deliver the message which was the objective of his mission. In fact, this kind of mission, living at a place where people speak different language with different belief system and where one is prone to be alienated with full of hostility, is almost impossible for an ordinary agent. However, in the case of Ashin Ottama, he set an example for future agents that with genuine and perfectly practiced </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">which is accompanied by </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ�, </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">it is possible to make a success in disseminating the Teachings of Buddha to the new lands. Thus agents are highly advised to develop </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">karunÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">pÄ�nñÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">which are essential tools in teaching dharma.</span></span></p>

The Teachings of Buddha are originally in the PÄ�li texts. PÄ�li is a language without written forms and each Buddhist country uses their own characters and alphabets for written expressions. Here, translation is pivotal. A very minor divergent in meaning can lead to totally different concept or explanation. Again, mastering the language of both PÄ�li and recipients’ language is crucial.</span></span></p>

Ashin Thittila was born in 1896 and was ordained in 1915. At that time, Myanmar was still under the British ruling. Although English was used as office language, majority of natives were against learning English purely out of patriotism. This was most prominent in Buddhist community. The elder TheravÄ�da Buddhist monks condemned learning of English and so did their patrons. Ashin Thittila had a strong ambition to propagate Buddhism in the world which was full of aggression and anxiety. In order to fulfill his ambition, he was well aware of the need to master the language which was commonly spoken in the western world that is English. Thus, against all odds, he started learning English. He learned English in Myanmar, India and Sri Lanka. Moreover, since he was an expert in PÄ�li, it was easier for him to learn the grammar of English language. With great effort, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">vÄ«riya </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">and strong will, </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">saddÄ� </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">he finally achieved his goal in a short period of time.</span></span></p>

He went to England and stayed in London. It was just before the outbreak of World War II. He endured all the hardships there. When the War broke out, he did not go back to his country although many friends and colleagues insisted him and this was because he thought he hadn’t even started to accomplish his mission. During the War, he stayed at his friend catholic priest’s estate in Summerset. While residing there, he volunteered to do ‘black out’ which was to put out lights at night to avoid exposure to the bombers. He also volunteered as a first-aid nurse to take care of casualties and victims of bombings in London. Amidst the hardships where all the situations were very irrelevant for the livelihood of a Buddhist monk who also needed to comply with </span><em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">vinaya, </span></em><span style="font-size: 12pt; ">Ashin Thittila survived and started to launch his Buddhist missionary works.</span></span></p>

If the recipients’ language and the agent’s language are the same, then there is not much effort needed for the agent in teaching the dharma, except to be careful with the PÄ�li translation. However, if the agent and the recipients do not share the same language, then it is a must for the agent to master the language of the recipients which would be second tongue for him or her. It is suggested that agent should master at least 70% of both PÄ�li and the recipients’ language. In the case of Ashin Thittla, he firmly believed that he needed to master English and as a result of his hard work, he could break the big barrier. He organized group discussions and weekly public lectures. Then he became meditation instructor. His lectures and his instructions were very clear, precise and easily understandable by the English native speakers that the recipients keep on attending the sessions with increasing number of attendees every week. His British landlady called him ‘Uneducated Easterner’. She always commented that there was nothing new for westerners to learn from the easterner like Ashin Thittila. However, once she saw even famous academics started to attend his lectures, she stopped calling him ‘Uneducated Easterner’. He was a monk who learned and knew very well about the mindset of 20th century western people. He believed in the fact that Buddhist way is not to convert, but to raise the consciousness of others by our own deeds.</span></span></p>

He made such abstract and metaphysical topics very interesting by his skills in language. Among the candidates who entered the Abhidhamma exams, many of them passed with distinctions and those who passed were awarded certificates. He encouraged his students to learn synonyms for each Buddhist terminology and technical terms to help them make it easier to learn and understand.</span></span></p>

This is one of his major achievements. He was always very careful in translation and careful study of his works shows that he avoided personal ideas when translating the PÄ�li words. This is another issue on which agents need to pay much attention. Sometimes, when we focus much on the relevancy between the message we want to instill and the recipients’ situation, we try to formulate that would suit the situation and there is a tendency of divergence from the original meaning. As TheravÄ�dans, throughout these 2600 years, we have never added, subtracted or made changes to the Teachings of Buddha. Thus we need to keep this tradition and should be cautious about this. As for Ashin Thittila, he firmly aware of this and it is reflected in his lectures and his writings. He had written and translated many famous and best selling books on Buddhism such as The Book of Analysis, The Path of the Buddha, The Buddha and Personal Life, Essential Themes of Buddhist Lectures and many more.</span></span></p>

It solely aims to highlight the methods which are already mentioned in the Buddhist texts, but are prone to be overlooked by many scholars and disseminators of Buddhism lately. This re-exploration of specific means of teaching dharma hopes to add more flavors in improving the efficiency of the existing system in disseminating the Teachin</span><span>gs of Buddha and helping people to make their lives better.</span></span></p>
