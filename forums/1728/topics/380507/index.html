              <p>Here's a video that Thusness and I found very interesting. I think
                          what is said in this video lines up well with the Buddhist teaching of
                          Emptiness. Thusness have suggested I post it in our blog, <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com</a>, which I did.</p>
              <p>
              
              
              
              
              
              URL: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb1u9zOPwiQ&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb1u9zOPwiQ&amp;feature=related</a><br><br>It also reminds me of an article written by Longchen:<br><em><strong><br><span>The non-solidity of existence</span></strong><br><br><span>This article describes a spiritual insight. It may be quite hard to understand.</span><br><br><span>The
                          things that we experience are registered by all the sense organs. The
                          eye sight registers vision, the ears register sound, the body registers
                          sensations. These perception, sensations and experiences are not
                          happening in some places. They are the experience of the arising of
                          certain conditions. There is no solidity and physicality in the actual
                          experience.</span><br><br><span>What we
                          experienced is not universal and common to all. Here's an example to
                          illustrate that: We know that as human beings, we see in term of
                          colours. Some animals are however colour-blind, thus they see
                          differently from us. But none of us, is really seeing the truth nature
                          directly. The senses of different species of sentient beings experience
                          things differently. So who is seeing the real image of an object? None.</span><br><br><span>Likewise,
                          the various planes of existence are due to different conditions
                          arising. In certain types of meditation, one is said to be able to
                          access these planes of existence. This is because they are not specific
                          locations. They are mental states and are thus non-localised. In these
                          meditations, our consciousness changes and 'aligned' more with these
                          other states or planes of existence.</span><br><br><span>All
                          the planes of existence are simultaneously manifesting, but because our
                          senses are human-based conditioned arisings, we only see the human
                          world and other beings that shared 'similar' resonating arising
                          conditions. But nevertheless, the other planes of existences are not
                          elsewhere in some other places.</span><br><br><span>What
                          we think of as places are really just consciousness and there is no
                          solidity whatsoever. Even our touch sense is just that. The touch sense
                          gives an impression of feeling something that is physical and
                          three-dimensional. But there is really no solid self-existing object
                          there. Instead, it is simply the sensation that gives the impression of
                          physical solidity and form.</span><br><span>OK, that all I can think of and write about this topic. I will revise and improve this article where the need arises.</span><br><br><span>For your necessary ponderance. Thank you for reading.</span><br><br></em><span><em>These articles are parts of a series of spiritual realisation articles .<br></em><br></span></p>
              <p>It also reminds me of something Thusness talked about in the <a href="/forums/1728/topics/262408">Transcript of the Lankavatara Sutra sharing by Thusness</a> in January 2007 (note that this isn't meant to be a commentary of the
                          sutra but simply a personal sharing of his experience with it):<em><br><br><span> When we look at Buddhism, Buddhism is very consistent. Why do I say
                          that Buddhism is very consistent? Not because I like Buddhism. You see,
                          a person saying that I have experienced Presence, and I AM the Eternal
                          Witness, I AM God, I AM all powerful and I AM the First Cause, and yet,
                          they see a dualistic world. This is in total conflict; this has totally
                          no logic at all. Because, you see, in Buddhism when we talk about
                          Non-Duality, we are saying something like the Dependent Origination.
                          Because of This, That Is. This arises, That arises. This ceases, That
                          ceases. We look at the entire formation, there is no “Who?” Where is
                          the “Who?” When we ask “Where?”, there is no “Where?”. When we ask
                          “When?”, there is no “When?” It can be 10 million miles away. It can be
                          in another planet. The teaching is consistent. It does not require a
                          “Who”, a “Where”, a “When”. Condition arises, it is there. It is not
                          stored in any place, or anywhere. This is the teaching. The entire
                          teaching is consistent when it comes to the practise. They didn’t say
                          Concentration can lead to Insight. They tell you, Vipashyana Meditation
                          can lead to Insight of what Reality is all about. It does not teach
                          that there is a Self. The Buddha taught the three dharma seals: there
                          is No-Self. So the teaching is consistent in terms of philosophy, in
                          terms of meditation practice, and in terms of the truths that is being
                          preached.</span><br><br><span> And also in terms of spiritual powers. When I say something like
                          Clairvoyance... I can see, not bounded by distance. I can hear, not
                          bounded by distance. How come? Why? If we were to take other religions,
                          they can’t explain. But if you were to take Buddhism, Buddha had never
                          told you, has never taught, something of an Ego, something of a Where,
                          something of a When. It is not bounded by Time and Space at all in the
                          entire philosophy. Never has he taught anything like that. And
                          therefore, when we talk about spiritual powers, it is consistent. It is
                          knowing without the need for a Space and Time, not bounded by Space and
                          Time, because the entire teaching is so. And what is being said about
                          this? It is the Nature. This is your nature. Reality is like that, it
                          is so. Therefore, when we understand the teachings, we understand that
                          yes, it is not right to be attached, therefore we cannot say we want to
                          seek spiritual powers, like Nub. But we have to understand, this is our
                          Nature, this is our Reality. Because the teaching has never
                          contradicted itself. If you want to know about your reality, you have
                          to practise. That is the teaching. And the practise has always been
                          telling you to observe these 3 universal characteristics. So when we
                          see the link between the practise, the philosophy, even something
                          spiritual and something that is not scientific. This is important.</span></em></p>
              <p style="font-style: italic;">....in
                          Buddhism they teach you otherwise. They teach you not to see things in
                          terms of “I”, not to see things in terms of a “where” and a “when”.
                          Let’s say something very simple. When I say that things happen, it is
                          not like those people that subscribe to think that anything is just
                          taking by itself, it’s nature. Mainly what is important is conditions.
                          You must have the conditions, then things can surface. When the
                          conditions is there, they just surfaces, and manifest. If there is
                          cause in ten million miles away or ten million light years away, or
                          whatever it is, or in other realms, as long as there is conditions, it
                          WILL surface, it is not travelling {inaudible}. Can you understand this
                          part? Condition is there, they just manifest. This is one thing.<br> <br> The second thing, to break the view of an entity, when we say that,
                          where? Why must we keep of asking where? Why must we keep on asking
                          who? Where does the seed of propensity reside? It doesn’t reside
                          anywhere. Don’t ask where. It’s just the way it is. Because whenever
                          you ask where, who, and when, it is because you are very accustomed to
                          our way of inquiry. The way we enquire. It is an inquiry system only.
                          It is not reality. It is just the way you ask things only. It is just
                          the way we are molded, and therefore we ask things this way. If we ask
                          things this way, then the idea of God is more {inaudible} You see, the
                          idea of God is based on the first cause, right? What is God? God is the
                          first cause. But why must there be a first cause? There is a first
                          cause because there is a limit to the way we think. It is due to the
                          poverty of our own thinking mechanism. The mind requires a base to
                          start. So it is for the thinking mind to understand. It is not reality.
                          Only the mind needs to understand this way. Reality doesn’t behave that
                          way. Can you see? So we are trying to fit reality into a model of
                          concept. Correct?</p>
