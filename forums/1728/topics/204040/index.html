            <div class='col-md body'>Hey how abt a rpg theme where the player started out as a person trying to find buddhism teachings . Let the environment of the game be like an adventure where the player will go to various part of the world where he will meet buddhist masters , rinpoche who will give them some buddhist teachings and after end of the lessons , there will be a quiz for them to answer and only after passing the quiz then they can proceed to other places to learn more teachings . And of cos along the way they will have various queer encounters which will test them on their knowledge and understanding of the teachings that they have learnt. Any wrong step will have a different result , repeat the course or ending in a different path other then the intended one . And also if they manage to handle " obstacles " correctly , they will have some bonus things to help them on their journey to understand n know more abt buddhism thoroughly for example a gratefull couple informing them of a " hidden " location where there is a sage where they can learn some mantras or sutras " . Is it difficult to program such a game ? Used to be my dream to be a programmer so that i can create a game myself but things din work out that way . sigh !</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hee suddenly tot of some added features for the game . Perhaps you can make it an online game where more then one player or player can form groups to play tgether , learn buddhism teachings together so that they can help each other make the correct choices . And maybe let the player have some chances to setup shops to earn money to go to some ulu inaccessible places like island where you need to buy or rent a boat to go and they only place where you can find a boat is through players shops which sell such items , in this way i think the programmer can earn some sideline to earn abit of income to keep the game going or improve on the game . And also this feature will make the game more lively other then just walking ard seeking buddhist teaching . And also let the char in the game have a wisdom/karma statistic whereby it will increase or decrease depending on the actions , choices or correct understanding of the buddhist teachings which will enable them to proceed to the next stage otherwise they will have to go back to the course or walk ard to help pple to accumulate the statistics , for example to donate money to build temples or to the needy to increase their statistic for positive karma . And you can put some encounter whereby the npc will pretend to spread or teach some distorted teachings ending with a yes or no , true or false answer to test if the player really understand the teachings anot .</div>

I am not so good at grahphic design, so might have to borrow some graphic from other buddhist website, hope they will allow that.<br>And the data entry for the dharma Q&amp;A will be another headache. I have to go and study about other traditions of buddhism and their practises, but I will treat it as part of my cultivation as well.<br>This website won't be out so soon, but will keep you all informed.<br>nvm, I help you to achieve this dream then.<br></div>
