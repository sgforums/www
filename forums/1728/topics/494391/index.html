              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Pamela Gayle White SPRING
              2012 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Moving
              toward unconditional fulfillment and freedom</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You’re
              bright, curious, and driven. Maybe competitive, certainly inspired by a good
              challenge, and possibly interested in contributing something to make the world
              a better place. Maybe you’ve even thought about what it will take for you to
              reach 80 or 100 and be able to say: This is what I set out to do, and I’ve done
              it. There have been ups and downs, but I’ve pretty much stayed on track.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">You
              may think: To go from here to there—becoming a successful and satisfied person
              with a big chunk of life behind me—I’ll need to get this, achieve that, go there.
              If you’re a romantic, your success will depend on relationships; if you’re
              family-oriented, it’ll be family; if you’re a materialist, you’ll need to
              acquire certain things; if you’re an adventurer, adventures; if you’re an
              intellectual, knowledge. The list goes on. You may well have eminently worthy
              and admirable goals—especially if contributing to the welfare of others is part
              of what makes you tick.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              if our fulfillment and happiness depend on obtaining or doing something, will
              we be unhappy or frustrated if we don’t obtain it or do it? Is our happiness
              dependent on something that is ultimately beyond our personal reach? Does it
              depend on other people, other events? If those things, people, events, states
              or relationships that we depend on for our fulfillment change, what happens?
              They will change, they do change. Sometimes for the better—but not always. Then
              what?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is useful to take a closer look at what actually makes us happy. What do we
              mean by happy? Where do peace and fulfillment come from? What about
              dissatisfaction, pain and anguish? How do we define these experiences? And
              who—or what—is this potentially fulfilled person—this “me”?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Around
              2,600 years ago the Buddha, aware that we all share the desire to be happy and
              to avoid pain, asked himself these exact same questions. And 2,600 years ago
              the Buddha came up with answers that are still—according to Buddhists,
              anyway—the most intelligent, pertinent response to human needs in terms of
              philosophy and practice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha was born to a royal family in what is now southwestern Nepal. A holy
              fortune-teller told the Buddha’s father, the king, that the boy would grow up
              to be either a great ruler or a great renunciant and spiritual guide. Naturally
              his father liked the first version better, and he did everything in his power
              to make sure Prince Siddhartha Gautama was happy. We can imagine the palace,
              the gardens and fountains, the peacocks, banquets, dancing girls, silks and
              brocades, musicians and jasmine, and all the rest of it. The king made sure his
              son never saw anything unpleasant, troubling, or jarring. And we can presume
              that the handsome, gifted prince believed he was leading a meaningful,
              satisfying life. He was happily married, had a fine son, and his wish was
              everyone’s command.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              then, the story goes, he went beyond the perimeters of his idyllic life and for
              the first time witnessed the shocking truths of aging, illness, and death. And
              suddenly a yearning for peace and meaning that were not contingent on
              commodities like health, youth, and wealth arose and was stronger than
              everything else. So he left in pursuit of something like unalterable happiness,
              and he tried to find it through the extreme ascetic practices that were the
              going thing back then. After six years of astonishing self-abnegation, he came
              to the realization that the two extremes of earthly pleasures and
              self-mortification weren’t going to take him where he meant to go. So he had
              some lovely rice pudding, sat on a grass mat under a pipal tree in what is now
              Bodh Gaya, and vowed he wouldn’t quit until he found the absolute happiness he
              was looking for. “Let only skin, sinew, and bone remain,” he said, “let the
              flesh and blood dry in my body, but I will not give up this seat without
              attaining complete awakening.” After a long and very eventful night, he became
              Buddha, the Awakened One.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Seven
              weeks later, he gave his first teaching. It laid out the whole story, from our
              misguided pursuit of happiness to the possibility of awakening and peace, in
              four points: the Four Noble Truths. His first truth, the Truth of Suffering,
              states that suffering is a given in any form of existence that is dependent on
              causes and conditions. It defines suffering as all levels of discomfort,
              ranging from blatant pain to the subtle discomfort of change and the far
              subtler existential suffering that goes along with being alive.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              second truth is the Origin of Suffering, and here the Buddha explains that the
              origin of suffering is not some god who has it in for us, or some arbitrary
              finger of fate, but our own ignorance and its karmic by-products.
              Revolutionary! We’ll come back to this one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              third truth is the Truth of Cessation, or the truth of peace: the unequivocal
              peace that is realized when our veils, confusion, and selfishness have ceased,
              have been removed, and our natural goodness and wisdom have fully blossomed.
              Pure happiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              finally the fourth truth, the Truth of the Path, maps out the practice that
              leads us to the Truth of Cessation. That route is essentially right view, right
              action (learning how to be truly helpful), and right spiritual practice, as
              traditionally expressed by the condensed guide to a wholesome lifestyle called
              the Eightfold Noble Path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              origin of suffering is ignorance. The word in Sanskrit is avidya—not knowing,
              not being aware of our fundamental nature or essence as being buddha, awake,
              and of the nature of conditioned manifestation, including us, as being
              interconnected and devoid of any sort of solid, independent self; impermanent
              and subject to change, whether we like it or not; and composite, meaning that
              pain will be part of our experience, since everything that exists as an
              aggregate necessarily falls apart sooner or later. Even the Buddha, who went on
              to give teachings on different subjects in different places over a span of
              nearly 50 years, left his body behind at age 81.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ignorance
              means that we don’t have all of the elements we need to make informed choices
              about life. We’re all looking for comfort, or meaning, but we make clumsy
              choices that lead to painful results (eating too much chocolate is a personal
              case in point). Because of ignorance, we are unaware of the ultimate,
              fundamental interconnectedness of existence, and our universe is perceived not
              as the ever-changing lace of illusion it is but as a solid, somewhat static
              confrontation between self/me and other/everything else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              divide our world into me/you, friend/enemy, desirable/undesirable,
              fulfilling/frustrating, and so on. It’s a natural process, but a very
              arbitrary, utterly subjective one. Somehow we’re able to ignore this last fact.
              We’re in dualistic division mode, and we act on that; all sorts of emotions
              come into play, and we act on them. We reinforce the tendencies—Buddhists might
              say, we create or compound karma—that make the illusion thicker, stickier, more
              solid. And the further we are from truth, the more elusive happiness becomes.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              great 20th-century teacher from Tibet, the 3rd Jamgon Kongtrul, gave a talk at
              State University of New York at Albany in 1985. “Most of the time our
              relationship to the world around us accords not with its basic nature but with
              our incomplete perceptions of it,” he said. “We do not experience our own basic
              nature; instead we experience only what we see. The result is tremendous
              conflict in our lives. No matter how hard we try to work things out, there is
              always disorder and dissatisfaction, always something missing. No matter how
              much we seem to have accomplished, there is still more to achieve. This
              dissatisfaction continues and its scale increases, because what we are
              fundamentally and how we perceive are not the same.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jamgon
              Kongtrul refers to our basic nature: according to many teachings attributed to
              the Buddha, our basic, ultimate, objective nature is impossible to define in
              words, but it includes that potential for awakening that he presented in the
              third noble truth, Cessation. It has been described as luminous awareness,
              emptiness, basic goodness, and buddhanature. Basic nature has absolutely
              nothing to do with being a Buddhist; all beings share this innate spark of
              perfection. What Buddhism tries to do is give us the means to recognize,
              kindle, and experience this potential, no matter who we are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              a relative level, as beings subject to confusion or ignorance in varying
              degrees, we are interdependent, impermanent, and subject to the suffering we
              seek to avoid. The underlying motor of our experience is karma. Essentially,
              karma refers to the fact that actions and thoughts have results; nothing exists
              without a cause. This is both bad news and good news.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              bad news if we choose to remain in “head-in-the-sand” mode, because our
              tendency will be to relate to happiness and pleasure or frustration and
              dissatisfaction as having external causes and external solutions. We deal with
              them by focusing on a prize or a culprit and reacting according to our confused
              patterns: we turn on the charm, or scheme, or run away, or fight. But as Jamgon
              Kongtrul explained, “what is fundamentally true is that the experience of pain
              or pleasure is not so much what is happening externally as it is what is
              happening internally: the experience of pain or pleasure is mainly a state of
              mind. Whether we experience the world as enlightened or confused depends on our
              state of mind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              that’s the good news.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              good news because there is always the potential for being truly aware of what’s
              going on and using that to deepen our understanding. There’s always the
              potential for opening our eyes and being buddha: awake. Furthermore,
              interdependence means that good actions bring positive, happy results for us
              and for others; and impermanence means that painful situations can change for
              the better and that we can perceive them differently and use them more wisely.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Tibetan word for Buddhist, nangpa, means “insider,” as in “those whose focus is
              directed inside: on the mind, its workings and development.” The Buddha taught
              that true happiness, or fulfillment, is independent of outer causes and
              conditions. So for Buddhists, the pursuit of happiness involves training in
              looking inward. Once we know who we really are, from the inside out, we’re less
              likely to believe in the viability of our patterns and addictions. We realize
              that if we’ve been in cahoots with dissatisfaction and confusion, it’s because
              we haven’t discovered our own birthright.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">An
              oft-given analogy is that of the starving person who is unaware of the larder
              in the cellar. I always imagine an emaciated fellow in rags, too defeated or
              unimaginative to think to pick at the dirt floor of the filthy hovel he’s
              wasting away in. Too discouraged to find the big iron ring just under the
              surface of the dirt that would lift weightlessly away if pulled, revealing an
              illuminated cellar filled with cool spring water, gorgeous fruit, lots of good
              French cheese, fine crusty bread, and so on.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we’re inspired to dust off the big iron ring and give it a pull, if we’re
              interested in working toward replacing our confusion with clarity and peace of
              mind, in discovering our birthright, Buddhism gives us tools. One of the main
              tools, which guides us in observing and working with the mind, is meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditating
              isn’t about nuking the thoughts and emotions that arise in our mindstream; it
              isn’t about floating around in a bliss bubble; and it isn’t about shaving our
              head, changing our name to Wangmo and living in a cave. So what is it about?
              Remember that the Buddhist take on existence includes both the absolute and
              relative levels. When we meditate, we relate to both. We relate to absolute
              wisdom and relative confusion, and we do it without judgment or politics. The
              basic meditation called shamatha, or “calm abiding,” is a neutral process of
              acknowledging and letting go. It’s the Switzerland of practices. We’re willing
              to cut through our attachment to thought—but we are not trying to stop the process
              of thinking, because thoughts are not the problem. Our hopes and fears,
              attachment and rejection, the tension they create and veils they reinforce are
              the problem.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Meditation
              takes many different forms; there are endless variants, and each variant focuses
              on revealing one or another of those treasures in the larder. Shamatha is the
              practice that introduces us to the mind’s capacity to be trained and to develop
              composure. And though composure is not the final goal, stability is the basis
              for all other practices, some of which can be quite dynamic and demanding. If
              the mind is constantly scurrying around like a ferret on caffeine, how can we
              train it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we look at where the mind is going as it dashes and darts here and there, we
              see that our thoughts are concerned with the past—things we wish had happened
              differently, situations we enjoyed and want to recreate, events that are dead
              and gone—and the future, which doesn’t exist, and never unfolds the way we
              write the stories anyway. When we meditate, we relate to that unsettling,
              ineffable commodity: the present. We train in letting go of thoughts and
              feelings as they arise, and settle back into the present: that gap between two
              concepts—past and future—that don’t actually exist. We’re simply being, here and
              now. Because just being is so unfamiliar to us, we develop our practice through
              any one of many methods for calming the mind, like following the breath. We
              just sit down, settle our mind on the breath, acknowledge what’s arising, drop
              it and go back to our breathing. If we’re aware of tension, we soften and let
              it go. If we’re aware of agitation or drowsiness, we make use of diligence and
              apply a remedy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; text-align: left;">Pay attention. Stay open. Note discomfort and go
              back to your breathing. Use your curiosity. Be patient. You’re doing something
              vital: you’re pulling the iron ring. You’re moving in the direction of
              unconditional fulfillment and freedom. You’re pursuing happiness the only way
              that truly makes sense: from the inside out.</span></p>
