              <p><br>They are the cultural treasure of humanity. They are also the source of our material and spiritual civilisation. Today the human race has neglected the tradition and the accumulated wisdom of their forefathers, has opted for new innovations, and erroneously thinks that the human race is in great progress. Not<br>until they are at the end of their road will they begin to value the traditional culture<br>and the wisdom of our forefathers.<br>Even though today our technology is advanced, at the same time, our society is<br>facing extreme poverty more so than ever before. There are two kinds of poverty. One is lack of needed necessities. The other lacks spiritual culture. Recently a fellow student from Beijing invited me to talk about “How to Assist Those Who Are<br>impoverished by the Lack of Spirituality and Culture”. Apparently it has become a<br>serious problem in our society. Let us think about this carefully. What is more<br>important, materialism or spirituality? Let us take a look at all the sages of this world.<br>Should we live a life in poverty?<br>In China we all know Confucius and Mencius lived in poverty. Yan-Hui was<br>Confucius’s best student. Confucius often praised him. However, among all his<br>classmates, he was the poorest. He ate out of roughly woven bamboo ware and only had a ladle made of gourd. He didn’t even own a rice bowl or a cup. This was his living condition but he was very happy. His happiness came from being able to<br>practice what he had learned. Therefore, we know happiness does not come from<br>owning material things. This is also how we should look at our current problems.<br>All the saints, sages, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas had already demonstrated for us<br>that the enjoyment of owning material things cannot make us happy. Shakyamuni Buddha was born a prince in India. He gave up his thrown when he was nineteen<br>years old, along with it, the life of luxury. Instead he went in search for knowledge.<br>For the remainder of his life he only owned three pieces of clothing and one bowl. He<br>only ate one meal a day and slept underneath the tree. He did not think this was<br>suffering. He was actually very happy. At that time countless number of kings,<br>ministers, rich elders became his students and wanted to learn from him. Buddha did not accept their offerings. He never owned or built a temple in his life. Occasionally he accepted invitation to give lectures and lessons in homes. He always left soon afterwards. He went into nirvana in the woods not under a roof but in the fields. He demonstrated for us that true happiness comes from spiritual realisation. It has nothing to do with wealth or fame or because of the type of life we lead. Only when we truly understand what this means will we “let go”.</p>

              <p>The integration of deities occurs when there is a meeting of different cultures, some attribute that the jewish god originates from El, that the deluge also comes from the Mesopotamian myth(sumerian?)</p>
              <p>Did a search on Oannes and came up with these:-  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/retro/calendar/oannes.html">http://www.angelfire.com/retro/calendar/oannes.html</a></p>
              <p>Although topic is related to Jesus, your post deals with separate issues to be directed into different lines of investigation. 1, the origins and subsequent evolved emergence of the Deity.</p>
              <p>2,  The historical authenticity of person of Jesus.</p>
              <p>In regard to , you should refer the mentioned Prefect of Judea in the bible, which was Pontius Pilate, as crucification of Christ during his administration, so should have some records of it, which admittedly I did not pursue.</p>
              <p>I have misgivings about the christian faith, in particular in some of its methods of proselytisation, but I'll try my best not to mix the issues. If someone wishes to profess that God is Love, as long as  they  practise what they preach, I am content to leave it at that. Anymore than that, I will demand burden of proof and not just on hearsay.</p>

If you want to know about Jesus from Christian's point of view, Buddhists also have no problem in answering. Start a topic and many Buddhists here will answer you from Christian's point of view in details.</p>
