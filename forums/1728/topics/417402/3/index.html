              <p><span style="font-family: arial; line-height: normal; font-size: small;">Buddhist or any others with professed faith see other religion as how the adherents behave in front of them.  If  you feel christianity or your  god has been maligned or misrepresented in any way, feel free to engage constructively, Buddhists and other faiths also reserve this right.  Muslims, I do not know therefore reserve my comments, but christians rantings about buddism are aplenty. Allusions sweeping accusations to worshipping false idols and association to the devil is standard issue beliefs. One fundamenta belief is all non christians are sinners, that is frequently manifested as inherent superiority over non believers,or in one word, hereitcs. Many christians are laden with a guilt complex that lingers even when one leaves the religion, especially so. A lot of ex christians feel betrayed, and angry and confused by the beliefs and community they left behind. Until they have learnt to make peace, they continue to react strongly to to any holier than thou representations. This rebuttal is made with these people in mind. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: small;">Buddhist or any others with professed faith see other religion as how the adherents behave in front of them.  If  you feel christianity or your  god has been maligned or misrepresented in any way, feel free to engage constructively, Buddhists and other faiths also reserve this right.  Muslims, I do not know therefore reserve my comments, but christians rantings about buddism are aplenty. Allusions sweeping accusations to worshipping false idols and association to the devil is standard issue beliefs. One fundamenta belief is all non christians are sinners, that is frequently manifested as inherent superiority over non believers,or in one word, hereitcs. Many christians are laden with a guilt complex that lingers even when one leaves the religion, especially so. A lot of ex christians feel betrayed, and angry and confused by the beliefs and community they left behind. Until they have learnt to make peace, they continue to react strongly to to any holier than thou representations. This rebuttal is made with these people in mind. </span></p>

              <p>When I have issues with certain aspects of Buddhism, I question it all the same. Although that being the case,  perceptible practictoners of Buddhism are multifaceted. I question them when an useful opportunity rises.</p>
              <p>When there an appropriate moment  to discuss religion, we discuss, as long as we can keep a level view. This requires emotional maturity, are you ready?</p>
              <p>In an issue with an emotive element, it is best to take rational approach, dealing with facts at hand. Point to point verification is the best. And try not to score points for emotional gratification and respect your  fellow posters.</p>
              <p>However, the vocal ones or least visible ones, are usually defensive in nature. Current situation is no exception. The nice ones(christians) do have an easy demeanor, don't go aggressive,  aren't very vocal most of the time, just being comfortable with who they are.</p>
              <p>I do not intent anything, just comfortable and content with now. I am not going anywhere.</p>
              <p>There are subtle reminders to some who can take a hint, obviously, you are too hot and bothered to notice it.  What you have done is make accusations, whether real or imagined and hitting out with anger. Why do you feel threatened?</p>
