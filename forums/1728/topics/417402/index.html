              <p>There are many views among Buddhists. Some think he is a man, some think he is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhisattva">Bodhisattva</a>, I'm sure there are other views.</p>
              <p>Personally I think Jesus had some realisation but his teachings are very distorted by those who misunderstood him or wanted to use bible as a political tool.</p>

              <p>Gospels like the Gospel of Thomas shows realization of a deep contemplative/mystical nature... however this gospel, even though written not long after Jesus's passing, was not in the official canon accepted by the early churchfathers. Probably because it was too deep for most to understand or grasp.</p>
              <p>Other gospels also contains excerpts here and there that shows Jesus's realisation.</p>

              <p>15   Jesus said, "When you see one who was not born of woman, fall
                                  on your faces and worship.  That one is your Father."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This reminded me of my own koan - 'Before birth, Who am I?' or 'Before my parents were born, who am I/what is it?' - this triggered my own awakening.</p>
              <p>There are some very clear quotations from that gospel. In fact... not just 'some'... all verses show very clear non-dual realisation.</p>

              <p>Both Jesus and Buddha are the manifestation of the omnipresent true mind of ours. They are the embodiment of intrinsical peace that we all shared together. Their basic teachings is - there is no grievance over the past, for it is gone. Never has a worry that exist of the future, for it has yet to come. As long as it is called present moment, live this moment as if it was your last,and u will find each day worth living for!</p>

We believe as per Chapter 16 of Lotus Sutra, Eternal Shayamuni Buddha is equipped with the 3 bodies. He is the awaken one whom is free from ignorance and delusion. He able to see things as they really are. </span></p>

Because Lotus Sutra claimed that Buddha and Bodhisattvas is able to manifest themselves in any form to teach the Dharma. </span></p>

              <p>"God" is not part of it. First of all in Buddhism there is no Creator God... secondly, the lives of 'god' or celestial beings are plenty and common and thus isn't something 'inponderable' or out of reach.</p>

              <ul>
              <li>“The single most important non-canonical book yet to be uncovered.”</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>“A very important discovery —probably doing more as a single text to
               advance our understanding of the historical Jesus (and of the 
              transmission of his teachings) than all the Dead Sea Scrolls put 
              together.”</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>“One of the most important archaeological finds in the history of 
              New Testament scholarship —every bit as revolutionary for the study of 
              the New Testament as the Dead Sea Scrolls are for the study of the 
              Hebrew bible.”</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>“A gospel that understands ‘salvation’ to come from some other means than a ‘risen’ Jesus.”</li>
              </ul>
              <p>There are no miracles; no crowds of followers; no temple confrontations.</p>
              <p>No crucifixion or resurrection tales; no theology of sin, judgment, hell or redemption.</p>
              <p>No misogyny (Salome and Mary are two of the five disciples named); no
               discussion of founding a church; no talk of a Second Coming; and no 
              pious rephrasing of Old Testament commandments.</p>
              <p>For reasons that become clear, there is no talk of a post-crucifixion
               bodily resurrection, nor any miracle sagas which one could accept only 
              on faith.</p>

              <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Gospel of Thomas</strong> is truly a heretical scripture.</p>

               explores this “heresy”; how the message of Jesus in Thomas differs from
               the message in the New Testament. The claim: the self-references of 
              Jesus, here, are not to the fleshly person but to the embodied Presence 
              of an enlightened sage or master. And there are striking verses said to 
              have been spoken by Jesus —not found in the Bible<em> —that make sense only within the context of nonduality</em>.
               Does The Gospel of Thomas record the nondual enlightenment teachings of
               Jesus —and were they left out of the New Testament for that reason? Do 
              conventional understandings of Thomas miss its real significance?  How 
              does the message of Jesus in The Gospel of Thomas exemplify the ancient 
              teachings of nonduality?</p>

              <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffcc00;">“Was Jesus influenced by the East?”</span></h2>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While there is no historical evidence that Jesus was influenced by 
              nondual teachings (even from so far away as the East), it is not 
              inconceivable that he was.  In fact, there is a possibility that at 
              least some of its principles may have been known to him.  Let’s look at 
              how these teachings may have been present in his time and place.</p>
              <p>The writer <strong>Holger Kersten</strong> provided some research to buttress his points (which otherwise are tenuous) in the Penguin book <em>Jesus Lived In India</em>.  He attributes “the worldwide spread of Buddhism, even before the pre-Christian era” to the Indian ruler <strong>Ashoka</strong>,
               who lived circa 273–232 B.C., and who sent Buddhist missionaries along 
              the Silk Route to as far away as Egypt, Syria, and Greece.  The Buddha 
              himself was said to have instructed, “Go, O monks, and travel afar, for 
              the benefit and welfare of many, out of compassion for the world…”</p>
              <p>Buddha, like Jesus, had kept on the move, traversing “the entire length of the mid-Ganges basin,” says Kersten.</p>
              <p>At various times during the history of Buddhism, “the Indies basin, 
              the upper Ganges basin and the Deccan” were invaded by “Hellenic 
              Bactrians of the 2nd Century B.C., and the Scythians and Parthians in 
              the 1st Century B.C. …  The Scythian rulers of the Kushan dynasty 
              themselves encouraged the spread of Buddhism after their own 
              conversion.”</p>
              <p>Kersten’s tracing of cross-fertilization between cultures of the East
               and Near East, centuries before Jesus’ birth, is reflected in the book 
              of Acts (2:9):  Parthians (and “residents of Asia”) were among those 
              “staying in Jerusalem,” even after the crucifixion, this New Testament 
              book says.</p>
              <p>Similarly, the Quaker <strong>Albert Edmunds</strong>, a translator who worked with both Greek and Pali texts, reported on research that was available when he wrote <em>Buddhist and Christian Gospels</em>, in 1908.</p>
              <p>He noted that a German New Testament scholar had initiated such 
              comparisons before him, in 1867, because “These parallels [between 
              Buddhist and Christian scriptures] have aroused the interest of New 
              Testament scholars…[since they] belong to a world of [spiritual] thought
               which the whole East had in common.”</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1558" src="http://nondualityamerica.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/head.png?w=245&amp;h=270" alt="" width="245" height="270">Edmunds says that <strong>Ashoka</strong> (or Asoka) sent Buddhist “missionaries” to five Greek emperors, 
              including Antiochus, Ptolemy and Alexander, between 262–258 B.C.; thus 
              they would have entered Athens, Antioch, and Alexandria.  Ptolemy had 
              funded a Greek translation of the Jewish Pentateuch, and reportedly was 
              interested in a similar project about Hindu scriptures.</p>
              <p>Cross-culturally, Edmunds said that Greek forces inhabited the Punjab, of the Brahmins, around 110 B.C.</p>
              <p>In the 2nd Century B.C., there were “Hindu mahouts on the elephants of the Syrian Army.”</p>
              <p>In the 1st Century B.C., the Roman poet <strong>Horace</strong> mentions an Indian embassy to the first Roman emperor, <strong>Augustus</strong>, in 17 B.C.—only a short time before the birth of Jesus.</p>
              <p>The Greek geographer Strabo noted, according to Edmunds: “at the time
               of Christ, the intercourse [East/Near East] was at its height.”</p>
              <p>And later, <strong>Clement of Alexandria</strong>, toward the end of the 2nd Century C.E., knew of Hindu “philosophers…who obey the precepts of Buddha.”</p>
              <p>In any event, it is noteworthy that the author of the <em>Gospel of Matthew</em> did not suppose that his readers would have any difficulty in accepting
               the arrival, in Judea, of “wise  men” (Magi) from the East, from far 
              enough away to  need to navigate by the stars (2:1-12) at the time of 
              Jesus’ birth.</p>
              <p>It is interesting, in this natal tale, that the <em>first</em> of those to recognize the true nature of Jesus <em>were </em>from the East.</p>
              <p>How unlikely is it that Jesus might have been influenced by teachings that preceded him by centuries?  Consider this comparison:</p>
              <p>Said to be a contemporary of Jesus, <strong>Apollonius of Tyana</strong>,
               an “itinerant sage,” is known to have been an exponent of the teachings
               of Pythagoras, who was born circa 521 B.C. (about 40 years before 
              Buddha).</p>
              <p>After receiving an education in the Greek city of Tarsus, Apollonius then traveled to Babylon, an account says, to <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1559" src="http://nondualityamerica.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/apollonius.png?w=200&amp;h=230" alt="" width="200" height="230">study with the Magi.  Then he went to India to learn first-hand the teachings of the <strong>Brahmans</strong>.
                Returning to the coast of northern Syria, Anatolia and Greece, he lead
               a circle of disciples as a holy man.  He also traveled to Rome, Sicily,
               Spain and visited the “naked sages” of Upper Egypt.  Then he lived for 
              the rest of his life in Asia Minor, and died in 96 C.E. <strong><span style="color: #800000;">¹</span></strong></p>
              <p>However, whether Jesus was influenced by the nondual winds of the 
              East, one needs to consider that there have been the spontaneous 
              awakenings of self-realized sages chronicled in widespread places and 
              times throughout written history —from Buddha, as an example in ancient 
              times, to <strong>Ramana Maharshi</strong>, as a paragon in modern times.</p>
              <p>What later became known as <em>gnosis</em> would have been known in 
              Buddha’s times as jnana (ya-na); both mean “knowledge,” in the sense of 
              “wisdom,” and are evidently related words from the same root.</p>
              <p>The meaning of <em>jnana</em>, summarized in an encyclopedia, is the “<em>eradication </em>of
               the ignorance that sees the illusory multiplicity of the world as real,
               by attainment of knowledge of the Self [Absolute],” which is regarded 
              as “a single fundamental reality,” by the presence of which “there is no
               real distinction between the soul [or self] and God.”</p>

               a “spiritual philosopher” who reported a spontaneous enlightenment 
              experience, once made this statement—apparently independently, although 
              it could fit easily into The Gospel of Thomas:<span style="color: #ffcc00;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc00;">“Under every stone and leaf,

              <h2><span style="color: #ffcc00;">What led to writing “The Fifth Gospel” material?</span></h2>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc00;"><br> </span></p>
              <p>Over the years, I have casually collected material from a myriad of 
              sources that elucidated what can be known of what is called the 
              “historical Jesus”. My interest in the facts of Jesus’ life (and the 
              authenticity of his pronouncements) long predated my introduction to the
               non-Christian scriptures of the East, such as Buddhism, Taoism, and 
              Advaita. After all, I was raised (and baptized at 13) as a Baptist.</p>
              <p>When I first came across a translation of <strong>The Gospel of Thomas</strong>,
               I wanted to determine how that testament of Jesus’ “unknown” sayings 
              contributed to the overall picture of who Jesus was, and what he had 
              taught.</p>
              <p>A friend, a (now deceased) professor who retired to Australia, asked 
              me to write for him–from that unorganized file I had collected —what to 
              me appeared to be the answer to the question of how <strong>The Gospel of Thomas</strong> informed our understanding of the historical Jesus and his message.</p>
              <p>Originally I wrote only the section “Commentary on Verses” which gives my annotation on each aphorism in Thomas.</p>
              <p>The next question followed though: If these are authentic sayings of 
              Jesus, why were they not in public circulation until 1945? And another 
              significant question needed to be answered: Why would anyone conclude 
              that they are authentic scriptures?</p>
              <p><em>These questions led to writing “The Fifth Gospel” material.</em></p>
              <p>The value of my compilation, I feel, is that it may be of service in 
              drawing attention to the importance of not relegating the “gnostic” 
              Jesus to a dismissive category. There’s something of invaluable 
              significance that’s been overlooked, so far, in the academic and 
              scholarly biblical discussion. That’s why this manuscript was composed.</p>

               Robert’s travels he has labored as an auto assembly line worker in 
              Detroit, as a carnival worker, a journalist in New York City, on a farm 
              of a Zen community in California, as a landscaper, a financial 
              consultant, a janitor. After living in the Mendocino area for about 
              twenty years he bought a camper van and moved to a property in a redwood
               forest where he studied the inner life intensely.</p>
              <p>Something fell into place there after a number of years, and out of 
              that period of solitude, Robert began writing and sharing his 
              observations on the reality that surrounds and includes us. Shortly 
              afterwards, Robert moved to Ojai, California where he continues to live 
              and write.</p>
