              <p>Some say the dark age, age of vice, Kaliyuga, is here now, or at least 
              coming soon. Some even fear that at the end of 2012 the world as we know
               it will end. What determines if an age is dark or golden? What are the 
              symptoms or omens? Earthquakes, violet skies, meteoric activity, these 
              are not the omens of doomsday as we are made to believe. Likewise, 
              cherub's flying, a sound economy, freedom of information, peaceful times
               are also not necessarily signs of a golden age. The age of light is 
              said to be when people value empathy and forgiveness, when they have a 
              willingness to see other people's view, and are contented with what they
               have. When such values are systematically sabotaged, then you can say 
              that the dawn of the doomsday has begun. When we look at a harmless 
              beggar as a pest and envy billionaires who routinely destroy the 
              earth,we are inviting doomsday to come. <br><br>Like Buddha taught, 
              everything is dependant on cause and condition. Dark and golden ages are
               no exception. They are not predestined, nor are they random or chaotic.
               Destiny is conditioned, Chief among the causes and conditions is one's 
              own individual self, you can create your destiny. Your choices are your 
              destiny. What and how we are now depends on what and how we have been in
               the past. What and how we will be in the future depends on what and how
               we are now. <br><br>Shakyamuni with his lotus feet may approach your 
              doorstep for alms but if we keep on being obsessed with Patek Philipe 
              watches, fame or friends, or six pack abs, then Buddha's truth is an 
              annoyance, an inconvenient truth. <br><br>Even though we may be in midst
               of Kaliyuga and are subject to endless causes and conditions of the 
              dark age—easily distracted and confined to thinking of our own self 
              preservation, aspiring to reach benchmarks based on materialistic, 
              consumerist values—we can take advantage of it. It is said that during 
              the degenerate times, the compassion of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas 
              ever more stronger. A savvy spiritual person could take advantage of 
              that opportunity. The dark age can be a reminder of the urgency and 
              preciousness of the Buddha, dharma, and sangha.<br> <br>As beings that 
              are dependant on conditions, we need to search for light, and cultivate 
              the conditions that will brings light. We need constant reminding of the
               opposite of materialism. For that we need the image of the Buddha, the 
              sound of the dharma, and the structure of the sangha. <br><br>In the 
              past few years, we have lost some of the greatest appearances of the 
              Buddha, such as Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche, and Mindroling Trichen 
              Rinpoche and Penor Rinpoche, who were all great reminders. But even 
              though their appearance has dissolved, bear in mind that their 
              compassion does not know the meaning of limitations. <br><br>In the 
              spirit of where there is a demand, there is supply, we should have 
              aspirations and longing for the appearance of the Buddhas and 
              bodhisattvas to never to cease, and—to put it in a trendy term—their 
              swift rebirth. But this rebirth should not be limited to a Tibetan child
               who has been raised in a particular culture or tradition. We can wish 
              for Buddha's rebith in all forms, even as something seemingly 
              insignificant as the breeze, to remind us of the values of love and 
              compassion and tolerance. We must aspire to galvanize myriad 
              manifestations of the Buddha, not just throne-hopping, Rolls 
              Royce-driving tulkus who are a product of nepotism.<br> <br>DJKHYENTSE. 28/120012</p>

              <p>It doesn't matter whether it is golden or dark age. As the old saying goes :çœ¼çœ‹ä»–äººæ­»ï¼Œå¿ƒä¸­çƒ­å¦‚ç�«ï¼Œä¸�æ˜¯çƒ­ä»–äººï¼Œè½¬çœ¼è½®åˆ°æˆ‘ã€‚We don't need golden or dark age to remind us  the urgency of the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.</p>
              <p>Just look around us, we will feel the urgency just like the old Chinese saying : We feel the urgency whenever we see someone passed away as very soon it will be our turn to pass away.</p>
