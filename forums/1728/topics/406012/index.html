              <p>Lama Wangdor has spent more than 30 years meditating in the caves first used by Padmasambava, above Lotus Lake. Several years ago he began the project of constructing a massive Padmasambhava statue and center in the hills overlooking Tso Pema. The kind donations of many people within the Dharma community have allowed this construction project to make much progress, even though it will take years to complete. The statue's foundation alone has taken three years to construct. Among other benefits, the statue project has provided steady construction work for many people living in the Rewalsar area, as well as master artists from Nepal and Bhutan</p>
              <p>Few people realize that very, very little of the work on the statue is performed with heavy machinery. The statue itself is made of cement layered by hand over a skeleton of iron rebar. Stones for walls are cut by hand. Scaffolding is constructed from trunks of bamboo. The largest machine on site has been a cement mixer; materials such as cement and stones are ported onto the work site by laborers and packhorses. Bhutanese sculptors work the finer details into the cement while it is still wet</p>
              <p>A team of painters from Nepal came next, covering the statue in primer before applying final colors. While sprayers were used for larger parts of the statue, smaller areas were delicately filled in with brushes. Now the construction team is hard at work on the inside rooms and outlying buildings of the complex. A whole new batch of medicine pills and dzong have been made for the statues planned for the building's interior. Meanwhile, local Tibetans have been hard at work printing prayer flags to be hung later</p>

              <p>Wangdor Rimpoche is a Tibetan Buddhist monk and teacher (lama). Through decades of solitary meditation, retreats and practices he has achieved the state which Buddhists call realization and is respected worldwide as a venerable teacher and a master of "Direct Mind Perception" (Dzogchen) Meditation. Lama Wangdor has a profound commitment to making Buddhist philosophy and teachings accessible to everyone with a sincere interest. He has taught and given empowerments in Asia, Europe and the United States over the past two decades.</p>
              <p>He has spent more than 30 years meditating in the caves first used by the Tibetan saint, Padmasambava, above Lotus Lake (Tsol Pema) in the Himachal Pradesh region of Northern India. In solitary retreat during the early years, he was eventually joined over time by more than 50 cave-dwelling yogis and yoginis who look to him for guidance and support. Beginning in the 1970s, he constructed a monastery near the lake as well as a retreat center on the mountain, available to practitioners of all lineages and nationalities, projects which have taken nearly 20 years to complete.</p>
              <p>Wangdor Rimpoche holds both Nyingma and Kagyu Dzogchen/Chagchen lineages and is considered a Rime teacher. He teaches from heart texts on Dzogchen, the maha-ati and mahamudra yogas which he has received in lineage from Nambla Janchub Dorje, Kunu Rimpoche and Scholars Chonchok Sumon Khenpo of Trungpa Rimpoche's line; Tucksie Rimpoche and Pumdong Key Rimpoche.</p>
