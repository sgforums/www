              Thailand Find Growing Acceptance in the Face of Official Disapproval</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Craig Lewis Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2017-09-04 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
              entrenched opposition from within the conservative ranks of Buddhist
              officialdom that governs Thailand’s monastic community, the tiny but growing
              community of fully ordained female monastics in this Southeast Asian kingdom is
              steadily gaining recognition and respect and is increasingly viewed as
              occupying the forefront of a positive tide of change in a religious institution
              riven by reports of excess, corruption, and hypocrisy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Change
              is taking place in favor of female ordination, not only in Thailand but elsewhere
              in the world,” said Venerable Dhammananda Bhikkhuni, Thailand’s first fully
              ordained female monastic and something of a quiet figurehead for the movement.
              “Whatever the resistance from the establishment, more women will choose to
              pursue a spiritual path as female monastics. Nothing can stop it.”
              Predominantly a Buddhist country—93.2 per cent of Thailand’s population of 69
              million identify as Theravada Buddhists, according to data for 2010 from the
              Washington, DC-based Pew Research Center—Thailand is home to approximately
              38,000 Buddhist temples and an estimated 300,000 bhikkhus. However, Thailand
              has never officially recognized the full monastic ordination of women, and
              bhikkhunis do not generally enjoy the same level of societal acceptance as their
              male counterparts. By comparison, the Mahayana branch of Buddhist traditions
              widely practiced in East Asia have historically been much more accepting of
              female ordination.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet
              communities of female renunciants do exist and are growing across Thailand. There
              are currently more than 100 determined bhikkhunis who are committed to
              overturning the institutionalized chauvinism that stands in the way of female
              monasticism. Supported by more progressively minded bhikkhus, they seek to
              re-establish the fourfold sangha* envisioned by Shakyamuni Buddha as the
              optimal holistic and inclusive structure in which all segments of society can
              study and share the Dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Ven.
              Dhammananda ordained in Sri Lanka in 2013, becoming Thailand’s first bhikkhuni
              in the face of considerable public opposition. Formerly known as Chatsumarn
              Kabilsingh, an author and professor of religious studies and philosophy at a
              prominent Thai university, she states her case simply and with a gentle logic,
              noting that the Buddha himself founded the bhikkhuni order, which included his
              own adoptive mother. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“When
              the Buddha was enlightened and he established the Buddhist religion, he
              described the four pillars of the faith: bhikkhu, bhikkhuni, laymen, and
              laywomen,” she explains. “This was very clear in his mind and it is written in
              the historical texts, so it is not about equality as such, it is about what’s
              right. We are shareholders of the faith and simply upholding Buddha’s original
              vision.” (Huffington Post)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to historians, bhikkhunis flourished for 1,000 years in India and Sri Lanka,
              but the spread of Islam and the impact of various regional conflicts caused
              them to almost disappear. In Thailand, a proclamation by the kingdom’s Buddhist
              Sangha Supreme Council in 1928 expressly forbade female ordination. Instead,
              women in the country may only become white-robed nuns, known in Thai as maechi,
              who receive a much lower level of respect and recognition from society at
              large, and hold a rank comparable to that of a novice monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Yet
              amid a stream of media reports of scandalous exploits by misbehaving monks,
              there is a growing public voice warning that patience is beginning to wear thin
              and calling for reform. “There are many questions posed by the public that the
              Sangha has to answer,” notes Phramaha Boonchuay Doojai, a leading activist monk
              at Chiang Mai Buddhist College: “They cannot just sit quietly and hope issues
              like female ordination will fade away. It is not possible.” He warns that if
              the sangha’s bureaucracy continues to oppose bhikkhuni ordination, it could
              find itself at the wrong end of popular opinion after already drawing criticism
              for failing to curtail inappropriate behavior among the male monastic majority.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">International
              attention and support has also lent impetus to the movement in recent years,
              with organizations such as the Network of Asian Theravada Bhikkhunis and the
              Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women adding weight to the
              growing consensus. In Thailand, Songdhammakalyani Monastery in the central town
              of Nakhon Pathom, of which Ven. Dhammananda is the abbot, has become an
              international center for the training of female Buddhist clergy.</span></p>

              elsewhere in the world,” said Ven. Dhammananda with optimism. “Whatever the

              path as female monastics. Nothing can stop it.”</span><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;"> </span></p>
