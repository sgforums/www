              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shuyin Buddhistdoor Global | 2018-05-07 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With a wasted body and listless eyes, 37-year-old Pyu stares
              into space. Soon his prolonged battle with tuberculosis will be over. The faint
              chanting of Buddhist monks can be heard in the distance, as if to soothe his
              tormented spirit. Yet Pyu’s mind is not appeased. How can he have a “good”
              death when he knows not what will happen to his aged mother, his wife, and two
              children? Furthermore, how will they manage his funeral with no money and no
              help? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In Buddhist Myanmar, funerals are of the utmost importance.
              But for too many poor Burmese families, especially those living in Yangon, the
              cost of even a simple funeral is beyond their means. Many resort to taking out
              high-interest loans, or secretly burying their dead in a field. With escalating
              costs and widespread land grabbing in recent years, times are hard for both the
              living and the dead. As 80-year-old Ma Moe laments: “It is costly even to die.
              If I’m going to die, I’ll go back to my village. If I die there, at least the
              community will help with the funeral. I don’t want my children to owe a lot of
              debt because of my funeral.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“Most people are desperately poor in this country,” says Kyaw
              Thu, a burly bearded man with a grey ponytail. “Traditional funeral costs are
              on average about US$7,500, according to a 2014 survey, and that does not
              include cemetery costs in Yangon, which will easily cost around another
              US$2,000. A typical funeral and burial costs run to at least US$9,000. And
              undertakers expect to be paid in full at the time of the funeral. That is
              impossibly unaffordable for many people.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">No one understands the cost of dying in Myanmar better than
              Kyaw Thu. For the last 15 years, he has conducted thousands of funerals, served
              as hearse driver, pallbearer, consoled the bereaved and provided for the needy.
              For him, it is all part of a day’s work, yet his very presence at the funerals
              usually causes quite a stir. After all, he was once regarded as the Marlon
              Brando of Myanmar, with more than 200 films and two Myanmar Academy Awards to
              his credit (one for best actor in Da-Byi-Thu Ma Shwe Hta A in 1994 and one for
              best director on Amay No Bo in 2003). These days, however, he is more likely to
              be found inspecting hearses at the Free Funeral Service Society’s (FFSS)
              headquarters in Yangon’s Thingangyune Township. But be it as a screen idol or
              president and co-founder of one of Myanmar’s largest NGOs providing free
              funeral services for the poor, the charismatic Kyaw Thu is still immensely popular
              with the masses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Kyaw Thu’s dice with the dead was cast one day when a
              prominent monk told his daughter about the dire fate that awaits actors after
              they die. “The monk said that this is because actors play with people’s
              emotions, make them laugh, cry, and feel anger during their movies. This is not
              in line with Buddhist virtues, so they will be reborn in the lower realms,”
              Kyaw Thu recounted. The monk’s words jolted Kyaw Thu into reviewing his life
              and what he was doing. One day, while visiting his mentor, the late movie
              director Thuka, in hospital, Kyaw Thu learned of the plight of the old woman in
              the next bed. “Her family visited her daily until the doctor pronounced that
              they should take her home because there was nothing else he could for her,” he
              recalled. “Then the family stopped coming to the hospital and the woman died
              alone and was buried in a common grave. We later learned that they had
              abandoned her because they did not have money to pay for her funeral.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As a devout Buddhist, Kyaw Thu, like his mentor Thuka,
              believes that funeral rites are important as they signify the passage into the
              next life. Moved by the plight of the poor, the two decided to set up a free
              funeral service to help the needy honor their loved ones with a dignified and
              proper funeral. On 1 January 2001, the FFSS was founded. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The early years of the FFSS were fraught with difficulties.
              For a start, there were cultural superstitions to overcome. It was not easy to
              recruit workers and volunteers, as many Burmese believe that working with the
              dead is lowly and unlucky. In some neighborhoods, street signs reading “no
              hearses allowed” are put up to discourage hearses from driving through. Some in
              the film industry ostracized Kyaw Thu. His show-business friends were shocked
              that he carried coffins at funerals and some even refused to co-star with him.
              In 2007, Kyaw Thu’s acting career suffered another blow. He was accused of
              supporting the Saffron Revolution after donating food to protesting monks,
              and was arrested and banned from the film industry. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But like the revolutionary heroes he has portrayed on screen,
              iron-willed Kyaw Thu took it all in stride, and even saw it as a blessing
              because it allowed him to dedicate his time fully to the FFSS and helping
              people. “The people’s tears are your tears. The people’s happiness is your
              happiness. As long as you have a compassionate heart, you can feel for the
              people,” he observed. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With his perseverance and energetic drive for social change,
              Kyaw Thu has won the support of many public figures, including Aung San Suu
              Kyi. All FFSS services are funded by private donations and heavily supported by
              volunteers. To date, the FFSS has conducted more than 150,000 free funerals,
              serving those in need regardless of class, race, or religion. With a staff of
              more than 100, and 500 volunteers, the society handles about 40–50 funerals
              daily, taking full responsibility from collecting the body and renting a
              funeral van, to providing a coffin and meeting all the expenses for the
              mortuary and cremation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The FFSS has since expanded beyond its core service of
              providing free funerals to include medical, educational, and many other social
              services. The Thu Ka Charity Clinic, which has about 50 volunteer doctors and
              100 paid staff, provides free medical care ranging from eye surgery to kidney
              dialysis for some 100 patients daily. The FFSS also operates a 24-hour
              emergency response service with a fleet of ambulances, and runs a charity
              school for children from poor families providing free vocational training such
              as IT and hospitality. In addition, it is involved in humanitarian relief, such
              as providing aid after Cyclone Nargis, and a range of environmental and healthcare
              programs. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In 2015, Kyaw Thu won the Ramon Magsaysay Award, for “his
              generous compassion in addressing the fundamental needs of both the living and
              the dead in Myanmar—regardless of their class or religion—and his channeling
              personal fame and privilege to mobilize many others toward serving the greater
              social good.”On receiving the award, a modest Kyaw Thu said, “I got this prize
              not only because of me but also the unity of donors, volunteers, and staff all
              together.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Kyaw Thu’s immense popularity with the masses and their
              support of the FFSS has, as expected, led some to be wary of his political
              ambitions. But as he expressed in a post-award interview, “I don’t want that
              dirty political life. But in my social work, I can really do things and reach
              out to the people with a true heart.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Kyaw Thu is also quick to emphasize that the FFSS is not a
              political engine: “We don’t distinguish between religions, between enemies and
              friends. We help all sorts of people.” Through the years, the FFSS has buried
              everyone from pro-democracy activists to army-linked elite politicians. In
              early 2017, the FFSS provided funeral assistance to U Ko-Ni, a prominent Muslim
              lawyer and strong proponent of inter-religious harmony, who was assassinated at
              Myanmar International Airport, and U Nay Win, the taxi driver who was shot dead
              while chasing the attacker. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Work at the FFSS has changed this once-celebrated film star’s
              outlook on life and work. “After witnessing and experiencing many happenings in
              my life, I have come to know more about the value of life,” he explained. “As
              an actor, I used to crave publicity and chased money and fame, but now I want
              nothing but to help those in need.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After years of waiting on the dead, Kyaw Thu is ready to
              stare his own death in the face: “I am not afraid of dying. Death is our
              inescapable destination. We all are on the path to death, whether rich or poor,
              famous or unknown. When you die, you cannot take your wealth and fame. We leave
              nothing behind except our good deeds. So we should do as many good deeds as we
              can while we are still breathing. The rest will take care of itself.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For this legendary hero of Myanmar, life has no regrets.
              Baring his left arm, he reveals a tattoo that reads: “Hey! Walk your own path.
              Do your own duty. Fulfill your own obligations. Be guided by your own virtue.
              Write your own history. That’s all. Kyaw Thu.”</span></p>
