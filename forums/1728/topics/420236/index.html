              <div class="mbl notesBlogText clearfix">
              <div>
              <p>I'm
                                       at home. The washing up is being done. All that exists in the universe 
                                      is the chinking of plates, the glistening of bubbles, and the <em>whoooossshhh </em>of water as it shoots out of the tap. The washing of dishes fills all available space.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This bowl is particularly dirty. It's covered in dried breakfast cereal and will take ages to clean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The
                                       phone rings. The bowl is put down, rubber gloves are removed, and 
                                      kitchen is replaced by living room. Kitchen sink and dirty dishes are 
                                      replaced by sofa and table and phone. “Hello?”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A voice appears out of nowhere. “Hey Jeff!”. It's my friend calling from London. But the sound of his voice happens <em>here</em>, in the room with the sofa and the phone, not ‘<em>out there</em>’ in the world. My friend isn’t in <em>London</em>, he is <em>here </em>with me. He meets me in this ever-present intimacy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He
                                       tells me some good news – he has found a new job. This news is good, in
                                       his world. And because in this moment his world is my world, this news 
                                      is good for me too. We share our good fortune, together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nobody here, nobody there. And still, the response comes: “Wow, that's great news!” and it's not even like I'm acting. I really <em>mean </em>what
                                       I say, when I say it. Love does not reject anything, love does not put 
                                      on an act or a show to please people, love does not posture and pretend 
                                      just to win approval. No, love dances, love plays, love embraces, for 
                                      the sheer joy of it, and so the words come: “Wow, that's great news!”. I
                                       know he's worked so hard to get this new job and there is only 
                                      celebration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We arrange a time to meet next week for coffee and I scribble down the details on a piece of paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The
                                       conversation ends. I put down the phone and go back into the kitchen 
                                      and continue to scrub away at the hardened cereal. The hands move, the 
                                      water runs, and a pile of dirty washing up is replaced by carefully 
                                      stacked plates and saucers and knives and spoons, sparkling in the 
                                      sunlight streaming in from the window. There is only gratitude for the 
                                      washing up liquid, the rubber gloves and the sunlight that illuminates 
                                      it all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Celebration for my friend’s good news, gratitude 
                                      for the rubber gloves, what's the difference here? All sparkling, 
                                      shimmering appearances in the play of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I need to 
                                      urinate. Quicker than a flash, a toilet appears. That's amazing. Need 
                                      for urination arises, toilet appears. This is a perfectly synchronised 
                                      play. Needs are always met, somehow. Contraction, expansion. Tension, 
                                      release. The heartbeat of the universe, and it's all so ordinary in its 
                                      appearance. Amazing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whilst I'm drying my hands I notice 
                                      that the bath needs cleaning, desperately. Well, there's no time like 
                                      the present! Now all there is, is total absorption with cleaning the 
                                      bath. Spiritual awakening? Oneness? Advaita? Nonduality? No, no, no. Not
                                       that. The bath needs to be cleaned! This scum must be removed! It's a 
                                      matter of life and death!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I finish with the bath, go back 
                                      into the kitchen and notice that the washing up has been done. What a 
                                      wonderful surprise! I'd forgotten it had been done. I grab a drink of 
                                      water and go back into the living room. I see that there are some notes 
                                      scribbled on a pad of paper about meeting my friend next week. Oh yes, 
                                      another wonderful surprise! Life is flowering everywhere, it is simply 
                                      bursting at the seams: in the kitchen, in the bathroom, in the living 
                                      room, and even in somewhere called “London”. It's absolutely everywhere.
                                       It cannot be contained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What an adventure I've had in the
                                       past few hours! And all I did was move between my kitchen, bathroom and
                                       living room. There is so much to see and do here. How rich this life 
                                      is. And there is more to explore....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To the world, doing the washing up and cleaning the bath is <em>nothing</em>. When seen in clarity, it's <em>everything</em>. When you ask me “what did you do today?” I'll tell you that <em>'I did the washing up, cleaned the bath and spoke to my friend in London’</em>,
                                       when of course what really happened, beyond the story (and how I love 
                                      the story!) is that the dishes washed themselves, the bath cleaned 
                                      itself and there was nobody on the phone a friend in London. What really
                                       happened was <em>adventure </em>- what really happened was <em>intimacy </em>with all things. The story didn't happen - life happened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The story is only a pale imitation of the celebration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've
                                       been having a secret love affair with life, you see, and nobody will 
                                      ever know. I've been intimate with the plates and spoons, with the 
                                      washing up liquid, with the bath tub and the cleaning products, with the
                                       sound of my friend's voice and the sunlight streaming in from the 
                                      kitchen window. I've been intimate with the carpet, with the walls, with
                                       the oven and the fridge, with the toilet and the phone and the cute 
                                      little spider I found crawling up the side of the radiator. Nobody can 
                                      take this intimacy away from me. Nobody. No power in the world can 
                                      threaten it. It's my little secret that isn't really a secret at all. It
                                       is life itself, and it is always right here.</p>

              <div class="mbs mbs uiHeaderSubTitle lfloat fsm fwn fcg">by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/LifeWithoutACentre">Jeff Foster</a> on Friday, January 7, 2011 at 10:21am</div>
              </div>
              <div class="mbl notesBlogText clearfix">
              <div>
              <p>I find myself outside a supermarket. How did I get here? I don't remember. Do I need to buy anything? I don't know. Yet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh look - the feet are moving. Follow the feet...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find myself staring at coffee. Do I need coffee? I can’t remember. Maybe I just enjoy <em>looking</em> at coffee. The hand reaches out to grab a lovely blue packet. I start to read the blurb on the back.<em> “A sweet blend of Latin American coffees with a smooth, full bodied flavour that can be enjoyed from dawn to dusk.”</em>  Wonderful! The eyes dart over to another brand. I've lost interest in this <em>sweet blend of Latin American coffees with a smooth, full bodied flavour</em> and have become fascinated with the coffee with the funny-looking purple parrot on the front.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moments
                                       later I'm in the shampoo aisle. How did I get here? I must have lost 
                                      interest in the coffee and remembered that I needed shampoo. Oh, look at
                                       all those different colours! Greens, pinks, reds, oranges. They all 
                                      want my attention. They are all calling to me in their own unique way. 
                                      This isn't shopping, this is a mating ritual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I read the blurb on the back of each bottle. I love doing this. Each bottle is a different world, a different universe. <em>“Great Hair, No Fuss!” “Put Shine and Dazzle Back Into Dry Hair!”</em> In the blink of an eye, five, ten, twenty minutes have gone by. It was 
                                      six o'clock and now it's twenty minutes past six and I find that I'm 
                                      still comparing shampoos. In the past, by now I would have been thinking
                                       “Jeff, you weirdo, get a life!”. There would have been a voice there, a
                                       narrator, constantly evaluating and judging Jeff and comparing him to 
                                      others. These days, there is no interest in 'conforming'. Who says you 
                                      can't fall in love with shampoo bottles?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a flash, I 
                                      notice that I'm in the vegetable aisle, and that there is a shampoo 
                                      bottle in my basket. That must be the one  I 'chose'. Haha, yes, the 
                                      illusion of choice!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I start surveying the vegetables. 
                                      Carrots, onions, leeks. The hand moves to pick out some potatoes. This 
                                      one is nice. This one is... ooh, it's got some funny white bits coming 
                                      out of it, I'll give it a miss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am nothing. The potatoes
                                       are everything. I disappear into the potatoes. I am the potatoes 
                                      picking themselves. I am Mr Potato Head.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A young man starts talking to me in the milk and dairy aisle. He asks “<em>are you from round here?</em>”.
                                       For a moment the knowledge is not there. Then suddenly the knowledge 
                                      comes: Jeff lived in Brighton for two years! But it's too late, he's 
                                      already talking. <em>“Do you know any cheap bed and breakfasts round here?”</em> I reply <em>“well there's plenty on the seafront, and I think there's a very cheap one in the town centre.”</em> 
                                       I don't know where the words come from. He mutters something under his 
                                      breath and then begins to rant and rave about how much he hates 
                                      Brighton, even though he's only been here for two days. His face becomes
                                       red and he starts to pant like a dog. He lets me know what an awful 
                                      place Brighton is, how unfriendly the people are, how it's full of<em> “gays and prostitutes and spiritual weirdos.</em>”
                                       I don't agree and I don't disagree, I just listen and watch. He's just 
                                      telling his story. If I was attached to Brighton I can imagine how his 
                                      story might offend me. But I'm not, and it doesn't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He 
                                      finishes his rant, I offer him some useful information about hostels in 
                                      Brighton, then the body turns, and the legs begin to move. Where are 
                                      they going?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bread! The angry man is wiped out and now I'm 
                                      in the bread aisle, and the smell of freshly baked bread is so heavenly,
                                       and it's totally free. Taste, touch, smell, they don't cost a penny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A
                                       couple next to me are arguing. The man wants a large pack of bagels, 
                                      the woman says they need to save money and buy the smaller one. A 
                                      thought pops up: if this man and woman could just falll in love with the
                                       bagels, there wouldn't be a problem. If they could just fall in love 
                                      with the coffee, the shampoo, the potatoes, the brightly coloured signs 
                                      and fluorescent lighting, with the people who hate Brighton and the 
                                      people who love it, with the smell of freshly baked bread, the screaming
                                       of babies and the weight of shopping baskets, with the shape and 
                                      texture and colour of everything, then there wouldn't be a problem ever 
                                      again. If these people could just <em>die</em>, right here and right now, then like newborn babies they would see all of this for the first time, and it would amaze them.<strong> For we are surrounded by wonder, always.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I
                                       leave the store and walk home. The entire experience – the coffee, the 
                                      shampoo, the angry man - is reduced to a memory, and the memory becomes a
                                       single thought, and the single thought dissolves into the vastness. Did
                                       it ever happen? I don't know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is like a constant 
                                      death. Death of everything that's gone before. Death of the old. In 
                                      every moment you wave goodbye to the coffee, the shampoo, the angry man,
                                       the potatoes, and you meet life face to face for the first time. You 
                                      cling to none of it, and in return you are given <strong>everything</strong>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's the deal.</p>
