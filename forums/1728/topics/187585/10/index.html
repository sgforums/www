First, are you supporting AEN or refuting AEN with the following article about Quantum Computer and Quantum Entanglement?  And which aspect of quantum mechanics (the link you provided) do you want people to acknowledge that is supporting you?  I remembered asking you do you consider quantum entanglement phenomenon as mere fantasy but received no reply.<br><strong><br>Â“You are very quick to accept any speculation, any suggestions.... let me cut and paste what I posted at the Christian forum for you here.Â”<br></strong><br>Do tell me what speculations and suggestions I have accepted and what I have suggested in my earlier post:<br><strong><br>Perhaps if we were to live in the 17th centuries applying the Newtonian viewpoint, what you said might still be acceptable in the scientific community. Unfortunately, we donÂ’t. In light of quantum mechanics and neuroscience, I think that is a bold statement and you may want to substantiate it with some valid scientific findings.<br></strong><br><br>It is alright to speak your mind and I do want you to speak what you think but I do not want to engage in a tongue fight.  Since any form of experience is subjective and personal, it will be quite irrelevant to make objective claims about what one has experienced.  It is an individual path.  Your earlier reply to my topic on imaginary numbers is respectable and measured.  I believe besides telling you to delve deeper into the core teachings of Buddhism and a little about mental detachment is important for scientific spirit, I have not spoken any other materials about Buddhism to you.  This is because I respect what Buddha taught and I do not want to make it a topic of argument.  Anyway, happy exploring. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
