            <div class='col-md body'>To add on to my previous post on Buddhism and Science on 28 April 2006 Â· 03:30 PM -<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....Nowadays physicists explain phenomena do not exist objectively in and of themselves but exists in the context of involvement with an observer. I feel that the relation between matter and consciousness is a place where eastern philosophy and western science could meet. I think this would be a happy marriage with no divorce. If we work along the lines of a joint effort by Buddhist scholars with experience in meditation and unbiased physicists to engage in a deeper research in the relation between matter and consciousness, we may find beautiful things which may be helpful. Also those scientists working on the human brain working on the field of neurology could benefit from the Buddhist explanations about consciousness. Some time ago, I asked a neurologist how memory functions. He reported they still have not found a concrete explanation. So in this field too we can work together. Some western medical professionals are also interested in curing certain illnesses through meditation. This is another interesting topic for joint project. Because of Buddhism's emphasis on self-creation, there is no Creator deity. Thus some consider it strictly speaking not a religion. A western scholar told me Buddhism is not a religion. It is a kind of science of mind. In this sense Buddhism does not belong to the category of religion. I consider this to be unfortunate. But in some sense Buddhism becomes closer to science. However from the scientists' viewpoint, Buddhism is a spiritual path. It is unfortunate that we do not seem to belong to science either. Buddhism thereby belongs to neither religion nor pure science. But this provides us an opportunity to make a bridge between faith and science. This is why I believe in the future we will work at bringing these two forces together. The majority of people ignore religion. But among those who do not, there is on one side of group who are experiencing the values of a spiritual path. On the other is a group who are denying any value to religion. As a result there is constant conflict between these factions. If one way or another we can help bring these two forces closer, it would be worthwhile....</span><br><br>- The Dalai Lama, Meaning of Life 3-4<br><br>Pls also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=165203" rel="nofollow">NeuroScience and Buddhism</a></div>

The understanding capacity of the value of these religious ideas may diminish and disappear from ManÂ’s Mind. And Man may experience the difficulty of practicing these principles in a corrupted society. However, the value of the BuddhaÂ’s teaching will be appreciated by every cultured and understanding person at any time. As complimented by Albert Einstein (Physicist and Mathematician), winner of the Nobel Prize, who is popularly regarded as the most outstanding scientist of the twentieth century,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion. It should transcend a personal God and avoid dogmas and theology. Covering both the natural and the spiritual, it should be based on a religious sense arising from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual and a meaningful unity.

It is also pointless for you to debate on something that you are not sure of or have no knowledge about - i.e Shariras. All you have to do is to follow the guidelines of the Buddha to the Kalamas. <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=188005" rel="nofollow">Dogmatism? Blind Faith? The Kalamas are Disillusioned</a>. I am also starting to see how it is wrong to debate in this way because people's ignorance is endless and a person will never see light when his mind is delusioned. It is only through the learning of dharma and practise of dharma that they will gradually understand. A buddhist also do not need to be concerned about the supernatural - what is more important is your buddhist cultivation right now, and living a virtuous and wholesome life with lasting hapiness.<br><br>Third post:<br>[quote].....Conviction in a belief can take various forms. One form reasons according to Dhamma, while another form is contrary to the Dhamma. This second way is heedless, it is a foolhardy understanding, micchaditthi, wrong view. One doesn't listen to anybody else.<br><br>Take the example of Dighanakha the Brahmin. This Brahmin only believed himself, he wouldn't believe others. At one time when the Buddha was resting at Rajagaha, Dighanakha went to listen to his teaching. Or you might say that Dighanakha went to teach the Buddha, because he was intent on expounding his own views ...<br><br>"I am of the view that nothing suits me."<br>This was his view. The Buddha listened to DighanakhaÂ’s view and then answered,<br><br>"Brahmin, this view of yours doesn't suit you either." When the Buddha had answered in this way, Dighanakha was stumped. He didn't know what to say. The Buddha explained in many ways, till the Brahmin understood. He stopped to reflect and saw...<br><br>"Hmm, this view of mine isn't right."<br>On hearing the Buddha's answer the Brahmin abandoned his conceited views and immediately saw the truth. He changed right then and there, turning right around, just as one would invert one's hand. He praised the teaching of the Buddha thus:<br><br>"Listening to the Blessed One's teaching, my mind was illumined, just as one living in darkness might perceive light. My mind is like an overturned basin which has been up righted, like a man who has been lost and finds the way."<br><br>Now at that time a certain knowledge arose within his mind, within that mind which had been up righted. Wrong view vanished and right view took its place. Darkness disappeared and light arose.<br><br>The Buddha declared that the Brahmin Dighanakha was one who had opened the Dhamma Eye. Previously Dighanakha clung to his own views and had no intention of changing them. But when he heard the Buddha's teaching his mind saw the truth, he saw that his clinging to those views was wrong. When the<br>right understanding arose he was able to perceive his previous understanding as mistaken, so he compared his experience with a person living in darkness who had found light. This is how it is. At that time the Brahmin Dighanakha transcended his wrong view.....<span style="font-style: italic;">....But no matter how much studies and research - is it able to convince people from other faiths? Especially in the field of 'Spirituality'. Maybe not. Many ppl, including Atheists, or from other Faiths, will have trouble accepting these truths (i.e Darwin's theory of evolution?). <strong>That is because of their dogmatism, lack of open mindedness. Prove is already out there - but if you are dogmatic, you will never be able to accept it.</strong> The ultimate proof that will clear ALL doubts, not even single one remaining, is through Enlightenment itself. Prior to that it is still OK to have doubts, as long as your doubt does not become a Fetter and Obstruction to your path.....</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br>....Dogmas - religious, political, scientific - arise out of the erroneous belief that thought can encapsulate reality or the truth. Dogmas are collective conceptual prisons. And the strange thing is that people love their prison cells becuase they give them a sense of security and a false sense of "I know."<br><br>Nothing has inflicted more suffering on humanity than its dogmas. It is true that every dogma crumbles sooner or later, because reality will eventually disclose its falseness; however, <strong>unless the basic delusion of it is seen for what it is, it will be replaced by others.</strong><br><br>What is this basic delusion? Identification with thought......<br><br>- Eckhart Tolle, Stillness Speaks</blockquote>I am not an enlightened person, or a Buddha who can open your dharma eye to remove the root of delusion.<br><br>In this case, it is not a religious dogma, but the dogma ridden with scepticism that nothing spiritual exist in the world. That is a very limited viewpoint and is because a person cannot transcend mundane logic - much like those 400 years ago who would not have believed if you were to tell them the Earth is round.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Lastly, because I can sense that there is some attachment to scepticism on your part, may I suggest that you read thoroughly the new topic I have created - Dogmatism? Blind Faith? The Kalamas are Disillusioned. There is no need for me to prove anything on the forum.<br><br>As seen in the topic 'Dogmatism? Blind Faith? The Kalamas are Disillusioned', true contemplatives do not need to depend on scientific reports. If it were otherwise, for 2500 years, of which a large period of time there is lack of modern science, nobody would have become enlightened. Buddhism is not a religion, neither is it just a philosophy or an academic subject. It reveals truths beyond theories and comprehension of the mind. <strong>A person of high caliber (as have been seen in Albert Einstein) will not limit himself solely to science to understand the universe -- not everything is measurable and quantifiable. There is absolutely no need for us to prove anything - if we cultivate the dharma we will see for ourselves.</strong><br><br>May you be enlightened.</span></div>
