            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by casino_king:<br>[b]<br><br>This goes straight to the credibility of Buddhism. What is Buddhism if not for the supernatural claims? It becomes like Confusionism.</blockquote>Wrong. I have respect for Confucianism. It is a great philosophy. But it only dealt with worldly and moral issues. Buddhism isn't just about worldly and moral issues, but more importantly also on attaining the Wisdom of Liberation, the wisdom into the clear seeing of the nature of reality.<br><br><blockquote>Attain the state of Nibena. That is a supernatural state. What evidence did the Buddhist produced to show that this supernatural state is only imaginary and not backed up by evidence? None.</blockquote>Nirvana is not a supernatural state. In fact it is not even a state to begin with, because state implies a conditioned mental phenomena - that which Nirvana is not. There can be an endless list to what Nirvana is Not, but to assert what Nirvana is, is much more difficult. It is liberated bliss beyond conditionings, beyond time and space, etc. In fact it is very very simple - so simple that it doesn't even make sense to a usual mind!<br><br>Time and space is relative and only known in the analytical mind. In this moment, without any analysis and thoughts, just pure awareness, you have already transcended time and space.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But have you attained Nirvana? Not yet.... immediately you returned back to Samsara.<br><br>If you can, grab a copy of 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle. Such concepts will become clearer to you as you read. It is also very inspiring and transformative. It is not very philosophical and does not contain much belief systems so people like you should be able to read it. When you are stressed/depressed you can also read it. Eckhart Tolle is a mystic however he does not come from the Buddhist tradition. He does not come from any traditions, in fact. However he does quote Buddha, Jesus, Bhagavad Gita (Hindu), Tao Te Ching (Taoist) from time to time.<br><br><blockquote>Eckhart Tolle is emerging as one of the most original and inspiring spiritual teachers of our time. He travels and teaches throughout the world.<br><br>Eckhart is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition, but excludes none. His profound yet simple and practical teachings have helped thousands of people find inner peace and greater fulfillment in their lives. At the core of his teachings lies the transformation of individual and collective human consciousness - a global spiritual awakening.<br><br>Eckhart was born in Germany and educated at the Universities of London and Cambridge. At the age of twenty-nine, a profound spiritual transformation virtually dissolved his old identity and radically changed the course of his life. The next few years were devoted to understanding, integrating and deepening that transformation and marked the beginning of an intense inward journey. Later, he began to work with individuals and small groups as a counselor and spiritual teacher.<br><br>Eckhart Tolle is the author of The Power of Now, a #1 New York Times best-seller which has been widely recognized as one of the most influential spiritual books of our time. It has been translated into over 30 languages.</blockquote>Also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=185686" rel="nofollow">Eckhart Tolle</a><br><br>I am not a dharma teacher. You need to find an enlightened teacher to guide you. It is truly possible.<br><br><blockquote>Buddhas, like the Christain God is also in hiding.

And of course in the other gospels known as the Gnostic gospels like Gospel of Thomas, it has a lot of wisdom of mysticism which have similarities to the teachings of Buddhism. Uncountable mystics have already attained the same sort of realisations - not only in Christian mysticism, but also the Islam Sufi (islamic mysticism), Taoism, Hindus, New Age etc etc. Lots more.
