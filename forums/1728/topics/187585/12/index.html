But its techniques are DIFFERENT from those that you more often know. Like I said, don't confuse Biology with Physics, Chemistry with Arts.

Why do I say scientific? Because Buddha's way of teaching is scientific. Even when compared to other systems of Mystic contemplative systems like Christian Mysticism, Islamic Sufism, Hindu, Taoism, New Age etc - no other religions had that kind of 'scientific' approach. Other mystical traditions tend to personify their mystical realisations/experiences of divinity/pure consciousness (i.e Christ within - union with God), and in terms of clarity falls still fall short of Buddha's level of understanding - although what they realised is also not different Buddhism, it is a stage whereby a contemplative will have to go through. Buddhism also provides a Systematic way of experiencing reality. What I meant by systematic and scientific - for example, in modern science, we will say: Given any event E1, there is an Event E2 that follows E1 after time interval T1, we can say that E1 is the cause of E2.... the causality aspect, this is, that is.. this exists, that exists. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Now, compare it with Buddhism - the teaching that started more than 2500 years ago. We learn about the <a href="http://www.pcddallas.org/The_12_Links_of_Interdependent_Origination.htm" rel="nofollow">12 Links of Interdependant Origination</a>, etc. By 'reversing' and eliminating the Interdependant Origination Links of Origination one may again arrive at the point where there is no more trace of ignorance. Buddha's method of teaching is very systematic throughout. It also ensures no confusion among practitioners and that everyone will be able to arrive at the same grounds at the end of their path.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Samsara is like a sickness; the Buddha, who was called the Great Physician,<br><br>offers a cure; but the patient must recognize the illness, with its causes, its symptoms, and its effects, before the cure can begin.</span> - <a href="http://www.pcddallas.org/The_12_Links_of_Interdependent_Origination.htm" rel="nofollow">12 Links of Interdependant Origination</a></div></blockquote><blockquote>But you people say things that sounds so good...

Doesn't mean Buddhists will not accept if science were to disproof what Buddha said - but what I meant is Buddhism is completely compatible with modern science.<br><br>Lastly I do see your point and I do agree with what you and concerned_man suggested:<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by concerned_man:<div class="quote_body">hmm....<br><br>I still stand for this:<br>To bend our faith to fit the facts than to bend the facts to fit the faith.<br><br>Amitabha<br><br></div></div>

When I was doing elementary particle physics there was a theory that required for its proof the existence of what was called the 'W' particle. At the cyclotron in Geneva, CERN funded a huge research project, smashing atoms together with an enormous particle accelerator, to try and find one of these 'W' particles. They spent literally hundreds of millions of pounds on this project. They found one, just one 'W' particle. I don't think they have found another since. But once they found one 'W' particle, the researchers involved in that project were given Nobel prizes for physics. They had proved the theory by just finding the one 'W' particle. That's good science. Just one is enough to prove the theory.<br><br>When it comes to things we don't like to believe, they call just one experience, one clear factual undeniable experience, an anomaly. Anomaly is a word in science for disconcerting evidence that we can put in the back of a filing cabinet and not look at again, because it's threatens our worldview. It undermines what we want to believe. It is threatening to our dogma. However, an essential part of the scientific method is that theories have to be abandoned in favour of the evidence, in respect of the facts. The point is that the evidence for a mind independent of the brain is there. But once we admit that evidence, and follow the scientific method, then many cherished theories, what we call 'sacred cows' will have to be abandoned.<br><br>When we see something that challenges any theory, in science or in religion, we should not ignore the evidence. We have to change the theory to fit the facts. That is what we do in Buddhism. All the Dhamma of the Buddha, everything that he taught, if it does not fit the experience, then we should not accept it. We should not accept the Buddha's words in contradiction of experience. That is clearly stated in the Kālāma Sutta. (AN III, 65) The Buddha said do not believe because it is written in the books, or even if I say it. Don't just believe because it is tradition, or because it sounds right, or because it's comforting to you. Make sure it fits your experience. The existence of mind, independent of the brain, fits experience. The facts are there.<br><br>Sometimes, however, we cannot trust the experts. You cannot trust Ajahn Brahm. You cannot trust the scientific journals. Because people are often biased. Buddhism gives you a scientific method for your practice. Buddhism says, do the experiment and find out for your self if what the Buddha said is true or not. Check out your experience. For example, develop the method to test the truth of past lives, rebirth and reincarnation. Don't just believe it with faith, find out for yourself. The Buddha has given a scientific experiment that you can repeat.<br><br>Until you understand the law of kamma, which is part of Buddhism, kamma is just a theory. Do you believe that there is a God 'up there' who decides when you can be happy or unhappy? Or is everything that happens to you just chance? Your happiness and your suffering in life, your joy, your pain and disappointments, are they deserved? Are you responsible or is it someone else's fault? Is it mere chance that we are rich or poor? Is it bad luck when we are sick and die at a young age? Why? You can find the true answer for yourself. You can experience the law of kamma through deep meditation. When the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, the two knowledge's he realized just before his Enlightenment were the knowledge from experience of the truth of rebirth, and the knowledge from experience of the Law of kamma. This was not theory, not just more thinking, not something worked out from discussions around the coffee table this was realization from deep experience of the nature of mind. You too can have that same experience.<br><br>All religions in the world except Buddhism maintain the existence of a soul. They affirm a real 'self', an 'essence of all being', a 'person', a 'me'. Buddhism says there is no self! Who is right? What is this 'ghost in the machine'? Is it a soul, is it a being, or is it a process? What is it? When the Buddha said that there is no one in here, he never meant that to be just believed, he meant that to be experienced. The Buddha said, as a scientific fact, that there is no 'self'. But like any scientific fact, it has to be experienced each one for themselves, paccattam veditabbo viÃ±Ã±ūhī. Many of you chant those Pāli words every day. It is basic scientific Buddhism. You have to keep an open mind. You don't believe there is 'no self', you don't believe there is a 'self' both beliefs are dogmatism. Keep an open mind until you complete the experiment. The experiment is the practice of sila, samādhi and paÃ±Ã±a, (virtue, meditation and insight). The experiment is Buddhist practice. Do the same experimental procedures that the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. Repeat it and see if you get the same results. The result is called Enlightenment.<br><br>Men and women have repeated that experiment many times over the centuries. It is in the laboratory of Buddhist practice that the Enlightened Ones, the Arahants, arise. The Arahants are the ones who have done the experiment and found the result. That's why Buddhism always has been the scientific way. It is the way of finding out for your self the truth of Enlightenment.</div></blockquote></div>
