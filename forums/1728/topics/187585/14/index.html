That is the path to a spiritual life. The schools teach different ways or paths... some by purifying the mind; some by doing good and avoiding evil.<br><br>To be more specific, Buddhism came out of Hinduism.<br><br>Do you know why Buddhism is not popular in India? Because Hinduism was there but not in China and SEA.<br><br>Do you know why Roman Catholism is so much bigger than all the protestent churches combined?<br><br>Buddhism and the Protestent churches were rebels. Rebels are people who think that they know better. But they are simply restating the original in another way.<br><br>Do you know why in a Buddhist country like Thailand; the 4 face Hindu God is the most popular; not only in Bangkok but in the whole region?<br><br>Think about it and detach; detach... you will be enlightened sooner.</div>

But there is a deeper spirituality behind Hinduism then what you see on the outside.<br><br>There is a reason why there are Hindus temples and lots and lots of Hindu Gods.<br><br>The outsider looks at it and laughs. Monkey god, elephant god and what not. It is like are these people mad or what?<br><br>Do you think that they are mad? Do you think that they don't know how "stupid" it looks? All these are for the seekers. When they are ready for the "enlightenment" they will get it.<br><br>In Roman Catholism it is the same. The protestents protests that they are idol worshipers because they have statues where they do the cross and pray in front of. They protest that they pray to Mary and calls her mother of God.<br><br>You see, those that make fun or the Hindus and those that protest against the Roman Catholics are missing the whole point and they have a log in their eyes... so they cannot see.<br><br>Yet I tend to think that the individual Roman Catholic have more likelihood to know God than the protestant.
