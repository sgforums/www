This whole sutra discourse took place in Trayastrimsas Heaven - the only sutra discourse to have taken place outside planet Earth. Therefore all kinds of beings and spiritual beings - in Chinese we call them <span style="font-style: italic;">Tian Long Ba Bu</span> gathers to listen to Buddha's discourse. Why? Because Buddha's mother died 7 days and was reborn in Trayastrimsas Heaven after Buddha was born, and after Buddha attain enlightenment he wants to repay<br>his mother's kindness by teaching her the Dharma.<br><br>This entire sutra was a real record of what has taken place in Trayastrimsas Heaven, but since you have doubts that Trayastrimsas Heaven exists, you do not have to be too concerned - one day through your cultivation you will witness for yourself that these realms. Remember to keep an open mind, and not fall into the extremes of sceptical doubts.<br><br>The true superstition is dogmatic assumptions - like what I said, you can go back in time 400 years ago and tell the others that the world is round and everyone will think you're insane.</div>

Why can't they discard these claims as understanding and knowledge of a bygone era?[/b]</blockquote>Why are you so concerned about those things that Buddhists are not concerned about? We are not concerned too much about the supernatural. Whether you believe it or not doesnt really matter very much. What is most important is the 4 nobles truths, the 8 fold path, this is what Buddhists are concerned about, not those supernatural things! Other supernatural things that we cannot perceive now - in the future will verify whether they are true or false, but right now, the concerns is the liberation of human sufferings, mental afflictions, the concerns is about living a blissful life, practising the dharma in our lives and experiencing the highest bliss Nirvana.<br><br>We cannot even say that these are knowledge of a bygone era, just because we do not have the capacities and abilities to verify for ourselves right now - because Buddha already taught us how it is possible to verify for ourselves through what he taught.<br><br>Things like, Trayastrimsa Heaven, like I mentioned in the other post, or anything supernatural, you can eventually verify for yourself that these places do exist as long as you cultivate according to Buddhism. But before that, one should take note of it, and maintain an open mind. Many many people has been to Trayastrimsa Heaven, for example, 1250 disciples of Buddha was attending the discourse at Trayatrimsa Heaven. So you cannot say that it definitely is a made up story. And similarly, since 1250 disciples can meet at Trayastrimsa Heaven means you also can go there one day. You cannot assert nor can you say that it did not happen. Science has neither proven nor disproven the existences of these realms, and our technology to look into the universe is still at its infancy. We do not even know right now for certain whether life exists in other parts of the universe and beyond. The Buddha's answer is Yes, that is his own experience and his own seeing, so just take note of it, and in the future you will be able to verify what Buddha said is true or false.<br><br>It is interesting to note, that when Buddha spoke to the Kalamas, he spoke to them in the Kalamas' capacity to comprehend his truths - as since the Kalamas could not comprehend whether rebirth exists, Buddha mentioned...<br><br>Exerpt from <a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=188005" rel="nofollow">Dogmatism?

Blind Faith? The Kalamas are Disillusioned', true contemplatives do not need to depend on scientific reports. If it were otherwise, for 2500 years, of which a large period of time there is lack of modern science, nobody would have become enlightened. Buddhism is not a religion, neither is it just a philosophy or an academic subject. It reveals truths beyond theories and comprehension of the mind. A person of high caliber (as have been seen in Albert Einstein) will not limit himself solely to science to understand the universe -- not everything is measurable and quantifiable. There is absolutely no need for us to prove anything - if we cultivate the dharma we will see for ourselves.</span><br><br>And also, I mentioned, Buddhism is also a kind of Science with its own method of 'experimenting' and finding out the validity through meditation.<br><br>For example to try to use 'Biology' to prove 'Physics' which are two different subjects is quite difficult and not the best way of finding out the truths.</div>

Give that raft to everybody because it works!'<br><br>Firstly, to get ONTO the other shore, it is necessary that you must finally let go of the method you use to arrive at the point of liberation. This is a high stage and for beginners like me, I still need the raft for my cultivation. But for someone on the verge on liberation, that's different. Its just like saying - you cannot possibly propel your raft even onto the land. For example if you practise meditation, eventually you will reach the state of non-meditation. If you practise a Koan, eventually the Koan, the Question, the Method will dissolve altogether, and what is left is your luminous Buddha Nature shining clearly.<br><br><a href="http://www.purifymind.com/ThoughtFree.htm" rel="nofollow">Thought-Free Wakefulness</a> (a website on meditation based on Vajrayana)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">....Having perfected one taste through the levels of the lesser, medium and higher stages, the fourth yoga is nonmeditation. This is the point at which every type of conviction and the fixing of the attention on something completely dissolves. All convictions and habitual tendencies have dissolved and are left behind. One has captured the dharmakaya throne of nonmeditation.<br>In the beginning one needs to be convinced about how reality is: one needs to have confidence in the view. Ultimately, however, any form of conviction is still a subtle obscuration, still a hindrance. At the final stage of nonmeditation, all types of habitual tendencies and convictions need to be dissolved, left behind. There is nothing more to cultivate, nothing more to reach. One has arrived at the end of the path. All that needs to be purified has been purified. Karma, disturbing emotions and the habitual tendencies have all been cleared up, so that nothing is left.<br>The path is necessary as long as we have not arrived. The moment we arrive, however, the need for the road to get there has fallen away. As long as we are not at our destination, then it is also necessary to have the concept of path in order to get there. But once the destination has been reached, once whatever needs to be cultivated has been cultivated and whatever needs to be abandoned has been left behind, the whole need for path is over. That is what is meant by nonmeditation, literally non-cultivation. This is the dharmakaya [the formless body of ultimate reality, one of the three bodies (kayas) of Buddha] throne of nonmeditation. In Dzogchen, the exhaustion of all concepts and phenomena is the ultimate level of experience. This is the state of complete enlightenment. Both these levels of realization are equal to that of all buddhas...</span><br><br>Secondly, I do not see a lack of people who 'give that raft to everybody' - Buddha certainly did. And it is not only one raft, there are 84000 kinds of rafts, or 84000 medicines, dharma doors - whatever you call it, to treat the sentient mind. Even in present days, there is no lack of enlightened dharma teachers in the world teaching the dharmas to liberate humanity.<br><br>[quote]I really pity you. Clinging on to superstitions; the baseless beliefs. You will never arrive because you are pulling the old raft along with you even though you have crossed the river and have come to a super highway. You should be driving a sports car but there you are sitting on the raft in the middle of the super highway leading towards enlightenment.Do you even know what a raft means? Haha I doubt you do.<br><br>There are two ways to describe the Dharmas that Buddha taught - a medicine and a raft. A raft is just like a medicine, a Dharma used to treat the human mind - to destroy the mental afflictions and the sentient mind to awaken to our true self.<br><br>In terms of raft, we explain that it is a raft to lead us from our sufferings/Dukkha to awakening - which is the other shore.<br><br>It has nothing to do at all with the supernatural. For example just because a scientific report says 'This report is written in a place called ABC', and then someone weird just start doubting that the science report is written in ABC, and keep on claiming that ABC does not exist - and completely neglect what the scientific report is talking about. Similarly you are like that person, who discuss issues that people and Buddhists do not get concerned about. People are able to appreciate and gain something from the teachings of Ksitigarbha Sutra, but all you are concerned is the place that sutra discourse took place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But you are right that Buddhists should focus on the practical aspects of Buddhism rather on things that we cannot yet verify. And as to those things that we cannot yet verify as we practise what the Buddha taught we will be able to verify for ourselves. There is absolutely no 'clinging to beliefs and superstitions' involved.<br><br><blockquote>I enjoyed debating here though, gave be more insights into Buddhism.</blockquote>Do feel welcome to discuss on the forum again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Lastly if you can, do get the book that Neutral Onliner recommend you and also 'The Power of Now' by Eckhart Tolle.<br><br>I believe our next discussion will be more purposeful and meaningful if you can understand the true practise of Buddhism in life.</div>

Why can't they discard these claims as understanding and knowledge of a bygone era?</blockquote>then u really don't deeply understand how wise and compassion, a doctor the Buddha really is. it's as long as you can get the result and cure of the illness(ending suffering) done, it doesn't matter if a doctor uses posion to threat posion. that was a case where Buddha went to a cult that worship gods.  in order to preach them the Dharma, He didn't change their way of life of ritualism. But Buddha change the <strong>Significance </strong>of their ritual to explain the Dharma. like washing a cup without change the shape of the cup. this is most brillant form of delivering beings.<br><br>ppl who don't see the whole picture only see a small persepctive, judging the book by the cover, see the story outside, but never see the meaning inside. like people are pointing to the moon, while one is still looking at the finger. but the meaning is the moon not the finger.<br><br>Dharma is for one to digest. digest is different from clinging. when digested, believe is true believe, not believe is right disbelieve. but when one's not digested the dharma, believe is false believe, disbelieve is also false disbelieve.<br><br>people of 'science' are only left in doubt (which is one of the 5 poisons).<br>it's good that we explain what people of 'science' Cannot explain. it given the whole picture of life and reality itself without doubt. why some are born rich, poor, good lookinh, ugly... all unequality of people and animal...etcs. with that understanding, you then are able to let go, go on and practice Dharma.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>

Just because  they call themselves "Buddhist." Once you are attached to an organisation, you get pulled in no matter what. For me I go to Hindu / Buddhist / Taoist temples and Churches. I never formally join and I come and go without talking to anyone. I go mainly to be among the believers. To be a part of a community of believers. For your info, this morning I was at the Suntec city gathering of the Buddhists.<br><br>Of course for that community to exist; for that building to exists, some people must be actively involved in it. I just do not want, personally to be attached to it in that way.<br><br>So the issues that remains are, how to find a teahcer without attaching to a Buddhist organisation and how to be a part of a community of believers without being part of an organisation.<br><br>I think the warning should come first and he can decide for himself.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by casino_king:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes find a teacher but not attach oneself to an organisation, even though they call themselves "Buddhist." Just because  they call themselves "Buddhist." Once you are attached to an organisation, you get pulled in no matter what. For me I go to Hindu / Buddhist / Taoist temples and Churches. I never formally join and I come and go without talking to anyone. I go mainly to be among the believers. To be a part of a community of believers. For your info, this morning I was at the Suntec city gathering of the Buddhists.<br><br>Of course for that community to exist; for that building to exists, some people must be actively involved in it. I just do not want, personally to be attached to it in that way.<br><br>So the issues that remains are, how to find a teahcer without attaching to a Buddhist organisation and how to be a part of a community of believers without being part of an organisation.<br><br>I think the warning should come first and he can decide for himself. Maybe he likes to get involved in the politics after all.... Form is emptiness and emptiness is form.</div></blockquote>Again what you said makes sense and theoretically nothing wrong with it.<br><br>But however if you find Buddhism is useful, you may want to put your focus on learning and practising Buddhism. Unless you really got that kind of time to go around Singapore to all sorts of places.<br><br>Just like university - there are a lot of different subjects. You only need to major in one particular kind - i.e, Engineering. Although if you study engineering you still can study a bit of other subjects, your major is still your major.<br><br>Otherwise there will be little results coming out of it - and you will not be able to receive your graduation certificate because you cannot complete one particular course - but machiam a bit of everything.<br><br>This same advise goes not only to different religions - but different followers of different schools of Buddhism that focuses on different aspects and practises. Because Buddha taught 84000 dharma doors, it may be needed that you only focus on some or one.</div>
