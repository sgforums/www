Their coming wasn't just seven hundred billion years ago. Perhaps such a situation already existed seven thousand trillion years ago. When the gods from the Heaven of Light-Sound came to this world, they were no longer that perfect and had already lost their wisdom. Why? For the same reason that people lose their wisdom when they get reborn. In the beginning, there were no humans in this world, and it was still undeveloped, an indistinguishable mass, like a chicken egg. The gods flew to the world like flies, thinking there was something good to eat here. To get from the Heaven of Light-Sound to the earth, they probably had to travel a long time, just as now it takes a long time for a satellite launched into space to enter its orbit, perhaps several years in human time. The gods didn't come to the earth for any special reason. They had been travelling and had lost their compass, so they were in quite a flurry when they got to the earth. When they reached the earth, they were not as intelligent as they had been in the heavens. All they had left was a perceptive nature. They weren't as perfect and whole as when they were in the heavens. In the same way, a person may be very intelligent, but when he dies and gets reborn as a child again, he will have forgotten all about his previous life. It is also like those victims of car collisions who fall into a coma and become totally stupefied. </div></blockquote> I must say that this is interesting reading...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by geforce:</div><div class="quote_body">Although it's said that they came from the Heaven of Light-Sound, they gradually lost their original virtue and wisdom and only had a little bit of perceptive ability left. Although they are said to have come from the Heaven of Light-Sound, only a few came, and ultimately no one knows how many. No one can verify when they came either. There are no historical records to consult, nor is there much basis for this theory.  </div></blockquote> no basis? How sad.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by geforce:</div><div class="quote_body">As for the so-called science, there is no real thing called science. People just made up the name "science" and called it that. It's actually just a body of theories. Is this kind of reasoning perfect or not? It depends on each person's perspective and faculty of understanding. Some people understand it. Others have not studied science before, and do not understand science. Does that mean the people who haven't studied science before lack that kind of reasoning in their own nature? </div></blockquote> I would think so.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by geforce:</div><div class="quote_body">No. </div></blockquote>Oh?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by geforce:</div><div class="quote_body">Regardless of whether you've studied science or not, that kind of reasoning exists in your nature.

They are as if "adding a head on top of a head." Having nothing to do, they look for something to keep them busy. Busily doing this and that, they never discover anything. They study science, investigating back and forth, but they never reach any real conclusions. </div></blockquote> Coming from someone who is typing on a computer linked by the Internet... I am left speechless.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by geforce:</div><div class="quote_body">People become attached to science, thinking it's something special. In fact, it is all inherent in our nature, and you don't need to look outside. If you seek outside, you'll never find it. You may say it's real, but that's just the superficial. The real thing can neither be found nor spoken of. Basically, science doesn't exist. It's just called science because that's what we call it.<br></div></blockquote>I guess the only conclusion I can arrive at is that you did not use a PC to type that and it was transmitted to us using telekinesis.... awesome!<br></div>

According to the scientific method, it is pure speculation unless you study it properly. Nothing can replace scientific experiments to discover the truth. The scientific method was not developed to discredit religion. It was developed <strong>"for the investigation of phenomena and the acquisition of new knowledge of the natural world, as well as the correction and integration of previous knowledge, based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning.</strong> Buddhists make so many claims about Shariras and yet refuse to put the claims to the tests.... one can only conclude that the claims are pure speculations.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Again, my dunnu how many times repeating it, Buddhists do NOT speculate about shariras because it is none of our business to speculate - does it help in our enlightenment?

There are many others. For instance, many people tested the sharira by hitting them with a hammer - and not only is the sharira completely unharmed, it leaves a dent on the hammer itself. As for heating, of course, shariras cannot be melted because the shariras are remained from cremation. For instance Buddha's shariras were obtained after his body Self-cremated in a Samadhi of Fire - witnessed by all the disciples around him, and the shariras that remained were even larger and more than his entire body. It was later distributed equally to 8 kingdoms. It was reported that some went to the nagas and some went to the devas. If shariras can melt, it would have melted. It cannot be melted or reduced to ashes and remain undamaged.<br><br>Scientific experiment? There is no need for scientific experiment, unless you consider hitting and heating as scientific experiment. Then yes - if you have a sharira, no matter how you burn or hit it, no amount of heat and pressure can dissolve the sharira. It will remain as beautiful as ever.</div>

The box is samsara itself - and samsara resides in the mind.<br><br>For example, through practising dharma, we can be completely liberated from the symbols that we are binded to. <span style="font-style: italic;">....Lastly I do see some of your points.

Through practising dharma, one will be freed from ALL samsaric mental tendencies. It is not like 'I believe in Buddha, and Buddha says Gambling is Evil, so I don't gamble.' Such people may say so, but will not be free from temptation and may give in to temptation no matter how strong his faith may be.<br><br>Rules and laws made by men are needed only at the beginning when people are mentally unstable, unruly and impure. That is why precepts is the basis for Samadhi and Wisdom, but as one developes Samadhi and Wisdom, his mind will naturally not be moved to commit crimes. If everyone can practise the dharma, purify his mind, then I believe one day, there will absolutely be no need for laws - because <strong>when the mind is pure, the land is pure.</strong> A pure land shall be found within samsara.<br><br><blockquote>Life has much to offer<br>if only you can see that life is not for clinging to<br>but that life is there for living.</blockquote>Good, it seems you have understood what I said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Casino_King,<br><br>Since science in its most advance form is written in the form of mathematics, I would just like to bring imaginary numbers into picture to illustrate a point about fantasies.  Â‘Imaginary numberÂ’ as its name implies isnÂ’t real and early mathematicians deemed it as quite meaningless to do something like square rooting a negative 1.  Nevertheless, since it appeared in mathematics, they did not just shunt it aside.  True enough few centuries later mathematicians were finally able to give imaginary numbers geometrical interpretation.  This helps us understand how Â“time intervalsÂ” can be represented as Â“space distancesÂ” and gives great convenience in uniting our ordinary three-dimensional space and time into a four-dimensional picture governed by the rules of four-dimensional geometry.  Thus we should not discredit too quickly what that is enveloped by a veil of mystery as total fantasies.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An additional point:<br><br>Science is but one way of understanding the phenomenon universe.  It is neither the only way nor the best way.  Just like it is not right to apply the same physical laws that govern a man size universe to the quantum world, we canÂ’t apply the same laws when we deal with a world that is non-material and qualitative (It is not meant for that).  We do not create a mathematical formula to define the meaning of Â‘beautyÂ’ and Â‘loveÂ’.  Using the wrong approach at times mislead us into conclusion that something is irrational and in turn, we might missed something truly valuable.  Just my 2 cents worth.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes Casino_King,<br><br>I certainly agree with what you said. Transcendental experience till now must remain at a personal level and it is not wise to over emphasize these experiences and make objective claims.
