I.e Christian Mysticism, Islamic Sufism, Advaita Vedanta, Taoism (not religious taoism - but i.e lao tzu &amp; chuang tzu), New Age mysticism (not neo-pagan), etc.<br><br>It is the only group within each religion that does not have a history of causing violence. Why?<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>[b]No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"[/b]</blockquote>- with exceptions of mysticism.<br><br>Unfortunately mysticism is not as commonly practised as the belief-systems that ppl made up/thought up from their scriptures. Or the scriptures may in time include many mythologies like Hinduism and not many ppl see a deeper essence of it. And usually mystics do not have institutions like big churches to attract followers.</div>

Children understand parental love becuase they have experienced it. They understand thier own love for their parents and family because they have experienced it.<br><br>You try telling them about the "love" between husbands and wifes, between prostitutes and clients, between homosexual couples, between people involved in incests and between rapist and victims; you can give them all the head knowledge you want and when you question them about it and ask them to describe it, you invariably get the wrong answers.<br><br>If the child thinks that OK now I know and go out into the world based on what you had informed it and make decisions based on it; the child is in grave danger.<br><br>If instead of trying to help the child "understand" it you give the child guidelines as to what to do (while telling them that they should not try to understand but accept that they do not know and cannot understand) when they encounter certain situations; that is much better.<br><br>The child do not go out into the world thinking, no problem I understand it now, I can handle any similar situations that comes along and make my own decisions. The child will pause and reflect and come back and ask you.<br><br>What you understand as Devils and Gods; Dharma Protectors and Demons; Holy Spirits and Evil Spirits and what they set out to do and whether or not they really exist and in what form are beyond your comprehension. When you try to understand them or it; it becomes dangerous because you think you know but in actual fact you do not.<br><br>It becomes dangerous because you end up making decisions based on errors.

So have you learnt nothing from our discussion so far? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Buddhism does NOT worship gods. Gods and deities have no place in Buddhism unlike other religion that worships deities, gods or God.<br><br>Only enlightened beings have a 'place' in Buddhism - that is, all Buddhists respect, venerate and revere them.
