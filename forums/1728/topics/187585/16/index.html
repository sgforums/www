Therefore those following the mainstream traditions of Buddhism - Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana, all of them only consider Buddhists as having <strong>taken refuge in the Three Treasures/Triple Gems</strong>.<br><br>And since you are <strong>in a forum that follows Buddha's words</strong>, it would be wise for you NOT to confuse the others with the TRUE buddhists (our definition of true buddhist: those who have followed buddha's instructions by taking refuge, thus becoming Buddha's follower/disciple).<br><br>Therefore, there is no point asking or discussing about these 'pray pray buddhist' which in our definition, and buddha's definition, and all mainstream tradition buddhist definitions, in our forum, are NOT the true buddhist. Our forum is NOT about those kind of Buddhists, our forum is about Buddhists who learn and practise Buddha's dharma.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>an example which i have been observing: my inlaws and some relatives, they have a theravada tradition of hirerchy of buddha's and arhats images on their altars at home. on 1st and 15th of the lunar month, they'll be vegetarians. they go to shi ma lu guan yin temple to pray. (i do not even consider that should be praying at all, it's more appropriate for people to venerate respects to the bodhisattvas for guidances on the path to enlightenment.) they also visit the theravada monastery somewhere near SGH (forgot the name of the road). sometimes they visit thailand in those rural areas to visit monks for blessings. they are kind and helpful..... my inlaws routinely will light joss sticks at certain time of the day daily.....<br><br>then lately i asked them do they have any knowledge of buddha's teachings that they can share and guide me as well.....? they said no.... they said that it is not everyone will have the affinity to be able to know and understand the teachings. and they do not even know that heart sutra exist.....<br><br>well..... in these daily observation which is not far away that is none other than happening around me, i realise that..... sometimes it is not the matter of not having affinity to learn or not when the path is right there in front of you to start walking. how you walk? use your legs to walk lah..... so each destiny's is in each own's hands. the karmic influence does play a part in how long of time does one take to open up to the path.<br><br>and then, when i asked them are they buddhist? they say yes. ok, so i keep quiet. i told them that i have taken refuge in the tripple gem and they were delighted to know that. they added that it is not easy to take refuge in the 3 treasures and one must have yuan to be able to do so, thats why till today they still haven't taken refuge in the triple gem..... i just smiled and said nothing else because i don't want to make them feel bad or ashamed if i point some of their mistakes out...... time is perhaps not right yet.<br><br>sometimes it is not the environment or any other external factors that causes one's decision or intention. people tend to have so many little bits and pieces of this and that at the back of their mind thats is hindering them. all these hindrances are like monkeys in the head telling stopping you from doing this doing that that ought to be done...... the problem is sometimes people don't even know these monkeys exist.......<br><br>our life is us to lead, not life leads us. the direction of the wind cannot be changed but we can adjust the sails......</div>

(i do not even consider that should be praying at all, it's more appropriate for people to venerate respects to the bodhisattvas for guidances on the path to enlightenment.) they also visit the theravada monastery somewhere near SGH (forgot the name of the road). sometimes they visit thailand in those rural areas to visit monks for blessings. they are kind and helpful..... my inlaws routinely will light joss sticks at certain time of the day daily.....<br><br>then lately i asked them do they have any knowledge of buddha's teachings that they can share and guide me as well.....? they said no.... they said that it is not everyone will have the affinity to be able to know and understand the teachings. and they do not even know that heart sutra exist.....<br><br>well..... in these daily observation which is not far away that is none other than happening around me, i realise that..... sometimes it is not the matter of not having affinity to learn or not when the path is right there in front of you to start walking. how you walk? use your legs to walk lah..... so each destiny's is in each own's hands. the karmic influence does play a part in how long of time does one take to open up to the path.<br><br>and then, when i asked them are they buddhist? they say yes. ok, so i keep quiet. i told them that i have taken refuge in the tripple gem and they were delighted to know that. they added that it is not easy to take refuge in the 3 treasures and one must have yuan to be able to do so, thats why till today they still haven't taken refuge in the triple gem..... i just smiled and said nothing else because i don't want to make them feel bad or ashamed if i point some of their mistakes out...... time is perhaps not right yet.<br><br>sometimes it is not the environment or any other external factors that causes one's decision or intention. people tend to have so many little bits and pieces of this and that at the back of their mind thats is hindering them. all these hindrances are like monkeys in the head telling stopping you from doing this doing that that ought to be done...... the problem is sometimes people don't even know these monkeys exist.......<br><br>our life is us to lead, not life leads us. the direction of the wind cannot be changed but we can adjust the sails......</div></blockquote>This is actually a problem all the religions face as far as I can see. There are many seekers that stop before the find the truth. The inter religious problems in this world, are in my opinions caused by all these seekers who have learnt a little then stop for one reason or other.<br><br>When these seekers then hold office in religious organisations, all hell break lose.<br><br></div>

Tolerance is not something that you make an effort to have. They have it. And people who does not have it should seriously consider whether they are who thay think that they are... disciples, followers, converts... of their own religions or simply doing what everybody does in their churches and temples and believing what the people in their religions believe.<br><br>Just like Buddhism is not about believing what Buddha says. It is realising for yourself Buddhist teachings. They are lots of Buddhists who believes what Buddha says just like there are many Chistians who believes what the bible says.</div>

No-one who has made a genuine effort to examine other religions with an open mind could think like that either. The first thing you notice when you study the different religions is just how much they have in common. All religions acknowledge that man's present state is unsatisfactory. All believe that a change of attitude and behaviour is needed if man's situation is to improve. All teach an ethics that includes love, kindness, patience, generosity and social responsibility and all accept the existence of some form of Absolute.<br><br>They use different languages, different names and different symbols to describe and explain these things; and it is only when they narrow- mindedly cling to their one way of seeing things that religious tolerance, pride and self-righteousness arise.<br><br>Imagine an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Chinese and an Indonesian all looking at a cup. The Englishman says, "That is a cup." The Frenchman answers, "No it's not. It's a tasse." The Chinese comments, "You are both wrong. It's a pei." And the Indonesian laughs at the others and says "What a fool you are. It's a cawan." The Englishman get a dictionary and shows it to the others saying, "I can prove that it is a cup. My dictionary says so." "Then your dictionary is wrong," says the Frenchman "because my dictionary clearly says it is a tasse." The Chinese scoffs at them. "My dictionary is thousands of years older than yours, so my dictionary must be right. And besides, more people speak Chinese than any other language, so it must be pei." While they are squabbling and arguing with each other, a Buddhist comes up and drinks from the cup. After he has drunk, he says to the others, "Whether you call it a cup, a tasse, a pei or a cawan, the purpose of the cup is to be used. Stop arguing and drink, stop squabbling and refresh your thirst". This is the Buddhist attitude to other religions.<br><br></div>
