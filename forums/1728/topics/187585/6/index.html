Challenge each other findings as a one-upmanship competition. Sometimes for truth, sometimes for ego. So science, in itself is not that noble after all...<br><br>The Korean scientist was faking his findings until he can't fake it anymore. What killed him off is to have one bigger fake each time round. Remember nobody scrutinised him until his last forgery.<br><br>....  the reality of the matter is, even for science, nothing is really absolute.

It is a FACT that shariras exist, and if you have missed the great Singapore Buddha Tooth relics exhibition in Singapore Expo a few years ago, which not only housed Buddha's tooth relics but also uncountable other miraculous and colourful relics, I think you missed something great.<br><br>Scientific explanation? I dont think there is scientific explanation yet, but like i said, this is NOT what Buddhists are concerned about. Whether we understand scientifically the miraculous workings of shariras, it does not affect our spiritual enlightenment.<br><br>Then take the Holographic Reality model I have shared with you earlier on, it is scientific explanation BACKED by EVIDENCE, so again it is not against your 'scientific method' website. The Holographic Nature of Reality is taught by Buddha 2500 years ago and also similarly taught and spoken by other mystics and contemplatives. The book on The Amazing Holographic Universe also explains scientifically how paranormal activities can occur.<br><br>Then take Ian Stevenson's research on past life - and many others researches (i.e <a href="http://www.business.uq.edu.au/staff/personal/zhong/reinc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.business.uq.edu.au/staff/personal/zhong/reinc/</a>) on past life - it is also backed by a lot of evidence.<br><br>Then take the 'amazing abilities' thread - and its evidences - and its scientific explanations - all these are not speculations but is part of SCIENCE and quantum physics (the explanation part). This explains how psychic, paranormal phenomena is possible. In fact miracles, psychic phenomena, are so common in all religions that if you want to look for them you do not need to come to Buddhism. Not only monks have supernatural powers. There are so many people throughout the world who has psychic, supernatural abilities - even on this forum. Hopefully you may meet one someday and be convinced. I am convinced because of my personal experiences.<br><br>Also, countless Near Death Experience cases confirm that Consciousness DOES survive after death.<br><br>Many of these people who are CLINICALLY DEAD for a few minutes/seconds before revival report floating above their bodies and watching what was happening to "HIM" (his dead body) - everything in exact details.<br><br>Let me remind you again the Buddhism and Buddhist practise itself is PROOF.<br><br>If you dont believe it, by following Buddha's method, you will find the proof - just like countless others had. Similarly a science experiment that has succeeded will be reproducable by all others. Similar case - Buddha's enlightenment is reproducable in everybody else.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method</a><br><br>Scientific method refers to a body of techniques for the investigation of phenomena and the acquisition of new knowledge of the natural world, as well as the correction and integration of previous knowledge, based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning.<br><br>-----<br><br>Under this definition, then Buddhism CERTAINLY is a Scientific Method. But its techniques are DIFFERENT from those that you more often know. Like I said, don't confuse Biology with Physics, Chemistry with Arts. And also, Buddhism also deals with that which is beyond the 'natural world'.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: it transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it covers both the natural &amp; spiritual</span></strong>, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity"<br><br>-- Albert Einstein [1954, from Albert Einstein: The Human Side, edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, Princeton University Press]<br><br>"The religion of the future will be a cosmic religion.

Blind Faith? The Kalamas are Disillusioned</a>. There is no need for me to prove anything on the forum.<br><br>As seen in the topic 'Dogmatism? Blind Faith? The Kalamas are Disillusioned', true contemplatives do not need to depend on scientific reports. If it were otherwise, for 2500 years, of which a large period of time there is lack of modern science, nobody would have become enlightened. Buddhism is not a religion, neither is it just a philosophy or an academic subject. It reveals truths beyond theories and comprehension of the mind. A person of high caliber (as have been seen in Albert Einstein) will not limit himself solely to science to understand the universe -- not everything is measurable and quantifiable. There is absolutely no need for us to prove anything - if we cultivate the dharma we will see for ourselves.<br><br>May you be enlightened.</div>

It's even a simpler question that the one you asked, surely a person with such a knowledgeable background is able to give an answer to this one?<br><br>In case you forget: the question is: do you believe that there is a supernatural realm, and if you do, are you also delusional?</div>

Especially in the field of 'Spirituality'. Maybe not. Many ppl, including Atheists, or from other Faiths, will have trouble accepting these truths (i.e Darwin's theory of evolution?). <strong>That is because of their dogmatism, lack of open mindedness. Prove is already out there - but if you are dogmatic, you will never be able to accept it.</strong> The ultimate proof that will clear ALL doubts, not even single one remaining, is through Enlightenment itself. Prior to that it is still OK to have doubts, as long as your doubt does not become a Fetter and Obstruction to your path.....</span><br><br>Anyway I am not proving the existence of a deity (buddhists dont worship deities) - but the tenets of Buddhism. Actually there is no need for me to prove at all, one just needs to go by the guidelines of the Kalama Sutta in Buddhism.</div>
