It is also a place for the propagation of Dharma. The propagation of dharma is the most important function of a monastery/dharma centre.<br><br>Chanting is one out of the uncountable meditative methods to achieve Samadhi, non-waveredness of the mind. When a person is dying, it is most important for a person who knows the dharma, preferably a venerable, to speak the dharma of Emptiness, Impermanence to the dying so that he can let go of all his attachments and attain peace of mind. This is the most important thing. So the venerables usually advise people not to cry but chant Buddha Names/Mantras instead because crying will invoke strong emotional disturbance on the dying person.</div>

Buddhism does have good evidence, the evidence is in the people.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Buddhism is a religion of the people, by the people, for the people. - Ajahn Brahmavamso</span><br><br>By the path of Buddha, you will realise and see for yourself what was being said, and you will BE the evidence.<br><br>Buddhist logic is good. In fact Buddha did provide quite good logical reasonings. Not only logical, it is systematic.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Buddhism also provides a Systematic way of experiencing reality. What I meant by systematic and scientific - for example, in modern science, we will say: Given any event E1, there is an Event E2 that follows E1 after time interval T1, we can say that E1 is the cause of E2.... the causality aspect, this is, that is.. this exists, that exists. Smile Now, compare it with Buddhism - the teaching that started more than 2500 years ago. We learn about the 12 Links of Interdependant Origination, etc. By 'reversing' and eliminating the Interdependant Origination Links of Origination one may again arrive at the point where there is no more trace of ignorance. Buddha's method of teaching is very systematic throughout. It also ensures no confusion among practitioners and that everyone will be able to arrive at the same grounds at the end of their path.</span></div>

This line - I have repeated over and over, and explained it quite well, I believe.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The methods used to gain insights in the spiritual world is not by what we understand as (Modern) Scientific Method, because our mundane world's knowledge of the Science does NOT include dealing with spirituality - but of the material world. The Scientists know little about the nature of consciousness, so little that they can neither refute nor assert anything regarding it. So far they have not disproven anything taught by Buddha. The studies done have positive results. In fact I have already given you quite a couple of URLs in the previous post - have you read them?<br><br>But no matter how much studies and research - is it able to convince people from other faiths? Especially in the field of 'Spirituality'. Maybe not. Many ppl, including Atheists, or from other Faiths, will have trouble accepting these truths (i.e Darwin's theory of evolution?). That is because of their dogmatism, lack of open mindedness. Prove is already out there - but if you are dogmatic, you will never be able to accept it. The ultimate proof that will clear ALL doubts, not even single one remaining, is through Enlightenment itself. Prior to that it is still OK to have doubts, as long as your doubt does not become a Fetter and Obstruction to your path.</span></div>

I consider it to be author Michael Talbot's most important work, as well as one of the best books ever written on the subject of so-called paranormal phenomenon.<br><br>Talbot's fascination for finding scientific explanations for psychic and paranormal activity began when he noticed objects moving inexplicably around him, regardless where he lived. He would sometimes awaken to find socks draped on his houseplants, and occasionally found objects in his apartment that he knew for a fact had been hundreds of miles away. His real-life experiences with such shifts in reality combined with his training in physics led him to explore possible reasons for these and other mysterious happenings.<br><br>Talbot begins his book with an excellent introduction to physicist David Bohm's concept of the holographic model of the universe, and combines the physics model with Karl Pribram's work on the holographic model of the brain. The result is a marvelous description of a non-local, interconnected and alive universe that moves in response to our every thought and feeling.<br><br>I am very impressed with the clarity with which Talbot presents the concept of a holographic universe and how various paranormal phenomenon can be explained within that model. Talbot's discussion is comprehensive, fascinating, clear, and packed with relevant and intriguing stories of paranormal phenomenon. Out of body experiences (OBEs), near death experiences (NDEs), auric readings, psychokinesis, acupuncture, X-ray vision, healing, and psychic readings are all described and considered for placement into the holographic model.<br><br>Talbot presents a wealth of relevant research studies and scientific theories from David Bohm, Helmut Schmidt, Marilyn Schlitz, Robert Monroe, Charles Tart, Larry Dossey, Paul Davies, PMH Atwater, Ian Stevenson, Fred Alan Wolf, Harold Puthoff, Russell Targ, Lyall Watson, Stanislav Grof, and many others.</span><br><br>-----------<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This is one of the most provocative books I have read in years. In the first few chapters Mr. Talbot describes the emerging holographic paradigm in science, drawing on David Bohm's work in quantum physics and Karl Pribam's work in neuroscience. I found both descriptions to be fascinating, and especially enjoyed the historical context for the work of these two seminal thinkers. As a person with a master's degree in neuroscience and chaos/complexity theory, I found a couple of his simplifications misleading, but would give him high marks for his overall comprehension of the conclusions of Pribam and his followers.<br><br>The remaining 2/3 of the book is a discussion of how the holographic paradigm may provide a rational basis for interpreting a wide variety of phenomenon located around the fringes of established science. He looks at everything from strange historical "miracles" like stigmata and appearances of the Virgin Mary to modern psychic abilities and LSD experiences, from out-of-body and near-death-experiences to UFO abductions. In addition, he compares language used in the modern scientific discussion of holography with the language used by ancient mystical traditions.<br><br>Mr. Talbot's writing style is unusually clear and lucid. All of this makes for a highly engaging book. It kept me up late every night for more than a week. I am a person who has had an OBE/NDE (out-of-body, near-death-experience), and can tell you that his description of such events is an astoundingly accurate portrayal of what I experienced.<br><br>I am also a scientist, and know that most of my highly rational, empirical colleages would have trouble accepting a majority of Mr. Talbot's conclusions. This work addresses something so completely out of the realm of everyday experience for most people, and probes a world that is normally invisible to the five senses. Hence, objective, empirical science -- as defined by a conventional theorist or practicing technician -- simply cannot address these experiences. They are outside the range of focus of the tool that Western minds currently rely on.<br><br>The service that Mr. Talbot provides is a challenge to rethink the conventional definition of science so that it can take into account a much wider range of human experience. What he argues for is the acceptance, as valid scientific data, of the experiences of individual humans, across cultures and throughout history, that are remarkably consistent with one another. These experiences address aspects of reality that are invisible to the skeptical eye, but become obvious to the person who chooses to develop other forms of perception.<br><br>As a person who was unwittingly thrown into an OBE/NDE experience, I am naturally inclined to read a book like this one with an open mind, and felt immensely rewarded for doing so. However, if I had reviewed the same book before having my own personal experience of some of the phenomena it describes, I would have reviewed it as a new-age excursion into a realm of fantasy. I am completely sympathetic to some of the reviewers who see it that way, and respectfully disagree.<br><br>I believe there is an extraordinary synthesis happening among the realms of human experience, one that can validate each individual's story, however unusual, and also one that honors all the different ways of knowing. I see Mr. Talbot's work as one of the more important bridges yet constructed between traditional science and spirituality, between rational discourse about repeatable, empirically verifiable phenomenon and the quirky, esoteric or mythological elements of personal experience that actually define most people's experience of reality. This book is a "must read" for any passionate seeker of truth.</span>[/url]</div>
