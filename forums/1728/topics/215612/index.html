            <div class='col-md body'><br>The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment Buddhist SÃ»tra, original Chinese title is Yuanjue jing, Japanese Engaku-kyo; 1 fasc. (T 842.17.913a-922a). Full title Dafangguang yuanjue xiuduluo liaoyi jing. A Chinese MahÃ¢yÃ¢na sutra which was probably written in the early eighth century C.E. Divided into twelve chapters as a series of discussions on meditation practice, this text deals with issues such as the meaning and origin of ignorance, sudden and gradual enlightenment, original Buddhahood, etc. all themes which were originally elucidated in the Awakening of Faith. It was intended to resolve questions regarding doctrine and meditation for the earliest practitioners of the Chan school.<br><br>[edit] Summary<br>The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment is arranged in twelve chapters, plus a short introductory section. The introductory section describes the scene of the sermon and lists the major participants. The location is a state of deep meditative concentration (samadhi) and the participants are the Buddha and one hundred thousand great bodhisattvas, among whom twelve eminent bodhisattvas act as spokesmen. Each one of the twelve gets up one by one and asks the Buddha a set of questions about doctrine, practice and enlightenment. The structure of the sutra is such that the most "essential" and suddenistic discussions occur in the earlier chapters and the more "functional" and gradualistic dialogues occur later.<br><br>Bohiruci view<br><br>the Question of the first Bodhisattiva who question Sakyamuni is indeed deep<br><br>According to a comics comment.Its best for beginner to read the last bodhisatta question and progress towards the front<br><br>Perfect Enlightenment stand on the Great Spaciousty Period ,which mean the Nobleness of the Mahayana Bodhisattva Spirit in Universal Equality<br><br>Homage to the Assesmbly of Perfect Enlightenment<br>Homage to the Original Teacher ,Buddha Sakyamuni<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This kind of structure reflects a motif associated with the doctrine of the Huayan school (華嚴宗<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, which affirms that the Buddha delivered the abstruse Avatamsaka Sutra (華嚴經<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> as his first sermon, in an effort to directly awaken those whose "roots of virtue" were well-matured. The terminology that Zongmi (宗密<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> and Gihwa (己和<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> use to describe these advanced practitioners is that they possess the capacity for the teaching of "sudden enlightenment"Â—a direct awakening to the non-duality of reality, which necessarily precludes gradualist, "goal-oriented" practice. In the first two chapters (the chapters of MaÃ±juśrī and Samantabhadra), the Buddha holds very strictly to the sudden position, denying the possibility of enlightenment through gradual practice. In the third chapter he begins to allow for a bit of a gradual view, and the next several chapters become mixtures of the two. The final few chapters offer a fully gradualist perspective.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutra_of_Perfect_Enlightenment</div>

It is like a man who is dreaming. At the time of the dream, there is no non-existence. But when he awakens he finds that there is nothing for him to hold on to. Similarly, when the sky-flowers disappear from the sky, you cannot say that there is a definite point of their disappearance. Why? Because there is no point from which they arose. All sentient beings falsely perceive arising and ceasing within the unarisen. Therefore they say that there is 'transmigration through life-and-death.' "<br><br>"Good sons, in the practice of Perfect Enlightenment of the causal stage of the Tathāgata one understands these 'sky-flowers,' thus there is no transmigration, nor body/mind to undergo life-and-death. But they are not caused to be non-existent. It is because they lack original nature. Now, this [prior] awareness is in itself void, like empty space. Yet since this awareness that perceives it to be like empty space is none other than the appearance of sky-flowers, you also cannot say that there is no nature of awareness. Existence and non- existence both being dispelled is called 'according with pure enlightenment.' "<br><br>"Why? Because its nature is completely empty; because it is eternally changeless; because there is neither arising nor ceasing within the matrix of the Tathāgata, and because there are no fixed points of view. Like the nature of the reality-realm it is totally complete and perfect, pervading the ten directions. Therefore it is called the 'reality-practice of the causal stage.' Bodhisattvas, relying upon it arouse their pure mind within the Mahayana. Sentient beings of the degenerate age who practice relying on this will not fall into erroneous views."<br><br>Then, the World Honored One, wanting to restate the gist of this, spoke a verse. He said:<br><br>MaÃ±juśrī, you should know<br><br>All Tathāgatas<br><br>From their originally arisen causal stage<br><br>Penetrate ignorance<br><br>With enlightened wisdom.<br><br>Knowing it to be like sky-flowers<br><br>They are able to escape transmigration.<br><br>It is like the man in the dream<br><br>Who has nothing to grasp upon awakening.<br><br>Awareness is like space<br><br>Equal, changeless.<br><br>Enlightenment pervading the worlds of the ten directions<br><br>Is none other than the attainment of the Buddha-way.<br><br>All illusions cease at no-place<br><br>And in accomplishing the Way there is nothing attained.<br><br>That's because the original nature is complete, perfect.<br><br>In it, bodhisattvas<br><br>Are able to produce bodhicitta<br><br>All sentient beings of the degenerate age<br><br>Practicing this, will avoid erroneous views.<br><br></div>
