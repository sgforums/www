              <p>Channel 8 is showing Pilgrimage To The West at 10.30 pm on every Saturday.</p>
              <p>I have a few friends who asked me whether the story is true. Don't be surprise that many do not know that the story is a classical novel, they thought it is a Buddhism true story. I told them it is true that Master Xuan Zang travelled to the West to obtain the sacred texts but without the Sun Wu Kong, Zhu BaiJie and Sha WuJing.</p>
              <p>Though I've watched many versions of this story but I will never get tired of it. There's always something to learn from this drama.</p>
              <p>There was this part showing a beauty asking Monk Xuan Zang whether she was beautiful. Monk Xuan Zang said he did not know. The beauty asked him why he did not know and insisted on an answer. Monk Xuan Zang replied how to tell a heap of skeletons was beautiful or not.  It is always interesting to listen to the reply of someone who practice well or enlightened.</p>

              Zhu BaiJie is the metaphor of laziness and desire craving  in a human.
              
              Sha WuJing is the metaphor of simplicity, honesty but also not so wise intelligence in a human.  
              
              Sun Wu Kong is the metaphor of mischief in a human.
              
              The characteristics of the three above represent the undesirable traits of a human. 
              
              I read this analysis in a buddhist magazine.

              Xuanzang (Chinese: çŽ„å¥˜; pinyin: XuÃ¡n ZÃ ng; Wadeâ€“Giles: HsÃ¼an-tsang Sanskrit:à¤¹à¥�à¤µà¥‡à¤¨à¤¸à¤¾à¤‚à¤— ) (c. 602 â€“ 664) was a famous Chinese Buddhist monk, scholar, traveler, and translator who described the interaction between China and India in the early Tang period. Born in Henan province of China in 602 or 603, from boyhood he took to reading sacred books, including the Chinese Classics and the writings of the ancient sages.
              
              While residing in the city of Luoyang, Xuanzang entered Buddhist monkhood at the age of thirteen. Due to the political and social unrest caused by the fall of the Sui dynasty, he went to Chengdu in Sichuan (Szechuan), where he was ordained at the age of twenty. He later traveled throughout China in search of sacred books of Buddhism. At length, he came to Chang'an, then under the peaceful rule of Emperor Taizong of Tang. Here Xuanzang developed the desire to visit India. He knew about Faxian's visit to India and, like him, was concerned about the incomplete and misinterpreted nature of the Buddhist scriptures that had reached China.
               
              He became famous for his seventeen year overland journey to India, which is recorded in detail in his autobiography as well as a biography, both of which provided the inspiration for the epic novel Journey to the West.
              
              Xuanzang is also known as TÃ¡ng-sÄ�nzÃ ng (å”�ä¸‰è—�), XuÃ¡nzÃ ng SÄ�nzÃ ng (çŽ„å¥˜ä¸‰è—�), XuÃ¡nzÃ ng DÃ shÄ« (çŽ„å¥˜å¤§å¸«), or simply as TÃ¡ng SÄ“ng (å”�åƒ§), or Tang (Dynasty) Monk in Mandarin;

              <p><br><span style="color: #000080;">Those wondering spirits on earth, which category they belong to?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">I know of some encountering spirits disturbing them day and night, don't these spirits have any source in charge of them to control them?   </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wondering spirits belong to ghosts path. God's religion deny their existence, it thinks that they are demons in disguise. Actually they are the lost souls. Buddhists dedicate merits to them after chanting events so that their sufferings can be lessen or shorten. Earth Store Buddhaï¼ˆåœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨) is there to teach and "save" them but provided they wish to be "save". Just like we humans, some believe in Buddha's teachings and some do not. Same goes with ghosts.</span></p>

              There are people who do not believe in ghosts.  Till they meet one. 
              
              Then they become frightened instead of finding out more how to help the ghosts, they will try to block all future meetings with the third dimension.
              
              Actually ghosts are transformed from humans. They were humans too when they were alive.
              
              Instead of being scared of them, why not find out more on how to help them.  
              
              Buddhists can help in various methods, chanting for them, transferring merits to them so that they can be released from the ghosts realm.  Buddhists/Taoists can even help by providing food and clothes to them before preaching the goodness of Pureland to the ghosts.
              
              Ghosts need help as much as humans.

              <p>Off topic a bit. The other thread is locked, so I answer your question here.</p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #000080;">Those wondering spirits on earth, which category they belong to?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;">I know of some encountering spirits disturbing them day and night, don't these spirits have any source in charge of them to control them?   </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Wondering spirits belong to ghosts path. God's religion deny their existence, it thinks that they are demons in disguise. Actually they are the lost souls. Buddhists dedicate merits to them after chanting events so that their sufferings can be lessen or shorten. Earth Store Buddhaï¼ˆåœ°è—�çŽ‹è�©è�¨) is there to teach and "save" them but provided they wish to be "save". Just like we humans, some believe in Buddha's teachings and some do not. Same goes with ghosts.</span></p>

              <p><br>Yeah, many people have mistaken what is true Buddhism. Those who criticise Buddhism are mainly those who don't know what is true Buddhism. Those who know about true Buddhism can't find fault with Buddhism.</p>
