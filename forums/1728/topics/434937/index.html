              <p>Also called <strong>The Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar (Maha-sihanada Sutta)</strong></p>
              <h3>Introduction  </h3>
              <p>The Maha-sihanada Sutta, the Great Discourse on the Lion's Roar, is a
                   text of awesome scope and power, one of those rare suttas in which <strong>the 
                  Buddha discloses the greatness and loftiness of his own spiritual 
                  endowments.</strong> Towards the end of the sutta, the Buddha says that he has 
                  reached his eightieth year, which allows us to place the discourse in 
                  the final year of his life. Thus the sutta serves as a convenient 
                  summation of the exalted qualities that enabled the Buddha to function 
                  so effectively as teacher and spiritual guide through the forty-five 
                  years of his mission.</p>
              <p><strong>It is not typical of the Buddha to extol himself, for he did not 
                  intend his Dispensation to evolve into a personality cult centered 
                  around himself as a charismatic and powerful leader.</strong> Throughout his 
                  ministry he constantly emphasized the primacy of his role as guide, as 
                  the discoverer and proclaimer of the path. His task is not to command 
                  reverence, but to steer his disciples onto and along the path, for it is
                   <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only the practice of the path, the cultivation of the training, that 
                  can effect the deep interior purification by which one can reach the 
                  extinction of the defilements and liberation from suffering.</span></p>
              <p><strong>However, while the Buddha functions primarily as the revealer of the 
                  path, confidence in him as the Supreme Teacher remains an essential 
                  element of the training.</strong> It is this confidence, freshly arisen, that 
                  induces the curious inquirer to cross the great divide that separates 
                  the admirer of the Dhamma from the practitioner, and it is this same 
                  confidence that drives the aspirant forward until the task of 
                  self-cultivation has been completed. <strong>Frequent reflection on the 
                  greatness of the Master inspires joy and courage, sustaining one's 
                  commitment during those dark periods when prospects for progress appear 
                  bleak, and desire and doubt — those twin conspirators — combine forces 
                  to attempt to persuade one of the futility of one's efforts.</strong> Hence, in 
                  order to provide a spur to awaken and nurture the confidence necessary 
                  to tread the path through its downward turns as well as its ascents, the
                   Buddha on occasion offers us revelations of his "Buddha-<em>gunas,"</em> the excellent qualities of a Fully Enlightened One that entitle him to serve as the first of the Three Gems and Three Refuges.</p>
              <p>One of the most impressive of these rare disclosures is the Great 
                  Discourse on the Lion's Roar. Spoken as a rebuttal to the charges of a 
                  renegade disciple who, in the midst of the populous city of Vesali, had 
                  been denouncing the Buddha and attempting to dissuade others from 
                  following his teaching, the sutta recapitulates the various 
                  distinguished qualities of the Blessed One, with special emphasis upon 
                  his "ten Tathagata powers" <em>(tathagatabala)</em> and "four intrepidities" <em>(vesarajja);</em> the sutta also affords us a glimpse of the demanding ordeal he 
                  underwent over many past aeons seeking the path to deliverance. When it 
                  was first spoken, the sutta had such a powerful impact on one monk in 
                  the assembly that his bodily hairs stood on end, and thus, during an 
                  early period, the sutta was known by the alternative title "The 
                  Hair-raising Discourse." Even today, centuries later, the Great 
                  Discourse on the Lion's Roar can continue to serve as a fecund source of
                   inspiration.</p>

              <p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesali in the grove outside the city to the west.</p>
              <p>2. Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently left this Dhamma and Discipline.<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag  " name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-1">[1]</a> He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly: "The recluse 
                      Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge
                       and vision worthy of the noble ones.<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag  " name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-2">[2]</a> The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning,
                       following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and when he 
                      teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practices it to the 
                      complete destruction of suffering."<a id="fnt-3" class="noteTag  " name="fnt-3" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-3">[3]</a></p>
              <p>3. Then, when it was morning, the Venerable Sariputta dressed, and 
                      taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesali for alms. Then he heard
                       Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, making this statement before the 
                      Vesali assembly. When he had wandered for alms in Vesali and had 
                      returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed One, 
                      and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the 
                      Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying.</p>
              <p>4. (The Blessed One said:) "Sariputta, the misguided man Sunakkhatta 
                      is angry, and his words are spoken out of anger. Thinking to discredit 
                      the Tathagata, he actually praises him;[<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#bracket-note-m">*p.69</a>]
                       for it is a praise of the Tathagata to say of him: 'When he teaches the
                       Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practices it to the complete 
                      destruction of suffering.'</p>
              <p>5. "Sariputta, this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me 
                      according to Dhamma: 'That Blessed One is accomplished, fully 
                      enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of 
                      worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and 
                      humans, enlightened, blessed.'<a id="fnt-4" class="noteTag  " name="fnt-4" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-4">[4]</a></p>
              <p>6. "And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: 'That Blessed 
                      One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, he 
                      becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes;
                       he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a 
                      mountain, as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as 
                      though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it 
                      were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with 
                      his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty;
                       he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.'</p>
              <p>7. "And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: 'With the 
                      divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, that 
                      Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds, the heavenly and the human, 
                      those that are far as well as near.'</p>
              <p>8. "And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: 'That Blessed 
                      One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings, other 
                      persons. He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a
                       mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he understands a mind 
                      affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as 
                      unaffected by hate; he understands a mind affected by delusion as 
                      affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by 
                      delusion; he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a 
                      distracted mind as distracted; he understands an exalted mind as exalted
                       and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he understands a surpassed mind as 
                      surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he understands a 
                      concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as 
                      unconcentrated; he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an 
                      unliberated mind as unliberated.'</p>
              <h3>Ten Powers of a Tathagata</h3>
              <p>9. "Sariputta, the Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers, 
                      possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's 
                      roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.<a id="fnt-5" class="noteTag  " name="fnt-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-5">[5]</a> What are the ten?</p>

              <p>17. (8) "Again, the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives, 
                      that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, 
                      ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a 
                      hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons
                       of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of 
                      world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, 
                      with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of

                      reappeared here.' Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects 
                      his manifold past lives. That too is a Tathagata's power...</p>
              <p>18. (9) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses 
                      the human, the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing, 
                      inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he 
                      understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These 
                      worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech and mind, revilers 
                      of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in 
                      their actions, on the dissolution of the body, [71] after death, have 
                      reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in

                       the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and 
                      surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, 
                      inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he 
                      understands how beings pass on according to their actions. That too is a
                       Tathagata's power...</p>
              <p>19. (10) "Again, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, 
                      the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of 
                      mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction 
                      of the taints. That too is a Tathagata's power that a Tathagata has, by 
                      virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar
                       in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.</p>
              <p>20. "The Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers, possessing which
                       he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the 
                      assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.</p>
              <p>21. "Sariputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 
                      'The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction
                       in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama 
                      teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning, following his own 
                      line of inquiry as it occurs to him' — unless he abandons that assertion
                       and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as (surely as 
                      if he had been) carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.<a id="fnt-13" class="noteTag  " name="fnt-13" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-13">[13]</a> Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue, concentration and wisdom would 
                      here and now enjoy final knowledge, so it will happen in this case, I 
                      say, that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and 
                      relinquishes that view, then as (surely as if he had been) carried off 
                      and put there he will wind up in hell.</p>
              <h3>Four Kinds of Intrepidity</h3>
              <p>22. "Sariputta, the Tathagata has these four kinds of intrepidity, 
                      possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's 
                      roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma. What are 
                      the four?</p>
              <p>23. "Here, I see no ground on which any recluse or brahman or god or 
                      Mara or Brahma or anyone at all in the world could, in accordance with 
                      the Dhamma, accuse me thus: 'While you claim full enlightenment, you are
                       not fully enlightened in regard to certain things.' [72] And seeing no 
                      ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness and intrepidity.</p>
              <p>24. "I see no ground on which any recluse... or anyone at all could 
                      accuse me thus: 'While you claim to have destroyed the taints, these 
                      taints are undestroyed by you.' And seeing no ground for that, I abide 
                      in safety, fearlessness and intrepidity.</p>
              <p>25. "I see no ground on which any recluse... or anyone at all could 
                      accuse me thus: 'Those things called obstructions by you are not able to
                       obstruct one who engages in them.' And seeing no ground for that, I 
                      abide in safety, fearlessness and intrepidity.</p>
              <p>26. "I see no ground on which any recluse... or anyone at all could 
                      accuse me thus: 'When you teach the Dhamma to someone, it does not lead 
                      him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering.' And 
                      seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness and

              <h3>The Eight Assemblies</h3>
              <p>29. "Sariputta, there are these eight assemblies. What are the eight?
                       An assembly of nobles, an assembly of brahmans, an assembly of 
                      householders, an assembly of recluses, an assembly of gods of the heaven
                       of the Four Great Kings, an assembly of gods of the heaven of the 
                      Thirty-three, an assembly of Mara's retinue, an assembly of Brahmas. 
                      Possessing these four kinds of intrepidity, the Tathagata approaches and
                       enters these eight assemblies.</p>
              <p>30. "I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles... 
                      many hundred assemblies of brahmans... many hundred assemblies of 
                      householders... many hundred assemblies of recluses... many hundred 
                      assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings... many hundred
                       assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three... many hundred 
                      assemblies of Mara's retinue... many hundred assemblies of Brahmas. And 
                      formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held 
                      conversations with them, yet I see no ground for thinking that fear or 
                      timidity might come upon me there. And seeing no ground for that, I 
                      abide in safety, fearlessness and intrepidity. [73]</p>

              <h3>Four Kinds of Generation</h3>
              <p>32. "Sariputta, there are these four kinds of generation. What are 
                      the four? Egg-born generation, womb-born generation, moisture-born 
                      generation and spontaneous generation.</p>
              <p>33. "What is egg-born generation? There are these beings born by 
                      breaking out of the shell of an egg; this is called egg-born generation.
                       What is womb-born generation? There are these beings born by breaking 
                      out from the caul; this is called womb-born generation. What is 
                      moisture-born generation? There are these beings born in a rotten fish, 
                      in a rotten corpse, in rotten dough, in a cesspit, or in a sewer; this 
                      is called moisture-born generation. What is spontaneous generation? 
                      There are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some 
                      beings in the lower worlds; this is called spontaneous generation. These
                       are the four kinds of generation.</p>

                  in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in

                  destination, in perdition, in hell, and is experiencing extremely

                  feelings.<a id="fnt-16" class="noteTag " name="fnt-16" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-16">[16]</a> Suppose there were a pond with clean, agreeable, cool water, 
                  transparent, with smooth banks, delightful, and nearby a dense wood; and
                   then a man scorched and exhausted by hot weather, weary, parched and 
                  thirsty, came by a path going in one way only and directed towards that 
                  same pond. Then a man with good sight on seeing him would say: 'This 
                  person so behaves... that he will come to this same pond'; and then 
                  later on he sees that he has plunged into the pond, bathed, drunk and 
                  relieved all his distress, fatigue and fever and has come out again and 
                  is sitting or lying in the wood [77] experiencing extremely pleasant 
                  feelings. So too, by encompassing mind with mind... extremely pleasant 
                  feelings. These are the five destinations.</p>
              <p>43. "Sariputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 
                  'The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction
                   in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama 
                  teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning, following his own 
                  line of inquiry as it occurs to him' — unless he abandons that assertion
                   and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as (surely as 
                  if he had been) carried off and put there he will wind up in hell. Just 
                  as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue, concentration and wisdom would here 
                  and now enjoy final knowledge, so it will happen in this case, I say, 
                  that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and 
                  relinquishes that view, then as (surely as if he had been) carried off 
                  and put there he will wind up in hell.</p>
              <h3>The Bodhisatta's Austerities</h3>
              <p>44. "Sariputta, I recall having lived a holy life possessing four 
                  factors. I have practiced asceticism — the extreme of asceticism; I have
                   practiced coarseness — the extreme of coarseness; I have practiced 
                  scrupulousness — the extreme of scrupulousness; I have practiced 
                  seclusion — the extreme of seclusion.<a id="fnt-17" class="noteTag " name="fnt-17" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-17">[17]</a></p>
              <p>45. "Such was my asceticism, Sariputta, that I went naked, rejecting 
                  conventions, licking my hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when 
                  asked; I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an 
                  invitation to a meal; I received nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across
                   a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together,
                   from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman lying 
                  with a man, from where food was advertised to be distributed, from where
                   a dog was waiting, from where flies were buzzing; I accepted no fish or
                   meat, I drank no liquor, wine or fermented brew. I kept to one house, 
                  to one morsel; I kept to two [78] houses, to two morsels;... I kept to 
                  seven houses, to seven morsels. I lived on one saucerful a day, on two 
                  saucerfuls a day... on seven saucerfuls a day; I took food once a day, 
                  once every two days... once every seven days, and so on up to once every
                   fortnight; I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated 
                  intervals. I was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or 
                  hide-parings or moss or ricebran or rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass 
                  or cowdung. I lived on forest roots and fruits, I fed on fallen fruits. I
                   clothed myself in hemp, in hemp-mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse 
                  rags, in tree bark, in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in 
                  kusa-grass fabric, in bark fabric, in wood-shavings fabric, in head-hair
                   wool, in animal wool, in owls' wings. I was one who pulled out hair and
                   beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. I was one 
                  who stood continuously, rejecting seats. I was one who squatted 
                  continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. I was one 
                  who used a mattress of spikes; I made a mattress of spikes my bed. I 
                  dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily 
                  including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing 
                  the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. Such was my 
                  asceticism.</p>
              <p>46. "Such was my coarseness, Sariputta, that just as the bole of a 
                  tinduka tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so too,
                   dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body and 
                  flaked off. It never occurred to me: 'Oh, let me rub this dust and dirt 
                  off with my hand, or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his 
                  hand' — it never occurred to me thus. Such was my coarseness.</p>
              <p>47. "Such was my scrupulousness, Sariputta, that I was always mindful
                   in stepping forwards and stepping backwards. I was full of pity even 
                  for (the beings in) a drop of water thus: 'Let me not hurt the tiny 
                  creatures in the crevices of the ground.' Such was my scrupulousness.</p>
              <p>48. "Such was my seclusion, Sariputta, that [79] I would plunge into 
                  some forest and dwell there. And when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or 
                  someone gathering grass or sticks, or a woodsman, I would flee from 
                  grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow, from 
                  hillock to hillock. Why was that? So that they should not see me or I 
                  see them. Just as a forest-bred deer, on seeing human beings, flees from
                   grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow, from 
                  hillock to hillock, so too, when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd... Such 
                  was my seclusion.</p>
              <p>49. "I would go on all fours to the cow-pens when the cattle had gone
                   out and the cowherd had left them, and I would feed on the dung of the 
                  young suckling calves. As long as my own excrement and urine lasted, I 
                  fed on my own excrement and urine. Such was my great distortion in 
                  feeding.</p>
              <p>50. "I would plunge into some awe-inspiring grove and dwell there — a
                   grove so awe-inspiring that normally it would make a man's hair stand 
                  up if he were not free from lust. When those cold wintry nights came 
                  during the 'eight-days interval of frost,' I would dwell by night in the
                   open and by day in the grove.<a id="fnt-18" class="noteTag " name="fnt-18" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-18">[18]</a> In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open 
                  and by night in the grove. And there came to me spontaneously this 
                  stanza never heard before:</p>
              <blockquote> Chilled by night and scorched by day,<br> Alone in awe-inspiring groves,<br> Naked, no fire to sit beside,<br> The sage yet pursues his quest. </blockquote>
              <p>51. "I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the 
                  dead for a pillow. And cowherd boys came up and spat on me, urinated on 
                  me, threw dirt at me, and poked sticks into my ears. Yet I do not recall
                   that I ever aroused an evil mind (of hate) against them. Such was my 
                  abiding in equanimity. [80]</p>
              <p>52. "Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmans whose 
                  doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about through food.'<a id="fnt-19" class="noteTag " name="fnt-19" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-19">[19]</a> They say: 'Let us live on kola-fruits,' and they eat kola-fruits, they 
                  eat kola-fruit powder, they drink kola-fruit water, and they make many 
                  kinds of kola-fruit concoctions. Now I recall having eaten a single 
                  kola-fruit a day. Sariputta, you may think that the kola-fruit was 
                  bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so: the kola-fruit was
                   then at most the same size as now. Through feeding on a single 
                  kola-fruit a day, my body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because
                   of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine 
                  stems or bamboo stems. Because of eating so little my backside became 
                  like a camel's hoof. Because of eating so little the projections on my 
                  spine stood forth like corded beads. Because of eating so little my ribs
                   jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn. 
                  Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their 
                  sockets, looking like a gleam of water which has sunk far down in a deep
                   well. Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a
                   green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun. Because of
                   eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if I 
                  touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone, and if I touched my 
                  backbone I encountered my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if I 
                  tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, 
                  rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.</p>
              <p>53-55. "Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmans whose 
                  doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about through food.' They
                   say: 'Let us live on beans'... 'Let us live on sesamum'... 'Let us live
                   on rice,' and they eat rice, they eat rice powder, [81] they drink rice
                   water, and they make various kinds of rice concoctions. Now I recall 
                  having eaten a single rice grain a day. Sariputta, you may think that 
                  the rice grain was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so:
                   the rice grain was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding 
                  on a single rice grain a day, my body reached a state of extreme 
                  emaciation. Because of eating so little... the hair, rotted at its 
                  roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.</p>
              <p>56. "Yet, Sariputta, by such conduct, by such practice, by such 
                  performance of austerities, I did not attain any superhuman states, any 
                  distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why was 
                  that? Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is 
                  noble and emancipating and leads the one who practices in accordance 
                  with it to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>
              <p>57. "Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmans whose 
                  doctrine and view is this: 'Purification comes about through the round 
                  of rebirths.' But it is impossible to find a realm in the round that I 
                  have not already [82] passed through in this long journey, except for 
                  the gods of the Pure Abodes; and had I passed through the round as a god
                   in the Pure Abodes, I would never have returned to this world.<a id="fnt-20" class="noteTag " name="fnt-20" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-20">[20]</a></p>
              <p>58. "There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view 
                  is this: 'Purification comes about through (some particular kind of) 
                  rebirth.' But it is impossible to find a kind of rebirth that I have not
                   been reborn in already in this long journey, except for the gods of the
                   Pure Abodes...</p>
              <p>59. "There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view 
                  is this: 'Purification comes about through (some particular) abode.' But
                   it is impossible to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt 
                  in... except for the gods of the Pure Abodes...</p>
              <p>60. "There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view 
                  is this: 'Purification comes about through sacrifice.' But it is 
                  impossible to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered
                   up by me in this long journey, when I was either a head-anointed noble 
                  king or a well-to-do-brahman.</p>
              <p>61. "There are certain recluses and brahmans whose doctrine and view 
                  is this: 'Purification comes about through fire-worship.' But it is 
                  impossible to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped 
                  by me in this long journey, when I was either a head-anointed noble king
                   or a well-to-do brahman.</p>
              <p>62. "Sariputta, there are certain recluses and brahmans whose 
                  doctrine and view is this: 'As long as this good man is still young, a 
                  black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime 
                  of life, so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom. But when this good 
                  man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the
                   last stage, being eighty, ninety or a hundred years old, then the 
                  lucidity of his wisdom is lost.' But it should not be regarded so. I am 
                  now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the 
                  last stage: my years have turned eighty. Now suppose that I had four 
                  disciples with a hundred years' lifespan, perfect in mindfulness, 
                  retentiveness, memory and lucidity of wisdom.<a id="fnt-21" class="noteTag " name="fnt-21" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-21">[21]</a> Just as a skilled archer, trained, practiced and tested, could easily 
                  shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose that they 
                  were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, [83] 
                  memory and lucidity of wisdom. Suppose that they continuously asked me 
                  about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when 
                  asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a 
                  subsidiary question or paused except to eat, drink, consume food, taste,
                   urinate, defecate and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tiredness.
                   Still the Tathagata's exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of 
                  factors of the Dhamma, and his replies to questions would not yet come 
                  to an end, but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred
                   years' lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years. 
                  Sariputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there will
                   be no change in the lucidity of the Tathagata's wisdom.</p>
              <p>63. "Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: 'A being not 
                  subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and 
                  happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, 
                  welfare and happiness of gods and humans,' it is of me indeed that 
                  rightly speaking this should be said."</p>
              <p>64. Now on that occasion the Venerable Nagasamala was standing behind the Blessed One fanning him.<a id="fnt-22" class="noteTag " name="fnt-22" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-22">[22]</a> Then he said to the Blessed One: "It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is
                   marvellous! As I listened to this discourse on the Dhamma, the hairs of
                   my body stood up. Venerable sir, what is the name of this discourse on 
                  the Dhamma?"</p>
              <p>"As to that, Nagasamala, you may remember this discourse on the Dhamma as 'The Hair-raising Discourse.' "<a id="fnt-23" class="noteTag " name="fnt-23" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html#fn-23">[23]</a></p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. The Venerable Nagasamala was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
