              Prisons</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">BD Dipananda Buddhistdoor Global | 2017-10-13 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">For the past three years, Buddhism has been the
              fastest-growing religion among prisoners in Scottish prisons. Data recently
              obtained via a Freedom of Information request, shows that 22 prisoners
              registered their religion as Buddhism in the past three years. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Prison chiefs could not say where these prisoners are housed
              or how many were Buddhist before 2014, however they do believe that the number
              has significantly increased over the past three years.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is so far unclear why the convicts converted to Buddhism.
              As once source noted: “It was a surprise to see so many cons professing their
              belief in a peaceful religion about karma and love. In the past, inmates have
              said they were Jewish or Muslim to get better food but it’s hard to see what’s
              behind the sudden surge in popularity of Buddhism.” However, it has been
              suggested that Buddhism might help the convicts come to terms with their
              incarceration and being removed from society, and the usual material pursuits.
              (Daily Record)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism has also been the fastest-growing religion in
              English prisons in the last decade, and many organizations are now teaching
              mindfulness-based meditation programs to prisoners, including Angulimala; a
              Buddhist prison chaplaincy organization in the UK, with the stated
              objective:  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">To make available facilities for the teaching and practice of
              Buddhism in Her Majesty’s Prisons and other places of lawful detention or
              custody, specifically:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">1. To recruit and advise a team of Buddhist visiting
              chaplains to be available as soon as there is a call for their services;</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">2. To act in an advisory capacity, and to liaise with the
              Home Office chaplaincy officials with individuals’ chaplains within her
              majesty’s prisons, and with any other relevant bodies or officials; and</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">3. To provide an aftercare and advisory service for prisoners
              after release. (Angulimala)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The name Angulimala comes from the Buddhist sutras.
              Angulimala was a robber and murderer whose name was derived from the garland he
              made of his victims’ fingers, which he wore around his neck (Angulimala
              literally means “finger garland”). One day, the Buddha passed by and Angulimala
              tried to chase the Buddha to kill him, but could not catch up, even though the
              Buddha was walking at his usual pace. After some time, Angulimala stopped in
              his tracks and shouted, “Stop!” at the Buddha. To which the Buddha responded
              that he had already stopped—he had stopped harming and killing and told
              Angulimala that now it was his turn to “stop.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">These words struck Angulimala to the extent that he did
              indeed “stop.” He threw down his weapons and followed the Buddha, becoming a
              monk and eventually attaining enlightenment. It is from this parable that the
              Buddhist Prison Chaplaincy Organization in England takes its name. (Community of
              Interbeing)â€‹</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">British monk Venerable Khemadhammo founded Angulimala in
              1985, and has since introduced Buddhism to more than 100 prisons throughout
              England, and since 1999 to numerous prisons in Scotland. According to Venerable
              Khemadhammo, it is not only prisoners who are imprisoned; everyone, including
              monastics, is imprisoned by their own greed, ignorance, prejudices, aversione,
              and attachments.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“It was my belief then, as it is now, that Buddhist
              techniques equip us with the means to escape that imprisonment and enjoy a
              secure and lasting peace,” said Venerable Khemadhammo. (Bangkok Post)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Dick Allen, a former prison chaplain with Angulimala who had
              been visiting prisons for nine years, observed that in his experience
              Angulimala helps not only the prisoners, but also Buddhists on the outside.
              Working for the organization and visiting the prisons has helped Allen along
              the path, and no doubt the activities of Angulimala will be a source of
              inspiration for many others. (Community of Interbeing)</span></p>
