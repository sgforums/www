              <p>i don't know about the buddhist teachings because i'm not a buddhist, but from an objective point of view, if the sacrifice of these animals are for the good of mankind in the form of medical breakthroughs, then i thinkit is fine.</p>

              <p>What's done has already been done. Stop it if possible. What can be done is to generate merits and dedicate to the  animals  and do self-repetance.</p>
              <p>Switch to a new job if possible. Even if we dont talk about any dharma , karma will still exists.</p>

              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The purpose of this post is to gather insight and raise awareness about animals being use for scientific purpose. I condemned the use of animals for research purpose; however we must be aware virtually every medical achievement of the last century has depended directly or indirectly on research with animals.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Perhaps whenever we receive medication and medical treatment, it is a good idea to dedicate merits to the animals that have make medical breakthrough possible.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I have recently turned down a job offer to work in an animal research lab opting to work in another place with a lower pay.</span></p>
