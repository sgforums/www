              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ezra Bayda SPRING 2009 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Ezra Bayda teaches that by truly knowing our fears, we can
              break their spell</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When things upset us, we often think that something is wrong.
              Perhaps the one time this is truest is when we experience fear. In fact, as
              human beings, we expend a huge portion of our energy dealing with anxiety and
              fear. This has certainly been apparent in the present economic upheavals and
              the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We live with an everyday reality that is
              tinged with personal and cultural anxiety. Our fears are not just the product
              of global events, however—they go to our very core. On a day-to-day level, fear
              often motivates how we act and react, and sometimes even how we dress or stand
              or talk. But fear makes our life narrow and dark. It is at the root of all
              conflict, underlying much of our sorrow. Fear also blocks intimacy and love
              and, more than anything, disconnects us from the lovingkindness that is our
              true nature.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Even considering how prevalent fear is in our lives, it
              nonetheless remains one of the murkiest areas to deal with, in daily life as
              well as in practice. This may sound bleak, but what is really the worst thing
              about fear? Though it is hard to admit, especially if we see ourselves as deeply
              spiritual, the main reason we have an aversion to fear is that it is physically
              and emotionally uncomfortable. Woody Allen put this quite well when he said, “I
              don’t like to be afraid—it scares me.” We simply don’t want to feel this
              discomfort and will do almost anything to avoid it. But whenever we give in to
              fear, we make it more solid, and our life becomes smaller, more limited, more
              contracted. In a way, every time we give in to fear, we cease to truly live.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We’re often not aware of the extent to which fear plays a
              part in our lives, which means that the first stage of practicing with fear
              requires acknowledging its presence. This can prove to be difficult, because
              many fears may not be readily apparent, such as the fear driving our ambition,
              the fear underlying our depression, or, perhaps most of all, the fear beneath
              our anger. But the fact is, once we look beyond our surface emotional reaction,
              we will see that almost every negative emotion, every drama, comes down to one
              or more of the three most basic fears: the fear of losing safety and control,
              the fear of aloneness and disconnection, and the fear of unworthiness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The second basic fear is that of aloneness and disconnection,
              which we also can feel as the fear of abandonment, loss, or death. Our fundamental
              aloneness, which is a basic human experience, ultimately must be faced
              directly, or it will continue to dictate how we feel and live. The first most
              basic fear is that of losing safety. Because safety is fundamental to our
              survival, this fear will instinctually be triggered at the first sign of danger
              or insecurity; the old brain, or limbic system, is inherently wired that way.
              This particular fear will also be triggered when we experience pain or
              discomfort. But in most cases, there is no real danger to us; in fact, our
              fears are largely imaginary— that the plane will crash, that we will be
              criticized, that we’re doing it wrong. Yet until we see this dimension of fear
              with clarity, we will continue to live with a sense of constriction that can seem
              daunting.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">A central component of spiritual life is recognizing that
              practice is not about ensuring that we feel secure or comfortable. It’s not
              that we won’t feel these things when we practice; rather, it’s that we are also
              bound to sometimes feel very uncomfortable and insecure, particularly when
              exploring and working with our darker emotions and unhealed pain. Still, there
              is also a deep security developed over the course of a practice life that isn’t
              likely to resemble the immediate comfort we usually crave. This fundamental
              security develops instead out of the willingness to stay with and truly
              experience our fears. Isn’t it ironic that the path to real security comes from
              residing in the fear of insecurity itself?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Insecurity can also manifest as the fear of helplessness,
              often surfacing as the fear of losing control, the fear of being controlled,
              the fear of chaos, or even the fear of the unfamiliar. For example, nearly all
              of us have experienced the emotion of rage, which is like being swept into a
              mushroom cloud explosion. Think of the kind of day when nothing seems to go
              your way, or even just the last time your TV remote stopped working and no
              matter what buttons you pushed, you couldn’t get it to do what you wanted. The
              urge to throw the remote against the wall can feel like angry rage, but as we
              bring awareness to this experience, we can discover that the feeling of rage is
              often just an outer explosion covering over the quieter inner implosion of
              feeling powerless. Rage may give us a feeling of power and control, but how
              often is it an evasion of the sense of powerlessness that feels so much worse?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We all dread the helplessness of losing control, and yet real
              freedom lies in recognizing the futility of demanding that life be within our
              control. Instead, we must learn the willingness to feel—to say yes to—the
              experience of helplessness itself. This is one of the hidden gifts of serious
              illness or loss. It pushes us right to our edge, where we may have the good
              fortune to realize that our only real option is to surrender to our experience
              and let it just be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">During a three-year period in the early 1990s when I was
              seriously ill with no indication that I would ever get better, I watched my
              life as I had known it begin to fall apart. I not only lost my ability to work
              and engage in physical activities, I also experienced a dismantling of my basic
              identities. At first, it was disorienting and frightening not to have the props
              of seeing myself as a Zen practitioner, a carpenter and contractor (my
              livelihood), a husband and a father. But as I stayed with the fears, and
              particularly as I was able to bring the quality of lovingkindness to the
              experience, there came a dramatic shift.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As the illusory self-images were stripped away, I experienced
              the freedom of not needing to be anyone at all. By truly surrendering to the
              experience of helplessness, by letting everything I clung to just fall apart, I
              found that what remained was more than enough. As we learn to breathe fear into
              the center of the chest, the heart feels more and more spacious. I’m not
              talking about the heart as a muscle in our chest, but rather the heart that is
              our true nature. This heart is more spacious than the mind can ever imagine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It’s interesting that one of life’s most vital lessons is
              something we are never taught in school: how to be at home with ourselves. When
              I first began going to meditation retreats, where there was no talking or
              social contact for days on end, I would sit facing the wall hour after hour,
              and invariably an anxious quiver rose up inside me. Sometimes it was so strong
              that I literally wanted to jump out of my skin. But just sitting there, doing
              nothing, brought me face to face with myself, with my fear of aloneness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Most people will almost instinctively try to avoid this fear.
              Many enter into relationships or engage in affairs. In fact, the extent to
              which people have affairs is often proportional to the urgency of needing to
              avoid feeling alone. However, the only way to transcend loneliness is to stop
              avoiding it, to be willing to face it—by truly residing in it. Further, if we wish
              to develop genuine intimacy in our relationships with others, it is crucial
              that we first face our own neediness and fear of aloneness. How can we expect
              to truly love or be intimate with another if we’re still relating to them from
              our fear-based needs?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Naturally, we still want and expect other people to take away
              these fears; we think that if we’re with someone who will pay attention to us,
              our loneliness will disappear. But if this particular deep-seated fear is part
              of our makeup, the mere act of our partner being engrossed in a book when we’re
              expecting attention will be enough to make us feel abandoned. We may try to
              deal with this by demanding or attempting to attract his or her attention, but
              even if that demand is met, our fear is unlikely to be assuaged for long.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Furthermore, getting the attention we desire does not
              necessarily mean we will experience intimacy. True intimacy comes instead when
              we’re willing to acknowledge the uncomfortable feelings of anxiety and fear
              that are part of our own conditioning; it comes when we can say yes to them,
              which means we’re willing to finally feel them. It may be uncomfortable to feel
              the fear of loneliness, but breathing that aching fear into the center of the
              chest and surrendering to it allows us to take responsibility for our own
              feelings. We no longer ask that others protect us from feeling these fears we
              had previously turned away from. We can discover that the more we face our own
              fear of aloneness, the more we experience true connection, and the more we can
              open to love.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The basic fear of aloneness may also include a related
              anxiety that is not usually recognized: the fear of disconnection— from others
              as well as from our own heart. This fear penetrates more deeply than loneliness
              and often manifests as a knotted quiver in the chest or abdomen. Remember, at
              bottom, the heart that seeks to awaken, to live genuinely, is more real than
              anything. It is the nameless drive that calls us to be who we most truly are.
              When we are not in touch with this, we may feel the existential anxiety of
              disconnection.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In a way, much of spiritual practice is geared toward helping
              us address our feeling of basic separation. How does this occur? First, we
              acknowledge our fear and see it clearly for what it is. We need to remember
              that the fear is, in fact, our path itself, our direct route to experiencing
              the lovingkindness at our core.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Then we must face the fear directly, saying yes to it.
              Essentially, this means we are willing to experience it—to sit with anxiety in
              the center of the chest and truly feel— rather than run away from it. When fear
              arises, in order to replace our usual dread with a genuine curiosity, we might
              ask, “Here it is again, how will it be this time?” As we breathe the sensations
              of anxiety into the heart, our familiar thought-based stories begin to
              dissolve. As we get out of our heads, we can experience the spaciousness of the
              nonconceptual: the healing power of the heart. No longer caught in fear or our
              sense of separateness, we are free to experience connectedness, which is our
              basic birthright and comes forth naturally on its own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The third basic fear is that of unworthiness. This fear takes
              many forms, such as the fear that I don’t count, the fear of general
              inadequacy, of being unworthy of love, of being nothing or stupid, and so on.
              The basic fear that we’ll never measure up dictates much of our behavior; for
              example, for some, it impels us to continuously and forcefully prove ourselves,
              while for others, it might prompt us to cease trying. In either case, isn’t our
              motivation the same: to avoid facing the basic fear of unworthiness? We may
              fear the feeling of unworthiness more than anything.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In fact, we are often merciless in these self-judgments of
              unworthiness—not just when we’re upset at ourselves, but as an ongoing frame of
              mind. Even if they’re not glaringly obvious, our self-judgments are always
              lurking under the surface, waiting to arise. For example, those who have stage
              fright, including the anxiety of public speaking, may feel the constant underground
              dread of having to deal with it. There’s a joke that people can fear public
              speaking so intensely that at a funeral they would rather be in the casket than
              give the eulogy. I can attest to the lurking dread of stage fright, as I had to
              face this particular fear for years. And yet ultimately giving public talks has
              been a very fruitful path.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Fear of public speaking triggers the dread and shame of
              public failure and humiliation. But what is really being threatened? Isn’t it
              just our self-image of appearing strong, calm, insightful, or whatever our own
              particular narrow view is of who we’re supposed to be? We certainly fear
              appearing weak or not on top of it. Why? Because that would confirm our own
              negative beliefs of unworthiness. Even though there is no real danger, isn’t it
              true that the fear of failing often feels fatal? Yet ironically, our very
              attempt to fight the fear is most often what increases it and may even result
              in panic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is a better alternative: We must learn to let it in
              willingly, to breathe the sensations of fear directly into the center of the
              chest. In other words, to say yes to the fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At one point in my life, when I was struggling with my fear
              of giving public talks, I joined Toastmasters, a group designed to help develop
              skills in public speaking. But I didn’t join to learn to give better talks, or
              even with the goal of overcoming my fear. I joined so that I could have a
              laboratory, a place to invite the fear in and go to its roots. In a way, I
              actually began to look forward to the fear arising so I could breathe it right
              into the heart, entering into it fully. Paradoxically, the willingness to be
              with the fear completely is what changes the experience of fear altogether.
              It’s not that fear will no longer arise; it’s that we no longer fear it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Eventually, we all need to be willing to face the deepest,
              darkest beliefs we have about ourselves. Only in this way can we come to know
              that they are only beliefs, and not the truth about who we are. By entering
              into this process willingly, by seeing through the fiction of who we believe
              ourselves to be, we can connect with our true nature. As Nietzsche put it, “One
              must have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.” Love is the
              dancing star, the fruit of saying yes, of consciously and willingly facing our
              fears.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When we can feel fear within the spaciousness of the breath
              and heart, we may even come to see it more as an adventure than a nightmare. To
              see it as an adventure means being willing to take the ride with curiosity,
              even with its inevitable ups and downs. Over the years, because I had to speak
              in public quite frequently, this situation provided an opportunity to tap into
              what was really important to me—to remember that my aspiration is to learn to
              live from the awakened heart. Whenever I remembered this right before giving a
              talk, it was no longer an issue of whether or not I felt the discomfort of
              fear. This allowed me to say yes to it and to willingly breathe the fear right
              in. In other words, when we connect with a larger sense of what life is,
              negative beliefs such as “I’ll never measure up” may still come up, but they no
              longer dictate who we are. Instead, we begin to use the fear as our actual path
              to learning to live from lovingkindness.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Remember, it’s a given that we don’t want to feel the fear of
              unworthiness, but at some point we have to understand that it’s more painful to
              try to suppress our fears and self-judgments, thus solidifying them, than it is
              to actually feel them. This is part of what it means to bring lovingkindness to
              our practice, because we are no longer viewing our fear as proof that we’re
              defective. Without cultivating love for ourselves, regardless of how much
              discipline we have, regardless of how serious we are about practice, we will
              still stay stuck in the subtle mercilessness of the mind, listening to the
              voice that tells us we are basically and fundamentally unworthy. We should
              never underestimate the need for lovingkindness on the long and sometimes
              daunting path of learning to awaken.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Please note that these three basic fears—insecurity and
              helplessness, aloneness and disconnection, and unworthiness— are not just
              mental. Scientists tell us that fear is written into the cellular memory of the
              body, particularly into a small part of the brain called the amygdala. That is
              why simply knowing about our fears intellectually will not free us from their
              domination. Every time they are triggered, we slide into an established groove
              in the brain. So until we can see our fears clearly, we will not be able to
              practice with them directly.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When I was a child, my father told me repeatedly, “The only
              thing to fear is fear itself.” Although his intentions were good, what I
              actually heard was that I should be afraid of fear! Fear thus became the enemy.
              We have to remember that fear is neither an enemy nor an obstacle; it is not a
              real monster. When we feel fear, we need to remind ourselves that it is our
              path; and when we truly understand this, we can welcome it into the
              spaciousness of the heart.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Interestingly, it is this nonconceptual experiencing of our
              fears that allows the grooves in the brain, which are preprogrammed to react to
              fear, to slowly be filled in. How this works is a mystery; it is no mystery,
              however, that unless we can clearly see our individual fears for what they are,
              it is unlikely we will overcome our habitual and instinctive aversions to them.
              The bright side of this is that once we are able to face our fears, once we
              willingly let them in, they become a portal to reality.</span></p>
