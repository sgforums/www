              <p>Hi guys.</p>
              <p>I read this from Master Chin Kung</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anger is like a fire, being one of the three poisons. Once a person's anger flares up, all the merit and virtues accumulated from years of diligent cultivation completely disintegrate, sending the practitioner back to square one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As the above, if one person really flares up, the virtues and merit will be gone?</p>
              <p>I am a person prone to anger.</p>
              <p>How do we prevent ourself from being angry.</p>
              <p>What if you are cultivating and people intentionally want to stir you up and make you angry</p>

              <p>There are several ways:</p>
              <p>1. Think of these people as your benefactors, for they lessen your karmic debt.</p>
              <p>2. Think of them as a test to your results of your cultivation. I.e. If I am training for my 2.4km run in my upcoming IPPT, I cannot be 'angry' to a stop watch for showing that I took 14.5min to finish the 2.4km (fail IPPT!)</p>
              <p>3. Try some loving-kindness meditation. However I personally haven't tried this before. I am sure more learned people can advise on this.</p>

              <p>Hi Forest-Gump,</p>
              <p>Yah, not easy to keep our cool espescially when the provocation is intentional. Everyone has given well advices ( except Kcockicht, not becos it's bad but  becos I dunno what he's talking about <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/confused.png" alt="confused.png">... but i think finally what he advocated is still correct ie. "don't angry lah." ). </p>
              <p>Anyway, i hv a simple way to share with u. I think this work quite alright for ppl like me who are not so cultivated yet, or still struggling on the practice. </p>
              <p>First, I always recalled those angry ppl's face and their body reactions -  they are almost always hysterical, unreasonable and usually their angry faces are distorted, suddendly became quite ugly even for otherwise attractive ppl... so sad, u know. Then I wld realise on the spot that I definitely don't wish to be like that! My rising anger wld quickly  subduced. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Or just remind yourself what you've realised above that when one flares up, all his merits and virtues gone, then you wld know that such anger is not worth it at all. It's like some hooligans keep shouting at us and we try to hit them by throwing at them all the gold bars that we've saved all our lives; well, they will keep your gold bars then continue their shouting game. Not worth it. There are other intelligent ways to solve the situation.</p>
              <p>Not easy at first, but can try and together with the other practice suggested by the rest above, one day u wld be able to deal with any situation with a super cool head.No need my D.I.Y methods anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br>Yes metta helps. Being more self-awared, mindful of your bodily action, speech and thought could help one avoiding unwholesome actions and to be clear-headed. If you can, you can try generating compassionate towards the people who have harmed you. Those people who have deliberately attempted to provoke you, are also your parents and friends in the past life. They have also been kind to you. No one in the world is bad or good. It is a matter of perspective These people have done something good for others and perhaps even for you before.</p>

              <h4><a name="patience"></a>PATIENCE - THE MAIN ANTIDOTE</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Patience is the main antidote to anger. As common wisdom says: 
                      just count to 100... During this time, any of the below methods can be 
                      effective. The most effective method will depend on the actual situation. 
                      Especially in our age of rush and intense change, patience may not be seen as a 
                      positive quality, but take a minute to think impatience can easily give rise to 
                      a general feeling of anger.</p>
              <p>Patience is like a beautiful ornament. When you become a person 
                      with great patience, it brings a certain element of charm to your life. You are 
                      loved by others, and you give no problems to your friends. You bring an element 
                      of joy, happiness, and calmness to other people's lives - your friends, your 
                      family, and the community. You do not have to ask to be accepted; everyone longs 
                      for your presence. Everyone looks up to you and respects you, not because you 
                      have worked for that or expected it, not because you were competing for their 
                      favor, but simply because of the nature of patience. You are respected and 
                      trusted, and you acquire dignity with the practice of patience. When you are 
                      honored, it is with sincerity, and it is something you can live up to.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>...Just hearing about patience does not mean you are 
                      experiencing it now or will easily develop it. To lay the ground for training 
                      the mind, you must first tame the mind. To tame the mind, it is extremely 
                      important to do the basic shamata [tranquility meditation, calm abiding] 
                      practice, which develops calmness and tranquility. Then you can add the practice 
                      of patience, understanding the benefits of patience and reminding yourself to 
                      take advantage of the available antidotes.<br><em>From <a href="http://www.snowlionpub.com/store/store.cgi?affiliate=International_Kalachakra_Network&amp;page=pages/DHPA.php">Dharma
