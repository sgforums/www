              <p>Hello all,</p>
              <p>Do all fears stem from the fear of death?  If that is the case, then it would imply that once we overcome the fear of death, all other fears cease to exist.  Is that correct?</p>
              <p>I would like to hear your views on this, especially those of you who have gained much wisdom in your practice.  Thank you.</p>

              <p>No... you can fear not getting your good exam results, not getting your bonus, you can fear the pain of thorn going into your leg, whatever. A lot of kinds of fear :)</p>
              <p>Basically, all fear stems from insecurity, and is one of those emotions linked to sense of self. Insecurity arises due to attachment to possessiveness, 'I', me, mine... when you have I, me, mine, and insecurity arises when 'I' feel insecure about 'me', 'my situation', 'my things', 'my future', etc...</p>
              <p>You know when you drink alcohol (not that I recommend it), you feel very brave. You dare to do things, approach girls... whatever. Why? Because of blood circulation etc... due to secondary conditions you feel strong, you don't feel weak, you don't feel insecure. So there are a lot of conditions that make you feel fear. If you feel weak, you feel insecure and fearful.</p>
              <p>So, if you feel secure, you will not have fear. Even if you have sense of self and you feel secure, you won't fear... you will feel brave.</p>
              <p>But if you have no more attachment to 'I', 'me', 'mine' you also won't feel fear anymore... and that is cutting the roots of afflictions. You don't need alcohol or adrenaline or a big ego... naturally you become fearless.</p>

              <p><br>I see, thank you, AEN.  Fear stems from our false sense of self then.</p>
              <p>A follow up question: All human beings and animals have a built-in sense of self preservation (eg. avoiding dangerous situations, not going to near a fire, etc)  Is this also due to our false sense of self too?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Behind the facade of self is the fear of the death of one's mind! As long as there is no consious self-destruction of one's persona, roles, individuality, the fear will always be there. ''Self'' is useful in the marketplace, business and so on so forth - however, when it is identified with and is made to be an aspect of oneself (one's beliefs, traditions image,  - security thru this mental construct of oneself and attachment to roles -  it is the fear of loss of these roles and ... maintaining a ficiton (mind constructs of life, love, ....) is tenuous. It is not existential but psychological and it does not exist!</div>
