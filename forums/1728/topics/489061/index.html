              Conversion Controversy</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span class="date"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> July 5th, 2015</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;"> <span class="articleheader">Ritu Raj Subedi</span> Lankaweb</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">British ambassador to Nepal Andrew Sparkes has sparked
              a storm of controversies. In his open letter to the Constituent Assembly
              members, he egged them on for ensuring the right to conversion in the new
              statute. His comment came at a time when a considerable size of Nepali
              population is smouldering against the decision to turn the Hindu nation into a
              secular state in 2006 and when the Himalayan nation has been struggling to have
              a new constitution. The first CA collapsed without delivering the statute and
              the second one is seemingly heading for the similar fate. The major parties are
              sharply divided and are unable to forge consensus on the thorny issues of the
              statute. Anybody can experience Nepal’s precarious political dilemma. And at
              this sensitive phase of transition, British envoy just threw a stone into the
              troubled waters only to raise the eyebrows of many.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Controversial Remark</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Although his embassy regretted his controversial
              remark, it riled the masses that have kept mum until recently over the growing
              interventionist acts of the foreign players on the Nepalese soil. When Nepal
              was declared a secular state, a section of people had registered their silent
              opposition to the move. They had a plausible argument- secularism was
              introduced without due and democratic procedure and without consulting over 80
              per cent Hindu population of the country. That Nepal was made secular state at
              the behest of the foreign elements has been their central line of logic, and
              the major parties have failed to furnish their credible answers to them. They
              have been demanding a referendum to settle the dispute. At a time when the
              parties could not justify that their decision to usher Nepal into secular state
              was transparent and based on popular mandate, Sparkes’ statement only gave
              credence to a polemic that Nepal’s secular and federal journey was taking place
              under a diabolic design of the foreign power centres.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since Nepal became secular, hundreds of thousands of
              ‘innocent people’ reportedly converted to the Christian followers through
              ‘monetary inducements.’ That Nepal has become a fertile ground for the
              conversion of sweeping scale has been justified by none other than a Christian
              organisation.  According to the Center for the Study of Global
              Christianity, Nepal is the fastest Christianity growing country in the world.
              In its report published in 2013, the Centre said that Nepal topped the list of
              20 countries that have the highest percentage of Christianity Average Annual
              Growth Rate (AAGR).  Nepal registered 10.93 per cent Christian AAGR
              followed by China, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Centre
              predicts that the Christian population in Nepal will double within six and a
              half years. In 1970, the number of Christian followers here stood at 0.1 per
              cent and it will reach 3.8 per cent in 2020, it states. It is estimated that
              the Christian followers are around 2 per cent. It is interesting to note that
              net Christian conversion rate was 8.74 per cent against 2.19 per cent
              population growth rate in Nepal. It said that the primary growth factor in Asia
              is massive conversion. “China, Nepal, Cambodia and Mongolia have high
              conversation rates among their indigenous people.  The majority of
              becoming Christians comes from non-religious, Buddhist and Hindu backgrounds,”
              the Centre said.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Under his ‘Look East Policy,’ the Pope of Vatican had
              reportedly vowed to bring 100 million people in Asia to the fold of
              Christianity by 2025. Is Sparkes’s tendentious plea for inserting the right to
              conversion provision in the new statute the part of Pope’s pledge? This mission
              cannot be met just placing a Bible or Christian literature in the hand of its
              prospective followers. It is not that the people must be bribed to make them
              tergiversate. The number of people, who change their faith voluntarily or after
              gaining enlightenment from other religions, may not be higher.  Until
              certain enticements and inducements are offered to the people, a large scale of
              conversion is not possible. As the above report disclosed, the rate of
              conversion is high among the indigenous people. There cannot be any suitable
              constituency than the ethnic, Dalit and impoverished hinterland for the
              religious hawks to prey on. There has long been perceived doubt that some
              Western nations are funding for the conversions in a clandestine manner and the
              report has corroborate this misgiving. The critics of conversion have argued
              that the ethnic movement and the conversion drive in Nepal have become two
              facets of the same coin because the funding for the two campaigns comes from
              the same sources. It is claimed that <em>the Nepal Transition to Peace Fund</em> that is backed by some Nordic and Western European nations are promoting
              ethnic/indigenous cause and Christianity in Nepal simultaneously.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Secularism simply means that the state detaches itself
              from any religious affairs. It is beyond doubt that religious freedom is a
              prerequisite for a healthy democratic and multicultural society. But, it is a
              gross mistake to use secularism as a license for conversion. Here is a sheer
              irony – many of the western nations are not secular but their diplomats here
              lecture us to be secular to the extent that the mission of the Vatican can be
              easily achieved. Envoy Sparkes and his country, the UK, is a glaring example.
              The UK that has 59 per cent of Christian population does not have a written
              constitution but its political tradition strongly suggests that it is not a
              secular nation. The Queen is the head of the Church of England. She, as per the
              recommendation of the Prime Minister, appoints 15 representatives of the Church
              of England to the House of Lords.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mind Your Own Business</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There is another classic example to show how
              anti-secular the UK is. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair was Catholic
              but when he became the Prime Minister, he converted himself to Protestant
              because he did not want to come into conflict with the Protestant Queen. He was
              a Protestant throughout his PM tenure. One month before he was to leave office,
              he visited the Pope in Rome, narrated his story and sought suggestion from him,
              “I want to be Catholic again. Could I be?” “Yes, you can adopt your previous
              faith,” the master of the Vatican had given the nod. Tony became Catholic
              again. This religious saga of Britain’s once famed Prime Minister speaks
              volumes that every nation has its own cultural value and system that guides the
              politics and entire society. When the Prime Minister of his own nation had to
              go through the rigmarole of religion to serve his office in the Downing Street,
              How did envoy Sparkes gather moral authority to remind us about the UN Charter
              on religious right and preach us  to do this or that in the new
              constitution? It would be wise if our foreign diplomats minded their own
              business and let our transitional politics take its own course.</span></p>
