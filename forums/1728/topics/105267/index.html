            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all,<br><br>I am not a Buddhist, but will still like to know the opinions of others, especially highly aware meditators.... on this topic. Thanks.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>_____________________________<br><br>We often create mental self-images about ourselves... That is 'I am kind, good, smart, etc, etc'... and totally believed that the image is the 'complete me'. However, when on a spiritual path, one begins to be confronted by their hitherto unknown 'dark aspects'. At first, we deny that we could conjure up such dark thoughts. In time, we begin to accept that underneath the 'light side', there are denied (do not want to admit) sides that we have judged as 'bad'. These so-called bad sides were as quickly brushed aside as they pop out into the mind. Now, they did not really go away but went undercover into the subconscious.<br><br>So, I think the problem was that a person created a self-image of himself/herself far too early. This self-image is like a template Front-end mask that the person believe he/she must be. So any disagreeable thoughts were shove under the rug, even away from the conscious mind.<br><br>Â“The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.Â”<br>Dr Carl Jung<br><br>If the above-mentioned law works, then any subconscious aspect will seek to be make known. Thus we experience the subconscious aspect as external of us. This aspects gets projected as external experiences. This is similar to karma.<br><br>I also believe that physical incarnations are meant for trying out certain things. The trying out is part of the learning process. By experience, a being knows the result and can then make decisions about it. Such as ' will doing this cause suffering?...' It  learns from his experiences. He learns what is beneficial, what's not.<br><br>So essentially, Earth life is experiential. The so-call dark are learning as well. By experiencing the other side of the coin, it learns how it feels like to be at the receiving end of his own treatment. All (light and dark) are both learning to create the most harmonious form of existence through experiences.<br><br>In my opinion: This life on Earth is not just about being light or dark, but about striving for the most harmonious/natural way of being through gaining experience from forays into light/dark scenarios. And the end result is often tinted with compassion, because compassion is understanding how it feels like to suffer.<br><br>From my experience, if one becomes totally devoid of worries and fears and his/her awareness can rest at a point to see the thoughts without judging them, we experience a kind of joy that is tinted with love. This is what I meant by Big Light.</div>
