There is indeed the claim that people get enlightened after going through the process, an initial enlightenment. I do not think it will happen to everyone, though it is possible... but not very likely. (at least not 'less than two hours')<br><br>But anyway really, when we watch a video or read a book about enlightenment, drop all expectations of something happening. The sutras have always said there is 'no attainment' (the idea of attainment is just the function of the illusory sense of self) That is just more ego in disguise of spiritual seeking. It is just a presently arising thought by no one... notice it as it arise.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">You are already in reality, whether you <span style="font-style: italic;">see</span> it or not.

It's not "out there" somewhere, but right here.<br><br>This provides us with the chance to wake up. You have this chance to wake up right now, in this moment, and in every moment. Thus enlightenment is already yours.<br><br>Most of us tend to think - and have been taught - that it's the other way around, that we've got to figure something out. But no. We don't need to fgure out our own experience; it's already here, firsthand.<br><br>You are already enlightened.

Nirvana transcends all samsaric realms. One who is liberated is no longer in the wheel of rebirth. And also, enlightened people are humans... they don't turn into angels or grow wings or necessarily have halos around their heads.<br><br>There are countless people who are enlightened since Buddha's lifetime, including many people in this forum. JonLS is also enlightened, btw. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> He has spoken about his experiences in our forum previously.<br><br>(though not necessarily Buddhahood or complete liberation yet, as there are many stages... the arhat path has 4 stages of enlightenment, the bodhisattva path has 10)<br><br>In <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=285256" rel="nofollow">&gt;I am already a good person, why must I practise dharma?</a><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>Translation:<br><br>[b]The Best of the Best must still practice Buddhism</strong><br><br>Q: I'm living without problems with clothes and food, I treat others well, others treat me well, my life is happy, why should I practice Buddhism?<br><br>A: You treat others well, others treat you well, your marriage's relationship is very well, life is happy, but there is something you cannot do and cannot say: "the present is very well, so I will not get sick, I will not die." We should know that to practice Buddhism, most importantly is to liberate from birth and death, seek liberation, open our wisdom, walk the Bodhisattva way, that is why we still have to practice Buddhism, learn (to be like a) Bodhisattva. Though your life is well, but you are now in the human realm, if you want it to be better, you can seek rebirth in heaven, for that you have to practice the 10 virtuous deeds and avoid doing any evil deeds. But to be further, though ascending to the heavens is better, it is not ultimate, for when your celestial blessings have finished, you will still fall, so how? We have to seek liberation, walk the Bodhisattva way, until attaining Buddhahood -- that is the best and most ultimate, that is why all worldly beings must practice Buddhism.[/b]</blockquote>and my previous post quite a long time ago:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...What "circle" or "cycle of life and death" means in Buddhism, is that sentient beings are constantly being reborn in Samsara - the world of sufferings. They are always reborn again and again in the 6 realms of existence in samsara, according to their karma. Samsaric existence is full of pain and sufferings, even in the Human Existence we have to go through Birth, Ageing, Sickness and Death, and the eight distresses. But even if you are born in a royal family, or even in the celestial/heaven realms, samsaric pleasures are still disatisfactory because of its transiency/impermanence... and by attaching to these transient pleasures thinking they are real and truly existent, permanent, we create even more sufferings. We suffer as we do not know that all compounded phenomena are empty of inherent, permanent, separate existence... and that all arises out of conditions and are always transient. Therefore the Buddha taught that suffering and disatisfactoriness is a fundamental truth in life (i.e first noble truth), however he also teaches the cause of suffering and the solution (second, third, fourth noble truth), the path leading to the liberation from these sufferings.<br><br>Sentient beings cannot become liberated from samsara because they are tied down by the bondage of their ignorance and karmic propensities... due to an illusion of duality (means subject-object separation) or a false sense of self, sentient beings are constantly grasping on things and craving for samsaric pleasures and existence, thus undergoing never ending suffering. Not only are we being reborn lifetime are lifetime, we are constantly reborn moment after moment even in this very life. This is because of our illusion and attachment to our 'self' and our sentient thoughts (our identification and attachment to thoughts and things caused by ignorance), and the process of identification with a 'self' is continued without an ending until we attain insights and enlightenment. To gain these insights we have to practise the eightfold path in our lives.<br><br>So therefore in Buddhism, Buddha showed us the path leading to the complete ending of all sufferings, finding the abiding purity and bliss of Nirvana, to become liberated from the cycle of rebirth in Samsara. Buddha taught that the Buddhas of past and future all teach Buddhism as "avoid all evil, doing all good, and purifying the mind". Most religions only teach "avoid all evil and doing all good", but only Buddhism teaches about liberation and the purification of the mind. The problem with just "avoiding all evil and doing all good" is that as a result we accumulate a lot of good karma and avoid creating bad karma, meaning we can be reborn in the higher realms or even the celestial realms like the heavens, however we still cannot attain nirvana, we cannot be liberated from the cycle of samsara.. and our enjoyment in these higher realms are also limited and transient. Similarly as described just now even if our lives are very good, there is still bound to be unsatisfactoriness and sufferings.. if we cannot be liberated moment to moment. Therefore when we practise Buddhism, also we practise purification of the mind... through mindfulness we become aware of and disidentify from all our sentient thoughts, our habitual tendencies of the mind, the afflictive emotions and so on due to identification with a false sense of self, and the identification is also known as the false 'ego'. Our Buddha Nature is like a clear mirror, our pure awareness, which unfortunately is obscured from us because of a layer of dust, or mental defilements. Through Buddhism we clean the mirror of its defilements to reveal the clear bright mirror underneath. Therefore through practising Buddhism we gain insights into the nature of reality, the nature of our minds, our Buddha Nature, and through awakening from our delusions we find the nirvanic bliss of clarity and liberation from all sufferings in our lives...</span></div>
