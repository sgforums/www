            <div class='col-md body'>This article is about the common 'pessimistic'/'escapist' perception of Buddhism and what Buddhism actually is.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol5no3f.htm</a><br><br><strong>7. Buddhism speaks of no ego, suffering, emptiness, and impermanence; isn't it pessimistic?</strong><br><br>These are not pessimistic values but the basis of happiness in life.<br><br>The non-ego and impermanence that Buddhism speaks of, is something that practitioners of Buddhism need to understand.<br><br>Impermanence is, for example, the darkness of the night and the brightness of the day. There is the impermanence of good karma and evil karma. An adorable newborn baby is not spared from impermanence too. In twenty years, he becomes a youth. Twenty years later he enters into middle age, and in another twenty years his life is nearly over. This is impermanence. A building cannot avoid impermanence either. When newly completed, it receives commendations for its architectural beauty. In a few short years, its condition will begin to deteriorate. Worse still, a natural disaster such as an earthquake may reduce it to a pile of rubble. In general, all things experience formation, existence, deterioration or destruction and eventually emptiness. For human beings, we experience birth, ageing, sickness and eventually death. Thus, no one likes impermanence. Instead, everybody yearns for things to be permanent.<br><br>The founder of Buddhism, Sakyamuni Buddha, even at a young age realised the impermanence of life as we progress through birth, ageing, sickness and death. He felt that there was no significant meaning to the mundane life, and therefore sought to find the 'permanent' meaning of life. He denounced the worldly life and became a monk. He subsequently attained Buddha-hood and realised the true permanence of the universe.<br><br>Emptiness is a manifestation of impermanence. The flower is very beautiful when it blossoms. However, soon after, it begins to wither. This process of blossoming and withering is a demonstration of impermanence. We see this everywhere; even the world that we live in is a demonstration of impermanence.<br><br>Is it pessimistic to be without our ego? The meaning of 'non-ego' refers to a Buddhism practitioner's attainment of non-attachment to his own ego. With that, he is naturally able to see through and let go of the many issues that he encounters in life. This is definitely not being pessimistic, neither is it gloomy. If the ruler of a country knows of seeing through and letting go and declares an end to war, then he saves many lives and resources. Isn't this a good thing?<br><br>From the foregoing, we can see that Buddhism is not pessimistic. We need to be very clear about what we ought or ought not to do. It is not pessimistic and gloomy if we do not do those things that we ought not to do.</blockquote></div>

I'm glad that things are going very well in Perth, and also very glad that the youths are interested in Buddhism there. We used to have a trip there but I didn't go, so maybe next time.<br><br>I believe the youth sector is much larger in Australia - as you know most of them in Singapore are middle age or older adults, with a smaller number of youth. So not as exciting lah. But we also have events other than the standard Buddhist events, pretty much the same. Therefore as we can see there's a difference in the situation of Buddhism in Singapore and "Western" countries.<br><br>Anyway I think this shows that Perth is a very good place to have set up a Dao Chang. Teacher Chen made good comments about Perth as having certain brightness in it, and being like a pure land (if memory serves). So I believe there are many people there receptive to the Dharma. As for Teacher Chen, I heard he is coming to Singapore this year (maybe you already know). By the way which side of Ren Cheng are you from now? Jiang Tang/Vihara/etc? Or the English side?<br><br>Also, Buddhism in General is rising very fast in Australia, it is currently the Fastest Rising Religion in Australia (you can do a search in Google). I am optimistic about the development of Buddhism in Australia.<br><br>BTW, you just came back?<br><br>And, thanks for the URL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Thanks.</div></blockquote>You yuan, you yuan  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Take refuge is to Take Refuge in the Three Treasures: the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. Why so? Because we want to be Buddha's disciples, be a Buddhist, therefore we need to return to the Buddha's domain and to rely on the Buddha, the Dharma (the truths, the teachings) and the Sangha (monastic community) as our teacher, in the same way that we are recognised as students only after we are enrolled with a particular institution and begin to take lessons. Taking refuge means to return to the Buddha's domain and to rely on the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha as our teacher.. One is a True Buddhist only after taking refuge in the Three Treasures.<br><br>It does not mean one needs to do alot of Buddhist studies, but it is important to have a Buddhist teacher to guide you in your path and dharma practise. After taking refuge, you have also found a "Master" in the Sangha (community).<br><br>Sometimes some people at the verge of dying, take refuge in Three Treasures, the Buddha, Dharma, Sangha. And it will definitely help in the after life because it plants a Karmic Seed of the Triple Gems. Next life maybe he might become a Buddhist and attain enlightenment eventually. So does not mean taking refuge means having to study a lot. It is also creating the cause for enlightenment. But if you have the opportunity to take refuge now, that is the best! Don't have to wait till old age or on the verge of death, or else by then without practise, your mind will be confused, afraid, and then everything, including next life, becomes very unpredictable.<br><br>In fact Buddhism focuses more on cultivation and practise than on studying/research.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Venerable Master Shen-KaiÂ’s teacher once asked him, "Which Buddha attained Buddhahood through reference and research? Which patriarch of Buddhism became a patriarch through reference and research?" None, of course, for they all attained enlightenment through cultivation.That experience awakened the Venerable to realise that being a Buddhist means learning, cultivating and putting into practice what the Buddha taught. This is the only way for us to benefit from the teachings of the Buddha.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/voiceofbliss.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/voiceofbliss.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your prompt reply. In relation to what you've said, maybe I can be considered a "layperson Buddhist" (for want of a better term) in that I believe in Buddhist teachings, learn about the teachings from books (although can't claim to have a deep understanding) and use them as a philosophy in life, but I don't chant nor really have Buddhist symbols/representations at home (other than books and a Buddha sculpture).<br><br>While I can understand the necessity to be guided by a Buddhist teacher or someone well-versed with Buddhism because sometimes we are faced with questions and dilemmas, yet, I feel a bit wary of joining groups (Sangha) for various reasons, e.g. not ready to follow their practices like chanting, or performing certain rituals. I feel that I should practice in such rituals only with the right understanding and if I believe in them, and not bec. everyone in the group is practising or that these are expected of a true Buddhist.<br><br>However, from what you've said, maybe I should not call myself a Buddhist then, since I have not take refuge in the Sangha.<br><br>Any comments?</div>

It is only through this way that you can quickly attain enlightenment under his guidance.<br><br>Usually for my dharma centre for example, the first part of the session is chanting sutras and meditation. Second session is dharma talk/sharing. There aren't much rituals, and Buddhism doesnt ask people to follow rituals blindly. Most important, like I said, is cultivation <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you feel that you might want to visit my dharma centre, don't hesitate to private message. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thus i heard from MCK that Jigong, the living Buddha (huo fo) is base on a real person. Though the tv series is a bit exaggerating. but there is really a person of almost the same ability. but i forgot the real name. He say that when people give food to Him, He just eat. There's a time when people keep offering HIm food, and He just kept eating and eating. The idea of More and less does not come to His mind. He is really in non-dualism. At least a Bu Dong di pu sa(8th Bhumi).<br><br>/\<br><br></div>
