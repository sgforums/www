              <p>so u just listen. ...anyway MCK would repeat the same thing over and over again. depend on your level of realisation, listening formulate discipline of the mind and later u'll gain concentration and then wisdom eventually.</p>

              <p>Insight meditation and chanting are different. Reciting sutra is to remember what the Buddha taught.</p>
              <p><br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Ok. I think when we
                                      view consciousness, we have to understand that there are a few
                                      things. We cannot keep on thinking about the objective world first.
                                      We must see how consciousness reacts. That is if we react very
                                      intensely, strongly towards symbols, then whatever reactions will
                                      go back deep into your consciousness. This is one thing. My
                                      perspective is that when you chant, you are not dealing with our
                                      luminous clarity. We're dealing with propensities deep in your
                                      consciousness. Insight meditation itself deals directly with this
                                      clarity. That is the luminous clarity. But if we were to continue
                                      to chant, you are actually focusing more on the deeper layers of
                                      consciousness that deals with propensities and the power of
                                      concentration. Do you see what I mean? It's not so much of the
                                      luminosity. However, the chanting itself, when it takes strength,
                                      it creates a kind of momentum. A momentum that synchronises not
                                      only with your sub-conscious or the deeper layers of your
                                      consciousness, but also your conscious level. This means it can
                                      sync the two layers into one. This syncing the two into one clears
                                      your mind, clears your thoughts. And then at this time, you ask who
                                      you are, that is, not letting the momentum take place, but just
                                      feel and sense... then you ask what is it. At that moment, you
                                      might see your reality. But your mind must be able to settle down
                                      first. But you must know there is a difference between working at
                                      the concentration level, dealing with the karmic propensities and
                                      creating new momentums, and practicing insight meditation that
                                      touch directly the clarity and the luminous nature, are two
                                      different things. You see what I mean or not?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">Participant 1</span>: Yeah I think so.
                                      This means that I still need to do insight meditation?<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Yes you have to do
                                      insight meditation. Even if you attain calmness you still have to
                                      do insight meditation. You must feel the awareness... You must
                                      sense it everywhere... That is very important for liberation. Now
                                      when we talk about awareness, we don't call it Self or we don't
                                      call it Mind. Why people call it Awareness is because they do not
                                      want to call it Self, because there is no Self. The reason they
                                      said Awareness, is because Awareness is not an entity. It is not a
                                      thing. It is just a point of luminous clarity. It is just clarity.
                                      But because we are so accustomed to thinking things in terms of
                                      object and subject, we always take Awareness as something. It must
                                      be somewhere inside, residing somewhere. Even if it is not residing
                                      inside the body it must be somewhere, someplace. This is the
                                      problem, you see. So when you say that letÂ’s be aware. We always
                                      think of Â“how?Â” How to be aware? When we say Â“where is awarenessÂ”,
                                      they always look for a place, they always look for a something.
                                      This is how the mind react, this is what I call a momentum. They
                                      always behave this way. They do not know how to say Â“Just do
                                      nothing. Everything is expressing itself by clarity.Â” They always
                                      want to react, you see what I mean?</p>

              <p>Excerpt from by Zen teacher David Loy:</p>
              <p><a href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm">http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm</a></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Nietzsche relates the denial of a thinker to 
                        a denial of the process of thinking. Why; after all, do we believe that there 
                        is an act of thinking? Because that act is what the thinker does: stringing 
                        thoughts together by creating new thoughts on the basis of the old thoughts. 
                        If there is no such thinker, then there need be no such act. That leaves only 
                        thoughts, but one at a time, although the succession may be rapid.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The significance of Nietzsche's remarks for 
                        us is that we find the same claim in the Asian nondual philosophies, particularly 
                        in Ch'an Buddhism. In The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch, Hui Neng explains 
                        what prajña is:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    To know our mind is to obtain liberation. 
                          To attain liberation is to experience the Samadhi of Prajna, which is ''thoughtlessness". 
                          What is "thoughtlessness"? Thoughtlessness is to see and know all 
                          Dharmas (things) with a mind free from attachment. When in use it pervades 
                          everywhere, and yet it sticks nowhere....When our mind works freely without 
                          any hindrance and is at liberty to "come" or to "go", 
                          we attain Samadhi of Prajna, or liberation. Such a state is called the function 
                          of "thoughtlessness". But to refrain from thinking of anything, 
                          so that all thoughts are suppressed, is to be Dharma-ridden, and this is an 
                          erroneous view. <a name="%5B20%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#20">[20]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The term "thoughtlessness" would seem to recommend 
                        a mind free from any thoughts, but Hui Neng denies this: rather, "thoughtlessness" 
                        is the function of a mind free from any attachment. The implication 
                        is that for someone who is liberated thoughts still arise, but there is no clinging 
                        to them when they do. Why the term "thoughtlessness" can be used to 
                        characterize such a state of mind will become clear in a moment. But the question 
                        that arises first is in what way one can ever be attached to thoughts if, as 
                        the ÅšiksÄ�samuccaya says, a thought has no staying power, that like lightning 
                        it breaks up in a moment and disappears. Hui Neng answers this later in the 
                        Platform Sutra when he says more about "how to think":</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">In the exercise of our thinking faculty, let 
                          the past be dead. If we allow our thoughts, past, present and future, to link 
                          up in a series, we put ourselves under restraint. On the other hand, if we 
                          never let our mind attach to anything, we shall gain liberation.<br> (my emphasis <a name="%5B21%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#21">[21]</a>)</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">One clings to a thought by allowing the thoughts 
                        to link up in a series, which means having one's next thought "caused", as it 
                        were, by the previous thoughts, rather than letting each thought arise spontaneously 
                        and nondually.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    According to the autobiographical first part 
                        of the Platform Sutra, Hui Neng became deeply enlightened and realized that 
                        all things in the universe are his self-nature, upon hearing a line from the 
                        Diamond Sutra: "Let your thought arise without fixing it anywhere". 
                        <a name="%5B22%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#22">[22]</a> The passage just prior to this one-which Hui Neng must also 
                        have heard-puts this in context. Edward Conze translates it as follows:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    Therefore then, Subhuti, the Bodhisattva 
                          should produce an unsupported thought, a thought which is nowhere supported, 
                          which is not supported (apratisthiti) by forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touchables, 
                          or objects of mind. <a name="%5B23%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#23">[23]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">A thought is "Unsupported" because it does not 
                        arise in dependence upon anything else, not "caused" by another thought ("mind-objects") 
                        and of course not "produced" by a thinker, which the Bodhisattva realizes does, 
                        not exist. Such an "unsupported thought", then, is prajña, arising by itself 
                        nondually.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The ego in its purity is experienced in the 
                          interval between two states or between two thoughts. The ego is like the worm 
                          which leaves one hold only after it catches another. Its true nature is known 
                          when it is out of contact with objects or thoughts. You should realize this 
                          interval as the abiding, unchangeable Reality, your true Being... <a name="%5B26%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#26">[26]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">The image of the ego as a worm which leaves one 
                        hold only after catching another might well have been used by Hui Neng and Ma-tsu 
                        to describe the way in which thoughts are apparently linked up in a series. 
                        The difference is that Mahayana Buddhism encourages the arising of "an 
                        unsupported thought", whereas Ramana Maharshi understands unchangeable 
                        Reality as that which is realized only when it is out of contact with all objects 
                        and thoughts. This is consistent with the general relation between Mahayana 
                        and Advaita: Nirguá¹‡a Brahman is so emptied of any attribute ("neti, neti,...") 
                        that it becomes impossible to differentiate from ÅšÅ«nyatÄ�. "It is difficult 
                        indeed to distinguish between pure being and pure non-being as a category". 
                        (S. Dasgupta). <a name="%5B27%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#27">[27]</a> But there is still a difference in emphasis.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">MahÄ�yÄ�na emphasizes realizing the emptiness 
                        of all phenomena, whereas Advaita distinguishes between empty Reality and phenomena, 
                        with the effect of devaluing the latter into mere mÄ�yÄ�.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    The image of a worm hesitant to leave its 
                        hold was used in a personal conversation I had in 1981 with a Theravada monk 
                        from Thailand, a meditation master named Phra Khemananda. This was before I 
                        discovered the passage from Ramana Maharshi; what Khemananda said was not prompted 
                        by any remark of mine, but was taught to him by his own teacher in Thailand. 
                        He began by drawing the following diagram:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;"><img src="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559-1.jpg" alt="jc26559-1.jpg (5220 bytes)" width="170" height="58"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Each oval represents a thought, he said; normally, 
                        we leave one thought only when we have another one to go to (as the arrows indicate), 
                        but to think in this way constitutes ignorance. Instead, we should realize that 
                        thinking is actually like this:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;"><img src="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559-2.jpg" alt="jc26559-2.jpg (5595 bytes)" width="285" height="78"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Then we will understand the true nature of thoughts: 
                        that thoughts do not arise from each other but by themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    This understanding of thoughts-not-linking-up-in-a-series 
                        but springing up nondually is consistent with D. T. Suzuki's conception of prajña:</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    It is important to note 
                          here that prajna wants to see its diction "quickly" apprehended, giving us 
                          no intervening moment for reflection or analysis or interpretation. Prajna 
                          for this reason is frequently likened to a flash of lightning or to a spark 
                          from two</span></p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">striking pieces of flint. "Quickness" 
                          does not refer to progress of time; it means immediacy, absence of deliberation, 
                          no allowance for an intervening proposition, no passing from premises to conclusion. 
                          <a name="%5B28%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#28">[28]</a></span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">This gives insight into the many Ch'an 
                      dialogues 
                        in which students are criticized for their hesitation or praised for 
                      their apparently 
                        nonsensical but immediate replies. That the reply is immediate is not 
                      itself 
                        sufficient; what is important is that each response be experienced as a
                       nondual "presentation of the whole". Hesitation reveals lack of prajña 
                      because 
                        it indicates either some logical train of thought or the 
                      self-conscious paralysis 
                        of all thought. That many approved replies are non-sequitur reveals 
                      one aspect 
                        of the enlightened mind, that its thoughts are free from reasoning and
                       any methodology.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">    Even more important, this also explains how 
                        meditation functions, since the "letting-go" of thoughts breaks up 
                        the otherwise habitual linking together in a series. Huang Po: "... Why 
                        do they [Ch'an students] not copy me by letting each thought go as though it 
                        were nothing, or as though it were a piece of rotten wood, a stone, or the cold 
                        ashes of a dead fire"? <a name="%5B29%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559.htm#29">[29]</a></span></p>

              <p>Reciting sutra will increase wisdom?</p>

              <p><br>yes, the principle is the same with reciting mantra or Buddha's Name, which is to <strong>DISPLINE the MIND</strong>. which mean when your mind is focus in reciting, then the mind become still, and when it's still, wisdom will arise.</p>
              <p>our mind is like a hanging lamp lights swinging in the center of a dark room. we won't be able to see clearly the inside of the room, when the lamp is moving around non stop. so Buddha's principle is to stop the mind. when the lamp stay still, what it shine will be clearer to see. similarly when the mind is still the wisdom we originally had in our Buddhanature will surface up per se.</p>
              <p>those meditator who count breath also follow the same principle. One disciple of Buddha use sweeping the floor while reciting a stanza also follow the same principle.</p>
              <p>hence that said, there are 84000 methods of disiplining the mind, and if Buddha know you very well, u can be concentrating on walking, or even eating mindfully, hearing, bowing to Buddha, doing some routine action...all this can also be use to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Disciple</span> the mind. however for me, is recommend Reciting Buddha's Name "Amituofo", as it got added Power from Amituofo.</p>
