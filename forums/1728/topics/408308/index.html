              <p>Erm how does anyone practice despite their very busy schedule!?</p>
              <p>Generally, i have been bringing works home almost everyday.. no time, no energy to practice.. also seldom don't go for dharma talk ..Lest to say meditate.. from not so good to further backsliding</p>
              <p>A friend advises me to practice Buddha Recitation in Daily life but anyone knows how to practise this Dharma Door in daily life. I mean how can your mind be in two places - one at mindfulness of Buddha while one is busily doing other things? Especially when feeling stress up while trying to finish the works..</p>

              <p>Hi, hope this helps:</p>
              <p>(ck is my friend)</p>
              <p>Ck: john, how to practise vipassana in daily life?<br> Thusness: just observe every sensation.<br> Thusness: until one day u are able to experience "emptiness as
                                      form".<br> Thusness: then it becomes effortless.<br> Thusness: Truthz u cannot imagine the bliss when one clearly
                                      experiences that.<br> Thusness: but there is no point to over stress anything.<br> Thusness: <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"><br> Ck: Thusness just observe every sensation... give me an eg?<br> Thusness: when u breath, u don't have to care what is the right way
                                      of breathing, whether u breath hard or soft, smooth or fine...just
                                      experience as much clarity as u can...just that
                                      experience...regardless of what it is like.<br> Thusness: same for all other experiences.<br> Ck: wot abt sound? hows it?<br> Thusness: when u hear, just the sound...the totality of the sound.
                                      There is no how but just to do away with all abitary thoughts. Hear
                                      the sound as clear as u can be.<br> Ck: then wot abt thots?<br> Ck: thots r v sticky <img title="Sad" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad"></p>
              <p>Thusness: thoughts seldom arise if the practice is correct. If it
                                      arises, then not to chase after its meaning. Not to answer urself
                                      what it means, not to dwell in 'what'...then u will resort to just
                                      the moment of awareness.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span><br>Ck: when i try to be just openly aware, i notice that i jump from sense to sense<br>Ck: like one moment hearing, then touch, etc<br>Thusness: that is okie.<br>Thusness: our nature is so.<br>Ck: wots the rite way to do it<br>Thusness: don't think that u should concentrate.<br>Thusness: ur only duty is to sense with as much clarity as possible.<br> Ck: and for all the sensations, i dun dwell in the 'what'?<br> Thusness: ur mind is looking for a way, a method<br> Thusness: but what that is needed is only the clarity.<br> Thusness: however because our mind is so molded and affect by our
                                      habitual propensities, it becomes difficult what that is direct and
                                      simple.<br> Thusness: just stop asking 'how', 'what', 'why'.<br> Thusness: and submerge into the moment.<br> Thusness: and experience.<br> Thusness: i perfer u to describe.<br> Thusness: not to ask how, what, why, when, where and who.<br> Thusness: only this is necessary.<br> Ck: ok<br> Thusness: if u practice immediately, u will understand.<br> Thusness: if u entertain who, what, where, when and how, u create
                                      more propensities and dull ur own luminosity.<br> <br> Ck: i shuffle btw self inquiry, observing sensations n thots, being
                                      aware... its ok rite<br> Thusness: yes<br> Ck: means start work i'll hv even more propensities...<br> Thusness: that is when u do not understand what awareness, but it
                                      is true to certain extend. <img title="Smile" src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"></p>

              <p>Hi Isis...</p>
              <p>nice leh when u can still think of your progress even though you are tied down with work..</p>
              <p>I sometimes got to work ot and juggle part time studies. For me, i just try to restrain my 5 senses. Chant abit in my mind.</p>
              <p>I seldom do meditation... Maybe before i go to sleep.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>As what "likeyou" said, chant in your heart whenever you are free to do so. For instance when you are travelling. I've heard a ven. said, he said ä½›æ³•æ˜¯å¿ƒæ³•ï¼Œå¦‚æžœä¸�ä¿®å¿ƒï¼Œå¿µä½›è¯µç»�å–Šç ´å–‰å’™ä¹Ÿæž‰ç„¶. To me, ä¿®å¿ƒis the most difficult part, chanting is as simple as ABC. Chanting with concentration is another challenge. Our mind is like a wild horse, galloping non stop, must always try to control it. It gallops even when I'm chanting ha ha ha.................</p></div>

              If you want to practice Buddha recitation, you can use the Ten Recitation Method. Ten Recitation Method is for very busy people.
              
              The Ten Recitation Method
              (from http://www.purelandbuddhism.com/lifetime_goal.pdf)
              
              1. Recite the words â€œNamo Amitabhaâ€� or â€œNamo Amitabha Buddhaâ€� three, five, or more times as you take one breath. Repeat this exercise with each breath for ten breaths.
              
              2. Finish this exercise by reciting the Verse for the Transference of Merit.
              
              The most important requirement for practicing this method is to do your recitations both in the morning and in the evening, every day. Face a portrait of Buddha if you have one, and try to face west as you recite.
              
              And like what the others mentioned, recite whenever you have time. When you have to use brain to think, you can temporary put down the recitation, after you are done with the thinking work, pick up the recitation again.

              <p>for me is remember to recite 'Amituofo, Amituofo'...., when feeling of <em>Self</em> arises or anytime when feeling bad or when u did something that disturb u. practice until it become automatic. it's also a way of observing the mind...è§‚å¿ƒã€‚when <em>Self</em> thoughts arises, use the name 'Amituofo' to suppress it per se.</p>

              <p><br>hi Isis, don't tell yourself it is difficult or impossible.  Just try it out, keep doing it,  bring your mind back to Amituofo whenever you remember to... soon it'd become a habit... don't analyse the practice whether it is doable or not, just do it.  Like Sinweiy said, it's a very very useful and powerful way to practice.</p>
              <p>One of the obstacles we have is we block ourselves psychologically by saying we can't before even putting in alot of effort to do the practice.  Say 'yes i can do it, i will try to do it....' and go and do it, throw yourself into the task. U may be surprised at the result of such a simple practice.</p>

              <p>just sharing how i practice personally</p>
              <p>morning once wake say the precepts, then meditate for an hour. wake up earlier to do this before going to work.</p>
              <p>during the course of the day, use noting as the main practice. must practice until this becomes a habit, so even when rushing will note 'rushing'. and i also in the process of forming the habit of wishing whoever i talk to (or come across) well, just in my mind saying 'may you be well, may you be happy'.</p>
              <p>just by the act of maintaining attention to whatever we are doing is a form of practice. so try to get used to reminding myself that there's no special place for practice.</p>
              <p>then before sleep meditate again, and end off with sleeping meditation until fall asleep mindfully.</p>
              <p>may everyone be mindful and be happy :)</p>

              <p>What if when you chant Namo Amituofo silently and one may feel restless after a while and then slowly progress to aversion... Since aversion has arised, shall we just continue to focus on the name of the Buddha?  </p>

              <p>just sharing how i practice personally</p>
              <p>morning once wake say the precepts, then meditate for an hour. wake up earlier to do this before going to work.</p>
              <p>during the course of the day, use noting as the main practice. must practice until this becomes a habit, so even when rushing will note 'rushing'. and i also in the process of forming the habit of wishing whoever i talk to (or come across) well, just in my mind saying 'may you be well, may you be happy'.</p>
              <p>just by the act of maintaining attention to whatever we are doing is a form of practice. so try to get used to reminding myself that there's no special place for practice.</p>
              <p>then before sleep meditate again, and end off with sleeping meditation until fall asleep mindfully.</p>
              <p>may everyone be mindful and be happy :)</p>

              <p>If you want to practice Buddha recitation, you can use the Ten Recitation Method. Ten Recitation Method is for very busy people.</p>
              <p>The Ten Recitation Method<br>(from <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.purelandbuddhism.com/lifetime_goal.pdf">http://www.purelandbuddhism.com/lifetime_goal.pdf</a>)</p>
              <p>1. Recite the words “Namo Amitabha” or “Namo Amitabha Buddha” three, five, or more times as you take one breath. Repeat this exercise with each breath for ten breaths.</p>
              <p>2. Finish this exercise by reciting the Verse for the Transference of Merit.</p>
              <p>The most important requirement for practicing this method is to do your recitations both in the morning and in the evening, every day. Face a portrait of Buddha if you have one, and try to face west as you recite.</p>
              <p>And like what the others mentioned, recite whenever you have time. When you have to use brain to think, you can temporary put down the recitation, after you are done with the thinking work, pick up the recitation again.</p>

              <p>Right view is also important. You have to understand the Buddhist teachings, about anatta, emptiness and dependent origination. Then with the right practice of insight meditation, realization will arise.</p>

              <p>also since our hearing is sharp in our world, listening to Dharma talks daily when there's time helps our view to be Right and keep our action away from unwholesomeness.</p>
              <p>i listened to MCK's talk when got free time. <a href="http://new.amtb-aus.org/">http://new.amtb-aus.org/</a> </p>
              <p>just download and listen in ur phone/mp3 player. u don't have to understand the meaning when listening, not so important to try very hard understanding.  MCK would say Dharma had no meaning. we are the one that give it meaning. :)</p>
              <p>so u just listen. ...anyway MCK would repeat the same thing over and over again. depend on your level of realisation, listening formulate discipline of the mind and later u'll gain concentration and then wisdom eventually.</p>
              <p>u can also contemplated on <strong>å› æ— æ‰€ä½� </strong>è€Œç”Ÿå…¶å¿ƒ in Diamond Sutra, the stanza that cause Hui Neng to be enlightened.. let go in the moment, free the mind from everything, like responsibility, career, material, love ones, family, people that own u money, people that dislike u, self etc all are but impermanent, false and empty.. let the mind free. </p>
