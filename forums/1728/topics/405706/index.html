              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: #EEEEEE;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">"In order to communicate very openly
              with the world, you need to develop fundamental trust. This kind of trust is
              not trusting“in”something, but simply trusting. It is very much like your
              breath. You do not consciously hold on to your breath, or trust in your breath,
              yet breathing is your very nature. In the same way, to be trusting is your very
              nature. To be trusting means you are fundamentally free from doubt about your
              goodness and about the goodness of others."</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">When we trust with our open heart, whatever
              occurs,“at that very moment that it occurs,”can be perceived as fresh and
              unstained by the clouds of hope and fear. Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche used the
              phrase “first thought, best thought” to refer to that first moment of fresh
              perception, before the colorful and coloring clouds of judgment and personal
              interpretation take over. “First thought” is “best thought” because it has not
              yet got covered over by all our opinions and interpretations, our hopes and
              fears, our likes and dislikes. It is direct perception of the world as it is.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Sometimes we discover “first thought, best
              thought” by relaxing into the present moment in a very simple way. Perhaps you
              are sitting in an airport looking down from a balcony onto the crowds milling
              around below. Suddenly your inner chatter stops. You are right there for a
              moment and actually see and hear. You see the pattern of motion; you hear the
              hubbub of voices and machines; you have a sense of timelessness and
              completeness.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">You may also come into this open state of
              mind when you are suddenly shocked. Perhaps you have had the experience of
              slipping on ice. Without thought your whole body and mind become unified to
              prevent a fall. At that moment you feel completely alive and right there. Afterwards,
              you may get a sudden rush of adrenaline and say, “Whew, that was close,” but
              the feeling of energy and wakefulness lingers for awhile.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Although we call it “first“thought,”” it is
              not a thought that necessarily comes in words. It is just the very first
              inspiration, however it expresses itself to us. It may just be “aah!” - a sharp
              gasp as we come around a corner on a mountaintop and see the valley laid out
              below us. Of course, then we immediately start thinking second thoughts, and
              third thoughts, like “Oh my, isn’t that beautiful,” or “How stupid that I
              didn’t bring my camera.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The first moment of awakening in the morning
              can be an opportunity to notice “first thought” because our mind is not yet so
              caught up in the daily round. We rarely catch the moment when we awaken from
              sleep, but sometimes we do. There is a kind of blank in which we often don’t
              even remember where we are or who we are. This moment might be frightening, or
              joyful, but in either case there is a vivid perception of the room around us.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">I have particularly noticed moments of fresh
              perception during an afternoon of taking photographs. A photograph can capture
              the feeling at the moment of experiencing something, just as it is, but first
              you must open your mind and see: the afternoon sun glancing off a bright
              yellow-green moss-covered rock in the middle of a clearing in the pine forest;
              a long horizontal bulbous cloud, dark with rain, yet brilliantly lit underneath
              by the evening sun; white mist over the bay, through which the faint outline of
              an island, a boat and a lone seagull suggest something out of nothing; a pile
              of steaming cowdung surrounded by yellow dandelions. In order to capture these
              moments you look not only at the objects themselves, but also at the light
              shining around and within them. Then, putting the camera down and looking at
              the ordinary world, suddenly it too seems bright and vibrant.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">When you take photographs, just before you
              click the shutter, your mind is empty and open, just seeing without words. When
              you stand in front of a blank sheet of paper, about to make a painting or a
              calligraphy, you have no idea what you will do. Maybe you have some plan for a
              painting, or you know what symbol you want to calligraph, but you don’t
              actually know what will appear when you put brush to paper. What you do out of
              trust in open mind will be fresh and spontaneous. Opening to first thought is
              the way to begin any action properly.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The same process happens, very fast, at
              every moment of our lives. Whether we are artists or not, any moment could be
              experienced as first thought. We have to touch first thought again and again.
              There is no promise of any ultimate point where you don’t have to pay attention
              anymore. At the moment you are about to make“any”gesture, before you actually
              do it, you can trust and open to “first thought, best thought.” When we are
              about to drink a glass of water, do we just reach for it and grab it and
              swallow it down? Or can there be a moment of first thought, clear perception,
              as we reach for the glass; and again as we touch it; and again as we lift it;
              and again as we move it towards our lips; and again as we taste the water on
              our tongue? When someone speaks sharply to us, do we immediately fire back, or
              can there be a moment of first thought before we respond?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 12.75pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Likewise, when you go about your daily
              business, make coffee, go to work, use the copier, attend a meeting, walk down
              the street, eat dinner, have an argument with your mate or make love, and so
              on. If you open to first thought, each of those occurrences in your
              life“could”be fresh and very direct. So often we ignore first thought - we
              think it is too silly, or outrageous. We have to be daring to catch first
              thought and follow it. First thought can guide our life, when we trust.</span></p>
