              <p><strong>I Alone Am The World Honoured One</strong></p>
              <p>by Ven Jue Xing from å�ƒæ±Ÿæœˆå½± (2)</p>
              <p>(loose translation by me)</p>
              <p>The founder of Buddhism, Shakyamuni Buddha, was born as a
                  prince. On the first day of his birth, he stepped on lotus flowers
                  and walked seven steps, with one finger pointing to the sky and one
                  finger pointing towards the earth, he said "Above the skies and
                  below the earth, I alone Am the World Honoured One." "I alone Am
                  the World Honoured One", what does this mean? Why did the Buddha
                  say this? Many times people have this question/doubt.</p>
              <p>Actually, what the Buddha referred to as 'I' is not the ordinary
                  sentient beings' egoic mind consciousness, much less is it a 'self'
                  that wants to be a religious leader. It is because the Buddha has
                  been awakened for many lifetimes and kalpas ago, and has already
                  achieved 'No Self', and continued to practice till present that he
                  was able to attain the fruition of Buddhahood. Otherwise, the 'I'
                  in 'I Alone Am The World Honoured One' would be just the ordinary
                  sentient being's me-form, me-clinging. Why then did the Buddha said
                  "I"?</p>
              <p>This is because what the Buddha referred to as "I" is actually
                  taking himself as a presentation: He is the Buddha, the Buddha is
                  Awareness, this Awareness fully pervades all space and dharma
                  realms. Everything that is sentient or insentient is a part of it,
                  every sentient beings in the universe rely on Awareness for
                  survival, and the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the three times
                  achieve liberation through realising Awareness. Thereafter, they
                  rely on Awareness's marvellous functions to walk the Bodhisattva
                  path, saving all sentient beings. Therefore it is said, "Above the
                  skies and below the earth, <strong>Awareness</strong> alone Is the
                  World Honoured One." And the reason for the Buddha's action is to
                  show that every human being has the essence of Awareness in its
                  completeness right from the beginning, and he wishes to awaken our
                  Awareness.</p>
              <p>The Lotus Sutra states:</p>
              <p><strong>“Shariputra, what is meant by ‘All Buddhas, World
                  Honored Ones, appear in the world only because of the causes and
                  conditions of the one great matter?’ The Buddhas, the World Honored
                  Ones, appear in the world because they wish to lead living beings
                  to open the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas and gain purity.
                  They appear in the world because they wish to demonstrate to all
                  living beings the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas. They appear
                  in the world because they wish to lead living beings to awaken to
                  the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas. They appear in the world
                  because they wish to lead living beings to enter into the Path of
                  the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas.”</strong></p>
              <p><strong>“Shariputra, these are the causes and conditions of the
                  one great matter for which all the Buddhas appear in the
                  world.”</strong></p>
              <p>Therefore, Buddha took birth in our world to enable sentient
                  beings to <em><strong>open the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas
                  and gain purity,</strong> <strong>demonstrate to all living beings
                  the knowledge and vision of the Buddhas,</strong> <strong>lead
                  living beings to awaken to the knowledge and vision of the
                  Buddhas,</strong> <strong>enter into the Path of the knowledge and
                  vision of the Buddhas.</strong></em> Therefore Buddha wants to open
                  the way of Awareness, enabling sentient beings to realise the
                  Essence of Awareness.</p>
              <p>All sentient beings rely on Awareness for survival, it is
                  because they have the Essence of Awareness that they are able to be
                  aware, feel, or know. However it is because sentient beings lost
                  sight of the Essence of Awareness that they are unable to become
                  self-aware, this is called "lost in sentient beings", or otherwise
                  known as ignorance. Whereas, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have
                  first realised Awareness, and it is because they realised
                  Awareness, and relied on Awareness in cultivation, that they
                  achieved liberation from all habitual energies and karmas of
                  sentient beings, and thereby accomplish the Fruit of Buddhahood. In
                  the universe, other than Awareness, all phenomena are only illusory
                  forms and arising due to the aggregation of causes and conditions,
                  and when the causes and conditions separate the phenomena ceases.
                  They do not have any real or eternal essence, and therefore the
                  Buddha once being born into this world declared to the world that
                  above the skies and below the earth, other than Awareness, all are
                  conditioned arising and conditioned ceasing, impermanent and
                  illusory forms, therefore "Awareness Alone IS the World Honoured
                  One." - for it is Eternal.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Buddhists should have right understanding and right
                  view. The purpose of practicing Buddhism is not for other matters.
                  Regardless of which dharma door you practice, it is for the purpose
                  of Awareness/Awakening. Only with Awakening, opening wisdom,
                  seeking liberation, can it be the correct aim. We must never attend
                  to trifles and neglect the essentials, not knowing self-awareness and
                  seeking the outside, else it would be to proceed in the opposite
                  directions of the aims of Buddhist practice.</p>
