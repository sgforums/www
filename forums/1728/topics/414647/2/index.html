              <p>Buddha view all beings with equal compassion whether they slandered Buddhism or not. How did you know the Buddha did not bless them? The Buddha is like a parent always looking out for the child, trying to teach the child and not let the child stray towards the bad, but if we as the children do not want to listen to our parent, and instead keep cursing them and think what they say is rubbish and run away from them, how can the parent help?<br><br>Karma is not taking revenge. Karma is about cause and effect. I eat and I have to go to the toilet. Eating is the cause, going to the toilet is the effect. I slap someone on the face, and that person shouts at me. Slapping the face is the cause, getting shout at is the effect. I save every month and 20 years later I had money to travel, saving the the cause, having money for travelling is the effect.</p>
              <p>Similarly, I do a good cause, i get a good result, I do evil, I get an evil result. Karma is not something the Buddha can control, hell is not something the Buddha create. We create our own karma and hells.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, the Buddha was very compassionate and wanted to help us, that is why he talked about karma. If we do not know that doing good brings good result and evil brings bad results, who knows what evil we will do and what suffering result we will reap.<br><br>If you want to understand about karma, please read this link.<br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/karma.htm</a></p>

              <p>"<em>Donating organs after death is not as good as donating them while you’re still alive—then it’s for real! If you don’t donate them until you’re dead and can’t use them anymore, what’s the use? As it’s said, “Don’t give to others what you yourself don’t want</em>.”--Venerable Hsuan Hua . The Venerable Master is unique in his view that if one can give up one’s organs while still alive (being able to endure the pain), then it won’t be any problem to donate them right before death. So he maintains that one need not wait until the point of death to donate one’s organs (at that time no one can be sure they will not regret their decision because of the <strong>excessive pain</strong>).</p>
              <p>Most people who have this idea are well-known Mahayana Masters. it may seem on appearance that it's beneficial, but underneath it, there's hidden danger.</p>

              <p>as purelander, i opt out long time ago. reason is as mentioned by AEN, regarding the 8 hour period. it's not we cannot withstand the pain for 8 hours and it'll be over, no, it's because the pain will cause one to generate vexation. withstand is one thing, generate frustration and end up in lower realms is another.  unless u really practice pureland very well, there will not be any bardo period. rebirth into pureland is straight away. but best not to take chance, sometimes we never know, if we will retrogress. retrogress is a big issue nowaday with so many external materialism.</p>
              <p>for purelanders, it's best that we get on the "ticket" or "train" to western pureland. save already then we talk about saving infinity people when u reached a true stage of non-retrogressing bodhisattva. in this way u are not selfish, but greater heart of saving even more people.</p>
              <p>it's like u are in a house that is on fire, many people are trapped, but u are able to escape and call for help, compare to helping one person and end up killed in the fire as well. but if u only escape for yourself then u will not gain entry into pureland.</p>
