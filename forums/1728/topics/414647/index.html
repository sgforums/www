              <p>Hi guys, I am going to turn 21 years next year, and today I received a letter asking me to support organ donation.</p>
              <p>My Buddhist Master (Ven Shen Kai) highly supported organ donation and said that those who donate will have tremendous merits which leads to a good rebirth...</p>
              <p>However there are other perspectives saying those who do organ donation within certain hours after death (before consciousness completely departs from the body) will undergo tremendous pain.</p>
              <p>My Taiwanese teacher (successor of my Master) said it will be painful if done within the period before consciousness departs (8 hours), but if your practice is up to level you can simply do it and take it as a karmic cleansing period.</p>

              <p>To me, i think this body is impermanent. If we can save a person's life, and possibly help him extend his lifespan, even expanding his opportunity to encounter dharma, i think its alright to suffer for a short period (8 hours) compared to extend a person's lifespan for Years.</p>

              <p>Dear eternal_now, you are so young and is fortunate to have a complete set of organs your Parents have given you. Please do not act hastily. I personally believe that better karma is to look after your precious health so do not venture into donating your organs upon impulse, and rather donate money to the suffering patient so that he/she can afford medicines and healthcare. This way, both your parents and you and the patient are 100% benefitting from this action and this importantly will not hurt or traumatise your parents who will worry for your health status if you do donate your organs. And take care of your health too then you will learn to take care of your parents health and this is even greater pure greatness of the human essence. Btw you do have a kind and passionate heart so God will bless you in whatever actions you do. Seek in thine heart and you will find the answer around you <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Dear eternal_now, you are so young and is fortunate to have a
                  complete set of organs your Parents have given you. Please do not
                  act hastily. I personally believe that better karma is to look
                  after your precious health so do not venture into donating your
                  organs upon impulse, and rather donate money to the suffering
                  patient so that he/she can afford medicines and healthcare. This
                  way, both your parents and you and the patient are 100% benefitting
                  from this action and this importantly will not hurt or traumatise
                  your parents who will worry for your health status if you do donate
                  your organs. And take care of your health too then you will learn
                  to take care of your parents health and this is even greater pure
                  greatness of the human essence. Btw you do have a kind and
                  passionate heart so God will bless you in whatever actions you do.
                  Seek in thine heart and you will find the answer around
                  you <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Hi osakco, I think you're misunderstanding the context of my post... I'm not asking about donating organs, I'm asking about donating organs when you die.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the policy is that those who do not opt out of the scheme, when they die below a certain age, their organs will be harvested immediately after death to save other needy patients in need of organ transplant.</p>
              <p>In Mahayana (and likewise Vajrayana Buddhism), a person is known to undergo bado, a state of transition between death and rebirth,  immediately after death. In other words some consciousness remains even after post mortem state... up to 8 hours after clinically dead.</p>
              <p>This means you can still feel pain when you are undergoing organ donation after your physical death. This is the dillema.</p>
              <p>Thanks for voicing out your sincere concerns though... and the opportunity to clarify myself.</p>

              <p>This is misinterpretation of sutra. Dun wait till hell to enjoy yourself in the seething hot boiling cauldron. Just boiling a pot of hot water and pour on your leg lah. If no scalding and suffering of pain, then you are real Devadatta. Devadatta knows this before his attainment while practice dharma (Buddha speaks sutra of infinite life - ä¸�ä¿¡è¯¸ä½›ç»�æ³•ï¼Œä¸�ä¿¡ç”Ÿæ­»å–„æ�¶ã€‚æ¬²å®³çœŸäººï¼Œæ–—ä¹±åƒ§ä¼—ã€‚æ„šç—´è’™æ˜§ï¼Œè‡ªä¸ºæ™ºæ…§ã€‚ä¸�çŸ¥ç”Ÿæ‰€ä»Žæ�¥ï¼Œæ­»æ‰€è¶£å�‘ã€‚), and so has vow, and then attained to materialise his vow, you not yet leh, or you might have attained but not all have attained :DIf others practice incorrectly because of your interpretation, the result may go alvic hell hor! just intereaction here and plse no personal hard feeling, we exist to love and joys together through buddha dharma :D</p>

              I was planning to opt out earlier, but haven't send in the letter, it's been sitting there for a long time.
              
              Saw this Q and A for Venerable Hsuan Hua and his reply......
              Q: Is it a good idea for Buddhists to donate their organs after death? 
              
              A: Donating organs after death is not as good as donating them while you're still aliveâ€”then it's for real! If you don't donate them until you're dead and can't use them anymore, what's the use? As it's said, "Don't give to others what you yourself don't want."
              
              Organ donation has been a topic of hot debate in recent years, and people are not in agreement. The Venerable Master is unique in his view that if one can give up one's organs while still alive (being able to endure the pain), then it won't be any problem to donate them right before death. So he maintains that one need not wait until the point of death to donate one's organs (at that time no one can be sure they will not regret their decision because of the excessive pain). The Master also thought that one who truly cultivates the Bodhisattva path should "give what they themselves would like to others."

              <p>Hi zero thought,</p>
              <p>Thanks a lot for the comment... will ponder on that. This also reminds me that my Master too talked about organ donation as a Bodhisattva practice... and also the various sutras that talk about Bodhisattvas willingly giving up organs for the benefit of other sentient beings, let alone Shakyamuni Buddha who in previous life gave up his body for others in many instances.</p>
