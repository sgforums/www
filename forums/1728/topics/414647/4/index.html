              <p>When the transitoriness of life hits us, we feel empty,  and that's we feel our day to day life rather unmeaningful. But it is also this dissatisfaction that makes us ponder. Lord Buddha also experienced this emptiness and set off seeking, and for that we are thankful.</p>

              <p>Hey Eternal Now</p>
              <p>Great to know that you have a big heart in desiring to donate your organ.</p>
              <p>I think Confucius once said, "How can one know about death before he knows clearly about life?" In one's lifetime, one should fulfill one's responsibility in realizing the ideal of a harmonious society.</p>
              <p>Hence, whether at the last moment of your life you will donate the organ willingly. I don't think anyone can know except yourself. Perhaps by reviewing one current daily life one can predict your future organ reaction.</p>
              <p>1) When your mum or close one enter your room to tidy the place. Are you happy and thankful about it or you react with.......?</p>
              <p>2) When you lose your Iphone or personal belonging after much search with no possiblility of recovery. Do you react negatively over it with the blaming attitdue or accept it without reservation?</p>
              <p>These two is a simple questions perhaps you can reflect with more question on your own. However, if one can honestly say that most of the time, one react with negatively then I think one is not prepare for the donation act. Why? If one is unable to deal with the external material things which one own how can he deal with people removing organ from one body which one has acustom to since birth. With shame, I would said I will react to No 2 that's why I did not opt for the donation.  </p>
              <p>Perhaps your taiwan master was right in saying that it might be a painful process for oneself especially if the person still has a lot of attachement to the body.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I was watching the program on Otko channel, Werid or What. Inside this program, they presented a case of heart transplant from a hollywood stuntsman who die in an accident to a businessman. Interestingly, the businessman began to pick up the stuntsman eating habit, sport activity, music preference and etc. It is as if part of the stuntman is still living in him. According to a Arizona University professor whom they interview, he believe memory is not only locate in the brain but in the organ, muscle and individual cell. Well perhaps this is what we call in the buddhist circle <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">attachment</span></strong>...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Lastly, I heard a story of Shariputra whom during his earthly life wanted to culitvate the Bodhisattva way. When he came across a person crying by the roadside who was seeking for help, he decided to help him at all cost. So the person request for his eye when he gouge out his right eye. The person  request for the left since he wanted left instead of right. Shariputra was so discourage that he said, " The Bodhisattva way is too difficult to practice, I better be a bhikshu."</p>
              <p>In conclusion, is a good to have a bodhisattva heart but one need to see if one capacity is there. Whatever choice you made I wish well and happiness.</p>

              <p>An Arhat, in this case meaning Theravadans, is also not lacking in loving kindness or compassion, he will readily give his organs even while he is alive.

              <p>The issue of donating organs rest on the ideals of compassion (selflessness)and practical understanding of pain (attachment to self and body). Contemplation on impermanence may be helpful.</p>
              <p>Another way is  shui yuan, if it is meant to be, it will meant to be. Like in the case of Singapore, you must opt out, instead of in. Also your organs must suitable for harvesting, usually of an early death, probably physical trauma.     </p>

              <p>Precisely it is the ideal of compassion which Eternal Now master say it is a good act which led to higher rebirth. At the sametime, the practical understanding of attachement to self which led Eternal Now taiwan master said it is not easy.</p>
              <p>Hence, the purpose of Shariputra eye donation story is highlight the difficult of practising compassionate giving in this world even when Shariputra is the wisest disciple. It <span style="text-decoration: underline;">does not imply</span> that Theravada practitioner has no compassion. I have read about great Theravada practitioner who is much more compassionate and accomplished than Mahanyana practitioner. It is not one tradition that one practise which determine if one is practising the Mahanyana way. It is the individual practise and the way it live out the Buddha's teaching that make the difference.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is the individual choice. May the choice that one choose help him to achieve Buddhahood in the days to come.</p>

              <p>Hey Eternal Now</p>
              <p>Great to know that you have a big heart in desiring to donate
              your organ.</p>
              <p>I think Confucius once said, "How can one know about death
              before he knows clearly about life?" In one's lifetime, one should
              fulfill one's responsibility in realizing the ideal of a harmonious
              society.</p>
              <p>Hence, whether at the last moment of your life you will donate
              the organ willingly. I don't think anyone can know except yourself.
              Perhaps by reviewing one current daily life one
              can predict your future organ reaction.</p>
              <p>1) When your mum or close one enter your room to tidy the
              place. Are you happy and thankful about it or you react
              with.......?</p>
              <p>2) When you lose your Iphone or personal belonging after
              much search with no possiblility of recovery. Do you react
              negatively over it with the blaming attitdue or accept it without
              reservation?</p>
              <p>These two is a simple questions perhaps you can reflect with
              more question on your own. However, if one can honestly say that
              most of the time, one react with negatively then I think one is not
              prepare for the donation act. Why? If one is unable
              to deal with the external material things which one own
              how can he deal with people removing organ from one body which
              one has acustom to since birth. With shame, I would said I
              will react to No 2 that's why I did not opt for the
              donation.  </p>
              <p>Perhaps your taiwan master was right in saying that it
              might be a painful process for oneself especially if
              the person still has a lot of attachement to the
              body.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, I was watching the program on Otko channel, Werid or
              What. Inside this program, they presented a case of heart
              transplant from a hollywood stuntsman who die in an
              accident to a businessman. Interestingly, the businessman began to
              pick up the stuntsman eating habit, sport activity, music
              preference and etc. It is as if part of the stuntman is still
              living in him. According to a Arizona University
              professor whom they interview, he believe memory is not
              only locate in the brain but in the organ, muscle and individual
              cell. Well perhaps this is what we call in the buddhist circle
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">attachment</span></strong>...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Lastly, I heard a story of Shariputra whom during his earthly
              life wanted to culitvate the Bodhisattva way. When
              he came across a person crying by the roadside who was
              seeking for help, he decided to help him at all cost. So the person
              request for his eye when he gouge out his right eye. The
              person  request for the left since he wanted left instead
              of right. Shariputra was so discourage that he said, " The
              Bodhisattva way is too difficult to practice, I better be a
              bhikshu."</p>
              <p>In conclusion, is a good to have a bodhisattva heart but one
              need to see if one capacity is there. Whatever choice you made I
              wish well and happiness.</p>

              <p>An Arhat, in this case meaning Theravadans, is also not lacking in loving kindness or compassion, he will readily give his organs even while he is alive. There is a video in Youtube recounting a Buddhist monk in Sri Lanka who donated one of his organs to a Christian missionary.  </p>
              <p>It's been awhile, I will try to rummage Youtube and see whether I can post the link.</p>
