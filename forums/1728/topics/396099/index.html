What then is this ‘Nagasena’?<span>  </span>Are perhaps the hairs of the head ‘Nagasena’?”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena:<span>  </span>“Is it then the wheels, or the framework, or the flag-staff, or the yoke, or the reins, or the goadstick?”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena:<span>  </span>“Then is this ‘chariot’ outside the combination of pole, axle, wheels, framework, flag-staff, yoke, reins, and goad?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>

But what is the real chariot?<span> </span>Your Majesty has told a lie, has spoken a falsehood!<span>  </span>There really is no chariot!<span>  </span>Your Majesty is the greatest king in the whole of India.<span>  </span>Of whom then are you afraid, that you do not speak the truth?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">(To Assembly) “Now listen, you 500 Greeks, and 80,000 monks, this king Milinda tells me he has come in a chariot.<span>  </span>But when asked to explain to me what a chariot is, he cannot establish its existence.<span>  </span>How can one possibly approve of that?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The five hundred Greeks thereupon applauded the Venerable Nagasena and said to King Milinda:<span>  </span>“Now let your Majesty get out of this if you can!”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda:<span>  </span>“I have not, Nagasena, spoken a falsehood.<span>  </span>For it is in dependence on the pole, the axle, the wheels, the framework, the flag-staff, etc., that there takes place this denomination ‘chariot,’ this designation, this conceptual term, a current appellation, and a mere name.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena:<span>  </span>“Your Majesty has spoken well about the chariot.<span>  </span>It is just so with me.<span>  </span>In dependence on the thirty-two parts of the body and the five Skandhas there takes place this denomination ‘Nagasena,’ this designation, this conceptual term, a current appellation, and a mere name.<span>  </span>In ultimate reality, however, this person cannot be apprehended.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda:<span>  </span>“It is wonderful, Nagasena, it is astonishing, Nagasena! Most brilliantly have these questions been answered!<span>  </span>Were the Buddha himself here, he would approve what you have said.<span> </span>Well spoken, Nagasena, well spoken!”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena: “He is neither the same nor another.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda:<span>  </span>“Give me an illustration!”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena: “What do you think, great king: when you were a tiny infant, newly born and quite soft, were you then the same as the one who is now grown up?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda: “No, that infant was one; I, now grown up, am another.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena: “If that is so, great king, you have had no mother, no father, no teaching, and no schooling!<span>  </span>Do we then take it that there is one mother for the embryo in the first stage, another for the second stage, another for the third, another for the fourth, another for the baby, another for the grown-up man?<span>  </span>Is the schoolboy one person, and the one who has finished school another?<span>  </span>Does one commit a crime, but the hands and feet of another are cut off?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda:<span>  </span>“Certainly not!<span>  </span>But what would you say, Reverend Sir, to all that?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena:<span>  </span>“I was neither the tiny infant, newly born and quite soft, nor am I now the grown-up man; but these comprise one unit depending on this very body.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda:<span>  </span>“Give me a simile!”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena:<span>  </span>“If a man were to light a lamp, could it give light throughout the whole night?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Milinda:<span>  </span>“Yes, it could.”<br><br></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena:<span>  </span>“Is not the flame which burns in the first watch of the night the same as the one which burns in the second?”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena: “Even so must we understand the collocation of a series of successive dharmas.<span>  </span>At rebirth one dharma arises, while another stops; but the two processes take place almost simultaneously (i.e., they are continuous).<span>  </span>Therefore the first act of consciousness in the new existence is neither the same as the last act of consciousness in the previous existence, nor is it another.”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Nagasena: “Milk, once the milking is done, turns after some time into curds; from curds it turns into fresh butter, and from fresh butter into ghee.<span> </span>Would it now be correct to say that the milk is the same thing as the curds, or the fresh butter, or the ghee?”</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana;">NOTE:<span>  </span>The use of “Dharma” here is meaningful.<span>  </span>“Dharma” often means something like “duty”, the right thing to do, or the law.<span>  </span>But it is more: the word comes from Sanskrit for “to hold together” or “to bear, support, or sustain”.<span>  </span>Dharma is the universal cosmic law that holds things together.<span>  </span>Dharma is how things are held together; there is no right or wrong way for things to be, since dharma is lawful and controls change, and causes things to unfold the way the do. One dharma is the law of karma. Another is the unity of all sentient beings.<span>  </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">The Buddhist scripture "<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/The%20Questions%20of%20King%20Milinda.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The Questions of King Milinda</span></span></a>" contains interesting and very modern arguments about personal identity through time. In effect, Buddhism rejects the key element in folk psychology: the idea of a self (a unified personal identity that is continuous through time). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">King Milinda and Nagasena (the Buddhist sage) discuss ordinary problems of personal identity. Nagasena says: "As Nagasena I am known, great King ... But ... this word 'Nagasena' is just a denomination, a designation, a conceptual term, a current appellation, a mere name.<span> </span>For no real person can here be apprehended."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">At first Milinda is astonished. Milinda thinks persons obviously exist: "This Nagasena tells me that he is not a real person! How can I be expected to agree with that!" But Milinda gradually realizes that "Nagasena" (the word) does not stand for anything he can point to: "Nagasena" does not designate the hairs on Nagasena's head, nor the hairs of the body, nor the "nails, teeth, skin, muscles, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, ..." etc.<span>  </span>In other words, the term "Nagasena" has no obvious denotation. Milinda notes that the term "Nagasena" also does not stand for Nagasena's form, or feeling or perceptions, impulses, or consciousness, nor any combination thereof. On the other hand, "Nagasena" does not stand for anything <em>other than</em> ("outside the combination") Nagasena's form, feelings, etc. Milinda concludes that "Nagasena" doesn't stand for anything, and this is puzzling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Nagasena answers with one of several arguments by analogy. The analogy is of the chariot. Nagasena points out that we can't say exactly what a chariot is, either; it's not the pole or the axle or the wheels, or the flag-staff, yoke, reins, etc.<span>  </span>But that doesn't mean there are no chariots. Milinda realizes that "it is <em>in dependence on</em> the pole, the axle, the wheels, the framework, the flag-staff, etc., that there takes place this denomination 'chariot' ..." Nagasena concludes: "It is just so with me. In dependence on<span>  </span>[the parts] there takes place this denomination 'Nagasena.' ... In ultimate reality, however, this person cannot be apprehended."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">The discussion continues. If we can't say what a person is, then how do we know a person is the same person through time? Nagasena's answer is basically that the question is badly formed, since you can give equally good <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> arguments that we are the same through time and that we are not the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">WHY YOU'RE THE SAME</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">To prove: You are the same person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Suppose you are different, in the sense that you now are not the same person as before.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Then you'd have no past -- no mother, no father. You do have a past, however, so it is absurd to suppose you are different.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">To prove: You are the same person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Suppose you are a different person in the sense that you are completely different at every moment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Then you'd have many mothers, fathers, etc.<span> </span>This is absurd, QED.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">WHY YOU'RE NOT THE SAME</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">To prove: You are a different person.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Suppose you are the same person. Then you'd still be a child, a baby, etc., which is absurd, QED.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">THEREFORE YOU ARE NEITHER THE SAME NOR DIFFERENT.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">If you can't say what the person is to begin with, and furthermore, you can't say whether a person is the same throughout a <em>single</em> life, then how can you say the <em>same person</em> is reincarnated in another body? What could reincarnation possibly mean?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Milinda asks: "When someone is reborn, is he the same or different?" Nagasena answers, "Neither." What's wrong here is our initial understanding of what it means to <em>be</em> anything in a world governed by dharma. The truth, says Nagasena, is that I'm not the infant or the grown-up but instead both comprise "one unit <em>depending on</em> ["in dependence on"] this very body." The relation of dependency is the key (just as in the chariot analogy).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Nagasena explains the dependency relation using two other similes:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.25in;  "><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">1.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">      </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">The lamp and the flame. The flame is never the same flame from moment to moment, though the lamp remains the same. Consciousness is the flame. The lamp is cosmic dharma. "Dharma" is from the Sanskrit word for "hold," "bear," support," or "sustain." Dharma is the law that holds the world together. One principle of dharma is the law of karma: the world is held together by the law of dependent origination (things come to be depending on how things were, and there is no difference between causal and moral dependence). Another principle of dharma is the unity of all sentient beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: -0.25in; margin-left: 0.25in;  "><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">2.<span style="font: 7pt 'Times New Roman';">      </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Milk / curds / butter / ghee. Milk becomes curds, which become butter, which becomes ghee. Milk is not the same as curds, butter, or ghee, but it's also not different. Those things <em>are</em> because of it, according to the laws of the universe. Something persists, in the sense that later things would not be as they are if earlier things had been different. It's misleading to say any nameable thing persists through all the changes, but nameable things in the past do really continue to influence things in the future. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Thus whatever constitutes "me" is not something I can name or point to, but what I am continues to affect what I become from one incarnation to the next. What I am now continues in the sense that it continues to <em>affect</em> the unfolding of the universe according to dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">BUT<strong> WHAT</strong> IS CONTINUOUS?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Milinda asks, "Is there any being that passes from one body to the next?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">Nagasena answers this without paradox: "No!" We just established that there is the universe and it is held together by the dharmas, which govern all change (dependent origination) of things within the universe. That's all there is. Change is the constant; "things" are not. So the question is not well-formed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">You are "you" only because you are still attached to things, and not "pure." You think of yourself (you are conscious of yourself) <em>as</em> someone who is separate (has the illusion of real difference and independence from the rest of the universe). You as this fictional separate being have desires: you think you want things or states of affairs to be different from the way they are. This constitutes being attached. As long as you remain attached, you remain discontented, under the illusion of separateness, and you remain part of the circle of change (samsara). But when we say "you" remain attached and continue through the cycle of samsara, we <strong>don't</strong> mean that there's some personal soul with particular traits that "goes" from one body to another. It just means that<span> </span>what comes later is causally/morally connected to earlier stuff according to the laws of karma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">WHY SHOULD I ABANDON ATTACHMENT, THEN, if I'm not going to be the same person who'll pay for it in my future incarnation?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">That's not the point.<span>  </span>If you're still attached, you're paying right now. Your craving now IS your suffering. Give it up and you have Nirvana now. The trick is to stop wishing you were off the wheel, stop wishing, period. You must realize that your true <em>being</em> is <em>nothing</em>, and has no desires at all.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">There's really no you, and if there's no you, there are no beliefs or desires for you to have, since according to folk psychology, beliefs and desires have metaphysically subjective being (like pains, they exist only as experienced). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; ">The folk psychology picture is profoundly misleading and believing it will make you miserable.</span></p>
