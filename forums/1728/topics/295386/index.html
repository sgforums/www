Good topic, have wanted to start a topic like that too. Maybe when I have gathered enough questions about it.<br><br>The most negative karma is not just about hurting Buddhas. The most negative karma one can commit, if I recall correctly in Wu2 Liang4 Shou4 Jing1 is actually slandering the Buddha's teachings (like saying Cause and Effect is bulls*** or baseless, Buddhas don't exist, Triple Gems are no refuge for us, etc).<br><br>Even an evil smile or wicked look at those praying to Earth-Store Bodhisattva would land you with a karma suffering so heavy that even after 1000 Buddhas are born and have gone into Parinibbana, you would still be in hell suffering day and night. For more details, please refer to the Sutra of Earth-Store Bodhisattva's Fundamental Vows.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to me, i think it's more like awareness than intention. unintented is like unknowing.<br><br>sometimes, if people are originally ignorance/unaware, they might be guided by the other people, peers and surrounding media, and hence their intention are as if okay to them. eat only mah. people are all doing it. right or not, they wouldn't know.<br>unknowingly eat already, next life come back, cycle happen again.<br>there's still a fine-line between neutral action and non-intention, due to the root of ignorance, imh.<br>it's not easy to stay aware all the time though.<br><br>----<br><br><blockquote>One instance of intention is one instance of kamma. When there is kamma there is immediate result. Even just one little thought, although not particularly important, is nevertheless not void of consequence. It will be at the least a "tiny speck" of kamma, added to the stream of conditions which shape mental activity. With repeated practice, through repeated proliferation by the mind, or through expression as external activity, the result becomes stronger in the form of character traits, physical features or repercussions from external sources.<br>A destructive intention does not have to be on a gross level. It may, for example, lead to the destruction of only a very small thing, such as when we angrily tear up a piece of paper. Even though that piece of paper has no importance in itself, the action still has some effect on the quality of the mind. The effect is very different from tearing up a piece of paper with a neutral state of mind, such as when throwing away scrap paper. If there is repeated implementation of such angry intention, the effects of accumulation will become clearer and clearer, and may develop to more significant levels. </blockquote><a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9280/kamma1.htm#meaning" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Academy/9280/kamma1.htm#meaning</a><br><br>/\</div>
