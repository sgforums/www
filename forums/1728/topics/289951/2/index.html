We just want to" fix the problem "no matter what. In fact most probably we wld hope for a quick- fix if there's any. And this is exactly where we might go to the wrong path.<br><br>There's no quick- fix soln in life. But it doesn't mean there's no soln at all. Just that it takes time.<br><br>My method is to first tell the person the effects of his actions( not neccessary mention the Dharma, although the theories may comes fr Dharma, as he may reject it outright), n if he seems to agree then I think the war is half won. The rest will be his own decisions n choices, all we can do is to observe quiety n press the emergency button again when he stray.<br><br>But in the case where he simply refuses to listen, then just let it be for the moment. Not abandon, but to just step aside. Becos to him, his actions is not a problem at all, we may be his problem! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So in this case, i wld just let him continues his lifestyle( of cos provided no humans, animals, or properties r harmed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ), n just wait for the efects to manifest one day. Then it may be possible for him to seek help n we can approach him again. Yes, it may happens in days, mths, yrs, but it wld happen. And yes, it may unfortunately  happen when we r long gone, but it will happen; n he will finally learn the lesson, albeit a little too late perhaps. No matter what, we shouldn't be too hard on ourselves in wanting to offer help. We help when we can, we stop when we've reached our limits.; then step aside, come back later n see wat happens. Things may hv changed, situations may hv change, n there may be new soln.<br><br>This is wat IsIs mentioned, that sometimes we hv to wait for the conditions to be ready for actons to be taken; or AndrewYap's "theory of the thirsty horse". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It helps to develope one pointedness and samadhi.<br><br>Lotus position is a yogic position that is very helpful in stabilising your mind and body -- if you practice yoga you will know that different bodily positions can have very different effects on your mental states, and also affects your meditative experience.<br><br>And btw, you can meditate while standing. This is called 'walking meditation', and I think is also as important as sitting. Furthermore, we must integrate our meditative state in our daily activities as much as possible as Buddhism is not just about sitting but living fully.<br><br>Next, I do not know the reason for chanting in 'archaic terms', but the language that I chant is Chinese, and I can understand what I am chanting. I think that is most important.<br><br>Like I just told a forummer --<br><br>"so my master say b4... chanting sutra is good but not as good as understanding sutra, but understanding sutra is not as good as practicing/'xing' the sutra, and that is still not as good as 'zheng'/realise/attain the essence of the sutra<br><br>so we shldnt just chant and chant... we must understand but not just understand theoretically<br><br>most impt is we must practice accordingly, and then realise the truth for ourselves"<br><blockquote>AEN, for a person who calls me dogmatic, you are the truly dogmatic one.</blockquote>Nope. I understand completely that I am saying.<br><br>On the other hand, all that you have said simply shows your ignorance of the subject, as shown above.<br><br>Update: and ignorance of subjects (i.e. meditation) is ok, but the worse thing is when you are completely ignorant of it, you think you know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
