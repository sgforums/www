              everywhere – but what do Buddhists think?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Morwenna Ferrier, The
              Guardian, 8 January 2017</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              is all about restraint and detachment, so no wonder the religion’s philosophy
              is proving popular at the start of a year in which many already feel anxious</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">London,
              UK -- New year, new tenuously legitimate diet rooted in spirituality. The
              Buddha diet is one of January’s horde. Ostensibly rooted in sensible,
              restrictive eating, it’s also one of the latest examples of consumer society
              co-opting asceticism to sell stuff.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              book Buddha’s Diet is climbing bestseller lists; Buddha bowls, the once
              left-field food-truck lunches, are coming to Marks &amp; Spencer (branded as
              nourish bowls); and the 15-strong chain of Buddha Bars has just celebrated its
              20th anniversary. Nothing, it seems, is safe from this blasphemous gravy train.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“It’s
              hardly surprising that people are trying to sell things attached to the concept
              of Buddhism,” says Singhamanas, who was ordained into the Triratna Buddhist
              order in 2012 and now works at the London Buddhist Centre. “It’s the idea that
              something can give you peace, ease, energy – something mysterious, something
              holy but not religious.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Semantically,
              it’s a logical next step on from mindfulness, which has mutated from meditative
              practice to a post-lunch app, and gone mass. Accountability lies with the
              “clever PR gurus” who have cottoned on to this, says Singhamanas. “In this
              economic system, all it takes is someone to apply that word to something and it
              suddenly seems very attractive.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Tucked
              away, though, there is method here. The co-author of Buddha’s Diet, Dan
              Zigmond, is an ordained monk, and intermittent fasting has always been key to
              Buddhism. Given our propensity towards extremes “Buddha’s ‘middle way’ of
              moderation might have particular relevance” now, he suggests. It’s a good diet:
              avoid processed foods, eat more protein, dine slowly and not late. There are
              even cheat days when you can gorge, so forgiving is the religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">In
              fairness, Buddhism has long had healthy eating nailed. The Buddha effigy –
              cuddly, pot-bellied – is actually a 1,000-year-old Chinese monk. “The real
              Buddha was quite fit,” says Zigmond. Equally, Buddha Bowls (vegetarian medleys
              in, yes, bowls) have authenticity, being loosely based on the practice of
              oryoki – meditative eating – and the bowls are modelled on Buddha’s head.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">As
              you might expect from a Buddhist, Singhamanas is relatively tolerant about the
              rebranding. “Most Buddhists are pretty easy-going – I haven’t heard anyone
              pontificating over M&amp;S ,” he says, “but it might be a little misleading.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              is more offended by the chain of Buddha Bars. Named, it is thought, because the
              original space was not dissimilar to a temple and the music played to customers
              considered to be “Zen-like”, there was a small outcry, some protests in Jakarta
              and blacking out of the bar’s CDs in Dubai over fears of idolatry. To
              Singhamanas “it’s not ethical. Buddhism promotes clarity and awareness,
              something the alcohol industry isn’t exactly behind.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Equally,
              consumerism is contradictory to the basic tenet of Buddhism: the idea of ending
              suffering through detachment. James Shaheen, editor of Tricycle: The Buddhist
              Review, agrees: “If you’re selling something a buyer doesn’t really need, it
              helps to imbue it with some promise of spiritual fulfilment or peace. It works
              for the seller. The buyer often regrets it.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">So
              why now, why 2017? One could blame post-Brexit vote/pre-Trump anxiety. “Judging
              by the number of people coming through the doors now, I’d say people aren’t
              looking forward to the new year,” says Singhamanas. “With regards to politics
              and the environment, they are feeling apprehensive and are looking for
              something to ground them.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He’s
              sceptical as to whether a healthy snack from M&amp;S can save us from
              existential crisis: “If a bowl were able to give you all that – if it were that
              easy – I wouldn’t be doing what I’m doing.”</span></p>
