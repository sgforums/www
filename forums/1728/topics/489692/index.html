                      collection of expectations and assumptions based on our early, formative
                      experiences in life: the interactions between ourselves in our first two or
                      three years of life and our caretakers. These developmental events form lasting
                      imprints on the young, impressionable mind, shaping how we view ourselves,
                      other people and the surrounding universe.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;">It is sadly ironic, and obviously hindering to the healing
                      process, that so many of the root experiences that continue to shape our
                      behaviors and self-views occurred</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;"> </span><a style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: inherit; box-sizing: border-box;" href="http://www.adoptionsupport.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Module-5-Handout-5.3.pdf"><span style="color: #015e50; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">before we're capable of creating narrative memories</span></a><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;">; in
                      other words, the core of our behavioral patterns are established by events --
                      interactions with caretakers essentially -- that we'll never be able to recall.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;">We act in accordance with inner road maps that are largely
                      unknown to us directly, as they're stored in a largely unconscious,
                      behind-the-scenes region of the brain (if we follow</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;"> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="http://www.allanschore.com/pdf/SchoreAttachHumDev.pdf"><span style="color: #015e50; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">Allan

                      the left hemisphere of the frontal lobe -- by pulling our attention back, again
                      and again, to the dramas we're obsessing over. In contrast to the left, the
                      right hemisphere works behind the scenes, providing a vigilant lookout for any
                      experience reminiscent of wounding, childhood abandonments; spotting a possible
                      rejection scenario in the present, it can direct awareness against our will,
                      focusing on the very people we'd prefer to forget.</span></p>

                      core beliefs surface as conscious thoughts: in those rare conversations where
                      we find ourselves, revealing those deepest views of "the way things
                      are" to others, revelations of generally hidden philosophies of self and
                      other.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>If we work with others in a healing
                      capacity, we'll watch as the suffering constantly seek verification and support
                      for the very views and beliefs that are maintaining our suffering; people tend
                      to seek confirmation for dualistic blame -- shame schemes, one moment
                      denouncing bosses, spouses, friends, colleagues as the culprits who've caused
                      their addictions or depression; other times blaming themselves in an entirely
                      unconstructive way, explaining that they're "damaged" or
                      "broken," incapable of thinking or acting in skillful ways. It's akin
                      to the alcoholic in denial, for the very patterns of blame and self-loathing
                      that keep them trapped in pathological addictions and perceptual distortions.</span></p>

                      than questioning our beliefs about how the world operates, which the Buddha
                      taught as a necessary quality in happiness and liberation, we invariably seek a
                      confirmation of our perceptions, further enslaving us to the damaging behaviors
                      that result from these views. To employ an analogy, someone losing their
                      hearing can blame others for "talking too softly" or
                      "mumbling." Or, with clarity provided by calm reflection, note a
                      pattern of being unable to hear others in various situations, and realize that
                      the problem is not with the world, but with the way its being perceived. In
                      other words, we become aware of our distorted perceptions by observing patterns
                      of experience, rather than reacting to appearances.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Let's investigate another example:
                      if, during our childhood years, we were excessively directed and intrusively
                      monitored by one or more parents, what results in adult years is
                      "engulfment fear," a shunning of intimacy, in which we pull away when
                      others seek any form of emotional commitment or disclosure. Driven by this
                      pattern, we may blame each successive partner for our retreat from intimacy,
                      failing to see the pattern, or road map, that's directing the behavior. As the
                      pattern grows increasingly apparent, we may even seek approval for our views
                      and behavior from friends, demanding an agreement that "romantic partners
                      are too demanding." In short, we fail to see patterns that us imprison us
                      and then demand allegiance to the resultant justifications.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>When we walk into a social gathering filled with strangers
                      we automatically prepare ourselves to act in accordance with our self-views; as
                      working models of self-and-other they predict how strangers will react to our
                      presence. These underlying perspectives filter our experiences, akin to wearing
                      an unnoticed pair of lenses that are subtly distorting everything we experience
                      in life. Some of us will operate from the underlying assumption that our needs
                      will be met in the world; when we walk into a social gathering, for example a
                      party filled with strangers, we'll look around and act according to the
                      assumption that others will be friendly and accommodating. Such confidence
                      allows us to investigate the room and connect with others, free of crippling
                      hesitancy or fear. This confidence was born in the<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA273&amp;dq=internal+working+model+attachment+theory&amp;ots=WTqlvDvl1n&amp;sig=XvRsaJMgFSmbm_D5EKRlaDyAwTs#v=onepage&amp;q=internal%20working%20model%20attachment%20theory&amp;f=false"><span style="color: #015e50; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">earliest relational experiences of life</span></a>, where
                      caretakers displayed consistent, tolerant parenting skills (Winnicott referred
                      to this as the "good enough mother").</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>

                      of empathy or identification with other people, operating from a constant
                      hunger for attention. Let's consider the narcissist, for example. There's a
                      time in childhood, perhaps in the second year of life, when parents are not as
                      available as they were previously; most of us learn that our caretakers can be
                      pulled away to focus their attentions elsewhere (other responsibilities and
                      obligations). These deflating experiences are essential, as they force us to
                      abandon many of the grandiose fantasies of early infancy, where our every
                      gesture brought some degree of attention; suddenly the distracted caretaker
                      appears, and we have to adapt to a news and forces us to live in a new reality;
                      every bid for attention is not received.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>But<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="http://www.minddisorders.com/Kau-Nu/Narcissistic-personality-disorder.html"><span style="color: #015e50; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">the narcissist bypasses this important stage of development</span></a>,
                      as during that stage the caretaker's attention remains approving and fixed, the
                      child is not relieved of its grandiosity while it remains in the orbit of the
                      overly rewarding parent. But this attention comes at a cost. The budding
                      narcissist performs a display of inauthentic emotions and behaviors to maintain
                      the caretaker's ongoing admiration: creativity or confidence is rewarded so long
                      as frustration or sadness is concealed. While the inevitable and painful phase
                      of losing the parent's attention is largely avoided, the individual never
                      learns how to process disconnection. Not knowing how to process abandonment
                      leads to a terror of it occurring, and so the narcissist develops their
                      defense, which is a "false self" possessed of all the qualities that
                      can insulate them from disappointment and rejection; they are superior to
                      others. To maintain their sense of superiority and immunity to rejection, a
                      narcissist seeks cheerleaders, as if people were put into the world to provide
                      an audience; like the mother or father of infancy, friends, lovers and
                      colleagues are collected to clap and applaud.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;">Eventually the Narcissist's False
                      Self becomes an incubator for addictive behaviors: as pressure builds to
                      maintain constant approval and recognition, the fear of inevitable abandonment
                      grows; loss in imminent, as no one can keep up this show forever. And so the
                      narcissist shops to accumulate a collection of "unique and valuable
                      objects" that prove his or her worth; he invests in the stock market to
                      demonstrate amazing business acumen. Pathological gambling, drug use, drinking,
                      reckless behavior are certain to follow. Unfortunately, its only when everything
                      fails, and the "dreaded experience" of traumatic abandonment by
                      others occurs that the pattern can be seen and the Narcissist be expected to
                      seek help.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>Others come to expect that their
                      needs will never be met, while everyone else in the room seems to be popular
                      and knows the secret to getting attention and success in the world. Navigating
                      through life via this perspective, we'll expect others to reject or our
                      emotions and needs, so we don't bother to play the game of human intimacy. The
                      world is a dangerous place where other people are not interested in our
                      happiness; other people are essentially uncaring. The distortion makes us
                      overlook how much we need connection with others. Like forgoing sustaining
                      amounts of food, shelter, medicine, if we give up on empathetic support from
                      others, we weaken and never flourish.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>In this way karma -- our actions and thoughts, which
                      neurally ingrain future tendencies and states of mind -- is based on our
                      working models and is self-reinforcing. Every time we avoid the risks involved
                      with asking for help from others, shrinking from the possibility of love or
                      compassion,<span> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-practice/201305/avoidance-coping"><span style="color: #015e50; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">we reinforce the view we won't get what we need</span></a>. Our road
                      maps (or, in Buddhist lingo, wrong views) are the ultimate cause of this
                      debilitating feedback loop: If we can't perceive the real conditions that are
                      occurring in each moment, we wont see what's available to us -- we'll seek out
                      people who are cold and rejecting, while overlooking the kind and generous. We
                      won't ask for what we need. If we can see other people without this distorted
                      perceptions, which are based on past interactions with entirely different
                      individuals, we may become aware that there's far more help available than our
                      predispositions or programming would have us believe.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>

                      essentially unkind, we may immediately resort to manipulative behaviors to get
                      our needs met; rather than asking for cooperation, we'll maneuver in ways to
                      get what we want with less risk of rejection. We may resort to lies, subterfuge
                      or threats (emotional blackmail); eventually we'll stumble and fail; our
                      relationships will inevitably suffer. Or we may eventually resort to presenting
                      to the world what Winnicott called a</span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;"> </span><a style="box-sizing: border-box; line-height: inherit;" href="http://icpla.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Daehnert-C-The-False-Self-Contemp.-Psychoa.-34-251-271.pdf"><span style="color: #015e50; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">"false self:"</span></a><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;"> </span><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 19.65pt;">we'll say or do whatever it takes to
                      get our needs met; shunting aside our authentic moods and feelings, we'll offer
                      inauthentic behaviors, performances of enthusiasm or limitless acts of
                      accommodating acts, all in the hope we'll eventually win our fair share of the
                      pie. Rather than presenting ourselves authentically, we act out what we believe
                      they want.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>

                      were it not for one significant drawback: no one can sustain a performance for
                      hours on end, much less an entire lifetime. Eventually we slip up and feel our
                      pesky, real emotions and impulses start to arise; we panic, fearing that if
                      other people may see through the cracks in the facade, discovering who we
                      really are, and everything we've accomplished in the charade will fall apart.
                      Even if we succeed in accomplishing great feats -- becoming successful lawyers
                      or business people in the hunt for acceptance and love -- we'll feel a barren
                      emptiness where self-worth should reside, for the acceptance we've received is
                      not for our authentic, spontaneous, true selves.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>As we force ourselves into the shapes
                      and behaviors we believe other people expect, resentment and anger grows. We're
                      suppressing needs after all, just for a modicum of acceptance from others.
                      Moral outrage invariably arises, as other people are only accepting a false presentation:
                      how dare they! Many relationships end in this sad drama, for when we finally
                      show our true selves, all the hidden weaknesses, sadness and fears, our
                      "significant others" and close friends will look at us dismay and
                      respond with some confusion, rather than the acceptance we crave: Why have we
                      been deceiving them for so long?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 14.05pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 19.65pt; vertical-align: baseline; box-sizing: border-box; text-rendering: optimizeLegibility; font-stretch: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #333333;'>And so these measures reinforce the
                      belief that the world is fundamentally rejecting and uncooperative. Stress and
                      suffering, in the form of agitation, are the inevitable results.</span></p>
