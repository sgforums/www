              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>During a time when every societal shift is sliced
              into wedges of data by the latest research poll, religion has been boiled down
              to how often we sit in the pews, how much we pray, even if we are
              "absolutely certain" to "not at all certain" about a belief
              in God.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>What can quickly get pushed aside is the larger
              picture. Older adults, for example, are far more likely to claim a religion
              than their children or grandchildren, according to studies. But even the most
              cursory search of the Internet shows that the big takeaway from all the number
              crunching is that 20- and 30-somethings somehow need to be won over.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>The nuances of faith among the most devoted
              generations — what religion brings to their lives, even how they find a sense
              of the spiritual — end up getting lost.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Robert Atchley, a professor of gerontology emeritus
              who served as director of the Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University in
              Ohio, had what he calls his first "epiphany" on this subject years
              ago while interviewing dozens of older, retired women for a research project.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>His plan was to see how they were adapting to their
              lives after leaving the workforce, yet he quickly realized there was something
              going on that he wanted to bottle up and keep for himself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>"They knew who they were, they were totally
              comfortable in their own being, they knew what they wanted out of life and how
              to get it. I mean, I came away from doing interviews with a hundred or so of
              those people and I said, "Whatever it is they've got, I want some of
              it,'" Atchley recalled.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Part of being comfortable in their own skin, he
              found, was living with a sense of the spiritual. As time wore on, he began to
              study the issue at length and in 2009 released a book called "Spirituality
              and Aging" (Johns Hopkins University Press).</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>As adults age, the way they see their religion and
              how it resonates in their lives often becomes more personal, he said. They
              might pick and choose what's most important to them in their religious beliefs
              and practices, or enjoy a stronger connection with their religious community.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Elements of their religion also may provide more
              comfort than ever before and a deeper spiritual connection, or transcending the
              self and connecting with a higher power and/or the sacred, he said. There also
              can be a sort of moment-to-moment spirituality that finds more meaning in the
              everyday, whether it's through nature, music, community work, meditation or
              other means.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>"There's a concept called gerotranscendence;
              it's the idea that as people get older they tend to be drawn to a much more
              transcendent perspective about what they're up to and what's going on. It
              doesn't mean you're off in never-never land, it means that you are actually
              present in a way that you weren't when your head was running everything a mile
              a minute," he said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>In her work looking at the issue of aging and
              resiliency, Lydia Manning, director of the Center for Gerontology at Concordia
              University in Chicago, noted that spirituality emerged as an important factor
              in the aging process. She has found that older adults often use their religious
              faith and spirituality as tools for helping them manage adversity.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>During one study on resiliency, she interviewed 64
              older adults, and only 19 reported that spirituality or religion were not part
              of how they negotiated through life's struggles. Even hardships such as serious
              illness or the death of a loved one were often seen as "invitations to
              strengthen their spiritual muscle," whether it was through practices such
              as prayer, meditation or connecting with others in their spiritual community,
              she said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>In 2012, Manning published the findings of another
              study focusing on spiritual resilience. It included multiple interviews with
              six women in their 80s, five who identified as Christians and one who was
              Unitarian Universalist. What she found was a sense of purpose and the ability
              to reframe their hardships into opportunities to practice a gratitude that was
              "expressed in connection with their spirituality and personal relationship
              with God."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>In terms of how individual faith is molded and
              shaped as time goes on, there is no easy answer, according to the experts. For
              some older adults, attending worship services can be a means of strong social
              and spiritual support. The baby boomers, they add, are going to continue to
              redefine societal norms, including what it means to be spiritual or religious.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Vernon Towne, a retired Presbyterian pastor of 40
              years who most recently served at Mountain View Presbyterian Church in Sun City
              Summerlin, noted that the evolution of someone's religious or spiritual life is
              very personal and comes down to individual experiences, their level of faith,
              values and beliefs.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>There is little doubt, however, that growing older
              brings forth the big questions of mortality, including one's relationship to
              God. Sometimes this means turning to particular doctrines and rituals of a
              religion that have held a deep meaning in the past, he said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Towne, who is 73, also points to a growth in the
              day-to-day spiritual aspects of faith as we age or at least more of an
              awareness of the "divine," whether it's in the present or the past.
              In his own life, the spiritual has come through in moments of silent prayer and
              meditation, divine coincidences, even the beauty of a thunderstorm, he said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>For his wife, Margaret, who holds a doctorate in
              education and has taught both critical thinking and science-and-religion
              courses during her career, faith is a lifetime journey that continues, no matter
              one's age. The gift of growing older is having the time to discuss it with
              others, explore its mysteries and hang on to a sense of humility that comes
              from not having all the answers, she said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>"There's so much we don't understand, I guess
              that's where the (expression), 'You do it by faith,' comes from, because you
              don't have the knowledge. So I think the humility of just being able to say, 'I
              have to leave it in the Lord's hands, I don't know this, I have to trust him
              and have faith.'"</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>The idea that religion and spirituality are anything
              but static holds true for others.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Sandra Dunn, Women's Division region leader with the
              Las Vegas SGI Buddhist center, has seen her own spirituality evolve into
              something that holds more of a "preciousness and profundity" at the
              age of 53 than it did when she was younger, she said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>She grew up in a Buddhist home, but it has been the
              joys and struggles of life that have given her a clearer understanding of her
              faith. The daily prayers and chanting are precious moments of self-reflection,
              she said, but it's the belief that she has the ability to transform her life in
              positive ways that is continually unfolding.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>"You start to realize, you know, anything can
              be a bad or good situation, anything can be positive or negative. It's really
              how we look at it and how we choose to pursue that with our behavior," she
              said.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>"My mom, who is 82, her life is so carefree, I
              can't imagine not wanting to be like that at her age," she added. "I
              guess the quality of life is what really attracts me (to Buddhism). As I get
              older, I see these examples in my life of people who are strong believers,
              strong practitioners."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 12pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 14.95pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";   color: #333333;'>Sitting in the living room of their northwest Las
              Vegas home, Binnie and Clay Wilkin talked about the way their Unitarian Universalist
              religion embraces principles that only resonate more and more as time goes by.
              For them, spirituality is about a personal search for what rings true to the
              individual, including the exploration of different faiths.</span></p>

              "Christian-based spiritual voyager" before she started attending
              Unitarian Universalist services with her husband about 10 years ago. "Once
              we establish that there is one truth, that means that our life is built on
              rejecting other truths, and it's the one thing about traditional religions that
              has disturbed me all these years," Binnie said.</span></p>

              reflection of being open to differences and the acceptance of varying ways of
              seeing the world. When asked what they considered the most important principle
              of their religion, Clay, who is 86, immediately pointed to a belief in the
              "interconnectedness of all life."</span></p>

              changes, but sometimes it's what you can do if you simply could talk to
              somebody and pass on something that may be of value to them, and also to take
              from them what may be of value to you, and that's a lifelong thing, it doesn't
              end," Clay said.</span></p>
