            <div class='col-md body'>here's something.....<br><br>lately i gone down to bugis with my kid, had a walk and stopped by outside a  temple and paid my respect to bodhisattva avalokiteshvara. took 3 incence sticks and lit up as an offering so as to reach out to the sentient beings for them to be able to receive blessings from the bodhisattvas. some people were so "kia-su" rushing pushing greedily wanna light up their own incence sticks 1st and selfishly take up their own spaces. while i wanted to light up mine, i just stood aside and waited for my turn and let those seemed "hurry" to finish 1st. then a gal was holding a bunch of incence sticks in her hands at the level of her chest walking around among the crowd. its so smoky and dangerous and i saw that i looked at her looked at her sticks and she looked at me looked at her sticks and continued to hold it that way. later she almost burned someone in front of her and the smoke went into that person's eyes. she didn't wanna admit her guilt and didn't look sorry about what she had done. just as she was walking pass me. i told her straight into her face nicely that next time cannot carry them like that as its dangerous &amp; must carry them high above especially in crowded place. we exchanged smiles &amp; left.<br><br>many people have a misconception that buddhism is a very old fashion traditional "religion" and do things overly without being mindful. some even place the image of bodhisattvas outside their balcony under the rain &amp; shine.... or have the concept that they must place facing the door.... to ward off evil or intruders..... its like disrecpecting..... taking the bodhisattvas as door guarding dogs? if one will meet danger one will meet thats karma a matter of time.........<br><br>shouldn't we treat and respect the images properly just like any humans who would like to be in the comfort of their home warm and safe. which humans would wanna sit at their doors all day to look after the home like a security guard.<br><br>well..... do correct me if i'm wrong please</div>

For example, the house can have a facing direction of South and the main door happens to be facing south. So placing the altar in that direction is ok.<br><br>Guess for some ppl, they want to see the images of Buddha first thing when they open the door. Less they lose their head and bring back the negativity of the days' work back home.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

One is a therava center another is RC activity center.<br><br>Theravada Center response.<br>-- The book was passed from one person to the next with each of them saying "This book is a new age spirituality book, useless". Eventually this book landed in the Bhante's (monk) hands. He skimmed thru the pages, turned back towards everybody and said "This book is not new age. This book is in fact very old age and its core Buddhist teachings. You can see the shock faces on the people. Later he walked to wards me carrying this book and said "I'm glad that there are still people who understands such teachings these days!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>RC response<br>-- I sat down and started talking about this book and immediately I get an answer "Oh who is the author, could it be Ven Sheng Kai?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   Then I said nope, the person is middle-aged and he's residing in Europe. I then wrote down the title and author of the book and told everyone "This is what Ven Sheng Kai and teacher Chen taught and will perhaps be the first book in the Da Shi Zhi Ye Su Ji Du Zong". I get another suprised look again  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Now you see how I enjoyed myself when I visit Buddhist centers these days!</div>
