            <div class='col-md body'>It is stated in the sutras that the Sangha, which may incld the Buddha, wore robes stitched together by multiple rags that ppl throw away. The color of the rags are usually dark colors. Sometimes it is common to see the robes in different colors because the rags that made it up are different in color<br><br>In the past cloth is considered a luxury item unlike now.<br><br>When Buddhism spreaded to China, the Chinese discarded the traditional sangha robe and wore their own chinese traditional clothes instead. So to say the chinese sangha robes are "traditional" is actually false. I would call it "Old-Fashioned". This is because the chinese changed the robe to be more in line with the fashion then. But over the years, ppl dun wear like that anymore but they still stick to the old Luo Han costume. Its just a dilemma.</div>

But yes, Prajna Paramita sutras are all 'commentaries of Da Zhi Mu Fa', as Shi Fu has put it. And Shi Fu did not say it is solely Ren Cheng dharma, but he said it was 'Patriarch's dharma, passed down from patriarches'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And he also warned people not to anyhow 'bang4 fa3'.<br><br>Prajna Paramita is taught throughout Mahayana.

In fact Shen Kai Shi Fu did not teach dharma in any 'Zong', he did not name any sect until 1993. Its bcos many ppl want a name and therefore my master gave it a name which he thinks suits it best. Not wei-shi (consciousness-only sect), but wei-fo.<br><br><blockquote>And to say rencheng choose not to be part of SBF is laughable. Do you think SBF wants to associate itself with Rencheng? Its just a graceful way by Rencheng as an excuse.</blockquote>I checked around and do not know what is the official stance of SBF prior to the controversy. But anyway whether SBF recognise RC just because of the robe issue, doesnt matter us. You yourself already said it is just a cultural baggage. And unfortunately there are a lot of things in Singapore Buddhism that is still strongly tied to these baggages. Mahayana robes that we know nowadays are not the same robes as what Buddha wore.<br><br>I dare to say that when Buddhism needs to go to space, all the monks and nuns uniforms will totally be changed. They will no longer be wearing the robes that Buddha wore in those days, but instead, they will be wearing spacesuits.<br><br><blockquote>When u pick up some CDs or books, many of the things spoken are one-sided.

Our books have mentioned Arhants over and over again, and we do not generally speak disparagingly about liberated saints. But encouraged people to walk the Bodhisattva path. This is just a typical characteristics of all Mahayana traditions. Do you include Mahayana sutras as being a fault of Chinese Buddhism? This is a whole different issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by earthling82:<br>[b]you are too ready to defend RC WY. This is the problem. This is why I left RC. Because of ppl like you. If you perceive RC to be good, then there is a perception of Bad. He who talks in terms of Good/Bad does not see the Dhamma and is trapped in the dualism of samsara. The dhamma is everywhere but you only see it in RC thru Ven Sheng Kai.</blockquote>It is not a matter of good or bad. But being someone to 'hu fa'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Against people who speak falsely. BTW I do not have any biasness for RC, if you speak falsely about Vajrayana, about Zen, about Theravada, I would be ready to 'defend'.<br><br>And I did not hide facts just becos "i perceive RC to be good".<br><br>BTW I already know who you are, and who you are directly speaking of. I think it is just a misunderstanding. Some other people do not get in touch with other sects and therefore do not understand the other sects well enough than us. But its ok - just let him focus on his own path.<br><br><blockquote>I still go back once in a while and interact with the ppl there. Because to me, everything in life is practise, I find no need to adhere to any center. The external is what RC is all about. The internal RC is to be realised. Like what Ven Jue Wu said there is no need to adhere to Buddhism. Just adhere to the Dhamma. Now when I say Dhamma, refer to the Pali meaning of Dhamma before you comment.</blockquote>Adhering to a particular practise is impt for us, bcos we advocate Yi Men Shen Ru. Because all Buddhist sects teach differently and practise different ways, we must focus on a particular one. You cant possibly practise all the dharma doors. It will only confuse yourself. Therefore if practise zen, just focus on zen. If practise vajrayana, focus on vajrayana.<br><br>And we do agree that all 84000 dharmas doors are equal. But 'yi men shen ru' is impt.<br><br>But I also agree with what you said. Everywhere is dao4 chang3.<br><br>BTW it is undeniable that Ren Cheng still got Chinese baggage. Its not something that we say we want, then we can simply get rid of them. Its not so easy. I believe what shi fu did was already a big step. He wanted to create a 'Global Buddhism'. Too little can be done in that era.<br><br>It must be done in a free environment like United States. Thats the only hope.</div>

It all depends on the individuals. Master have always emphasized 'Dong4 Zhong1 Xiu1', how many people actually does it, we dont know.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cenarious:</div><div class="quote_body">what the hell is a Ru Fa??</div></blockquote>Now I give u an example. Fa or Dhamma is about phenomena. What you see happening right now...for example the teaching of Dhamma, the giving to charity, the hustle of going to work, the acts of inpurity, the 911 attacks and the Tsunami....all of them are in accordance with the Dhamma and exist in harmony with it.<br><br>Now to contemplate the universe, we must know that Fa happens in constant flux and change. Knowing that Dhamma is also a Fa used to appease the inner arising and ceasing, and since Fa is always used to balance Fa...this realisation leads you to understand that Fa and non-Fa are actually 2 faces of the same coin.  Awareness brings about this knowing and leads to balance. And this is known as the middle path. To see the totality of the universe w/o the incessant mental noise and stripped away of Buddhist teachings is the beginning of realisation.<br><br>By the power of this truth, may we cease to contemplate the universe and realise englightenment here and now.</div>
