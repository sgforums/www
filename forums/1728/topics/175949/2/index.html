Knowing that Dhamma is also a Fa used to appease the inner arising and ceasing, and since Fa is always used to balance Fa...this realisation leads you to understand that Fa and non-Fa are actually 2 faces of the same coin.  Awareness brings about this knowing and leads to balance. And this is known as the middle path. To see the totality of the universe w/o the incessant mental noise and stripped away of Buddhist teachings is the beginning of realisation.<br><br>By the power of this truth, may we cease to contemplate the universe and realise englightenment here and now.</div></blockquote>Agreed.</div>

The arhat has only attained the voidness of the individual, so the arhat has not yet attained the full perfection of emptiness. He would like to stay in nirvana, so for him nirvana is not empty. Likewise, he has an aversion to birth and death, so his experience of the emptiness of birth and death is not thorough. It's as if you said, "The Ch'an Center is a terrible place. I want to be free of it, so I will go across the street and never come back." You cross the street, and you are free of the trouble and the evil of the Ch'an Center. However, as long as you dare not cross the street, and hold on to the idea that the Ch'an Center is a demonic cave, you are still attached to it. The Ch'an Center is not empty for you, and you are not thoroughly free of it. The Arhat is like that, and both nirvana and birth and death are not thoroughly empty for him.<br><br>The Buddha says, "When this voidness (of the person) is perfectly clear, you will realize that all dharmas (phenomena) are void." This is the state of the Mahayana bodhisattva. A bodhisattva realizes that not only the self which is formed of the five skandhas is empty, but the five skandhas, themselves, are also empty. The three realms, birth and death, in fact, all dharmas, are empty. If the cycle of birth and death is empty, then what can it do to me? So a bodhisattva does not seek to depart from the cycle of birth and death, but he also is not deluded within the cycle of birth and death. This state is called the emptiness of both person and dharma, and it is the completion, or perfection, of emptiness. When one has realized the emptiness of dharmas, one is liberated from nirvana dharma as well as from samsara dharma.</span></div>

Wherefore because it is thru Prajna that arises the sutta.<br><br>Prajna has various translated meanings in both the Pali and Mahayana Text. Now if you recall, Prajna is translated as Wisdom in most places but in RC its translated as Mother of Wisdom. The Da Zhi Mu Fa is the mother of all wisdom. Which is why the Heart sutra is sometimes explained right after the transmission of the Dhamma.<br><br>Paramita is the verb. The action of bringing it into perfection. Paramita is sometimes translated into Paramita.<br><br>So why isn't Prajna Paramita = Da Zhi Mu Fa. And in any case Dhamma has no fixed words, no fixed forms and no fixed presentation methods. When we say "This" = Da Zhi Mu Fa, we are already narrowing it into something digestable to the human mind. This narrowing is the fundamental delusion. Or "Original Sin" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> to our sufferings. However on a deeper level, without this narrowing, we won't understand. Because we need to grasp hold of something. The narrowing action by itself is still not original delusion. It is still in accord with Dhamma. Why because while thinking is not entirely conciousness, thinking is still within conciousness which is all-abiding. But uncontrollable and unstoppable narrowing, the grasping is the problem <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hence. Both Da Zhi Mu Fa and Prajna Paramita are fundamentally a reduced entity used to describe "...........................". The practising of either one will lead to union with the "...........................". From there on, there is no cultivation, but substaining"<br><br>To claim exclusive possession of some "Ultimate truth" or "High dhamma" is the common thing i see everywhere incld in RC. This results in a "Superior/Inferior" view which is delusional. Anything from Dhamma transmission, worldy skills, knowledge, academic and work achievements results from this inbalance. And the Holy War we're seeing now is also caused by militants who claim to be in exclusive possession of some truth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The reason why teacher chen asked "Have you learnt something" after the dhamma transmission is to point to the above problem. Of course as you also know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  the goal of practising Buddhism is to be in union with the Dhamma realm, and Da Zhi Mu Fa is the "Describing" method. It is instant transmutation and union with the universe. When the grasping stops, there is no gain nor loss. Hence the above problem will not surface.<br><br>Dao Chang is everywhere. Not just physically. Knowing this there is no limitation to which center we go. U can take it as training. To experience suffering. Through this experience, you can practise bringing out your awareness. From there, you --- deliver concious awareness into the world using a human body....   Suffering cease to be suffering, but a medium where purity comes into being. This is the true spirit of RC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The chinese govt also claimed rights over part of the kashmir region. But historically Chinese have wars with many countries so little suprise with some history-inherited racism.<br><br>But fundamentally racism is caused by our deluded minds.
