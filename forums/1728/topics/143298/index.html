This happened to me also, and those who have meditated until their thoughts have been "stilled". So anyone who experiences this shouldn't be alarmed or try to breathe again.<br><br>I have my own experiences which I believed to be Jhanic, but is not exactly similar to your experience. If there was anything that could describe what I experienced the strongest, it is probably "Piti" (ecstasy).<br><br>I don't know whether your experience is 1st jhana or not, if you have meditation teacher best to ask your teacher. Otherwise.. listen to  advise from Sangha, because he is quite trained in both Jhanas and Vipassana practices and has more meditation experiences to share. He has just returned from the Metta Retreat yesterday.<br><br>My advise to you is not to be attached to any kind of experiences or hold onto any expectations as it can hinder you. Just meditate with a pure mind, don't worry about anything else.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The essential conditions to develope jhana is withdrawal from our senses and having one pointedness.<br><br>A very trained person can sit in a very noisy environment and not become affected by the noise at all. Do you know if you reach higher jhanas, even if someone chops off your hand, you will not be affected at all? 1st Jhana maybe not so powerful yet. Well, that is how strong the one pointedness of jhana is.<br><br>As for eating, best is if you can eat vegetarian meals as it does help in meditation, many have said. Otherwise (just as any Buddhist should), eat the 5 clean sources of meat:<br><br>(1) That he did not slaughter the animal personally<br>(2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br>(4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br>(5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter<br><br>Also try to avoid eating pungent herbs: garlic, chives, leeks, onions, and asafoetida. It can cause passion and anger and distrupt meditation.<br><br>A definite No is Alcohol. My dharma teacher tells us that she unknowingly drank some Ginseng wine, and for a long time was unable to return to the previous stable state of samadhi. Sangha also have similar experience, his friends put alcohol into his drink without telling him, and then for quite some time was unable to do jhana or vipassana practise, like a helpless baby.<br><br>Back to First Jhana,<br><br><blockquote>First Jhana<br><br>Once Access Concentration has been established, you now induce the next factor of the First Jhana. This third factor is called Piti and is variously translated as delight, euphoria, rapture and ecstasy. By shifting your attention from the meditation subject to a pleasant sensation, particularly a pleasant physical sensation, and doing nothing more than not becoming distracted from the pleasant sensation, you will "automatically" enter the First Jhana. The experience is that the pleasant sensation grows in intensity until it explodes into an unmistakable state of ecstasy. This is Piti, which is primarily a physical experience. Physical pleasure this intense is accompanied by emotional pleasure, and this emotional pleasure is Sukha (joy) which is the fourth factor of the First Jhana. The last factor of the first Jhana is Ekaggata (one-pointedness of mind). Like Sukha, this factor arises without you doing anything, and as long as you remain totally focused on the physical and emotional pleasure, you will remain in the first Jhana.<br><br>As far as I have been able to determine, based on my own experience, the entry into the first Jhana from a physiological perspective proceeds something like this:<br><br>1. You quiet your mind with the initial and sustained attention to the meditation subject. I suspect that brain wave activity shows a noticable decrease during Access Concentration.<br><br>2. By shifting your attention to a pleasant sensation, you set up a positive reinforcement feedback loop within your quiet mind. For example, one of the most useful pleasant sensations to focus on is a smile. The act of smiling generates endorphins, which make you feel good, which makes you smile more, which generates more endorphins, etc.<br><br>3. The final and most difficult part of entering the First Jhana is to not do anything but observe the pleasure. Any attempt to increase the pleasure, even any thoughts of wanting to increase the pleasure, interrupt the feedback loop and drop you into a less quiet state of mind. But by doing nothing but focusing intently on the pleasure, you are propelled into an unmistakably altered state of consciousness.<br><br>See also: Mara</blockquote></div>
