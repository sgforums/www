              <p>1st Buddhist council (5th c. BCE)
              The first Buddhist council was held soon after the death of the Buddha
              under the patronage of king Ajatasatru of the Magadha empire, and
              presided by a monk named Mahakasyapa, at Rajagriha (today's Rajgir).
              The objective of the council was to record the Buddha's sayings (sutra)
              and codify monastic rules (vinaya): Ananda, one of the Buddha's main
              disciples and his cousin, was called upon to recite the discourses of
              the Buddha, and Upali, another disciple, recited the rules of the
              vinaya. These became the basis of the Pali Canon, which has been the
              orthodox text of reference throughout the history of Buddhism.
              2nd Buddhist council (383 BCE)
              The second Buddhist council was convened by King Kalasoka and held at
              Vaisali, following conflicts between the traditional schools of
              Buddhism and a more liberal interpretational movement called the
              Mahasanghikas.</p>
              <p>The
              traditional schools considered the Buddha as a human being who reached
              enlightenment, which could be most easily attained by monks following
              the monastic rules and practicing the teaching for the sake of
              overcoming suffering and attaining Arahantship. The secessionist
              Mahasangikas, however, tended to consider this approach too
              individualistic and selfish. They considered the objective of becoming
              an arhat insufficient, and instead proposed that the only true goal was
              to reach full buddhahood, in a sense opening the way to future Mahayana
              thought. They became proponents of more relaxed monastic rules, which
              could appeal to a large majority of monastic and lay people (hence
              their name the "great" or "majority" assembly). The council ended with
              the rejection of the Mahasanghikas. They left the council and
              maintained themselves for several centuries in northwestern India and
              Central Asia according to Kharoshti inscriptions found near the Oxus
              and dated c. 1st century AD.</p>
              <p>Ashokan proselytism (c. 260 BCE)
              The Mauryan king Ashoka (273ï¿½232 BCE) converted to Buddhism after his
              bloody conquest of the territory of Kalinga (today's Orissa) in the
              east of India. Regretful of the horrors brought by the conflict, the
              king decided to renounce violence, and to advertise the faith by
              building stupas and pillars urging for the respect of all animal life,
              and enjoining people to follow the Dharma. He also built roads and
              hospitals around the country.
              This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India. According
              to the plates and pillars left by king Ashoka (the Edicts of Ashoka),
              emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism,
              as far as the Greek kingdoms in the West, in particular the neighboring
              Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean
              according to the stone inscriptions left by Ashoka.</p>

              <p>don't think it was a rejection in the first council. both were concern with different community being monastic and lay. it was later council that started the "rejection". </p>
              <p>Quote:-</p>
              <p>First Council<br><em>Also known as 500 Council, Theravada Council", The First Compilation, etc. The assembly of 500 leading Bhikhus gathered for 3 months after the Buddha's death to compile the Buddhist sutras. It was held at Cave of the Seven Leaves near Rajagaha. <br>In the assembly, Ananda recited the Sutta-pitaka, Upali recited the Rules of Disciplines of the Order, i.e., Vinaya-pitaka, and Kassapa recited the Abhidhamma. Thus, the Tripitaka was adopted as a unity of doctrines and opinions within the religious order, and also an orthodox teaching for the Buddhists to follow.<br>---<br><br>Mahasanghika and Sthavira are known as two earliest sects in Hinayana. Mahasanghika is said to be the basis of the development of the Mahayana Buddhism, while Sthavira of the Theravada Buddhism.<br><br></em><em><span style="color: blue;">Mahasanghika<br>Literally means the Member of the Great Order, majority, community. During the First Council, when the Sthavira or elder disciples assembled in the cave after the Buddha's death, and the other disciples (called to be Mahasanghika) assembled outside the cave. Both compiled the Tripitaka. <strong>However, the former emphasized on the rules of disciplines in the monastic community, while the latter concerned the spread of the spirit of Buddhism in lay community. As sects, the principal division took place in the Second Council.</strong> </span><br><br>Sthavirah<br>Also known as Sthaviranikaya or Aryasthavirah. Sthavirah and Mahasanghikah are the two earliest sects in Buddhism. At first, they were not considered to be different. Sthavirah merely represented the intimate and older disciples of Shakyamuni, while Mahasanghika being the rest. It is said that a century later, a difference of opinion arose on certain doctrines. Three divisions were named as a result (all in Ceylon):<br><br>1)Mahaviharavasinah - A subdivision of the Sthavirah school, which<br>opposed to the Mahayana system.<br>2)Jetavaniyah - Or Jetiyasailah, school of the dwellers on Mount Jeta, which is a sub division of the Sthavirah, one of the Hinayana sect. Also known as Caitya-vandana, who paid reverence to or worship a stupa. Caitya is a religious monument or stupa in which the relics of the Buddha or other reverend sages are placed. This sect held that the Buddha's discourse was transcendent, his enlightenment was already determined when he was born, that he could violate the<br>natural laws, and could be reborn wherever he wished (in his previous lives as a Bodhisattva).<br>3)Abhayagiri-vasinah - A subdivision of early Sthavirah school. Abhayagiri, the Mountain of Fearlessness in Ceylon, where the disciples dwelled in a monastery.<br><br>In the course, the eighteen Hinayana sects were developed. From the time of Ashoka, four principal school are regarded as prevailing:<br><br><br>1) Mahasanghika - Literally means the Member of the Great Order, majority, community.<br>2) Sthavira<br>3)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked with Vatsiputriyah.<br>4) Mulasarvastivada - a branch of the Sarvastivadin sect, which asserted the doctrine of the reality of things. It held that all is produced by causative action, and everything is dynamic, not static. Mulasavastivada is a school of reality of all phenomena, one of the early Hinayana sects, said to have been formed, about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. Later it subdivided into five:<br><br>a) Mulasarvastivadah ,<br>b ) Dharmaguptah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah, developed from Mahisasakah and located in northwest India and Central Asia. Literally means those who protect (or preserve) the Law. They were instrumental informing the cult of the stupa, and were expert in incantation.<br>c) Kasyapiyah - a subdivision of Sarvastivadah.<br>d) Mahisasakah - a branch of Sarvastivadah founded 300 years after the Nirvana, but the doctrines of the school are said to be similar to those of the Mahasanghika. Literally means a ruler who converted or rectified his land or people. The school denied reality to past and future, but maintained the reality of the present. Similarly, the school rejected the doctrine of the void and the non-ego, the<br>production of taint by the Five consciousness, the theory of nine kinds of non-activity, and so on. They held that enlightenment came suddenly rathern than gradually. <br>e) Vatsiputriyah (most influential) - Vatsiputriyas in Sanskrit, Vajjiputtakas in Pali. Hinayanist sect often linked with Sammatiyah, which broke from the orothodox Sarvastivada. The founder was Vatsa. They may be classified as Pudgalavadins, accepting the pudgala transmigrated, and rejecting the theory of the Five Skandhas (the Five Aggregates comprising personality). They were considered schismatics through their insistence on the reality of the self. That individual self is neither the same nor different from the Five Skandhas. The doctrine challenged the Dharma exposition by the Sarvastivadah. The school was later dividied into four:<br><br>i)Dharmottariyah - a branch of Sthavirandin developed from Vatsiputriyah. Dharmottara is the Buddhist logician writing, an important commentary called the Nyayabindu-tika on Dharmakirtis Nyayabindu.<br>ii)Bhadrayaniyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from Vatsiputriyah.<br>iii)Sammatiyah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from Vatsiputriyah. It is a school of correct measures, or correct evaluation, formed about 300 years after the Nirvana of Shakyamuni. It was classified in the Pudgalavadin category, thus often linked with Vatsiputriyah.<br>iv)Sannagarikah - a branch of Sthavirandin, developed from Vatsiputriyah.<br><br>As far as Sthavira is concerned, there are eleven sects reckoned.<br><br>The Sthaviravadins were reputed as nearest to early Buddhism in its tenets, though it is said to have changed the basis of Buddhism from an agonostic system to a realist philosophy.</em></p>
