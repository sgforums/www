              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>It is said that after his enlightenment the Buddha was motivated to
              teach by seeing that all beings were seeking happiness, yet out of ignorance
              were doing the very things that brought them suffering. This aroused his great
              compassion to point the way to freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Buddha spoke of different kinds of happiness associated with various
              stages on the unfolding path of awakening. As we penetrate deeper into the
              process of opening, the happiness of each stage brings us progressively closer
              to the highest kind of happiness, the happiness of <em>nibbana</em>, of
              freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>What are the causes and conditions that give rise to each of these
              stages of happiness? How does this joy come about? The events and circumstances
              of our lives do not happen by accident; rather they are the result of certain
              causes and conditions. When we understand the conditions necessary for
              something to happen, we can begin to take destiny into our own hands.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The first kind of happiness is the one that’s most familiar to us—the
              happiness of sense pleasures. This is the kind of happiness we experience from
              being in pleasant surroundings, having good friends, enjoying beautiful sights
              and sounds and delicious tastes and smells, and having agreeable sensations in
              the body. Even though these pleasures are impermanent and fleeting, in the
              moments we’re experiencing them, they bring us a certain delight.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>According to the Buddha, each of the different kinds of happiness is
              created or conditioned by a different level of purity. The level that gives
              rise to sensual happiness is purity of conduct, sometimes called purity of
              action. Purity of conduct is a fundamental way of coming into a true
              relationship with ourselves, with other people, and with the world. It has two
              aspects. The first is the cultivation of generosity—the expression of non-greed
              and non-clinging. It is greed or attachment that keeps us bound to the wheel of
              samsara, the cycle of life and death. With every act of giving we weaken the
              power of grasping. The Buddha once said that if we knew as he did the fruit of
              giving, we would not let a single meal pass without sharing it, so great is the
              power of generosity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The Buddha spoke of three levels of generosity. He called the first
              beggarly giving—we give the worst of what we have, what we don’t want, the
              leftovers. Even then, we have a lot of doubt: “Should I give it? Shouldn’t I?
              Next year I’ll probably have a use for it.” The next level is friendly
              giving—we give what we would use for ourselves, and we give it with more
              spontaneity and ease, with more joy in the mind. The highest kind of generosity
              is queenly or kingly giving. The mind takes delight in offering the best of
              what we have, giving what we value most. This is the perfection of generosity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Generosity takes many forms—we may give our time, our energy, our
              material possessions, our love. All are expressions of caring, of compassion,
              of connection, and of renunciation—the ability to let go. The beauty of
              generosity is that it not only brings us happiness in the moment—we feel good
              when we give—but it is also the cause for happiness to arise in the future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>The other aspect of purity of conduct is <em>sila</em>, the Pali word
              for morality. In the Buddha’s teaching there are five precepts that lay people
              follow: not killing, not stealing, not committing sexual misconduct, not using
              wrong speech—false or harsh speech—and not taking intoxicants, which cloud or
              delude the mind. The underlying principle is non-harming—of ourselves, other
              people, and the environment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Just as generosity is a practice, so, too, is
              commitment to the precepts. Consciously practicing them fosters wakefulness and
              keeps us from simply acting out the habit patterns of our conditioning. The
              precepts serve as a reference point, giving us some clarity in understanding
              whether our behavior is wholesome or unwholesome. They are not a set of commandments—“Thou
              shalt not do this” and “Thou shalt do that”—but rather guidelines for exploring
              how our actions affect our mind: What happens when we’re in conflict with the
              world? What happens when we’re in harmony with other people and ourselves? In
              the traditional teachings of the Buddha, morality is the foundation of
              concentration, and concentration is the foundation of wisdom. When the mind is
              in turmoil, it’s very difficult to concentrate. The power of virtue is a
              steadfastness and ease of mind. And when we’re in harmony with ourselves, we
              give a wonderful gift to other people—the gift of trust. We’re saying with our
              lives, with our actions, “You need not fear me.” Just imagine how the world
              would be transformed if everybody observed one precept: not to kill.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The joy we experience when we’re practicing generosity
              and morality gives rise to the second kind of happiness, the happiness of
              concentration. The Buddha called this purity of mind. When the mind is steady
              and one-pointed, there’s a quality of inner peace and stillness that is much
              deeper and more fulfilling than the happiness of sense pleasures. We enjoy
              sense pleasures, but at a certain point we tire of them. Just how long can we
              listen to music or eat good food? By contrast, the happiness that comes with
              concentration of mind is refreshing. It energizes us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>There are many techniques for developing
              concentration. We can focus on the breath, on a sound, on a light, on a mantra,
              on an image, on walking. We can practice <em>metta</em>, lovingkindness, or <em>karuna</em>,
              compassion. We can each find the way that for us is most conducive to
              strengthening the state of one-pointedness, of collectedness. We learn how to
              quiet the inner dialogue. As concentration becomes stronger, we actually start
              living from a place of greater inner peace. This is a source of great
              happiness, great joy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The happiness of concentration makes possible the next
              kind of happiness, the happiness of beginning insight. When the mind is still,
              we can employ it in the service of awareness and come to a deeper understanding
              of who we are and what life is about. Wisdom unfolds in a very ordered way.
              When we sit and pay attention to our experience, the first level we come to is
              psychological insight. We see all our different sides—the loving side, the
              greedy side, the judging side, the angry side, the peaceful side. We see parts
              of ourselves that have been covered up—the jealousy, the fear, the hatred, the
              unworthiness. Often when we first open up to the experience of who we are, we
              don’t like a lot of it. The tendency is to be self-judgmental. Through the
              power of concentration and mindfulness, we learn how to rest very naturally in
              the simple awareness of what’s happening. We become less judgmental. We begin
              to get insight into the complexities of our personality. We see the patterns of
              our thoughts and emotions, and the ways we relate to people. But this is a
              tricky point in the practice. Psychological insights can be very
              seductive—who’s more interesting than oneself ?—so it’s easy to get lost on
              this level of inquiry. We need to be watchful and keep coming back to the main
              object of meditation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Through the practice of very careful momentary
              attention, we see and connect very directly with the nature of thoughts and
              emotions, not getting so lost in the story. What is the nature of anger? What
              is the quality of happiness? What is the quality of compassion? The momentum of
              mindfulness begins to build.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>At this point there’s a real jump in our practice. The
              Buddha called this level purity of view, or purity of understanding. We let go
              of our fascination with the content of our minds and drop into the level of
              process, the flow of phenomena. We see clearly that what is happening in each
              moment is knowing and object, arising and passing away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The Buddha once gave a very short discourse called
              “The All” in which he described the totality of our experience in six phrases:<em> </em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" line-height: 18.7pt;"><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>The eye,
              visible objects, and the knowing of them.<br> The ear, sounds, and the knowing of them.<br> The tongue, tastes, and the knowing of them.<br> The nose, smells, and the knowing of them.<br> The body, sensations, and the knowing of them.<br> The mind, mind objects, and the knowing of them.</span></em><em><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";  '></span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>This is our first clear glimpse of the nature of the
              mind itself. We see that all we are is a succession of mind moments—seeing,
              hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, thinking, feeling. At this stage, we have
              a very direct understanding of what the Buddha called the Three
              Characteristics. We have a visceral experience of the truth of <em>anicca</em>,
              impermanence: everything is changing constantly. And out of this intimate
              understanding of the momentariness of phenomena, we begin to comprehend more
              clearly what the Buddha meant by <em>dukkha</em>, suffering—the unsatisfactory
              nature of things. When we see that even pleasant things are changing—and changing
              rapidly—it becomes obvious that they are incapable of satisfying us. Not
              because they are inherently bad but because they don’t last. This insight leads
              to an understanding of the characteristic that is most difficult to see—<em>anatta</em>,
              or selflessness. There is no one behind this process to whom it is happening;
              what we call “self” is the process of change.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>Purity of view is a gateway to greater insight and
              even deeper levels of happiness. The momentum of mindfulness becomes so strong
              that the perception of phenomena arising and passing away becomes crystal
              clear. Concentration and awareness are effortless. The mind becomes luminous.
              This point in the practice is called Vipassana happiness. It is a very happy
              time in our meditation. The joy of it far exceeds the happiness of
              concentration or of sense pleasures, because we experience such precise, clear
              insight into the nature of things. It’s our first taste of coming home. We feel
              tremendous rapture and overwhelming gratitude: after all the work we’ve done,
              we’re finally reaping a great reward.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>But there’s a problem here. This stage is often called
              “pseudo-nibbana.” Everything we’ve practiced so hard for—clarity, luminosity,
              rapture, lightness, joy—is reflected back to us as what the Buddha called “the
              corruptions of insight.” The qualities themselves are not the problem; indeed,
              they are the factors of enlightenment. But because our insight is not yet
              mature, we become attached to them and to the happiness they bring. It takes
              renewed effort to come back to simply noting these extraordinary states. At
              this point we hit a bumpy stage. Instead of the arising and passing of
              phenomena, we begin to experience the dissolution of everything—our minds, our
              bodies, the world. Everything is vanishing. There’s no place to stand. We’re
              trying to hold onto something that is continually dissolving. As this stage
              unfolds, there is often tremendous fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>In Vipassana happiness, we can sit for hours. But at
              the stage of dissolution we sit for ten or fifteen minutes and become
              disgusted. This phase is colloquially known as the “rolling up the mat” stage
              because all yogis want to do is roll up the mat and quit. It’s a very difficult
              time, with a lot of existential suffering. This is not the suffering of pain in
              the knees or of psychological problems but the suffering inherent in existence.
              We think our practice is falling apart, but actually this is a stage of
              deepening wisdom. Out of our opening to dukkha comes what is called “the urge
              for deliverance,” a strong motivation to be free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>From this urge for freedom emerges another very happy
              stage of meditation, the happiness of equanimity. This is a far deeper,
              subtler, and more pervasive happiness than the rapture of the earlier stage of
              seeing things rapidly arising and passing away. There is softness and lightness
              in the body. The mind is perfectly poised—there is not even the slightest
              reaching for or pushing away. The mind is completely impartial. Pleasant or
              unpleasant, whatever arises is fine. All the factors of enlightenment are in
              the final maturing stage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   '>It is out of this place of equanimity that the mind
              opens spontaneously and intuitively to the unconditioned, the unborn, the
              unmanifest—nibbana. Nibbana is the highest happiness, beyond even the happiness
              of great insight or understanding, because it transcends the mind itself. It is
              transforming. The experience of nibbana has the power to uproot from the stream
              of consciousness the unwholesome factors of mind that keep us bound to samsara.
              The first moment of opening to the highest reality uproots the attachment to
              self, to the sense of “I.” And it is said that from that moment on, a being is
              destined to work through the remaining defilements, such as greed and anger, on
              the way to full awakening.</span></p>

              Buddha taught on so many levels was how to be happy. If we want the happiness
              of sense delights, there are causes and conditions, namely, purity of conduct.
              If we want the happiness of stillness, of peace, we need to develop
              concentration—one-pointedness of mind. If we want the happiness of insight, we
              need to develop purity of view, purity of understanding through strengthening
              mindfulness. If we want to experience the happiness of different stages of
              insight, all the way through equanimity, we need to continue building the
              momentum of mindfulness and the other factors of enlightenment. And if we want
              the highest happiness, the happiness of nibbana, we simply need to walk this
              path to the end. And when we aim for the highest kind of happiness, we find all
              the others a growing part of our lives.</span></p>
