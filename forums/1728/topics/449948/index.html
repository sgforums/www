              <p>There is no need to rely on Talismans in general.  If you create positive karma now, and take responsibility for any negative happenings as being a ripening for your past negative deeds.  That is the best protection for worldly life.  </p>
              <p>Generally, we are not willing to accept negative happenings because we are not willing to take responsibility for what we have done (assuming we believe in karma) and try to find a way to escape it.  This is not realistic because the moon can drop from the sky and fire can be cold but karma never fails to ripen.  So it is more thorough and far-sighted to use the methods of Dharma to purify our wrong conceptions and past karma.</p>
              <p>I am not implying that we should be passive and fatalistic, thinking that we are doomed by destiny or karma. But we can do what we should using Dharma to cultivate compassion and wisdom, try to discipline ourselves and refrain from creating harm to others and benefitting others where we can.  Relying on Talismans does not address key issues. Though IMO, it is ok for people using them, if they do not place too much emphasis on it, do so with pure motivation- not to take advantage of others, and practice the Dharma properly.</p>
              <p>There are certain advantages to Talismans both from a psychological point of view and also spiritually.  For eg, it gives you a sense of peace of mind instead of indulging in fears.  Also, there are amulets and mantra inscriptions in Vajrayana Buddhism too which help the user in manifold ways.  In the Dzogchen tantras, there are inscriptions called Tagdrols, liberation by touch, which helps the deceased to recognise his true nature after death.  And so on so forth. We can't generalise what is good or bad. But we should always return to the key principles of Dharma such as renunciation of samsara, bodhichitta and the wisdom realising emptiness (anatta, dependent origination etc) to ascertain if our present motivations or viewpoints are on the correct path.  </p>
              <p>Whether something is Buddhism or not depends on the understanding and motivation.  It does not depend on the external features.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your response.    Absolutely agree with your words on karma.    In one way or other sometimes we won't accept negative happenings.    Having said this, recently a relative who is diagnosed having leukemia is pushing blame that another relative is causing her the sickness.   To me it is karma, karma and still karma , nothing to do with any cause from anyone.     Karma has resulted in many suffering.</p>

              </p><p>Talisman is an object that possess super natural power. It is not restricted to taoism but many religion and traditional believes long time before taoism even exist.</p>
              <p>The Theravada buddhism in thailand and indochina also commonly use it as means of protection for the disciples.</p>
              <p>Above is the facts when we look from history angle.</p>
              <p>Now, is it right in terms of dharma? it depends on what kind of power is imbued into the amulet, and the motivation of the wearer. If an amulet is imbued with some black magic power or some evil spirit from lower realm, this will be against the buddha teaching and should be prohibited, because of the many side effects to have connection to black magic.</p>
              <p>But if the amulet is being blessed to have power from buddha and bodhisatva, that is perfectly fine. Needless to say, whether one has the merit to own such amulet, that is another story.</p>
              <p>Some people may argue using external super natural power is going against karma.</p>
              <p>Just look at how buddha sakyamuni use shurangama sutra to save ananda from black magic that cause him to have sexual misconduct.</p>
              <p>Obviously that's right according to dharma not just because it is performed by buddha himself, but because he use the right tool (white magic) for right purpose.</p>
