              <p>I for one don't often pray for help. Buddhism is not a praying religion, and many of those people who "pray" aren't Buddhists to begin with. So we must not mistake Buddhism with the common Chinese folk religion that prays to all Buddhist and non-Buddhist figures, and deities.</p>
              <p>By the way, Buddhists don't pray to deities, unlike folk religions. Deities are samsaric beings, still in the cycle of rebirth. Buddha and Bodhisattvas are above samsara, they are enlightened beings. Even then we do not 'pray' to them, we only pay respect and veneration.</p>
              <p>Through their teachings, we aim to practice the Boddhisattva path, attain Buddhahood ourselves. We do not 'worship' them. Everyone's Buddha Nature is complete, just that we have not realised it.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I think what you wrote is very true.</p>
              <p>IMO, by keeping this in mind one can better distinguish the truth from the propaganda.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that propaganda, like marketing and selling exists everywhere...even in religions.</p>

              <p><br>First of all, if you think you are free of fear, it could be your mind is not subtle enough to notice the very slight fear in you. The seed of fear may be still there, when you experience that kind of suffering beyond your current imagination, your fear may arise. If you really get rid of all these fear and seeds which is what we call attachment, then I must bow down to you already.<br>But then have to remember the sentient beings around you, they still have fear, so must think of a way to save them. Now the question is, when you hear those beings crying and praying for your help, will you go and help them.</p>

              <p>Human beings like to check,hold and attach.The mind is always checking the other mind which is the shadow of the latter.There will be no end.The whole fear comes from "I".The "I" or ego is very afraid to die.Lastly,when i hear those beings crying and praying for help, I will not go and help because they actually should be out searching for a way out.Crying and praying cannot help,give them some candy and they stop crying.</p>
