              <p>   "mainstream" pls elaborate your definition..perharps there is a misconfusion of understanding..unless you are referring to as not being a Buddhism school that following the typical path of Buddhism being taught? i would gladly address to any questions you have..:D Thank you. As for your statement, i would like to highlight that it is contrary of what you have put.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Mainstream Buddhist schools, no matter which tradition, will have the following:</p>
              <p>1. The Triple Gems - Buddha, Dharma and Sangha</p>
              <p>Soka Gakkai has the "Buddha" as Nichiren, Dharma as the "Lotus Sutra", but does it have a "Sangha"? Maybe you might argue that the Sangha are Soka Gakkai members, but is that really a "Sangha"?</p>
              <p>2. Acknowledge Sakyamuni Buddha as our Founder</p>
              <p>Soka Gakkai, and its former "parent body" Nichiren Shoshu do recognise Sakyamuni, but term Nichiren as the "Eternal Buddha", more supreme over Sakyamuni.</p>
              <p>3. In Japan, both Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shoshu have termed other schools of Buddhism, including other traditions within Nichiren Buddhism, as "heretic" and "value-less". Not even mentioning that it does have a political party "New Komeito" and sometimes uses it to power themselves.</p>
              <p>Above are some points.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Interesting points, let's us go through each of them, shall we?</p>
              <p>1) Sokkai Members terms as "Sangha"? According to what i know about "Sangha" it is an assembly of people (higher learning people) who work towards a  common goal or mission. Sokkai members are definitely working towards world peace with action and not just plain talk. There is also action at all members to help those in distress or really need help. To teach them Buddhism, so that they can understand their situation and challenge it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) Shakyamuni Buddha is revered as the founding father of Buddhism, not a disrupting fact. Shaykamuni Buddha come out with the Lotus Sutra and hid the essence in the Sutra. But Nichiren is the one who helps to reveal the real Law in the Lotus Sutra which has been hidden away for years. Without Nichiren, the Law will be hidden. No one is above the Law, not even Shakymuni Buddha or Nichiren.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Perharps you will like to elaborate a bit more on this. But as far as i knew, Komeito consists of members who are from Sokka Gakkai and it is setup to be help their people to "stand up" for injustice etc. It is also logical to say if the person in the political party is from xxx sect then the party belongs to that xxxx? Over in Japan, there is a more liberal society compared to what we have here and hence it is difficult to accept/understand. For example, in U.S, the people forming the political party is from yyy church but doesn't imply so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your statement "In Japan, both Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Shoshu have termed other schools of Buddhism, including other traditions within Nichiren Buddhism, as "heretic" and "value-less", perharps you will like to point all of us here to the relevant article to get a better understanding? that will helps a lot..:D</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>1. ok, for the 1st point i forgot about the broader definition of the term so i take that back.</p>
              <p>2. Then why in earlier SGI books (or at least, during my short stint in SGI in 1999-2000) are there definitions that Nichiren is the "Eternal Buddha" or æœ¬ä½›, while Sakyamuni is è·¡ä½›?</p>
              <p>3. I live in Japan, so i know what I'm saying. Of course, most Gakkai members are urged to vote for Komeito, and to support Komeito.</p>
              <p>4. Not forgetting that Gakkai and Shoshu are still at loggerheads at each other. I remember attending meetings on both sides (1999-2000), and was asked to chant the Daimoku and pray for one to "attain victory" over the other.</p>
              <p>Also, when an American friend of mine wanted to take Refuge in Buddhism at my temple in Japan, his then girlfriend from Gakkai objected to it. If Gakkai recognizes the value of other Buddhist schools, was there a need to object? It was only after they broke off did he manage to come down again to take Refuge.</p>

              <p> <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">Hi,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">1. ok, for the 1st point i forgot about the broader definition of the term so i take that back.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">2. Then why in earlier SGI books (or at least, during my short stint in SGI in 1999-2000) are there definitions that Nichiren is the "Eternal Buddha" or æœ¬ä½›, while Sakyamuni is è·¡ä½›?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">&gt;&gt; Good question. Eternal (æœ¬ä½›) and Provisional ( è·¡ä½›) Buddha - it is not about status of supremacy that as implied by the name in case you are thinking along that path. Provisional Buddha meant that what Shakyamuni Buddha had preached is fixed at the certain point of life in the past (dust particle kalpas) whereas what Nichiren himself preached is with the Mystic Law that is eternal in its own entity since beginningless time. If you refer to the Lotus Sutra, it is mentioned "I have preached the Law in many ways, devising many means. But in these more than forty years, i have not yet revealed the truth"..and the truth is the Mystic Law...but it is so hard to preach. Put ourselves in the shoes of the Shakyamuni Buddha, trying to think hard how to convince his followers. just imagine if one tells us one that 1 + 1 doesn't equal to 2, after so many years of belief. And the Law exists no where exist ourselves, the answer is in us, the cause of our suffering. That is why, if you refer to other Sutras, you can find a common thread that he is trying to preach the Law but to the capacity of the intellectual capacity of the people, as no one can accept that the Law exists within himself and can be a Buddha like Shakyamuni (if you have read the story of the father and his sons analogy in the Buddhist sutra)...sorry i deviate again :D</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">3. I live in Japan, so i know what I'm saying. Of course, most Gakkai members are urged to vote for Komeito, and to support Komeito.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">&gt;&gt; Definitely, but even those in priest robes may not be preaching real Buddhism if their intent is not correct, as long as they are human and have wrong intent.(Shakyamuni Buddha had even warned about priests who do not preach the real Buddhism) Moreover, it is the duty of the members to speak and highlight. Sometimes it just take one person to undo all the good efforts that have been put in by others. Being any political party, who wouldn't want to have all the votes? But it is still the choice of the members to choose who they want to vote to utimately</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">4. Not forgetting that Gakkai and Shoshu are still at loggerheads at each other. I remember attending meetings on both sides (1999-2000), and was asked to chant the Daimoku and pray for one to "attain victory" over the other.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">&gt;&gt; Indeed, Gakkai and Shoshu have been at loggerhead since the spilt due to different practice ideological. It is nothing new, if you knew about the Christians side, the Methodist, Protestants etc..even between the Muslims and Christians during the Crusade. Sorry, i have drifted but i think the idea is there. If one sees evil and choose to be silent and not do anything, one is no different from the doer of evil. Speaking from Gakkai side, if not chanting for the victory against the Shoshu, what kind of compassion, righteous are we showing to the rest? It is precisely the reason that Shoshu has goes reversal the real essence of Nichiren Buddhism that victory must been seen.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">Also, when an American friend of mine wanted to take Refuge in Buddhism at my temple in Japan, his then girlfriend from Gakkai objected to it. If Gakkai recognizes the value of other Buddhist schools, was there a need to object? It was only after they broke off did he manage to come down again to take Refuge.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;">&gt;&gt; it is anticipated reaction because who's wouldn't want one partner to practice the same as ones? would you object if someone who has been practicing close to you choose to join Soka Gakkai? As you have mentioned, it is his then girlfriend who object not Gakkai as an organization objects to him not practising Nichiren Buddhism. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; ">========================================================</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; ">Nichiren: Life as a fisherman's son (lowest status of the society) Shakyamuni: Life as a prince (highest status of the society)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; ">Nichiren: Persecute by all Buddhist schools and Court officials of entire country at that time including his followers (execution for 3). Almost being beheaded. Live in exile. Shakyamuni: Not much persecution of that degree.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; ">Nichiren: Reveals the Truth to all people in the Lotus Sutra despite getting troubles with the officials. Inscribe the object of worship that symbolized the Law within ourselves and for us to see via "the mirror" so that we can "see" who we are. Shakyamuni: Taught the different vehicles to all so that their intellectual level can be at the level to accept the One vehicle. But did not reveal the Truth. He assigned the burden of following the preaching of the Law to his followers that is us to carry on preaching the Law.</p>

              <p>1) Sokkai Members terms as "Sangha"? According to what i know about "Sangha" it is an assembly of people (higher learning people) who work towards a  common goal or mission. Sokkai members are definitely working towards world peace with action and not just plain talk. There is also action at all members to help those in distress or really need help. To teach them Buddhism, so that they can understand their situation and challenge it.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">There are plently of charity organisations in the world doing good. I have heard that Sokkai members are active in volunteerism which is a good thing. However, for the records, there are also many buddhist and also non-buddhist organisations in the world who are also very active in volunteerism. </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>As a Buddhist practicioner, it is one duty to understand one's mission in life. I wouldn't use the word "impose" it is a bit too hard, it is like forcing people. I should say, "gently" guide people with the desire to provide awareness. Again this should be classify under the technique to handle people tactfully. But coming back, just because one's is afraid of "hurting one's Bodhicitta and others", one refuse to act and have courage to help others. That is not compassion. E.g. If a father knows his children is doing wrong but do not guide them, he is not acting his part as a father.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Attaining Buddhahood or Enlightment is not a sudden spark that goes into one's head and bingo, we are enlighted. It is through the act of helping people that we challenge our inner thinking and extend our compassion and created good rewards for ourselves. We learnt to be stronger and have more compassion. It all comes back to us, just that the rewards would be inconspicious.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Of course, we can help others who are not living well in the path. Seeking religion to help themselves are not wrong either, as long as they, themselves are happy and free from suffering, it is still okay. Many people help others in their own special way such as preaching the dharma, volunteering, using their knowledge as a doctor to help others, or just being a good husband and wife, and also being a cultivator. </span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">I'm not saying helping others are wrong, infact it should be encouraged to foster harmonious living condition for all. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">when we seek religion, do we practise for oneself or for others?</span> :D <span style="color: #0000ff;">- i'm just adding a comment that different people might choose to practise differently and not for others due to different preferances. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">And you are not wrong neither</span></p>

              <p>Attaining Buddhahood or Enlightment is not a sudden spark that goes into one's head and bingo, we are enlighted. It is through the act of helping people that we challenge our inner thinking and extend our compassion and created good rewards for ourselves. We learnt to be stronger and have more compassion. It all comes back to us, just that the rewards would be inconspicious.</p>

              <p>So your point being ?</p>
              <p>now you are already a Buddha ?</p>
              <p>Quite interesting to see that you quote certain passage without rethinking what it means in real ..The Tientai and Tendai essence of Lotus Sutra</p>
              <p>You say all this are expedient ..but how about voting to Komeito ?</p>
              <p>Is that politics ?then where does Politics and religion complements each other</p>
              <p>Taiwan is a Buddhist majority country ,so why doesnt the Buddhist Organisation influenced the voters ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am hoping to see how you would define mundane affairs and spiritual affairs clearly .</p>
              <p>I have ex-sokka Gakkai friends who told me about the convenient path ,which leads to more confusion on the status of Lotus Sutra in the Order of Sokka Gakkai .Care to tell me ,honestly ,What does the Universal Gate Chapter of Avalokiteshvara meant to you ?</p>
