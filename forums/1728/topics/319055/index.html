              <p>From what i have read before Nibiru is a planet with a very long orbit. Also, there are legends that says that in the ancient past some of the 'gods' and 'demi-gods' came from Nibiru. These gods are related to the old European patheons of Greek gods. The 'gods' are bigger and taller than the humans on Earth. However, these 'gods' are not really gods but just more technological advanced and bigger sized humans. They use earth humans as slaves and to fight the war among each other. The 'gods' are powerful but violent and very prone to jeolousy. They also interbred with the earth humans giving rise to legends like Hercules.</p>
              <p>Regarding the year 2012, the Mayans calculated it as the end of this era. But that does not mean that it is the end of the world. 2012 should be seen as the end of a particular cycle and the embarkment of a new cycle after that.</p>
              <p>From my understanding only... the earth population will be reduced in the coming future. However, beyond a certain point the consciousness of humans also begin to evolve. This correspondes to a gradual 'upgrade' in their form. The form will gradually take on a glow. This is what a dream that i had suggested... if my interpretation is correct. There is a certain date too that suggest that about 1800-2000 years into the future, there may be another major leap in state.</p>
              <p>However, i wouldn't call all these changes enlightenment. It is that the civilization has less of the behavourial karmic tendencies that the form take on a glow. If you read some of the old Buddhist saying, there were beings in the past that has a glow, but due to increasing karma accumulation the glow gradually dissapear and become physical and solid in look. The mental state affects the form.</p>
              <p>This are just my understanding. Please read with discernment. Thanks.</p>

              <p>I think the clash from nibiru planet won't occur so soon, it is not a sure to happen thing.<br>The 2012 incidents is actually a huge flood that will make most of the south east asian countries submerged under water.<br>For those people who want to continue 'enjoy' and attach in the worldly stuffs and plan to practice the dharma only at old age, it is time to wake up. It is only 4 more years to go...</p>
              <p>Maybe the government should consider buying an aircraft carrier or things like huge ship so when huge flood happen, at least there is a floating platform for them to do things.</p>

              <p>I think the Asuras maybe these kinds of Beings. The asuras are also mentioned in Hinduism Aryan(vedic) mythology in ancient India. The Aryans in India where originally from certain part of Europe, so some indian/vedic concepts and the Greek mythology may be related.</p>

              To confirm I think we need to wait or anyone have a powerful telescope that can see the red glow of the planet?
              
              From google I saw it looked like a red sun surrounded by moons
              
              And if I don't remember wrongly, Nostradamus say something about the sun rise from the west and sets in the east.
              Could it be this red sun planet?

              <p>Hi Bodhi Hut,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the article..</p>
              <p>I had a Western teacher who is not of Buddhist background but of Western mystical tradition. She too, with her psychic senses, saw the ancient formation of these light-beings 'evolving' into the current physical type human. In the beginning, these light-beings are actually asexual but gradually split into the 2 sexes.</p>
              <p>With so many sources pointing to the same origin. I guess it must be true.</p>

              <p>Actually the 'light beings' are still within the realms of Samsara, particularly the 2nd Jhana of the Form planes of existence. As you said they are planes 'lower' than the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas because they still belong to samsaric/non-enlightened realms. They are called light-sound beings, and use light to communicate. They don't use 'verbal' language. 'Yi Zhen Fa Jie' and 'Hua Zhang Shi Jie' are talking about quite
                                    different matters, they are talking about the nature of reality which I
                                    will explain later.</p>
              <p>One of the points of the teaching of the origin of Mankind is that Buddhism does not accept the teachings of a creator, for human beings have not 'descended' from the creation of a personal God but are the natural evolutions of the devas from the 2nd Jhana Light-Sound (Abhassara) realm of heaven.</p>
              <p>They are also not really 'Hua Zhang Shi Jie' or 'Yi Zhen Fa Jie'... Yi Zhen Fa Jie, which is the One-Thus-Dharma-Realm is talking about non-duality, it is talking about the true nature of all planes of existence altogether. That means of the 10 realms of existence (the 6 samsaric + 4 saintly realms of existence), whether they are the realms of ordinary sentient beings or enlightened beings, there is only One Taste, One Reality, One Mind... which is luminous[aware]-emptiness inseparable. Wherever you are and whatever you experience are only of this One Reality, One Dharmadhatu. Hence 'Yi Zhen Fa Jie' is not a particular place, but is the nature of all phase of existence. It is your true non-dual nature, which is the essence of everything.</p>
              <p>The experience of non-duality is described by Ken Wilber as such,<em> "<span style="font-size: 85%;">And so how do you know that you have
                  finally and really overcome the Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if you
                  really overcome the Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that you
                  are on this side of your face looking at the world out there. There is
                  only the world, and you are all of that; you actually feel that you are
                  one with everything that is arising moment to moment. You are not

                  there” have become One Taste with a shuddering obviousness and
                  certainty so profound it feels like a five-ton rock just dropped on
                  your head. It is, shall we say, a feeling hard to miss.<br></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 85%;">At that point, which is actually your
                  ever-present condition, there is no exclusive identity with this
                  particular organism, no constriction of consciousness to the head, a
                  constriction that makes it seem that “you” are in the head looking at
                  the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of attention to
                  the personal bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with all that is
                  arising – a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely Free and
                  infinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so that every
                  single subject and every single object are erotically united in the
                  Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from merely being behind your
                  eyes, and you become the All, you directly and actually feel that your
                  basic identity is everything that is arising moment to moment (just as
                  previously you felt that your identity was with this finite, partial,
                  separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and outside
                  have become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!" </span></em></p>

              itself another experience. It is simply the opening or clearing in
              which all experiences arise and fall. It is the bright autumn sky
              through which the clouds come and go- it is not itself another cloud,
              another experience, another object, another manifestation. This
              realization is actually of the utter fruitlessness of experiences, the
              utter futility of trying to experience release or liberation. All
              experiences lose their taste entirely- these passing clouds.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br>You are

              opening, the emptiness, in which any experience comes and goes, like
              reflections on the mirror. And you are the mirror, the mirror mind, and
              not any experienced reflection. But you are not apart from the
              reflections, standing back and watching. You are everything that is
              arising moment to moment. You can swallow the whole cosmos in one gulp,
              it is so small, and you can taste the sky without moving an inch.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 85%;">That
              is why in Zen, it is said that you cannot enter the Great Samadhi: it
              is actually the opening or clearing that is ever present, and in which
              all experience- and all manifestation- arises moment to moment. It
              seems like you “enter” this state, except that once there, you realize
              that there never was a time this state was not fully present and fully
              recognized- “ the gateless gate.” And so you deeply understand that you
              never entered this state; nor did the Buddhas, past or future, ever
              enter this state.</span></em></p>
              <p><br><em><span style="font-size: 85%;">In Dzogchen, this is the recognition
                  of mind’s true nature. All things, in all worlds, are self-liberated as
                  they arise. All things are like sunlight on the water of a pond. It all
                  shimmers. It is all empty. It is all light. It is all full, and it is
                  all fulfilled. And the world goes on it ordinary way, and nobody

              <p>Hua Zhang Shi Jie is something similar, it is talking about seeing All in One/One in All. It is based on the principles of the <a href="/forums/1728/topics/214669">Net of Indra</a>. I just sent Thusness and Longchen a link recently, quite interesting... on this topic. <a href="http://deoxy.org/watch?v=ldzqbziuT_0&amp;amp;q=indras%20net">http://deoxy.org/watch?v=ldzqbziuT_0&amp;amp;q=indras%20net</a></p>
              <p>BTW, Hua Zhang Shi Jie and Yi Zhen Fa Jie are not Mi Zong/Vajrayana concepts... they belong to the Mahayana schools, particularly the Hua Yen school (for the Hua Zhang Shi Jie) and the Tien Tai school for the latter. But really all traditions are talking about the same thing... whereas Tien Tai calls it 'Yi Zhen Fa Jie', other traditions such as Vajrayana talk about the same thing with terms like 'One Taste'.</p>
              <p>Now, regarding more of the Light-Sound Heaven beings... there's an article which I posted before, which I will post in the subsequent post.</p>

                        evolving world goes through four stages, namely:</span></strong><br> <br> <strong>1. Formation<br> 2. Existence<br> 3. Destruction<br> 4. Void or Emptiness</strong><br> <br> Each stage has a time span termed a "medium kalpa" [1]. Twenty 
                        "small kalpas" make one "medium kalpa". The four stages, 
                        each termed a "medium kalpa", make up a "great kalpa".<br> <br> When the world reaches the final phase of the Stage of Destruction, there 
                        will be great fires burning down hell, planet earth, other stars and their 
                        cosmic worlds as well as the various heavens within the Field of Desires. 
                        Prior reaching the heaven of the 1st Jhana of the Field of Forms, the Devas, 
                        Bodhisattvas, Sages and those sentient beings who have performed great virtuous 
                        deeds in the lower worlds will naturally be saved. They have already been 
                        ascended to the Heaven of Radiant Lustre where they will enjoy happiness 
                        and heavenly bliss.<br> <br> Following the passing of twenty small kalpas in the Stage of Void or Emptiness, 
                        the world will return to the beginning of a new Stage of Formation. A big 
                        golden heavenly cloud will appear from the Heaven of Radiant Lustre and 
                        heavy rain will fall to drench the burning worlds. After the floodwater 
                        has receded, the various heavens below the heaven of the 1st Jhana (or Dhyana) 
                        will reappear. The massive forces of swirling on the remaining materials 
                        left over by the receding floodwater will gradually solidify. This process 
                        is accompanied by the reappearance of various planets in the sky - many 
                        are spherical in shape and others, elliptical. This will, of course, include 
                        our earth and the orbiting moon, as well as all the worlds below including 
                        the lowest level of hell. As the extreme heat energies rotate and concentrate, 
                        many suns are formed - this is what the astronomers called the stars, planets 
                        and satellites. Within each galaxy system, the stars have their orbits rotating 
                        around the sun, planets have their own orbits around the stars, and satellites 
                        around the planets. The revolving stars, planets and satellites coupled 
                        with their own rotations maintain motions, thus creating day and night. 
                        Further, the process produces day, month, year and the four seasons. However, 
                        it is to be noted that the time scales are different between earth, the 
                        various worlds of existence in heavens and other stellar systems.<br> <br> For this period, a passage in the Chinese Old Text story "Qiong-Lin" 
                        recorded similar description on the formation of the world. The text reads:<br> "When earth was first separated from heaven;<br> pure light air float to form the sky and the polluted air sink to form the 
                        ground; <br> the sun, moon and five stars are called the seven-Polis;<br> the heaven, earth and humans are called the three-lords; and <br> the sun is the master of the "Yang" [2] <br> with the moon as the image of the "Yin" [3]<br> <br> The above description is very close to what the Buddha said. Further, records 
                        from Buddhist scriptures match very well with what astronomers of today 
                        have found. It is in this manner that the world is returned to the great 
                        natural phenomenon of the universe.<br> <br> </span>

              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><br> During the first phase of the formation of earth, the earth's crust covering 
                        the ground was not fully solidified. The ground surface appeared milky in 
                        colour. Looking from the celestial plane, the earth shone brightly and afar. 
                        In the heaven of Radiant Lustre, many of those celestial beings whose blissful 
                        life in the heaven was coming to an end and who by disposition were more 
                        restless and impetuous, on seeing the brightness, and out of curiosity, 
                        began to travel down to the earth. They used their "clairvoyance feats" 
                        to fly down and reached different continents of the earth. They saw fluid 
                        springing out from the ground and they dipped their fingers in it. They 
                        tasted the fluid and found it extremely tasty, sweet like honey. While the 
                        fluid was so tasty, everyone craved for more. Those who had most, their 
                        bodies became rough and heavier. They began to lose their light illusory 
                        physical forms and their bodies slowly formed into the material body of 
                        bone and flesh. The weight forced them to the ground and they lost their 
                        "clairvoyance feats" and "natural heavenly clothes", 
                        and were unable to fly through the skies to return to the celestial world. 
                        They began to lose many of their intrinsic celestial qualities such as celestial 
                        colours, fragrant scent, brightness, beauty, wisdom and their innate miraculous 
                        quality. In particular, their "clairvoyance eyes" turned into 
                        human eyes; and their "clairvoyance ears" became human ears. They 
                        became unable to remember their past lives. They lost their special ability 
                        to read the minds of others. They were unable to communicate by radiant 
                        light from their mouths and they needed to depend on sounds from the movements 
                        of their tongues. While without sufficient languages and vocabulary, they 
                        needed sign language to assist them to fully communicate with each other. 
                        They became ordinary human beings on earth. After running out of the tasty 
                        fluid, they resorted to feed on thick weedy plants, then hard crops from 
                        the wild. At that time, the life span of human being was long and there 
                        was no disease or sickness. Later, they learned to plant crops and vegetables. 
                        During the period of feeding from nature, those who were greedy in feeding 
                        themselves acquired darker skin colours, ranging from brown to black. Others 
                        who did not feed as much and those who arrived later had lighter skin colour, 
                        ranging from fair to yellow. As time went on, together with the influence 
                        by climatic conditions of different regions (equatorial, temperate and cold 
                        regions), various skin coloured races of people were formed.<br> <br> </span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><em>… to be

                        for communication. The physical separation between the groups and the lack 
                        of efficient means of transportation resulted in the creation of hundreds 
                        and thousands of different languages. These people were the ancestors of 
                        the many different races in the world today. </span>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The 
                          early inhabitants, after losing their “celestial clothing”, 
                          moved around naked. While they played, their emotions on love and relationship 
                          arose resulting in sexual desires. They began to feel shy and shameful. 
                          At that time, grass and other plants were grown on earth and they used 
                          leaves as clothes, partly to cover their naked bodies and partly to protect 
                          themselves from the cold. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">From the perspective of the 
                          other worlds, the earth’s light had turned green, separating the 
                          seas and the land. The devas from other celestial worlds dared not come 
                          anymore. The human beings on earth began to live as husbands and wives. 
                          They raised children. They lived in caves and later, they learned to build 
                          dwelling houses. With improved conditions, the population grew. The six-sensory 
                          organs of the human being (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body and mind) began 
                          to differentiate and this resulted in affliction and vexation. The innate 
                          bright and innocent celestial nature disappeared, and in their places 
                          arose greed, anger, ignorance….thereby formed the basis of Asura 
                          sentient beings. The Devas, Human and Asura are beings of the three good 
                          realms. With the arising of the evil deeds of killing, stealing, sexual 
                          misconduct… resulting in the sentient beings in the three evil realms 
                          of animal, ghost and hell. Together, these formed the transmigration process 
                          in the six realms of existence. With this, all sentient beings have four 
                          modes of birth, namely,</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">and thousands and millions

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">These constitute the corresponding 
                          living spheres of the seas, land, sky and motion. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The thinking of humanity and 
                          their lives changed from simple to complex states. Some portions of the 
                          human race turned from the barbaric stage to a civilised world. Some portions 
                          of primitive man that fed on raw flesh and blood of birds and beasts gradually 
                          changed to civilisation. The introduction of farming and trading is the 
                          beginning of agriculture and commerce sectors. Some lived on making of 
                          farming tools, cooking utensils and production of building materials, 
                          this was the beginning of industry. In order to administer peace and justice 
                          arising from arguments and fights caused by greed, anger, ignorance, killing, 
                          stealing and sexual misconduct, virtuous and upright people were elected 
                          to maintain law and order, and to manage the affairs of people in the 
                          society. From these came education, social ethic and democratic government. 
                          The advent of languages created written texts which led to the flourishing 
                          of modern civilisation. The barbaric era ended. Communities moved from 
                          small tribal groups into big societies, from societies to countries, and 
                          from the competitive nature between countries, and they further evolved 
                          through scientific progress into the atomic age and the cosmic age. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When the human inhabitants 
                          first arrived on earth, the average life span at that time was longer 
                          than 84,000 years. As the people distanced themselves from good deeds 
                          and committed various evil deeds, the life span shortened. For every 100 
                          years, the average life span is reduced by 1 year. The human life span 
                          continued to shorten and when the life span dropped down to an average 
                          of 10 years, disasters and calamities struck. For those who were cultivating 
                          good deeds and had been staying away as hermits, they survived. For those 
                          who had survived the disasters and calamities, they realised their past 
                          mistakes and repented. Each began to cultivate good deeds and promoted 
                          to the society to carry out good deeds. With the effect of the communal 
                          good karma, the human life span began to lengthen again. And when the 
                          age has reached 84,000 years, the same decreasing process would repeat 
                          due to the arising of evil or unwholesome deeds. One cycle of such an 
                          increasing-decreasing life span is called a “small Kalpa”[1]. 
                          Twenty small kalpas make up a “medium kalpa”. With this, the 
                          Stage of Formation is completed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Next come the Stage of Existence. 
                          In this stage, the increasing-decreasing life span of human beings also 
                          underwent twenty small kalpas before it reaches the Stage of Destruction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">At the beginning of the Stage 
                          of Destruction, everything had developed to the extremes. All the natural 
                          resources had been completely exhausted and the earth severely damaged. 
                          The destruction process also went through a period of twenty small kalpas. 
                          In the final days, the seas dried up. Strong winds, big fires and heavy 
                          floods prevail. The Three Disasters (The three major disasters for world 
                          destruction – fire, water and wind) and Eight Difficulties (The 
                          eight conditions in which it is difficult to encounter a Buddha or hear 
                          his Dharma: in the hells; as hungry ghosts; as animals; in Uttarakuru 
                          (the northern continent where all is pleasant); in the long-life heaven 
                          (where life is long and easy); as deaf, blind and dumb; as worldly philosopher; 
                          in the intermediate period between a Buddha and his successor.) all come 
                          upon the earth. This is truly the “End of the World”. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When the earth is damaged, 
                          it enters into the Stage of Emptiness. This emptiness stage also lasts 
                          for a long period of twenty small kalpas. At the end of this period, big 
                          golden yellow clouds would appear and heavy rain would pour down from 
                          the Light-sound heaven to put out the fires. A new world is thereby created. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">According to the above described 
                          process, the world has to go through the four stages of Formation, Existence, 
                          Destruction and Emptiness which are the four “medium kalpas”. 
                          One “Great Kalpa” needs to go through four “medium kalpas” 
                          totaling eighty “small kalpas”.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the Buddhist scriptures, 
                          the term “Three Great Kalpas” refers to the Great Kalpas of 
                          the three periods of past, present and future. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the previous world before 
                          our present earth world, the era was called “Kalpa of Adornment”. 
                          During twenty small kalpas in the Stage of Existence of the Adornment 
                          Kalpa, there were one thousand Buddhas in existence to maintain the virtuous 
                          adornment of their world, hence its unique naming. Today, the current 
                          era is called the “Kalpa of Virtue”. In the twenty small kalpas 
                          of the Stage of Existence of this era, one thousand Buddhas will also 
                          be born. The present Sakyamuni Buddha is the fourth Buddha. When it comes 
                          to the fifth Buddha, his name will be Maitreya Buddha. Today, he is commonly 
                          referred to as “Maitreya Buddha – the Buddha to be”. 
                          He is presently not a Buddha and hence the name. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The next aeon is called the 
                          “Kalpa of Stars”. In this Kalpa of Stars, within the twenty 
                          small kalpas of the Stage of Existence, there will also be one thousand 
                          Buddhas. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">When the earth of the “Kalpa 
                          of Stars” era is destroyed, a new earth will be formed again. If 
                          the people of our present world wish to lead a long and blissful life, 
                          it is really possible to fulfil this wish. All that is needed is for the 
                          people to carry out good deeds, to cultivate and emulate the aspiration 
                          of the Bodhisattvas, to contribute to the beneficial deeds of Bodhisattvas, 
                          … and within the birth-death transmigration in the six realms of 
                          existence to continually maintain the human form lifetime after lifetime. 
                          When finally the “End of the World” comes, their “nature-soul” 
                          will be saved and they will be born in the Heaven of Light-sound where 
                          they will enjoy heavenly bliss. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The world may become damaged, 
                          but our “nature-soul” is non-ceasing. When a new earth is 
                          formed, those beings will come down from the Heaven of Light-sound, and 
                          due to the effect of the communal virtuous karma, together a new world 
                          is created that will be a brighter, more stable, peaceful and blissful 
                          Buddha World.</span></p>
              <span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">It is hoped that everyone 
                        will emulate the spirit and virtuous deeds of the Bodhisattvas lifetime 
                        after lifetime, and never to regress from the Bodhi path and enlightenment, 
                        but to continuously cultivate through the aeon of “Three Great Kalpas”. 
                        While there are a thousand Buddhas born in each Great Kalpa, if you could 
                        meet the Buddha in your lifetime and be guided and blessed; then it is definitely 
                        possible to become a Buddha in the next Great Kalpa after the “Kalpa 
                        of Stars” era. Therefore, Jen Chen Buddhism advocates the development 
                        of a blissful world on this earth. Such virtuous deeds shall bring about 
                        boundless blessings and longevity, and in the coming “kalpa” 
                        eras, everyone will become a Buddha. <img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><em> <br> <br> <br> Note: <br> <br> [1] Kalpa:<br> 1 small kalpa = 16.8 million years <br> 20 small kalpas = 1 medium kalpa = 336 million years<br> 80 small kalpas = 4 medium kalpas = 1 great kalpa = 1.344 billion years </em></span></td>

              <p><br> Well..i think the explaination in that article is more
              convincing...but like other saying is that there is a creator who
              create humans...As for the glowing being you mentioned..they should
              be in the heaven or plane lower than buddha and bodhisavatta....in
              Mi Zong..they talk about Hua Zhan Shi Jie or Yi Zhen Fa
              Jie...the light being are not in this plane.. </p>

              <p>Just a sharing of my opinion..</p>
              <p>I think..it is not entirely correct to think of the Buddha as residing on any specific plane. We are too used to think in terms of objects and things external to ourselve.</p>
              <p>The Buddha or buddha nature is the 'shared reality' of all Beings. It is really quite hard to explain as we are too used to think into terms of places, objects, time, etc.</p>
              <p>Perhaps that is why in Tibetan buddhism there is the notion of the 3 bodies of the Buddha.. namely Nirmanakaya,  Samboghakaya and the Dharmakaya. The Dharmakaya is the share reality of all Beings.</p>

                  water, fire and wind. As such, they do not have independent natures of
                  their own. A tree, for example, is the result of a combination of
                  nutrients, water, sunlight and air. Thus, they are in fact empty
                  because when the conditions that created and sustained them are no
                  longer present, these objects will return to emptiness. However, we
                  don't see them in this light. We think they are real, absolute and
                  permanent. But they are not. They are dependent upon other conditions.
                  We need to truly comprehend and awaken to this fundamental truth of
                  emptiness.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The phrase 'all form is non-form' is from the Diamond SÅ«tra. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  said, "SubhÅ«ti, what do you think? Can we use our ordinary flesh-eyes
                  to see the TathÄ�gata’s physical form and thus believe we are seeing the
                  true TathÄ�gata ?" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">SubhÅ«ti
                  replied, "No, World-honoured One. We cannot look upon the unreal form
                  of the TathÄ�gata’s manifestation and think we have perceived the
                  non-arising and non-ceasing true body of the TathÄ�gata."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">How
                  is that? The 16-foot physique of the TathÄ�gata is a bodily form
                  produced by an aggregation of causes and conditions. When life ends,
                  that body decays and eventually vanishes. It is not the truly pure
                  Dharma-kÄ�ya of the TathÄ�gata because the Dharma-kÄ�ya has no form to be
                  seen; it is empty and tranquil. How could flesh-eyes of sentient beings
                  see the true form of the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  told SubhÅ«ti, "Not only is the TathÄ�gata’s bodily form a false form
                  produced by the aggregation of causes and conditions, which does not
                  have real substance, so is any kind of thing in the universe, in this
                  world as well as beyond this world. All living and non-living things,
                  shapes and colours are merely formed by aggregations of causes and
                  conditions. They are impermanent and will change as causes and
                  conditions disperse. They are as illusory as the flower in the mirror
                  or the moon in the water!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"If
                  looking at appearances of objects, sentient beings are able to lucidly
                  awaken to its aggregation of causes and conditions, and understand
                  impermanence, their arising and ceasing; and if at that very instant,
                  distinguishing does not arise, then without discrimination, they can
                  enter into deep stillness. In stillness, pure wisdom reveals itself.
                  With supreme wisdom, they realise that all worldly form is created by
                  causes and conditions. Its nature is empty; it is not reality. In this
                  way, they will directly perceive the TathÄ�gata’s Dharma-kÄ�ya."</span></p>

                  was the Arahat who best understood emptiness. Thus, with regards to
                  emptiness, he had profound realisation. We see this in a story:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Once,
                  Buddha went to the heavenly palace of TrayastrimÅ›Ä�s to preach Dharma to
                  his mother. He only returned to earth after having been gone for a few
                  months. All of his disciples missed him. When he returned, they rushed
                  to welcome him, each hoping to be the first to pay their respects to
                  him. Being the most advanced in supernatural ability amongst the
                  Buddha's female disciples, BhiksunÄ« Lián-huÄ�-sè (è“®èŠ±è‰²) used her
                  supernatural powers and transformed herself into the image of
                  Saint-king CakravartÄ«. Then, with great poise, she went to stand right
                  up in front. She very happily paid her respects toBuddha and said,
                  "Disciple Lián-huÄ�-sè is the first to pay respects to Buddha today. Oh,
                  I’m overjoyed!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha replied with a smile, "Lián-huÄ�-sè, the first to see the TathÄ�gata wasn’t you. It was SubhÅ«ti!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">BhiksunÄ«
                  Lián-huÄ�-sè was astonished! SubhÅ«ti had not joined in the queue to
                  welcome the Buddha. How could he have been the first to meet the Buddha?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  then said, "The bodily form of the TathÄ�gata is not seen by our
                  perceptions. He who sees the Dharma, sees the TathÄ�gata." </span></p>
              <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="95%" align="center">

              </table>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">As
                  it turned out, when Buddha returned to earth, SubhÅ«ti had been in the
                  meditation hall sitting in stillness, deeply observing the emptiness of
                  all things and phenomena, clearly understanding the reality of inherent
                  emptiness, and thus realising the formless Dharma-kÄ�ya of TathÄ�gata.
                  Even though he had not been there in the queue, he had in fact truly
                  seen the TathÄ�gata.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha
                  has three bodies (TrikÄ�ya). One is 'NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya'(åŒ–èº«), or the
                  'Emanation Body'. According to the sentient beings' capacity for
                  understanding, Buddha manifests the illusory forms of physical bodies
                  in numerous worlds. Because of their heavy karmic hindrances, some
                  disciples were only able to see the 16-foot golden body of the Buddha,
                  but were unable to see the 32 physical characteristics and 80
                  accompanying physical features of a great person (i.e.
                  DvÄ�trimÅ›advara-laksana and Anuvyañjana).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Another
                  body of Buddha is 'Sambhoga-kÄ�ya' (æŠ¥èº«), or the 'benefiting body', of
                  which are two kinds: one is the 'body which benefits oneself', and the
                  other is the 'body which benefits others'. The former is the Buddha's
                  own attainment and awakening to his meritorious intrinsic pure
                  Buddha-nature, in the state of Dharma joy. The latter is the appearance
                  of enlightened, liberated Bodhisattvas to guide beginner-Bodhisattvas
                  (i.e. sentient beings who emulate Bodhisattvas and practise the
                  Bodhisattva Way) according to prevailing causalities, enabling these
                  beginner-Bodhisattvas to benefit from the teachings of Greater Vehicle
                  (MahÄ�yÄ�na) with Dharma joy. Both NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya and Sambhoga-kÄ�ya are
                  physical forms which are visible. However, the perfect Sambhoga-kÄ�ya of
                  Great Bodhisattvas is a form that is infinite and of awesome majesty.
                  It is not something that ordinary sentient beings like us can see. What
                  ordinary people see is the NirmÄ�na-kÄ�ya form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The
                  third body of Buddha, named 'Dharma-kÄ�ya'(æ³•èº«), is the Truth Body of the
                  TathÄ�gata, and also the reality of all phenomena. It permeates all of
                  space and is omnipresent. An ancient sage said, "Green bamboos are
                  entirely Dharma-kÄ�ya, luxuriant chrysanthemums are all PrajñÄ�; each
                  grass, each tree, all in the ocean of Buddha-nature. Green bamboos are
                  used for expressing the state of Dharma-kÄ�ya, but bamboos are by no
                  means Dharma-kÄ�ya. Luxuriant chrysanthemums are used for displaying the
                  function of PrajñÄ�, but chrysanthemums are by no means PrajñÄ�."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The
                  myriad of things and phenomena in this world are formed by aggregations
                  of numerous causes and conditions comprising four elements and five
                  skandhas , arising by causality and ceasing by causality; their nature
                  is inherently empty. And everything in the world is as such. They do
                  not exist as individual entities. Hence, the nature of all things and
                  phenomena is empty, tranquil and all pervasive. However, people are
                  unaware of this and are grasping on to their belief that the numerous
                  forms in the universe truly exist. But if you can truly comprehend this
                  and awaken to the realisation that the nature of all forms is
                  emptiness, then instantaneously you perceive the pure Dharma-kÄ�ya of
                  TathÄ�gata.</span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><img src="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/images/smallflower2.gif" alt="" width="20" height="18" align="top"></span></p>
