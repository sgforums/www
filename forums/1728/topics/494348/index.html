              in border standoff</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">July 24, 2017 | ASHOK
              SHARMA and CHRISTOPHER BODEEN Columbia Basin Herald</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">NEW
              DELHI (AP) — It was the tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan that sounded the
              alarm: Chinese soldiers had arrived with bulldozers and excavators, and were
              building a high-mountain road near India's border — in an area the two
              nuclear-armed Asian giants have disputed for decades.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India
              responded to the call by sending troops last month to evict the Chinese army
              construction party from the Doklam Plateau. Within a few days, Indian media
              were running leaked video footage of soldiers from both sides shoving one
              another atop a grassy flatland.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              tense standoff has only escalated, raising concerns in both capitals of an
              all-out military conflict. Both sides have made threats while simultaneously
              calling for negotiations. The U.S. State Department has urged the two sides to
              work together toward a peaceful resolution.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India
              told China last week that it was ready to hold talks if both sides pulled their
              forces back from the disputed border area. But China countered on Monday by
              insisting the road was being built on its sovereign territory, and warned India
              not to "push your luck."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India,
              taken aback by the escalation, has said the two governments reached an
              agreement in 2012 that the status of the Doklam area — which falls between
              China and India on a Bhutanese plateau — would be finalized only through joint
              consultations involving all parties.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              look at the key background of the dispute:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">AN
              OLD QUARREL</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India
              and China have faced off frequently since fighting a bloody 1962 war that ended
              with China seizing control of some territory. Troops from both sides still
              regularly patrol other unmarked territories, though neither side has fired any
              shots in decades. Negotiations since 1985 to settle the boundary dispute have
              seen little success.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              land they're currently arguing over spans 269 square kilometers (104 square
              miles) on a sparsely populated plateau in western Bhutan, which has no
              diplomatic ties with China and coordinates its relations with Beijing through
              New Delhi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              India and China have rival claims to other Himalayan areas as well, including
              90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) in what India considers its
              state of Arunachal Pradesh and China refers to as "Southern Tibet,"
              as well as 38,000 square kilometers (15,000 square miles) of another plateau
              called Aksai Chin.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan
              said the road China has been building would run from the town of Dokola to the
              Bhutanese army camp at Zompelri.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Bhutan's
              foreign ministry called it a "direct violation" of agreements reached
              in 1988 and 1998 to maintain peace and refrain from unilateral action in the
              area pending a final border settlement. "Bhutan hopes that the status quo
              in the Doklam area will be maintained," it said in a June 29 statement.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Chinese
              foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said last week that India's border guards,
              in responding to Bhutan's call for help, had "illegally trespassed the
              boundary into Chinese territory" when they confronted the Chinese army
              construction team.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">A
              STRATEGIC AREA</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              India, securing the Doklam Plateau is seen as essential to maintaining its
              control over a land corridor that connects India's mainland with its remote
              northeastern states.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India
              has said the Chinese road project threatens its access to the corridor, while
              China has questioned why India should even have a say in a matter that concerns
              only Beijing and Bhutan.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">India's
              army chief warned earlier this month that India's army was capable of fighting
              "2 1/2 wars" if needed to secure its borders.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Indian
              analysts said China appeared to be trying to pre-empt settlement negotiations
              by establishing a Chinese presence in Doklam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"China
              has been trying for a long time to gain a tactical advantage in this
              sector," having already established dominance along the Indian borders at
              Ladakh and Arunachal Pradesh, said security expert Uday Bhakar, a retired
              Indian navy officer. "The Chinese did not expect this resolute Indian
              response, and that's why the standoff has continued."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              dispute was discussed briefly without resolution by Chinese President Xi Jinping
              and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G-20 summit
              earlier this month in Hamburg, Germany. It is expected to be taken up again
              when Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval visits Beijing for another
              security forum on Thursday and Friday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">UNEASY
              NEIGHBORS</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Doklam standoff is just the latest of many irritants dogging relations between
              the world's two most populous nations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              years, India has watched uneasily as China vigorously wooed Bhutan and other,
              smaller countries in India's traditional sphere of influence, including Nepal,
              Sri Lanka and Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"This
              is not the first time that we have a standoff with China," said foreign
              affairs analyst and retired Indian diplomat G. Parthasarthy, predicting a
              period of stalemate followed by a political compromise if the tensions follow
              past patterns.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"China
              is in an ultra-nationalist mood of establishing a hegemony power in Asia,"
              he said. "The best thing for China is to sit down and talk."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">China,
              meanwhile, has been frustrated with India's refusal to sign onto a massive
              effort to build railways, ports and roads reaching from Asia to Europe and the
              Middle East. The project includes a China-Pakistan economic development program
              aimed at absorbing as much as $46 billion in investment, most of it from
              Chinese banks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">China
              also has complained bitterly for decades over India's accepting the Dalai Lama
              as a refugee in 1959. The Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader has kept his
              headquarters in northern India since fleeing Chinese-ruled Tibet.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Despite
              their disagreements, India and China entered a trade agreement in 1985 and have
              stepped up cooperation in agriculture, science and cultural exchange. But a
              $46.6 billion trade deficit favoring China has irked Indian members of
              parliament, who call regularly for more balance.</span></p>
