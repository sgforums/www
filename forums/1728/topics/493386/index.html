              Brain to Suffer?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Drake Baer January 19, 2017
              Science of Us</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              you’re going to get any sort of science done, an experiment needs a control
              group: the unaffected, possibly placebo-ed population that didn’t take part in
              whatever intervention it is you’re trying to study. Back in the earlier days of
              cognitive neuroscience, the control condition was intuitive enough: Just let
              the person in the brain scanner lie in repose, awake yet quiet, contemplating
              the tube they’re inside of. But in 1997, 2001, and beyond, studies kept coming
              out saying that it wasn’t much of a control at all. When the brain is “at
              rest,” it’s doing anything but resting.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              you don’t give its human anything to do, brain areas related to processing
              emotions, recalling memory, and thinking about what’s to come become quietly
              active. These self-referential streams of thought are so pervasive that in a
              formative paper Marcus Raichle, a Washington University neurologist who helped
              found the field, declared it to be the “the default mode of brain function,”
              and the constellation of brain areas that carry it out are the default mode
              network, or DMN. Because when given nothing else to do, the brain defaults to
              thinking about the person it’s embedded in. Since then, the DMN has been
              implicated in everything from depression to creativity. People who daydream
              more tend to have a more active DMN; relatedly, dreaming itself appears to be
              an amplified version of mind-wandering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Buddhist traditions, this chattering described by neuroscientists as the
              default mode is a dragon to be tamed, if not slain. Chögyam Trungpa, who was
              instrumental in bringing Tibetan Buddhism to the U.S., said the meditation
              practice is “necessary generally because our thinking pattern, our
              conceptualized way of conducting our life in the world, is either too
              manipulative, imposing itself upon the world, or else runs completely wild and
              uncontrolled,” he wrote in Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. “Therefore,
              our meditation practice must begin with ego’s outermost layer, the discursive
              thoughts which continually run through our minds, our mental gossip.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              his book Mindfulness for Beginners: Reclaiming the Present Moment â€• and Your
              Life, Jon Kabat-Zinn, the founder of mindfulness-based stress reduction, argues
              that this idle narration, this “selfing,” is something that needs to be reined
              in order to have a balanced mental life. When the DMN “predominates, especially
              out of unawareness, it can very much limit our understanding of ourselves and
              of what might be possible,” he argues. The crux of the Buddhist argument is
              that if you don’t establish some relationship with your DMN, some mindfulness
              of its activity, you’ll be yanked around by the swirling eddies of emotion,
              reaction, and rumination. But what do brain sciences say?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Whether
              or not your default activity is helpful or harmful depends on where your mind
              automatically tends to go, says Scott Barry Kaufman, the scientific director at
              the Imagination Institute at the University of Pennsylvania. In the same way
              that your tongue defaults to probing a cut on the roof of your mouth, the brain
              is attracted to unresolved issues. “People differ drastically regarding if
              their default mode network content is creative or ruminative,” he says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a way, the DMN is like a scout, ranging about for prospective futures. To
              Kaufman, the default mode has a “prospective bias”: It’s seeking out
              big-picture strategies for what could be. Depending on the person, their
              history, and their biological dispositions, that prospection could tilt toward
              worrying or hoping. As psychologists have contended for decades, daydreaming
              itself has at least three different flavors: positive constructive daydreaming,
              which has lots of playful, wishful imagery and plan-making thoughts;
              guilty-dysphoric daydreaming, which has lots of anguish and obsessive
              fantasies; and poor attentional control, where it’s hard to concentrate on
              anything. “Prospection can lead to suffering if it hinders executive attention,
              the ability to have awe, attention to the present moment,” he says, emphasizing
              that, as with so many others ways that our minds get into trouble, the problem
              is rigidity; research indicates that a disturbed DMN is a mechanism in
              depression. “Our greatest source of suffering isn’t the default mode,” Kaufman
              says, “but when we get stuck in the default mode.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Indeed,
              the peripatetic nature of the DMN can be harnessed for creative thinking. In a
              2015 Scientific Reports paper that Kaufman co-authored, 25 participants were
              asked to do creative thinking tasks, including the standard measure of
              divergent thinking, asking how many uses you can come up with for a brick
              (spoiler alert: doorstop and weapon are two go-to options). At the start of the
              task, the DMN coupled with the salience network, which selects which stimuli to
              attend to, and toward the end of the task, it coupled with the executive
              network, which is responsible for the control of attention and working memory —
              results that suggest that producing creative ideas requires a combination of
              focusing internal attention and controlling spontaneous thinking. “The DMN
              contributes to the (more or less) spontaneous generation of (potentially
              useful) ideas,” co-author and Harvard postdoc Roger Beaty told Science of Us
              via email.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              underscores the fact that not all minds that wander are lost. University of
              British Columbia philosopher Evan Thompson, author of Waking, Dreaming, Being:
              Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy, says the
              DMN’s mental meanderings are “the baseline state of you as a cognitive system.”
              It’s tremendously pragmatic: being able to remember the past, plan for the
              future, and happen upon creative insights are all essential tools for navigating
              life. While he was hesitant to mix the word “suffering,” which is so loaded in
              ancient Asian religious traditions, with the “default mode,” which is of a
              contemporary neural vintage, the two connect in the way that suffering arises
              when people concretize the fleeting swirls of thought, especially around
              conceptions of self. Still, he says, there’s “particular kind of stickiness”
              that can come when DMN activity grows overly self-centered.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Default-mode
              content involves an image of self, one that’s easy to become attached to. These
              self-conceptions are “affectively charged,” he says; they carry lots of
              emotional weight. “We constantly think that it’s not just another thought, that
              [the image of self] is something real, not just an mental image.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">He
              compared it with a strawberry and thoughts of a strawberry. If you’re a
              particularly good imaginer, you might start salivating at the image of a ripe,
              inviting strawberry. Still, it’s just a mental image; not an actual strawberry.
              The “selfing” conjured up by the DMN is a lot like that: images of who you
              think you are, but not who you actually are. While you wouldn’t take a mental
              image of a strawberry to be an appropriate filling to a real-world shortcake,
              it’s easy to take your mental images of you to be your real-world self.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              self isn’t one thing, it’s an evolving construct of many different processes,”
              Thompson says.“Contemplative traditions like Buddhism and yoga would say that
              habitually investing in the image of the self more reality than it actually has
              is a source of great difficulty. When we take it to be real when it isn’t,
              according to these traditions, then that causes suffering.” He mentioned that
              in cognitive behavioral therapy, that process of divesting realness from your
              mental chatter is called “decentering,” or thinking less that your thoughts are
              the truth about what’s happening and viewing them as an observer. The
              therapeutic interventions offered by psilocybin and LSD — which, at least in
              one trial, helped longtime smokers quit at a rate three times that of the best
              pharma drugs — seem to have a similar, though more sudden, effect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              a phenomenological, subjective, what-it’s-like level, the trouble or lack
              thereof that your DMN gets into seems to depend on how automatic (or
              de-automatized) your patterns of thought are. Lots of our trains of thought, as
              suggest by the term train, speed along as if carried by a locomotive, one after
              another, carried by mental-emotional momentum. If you’re more biologically
              sensitive to perceived threats, it’s likely that it’s a direct line to
              rumination, or negatively, recursively reflecting on how you’re bad at your
              job, rock-climbing, dealing with your family on holidays, or whatever the task
              is. Though by that point the amygdala, so present in neuroticism, will probably
              be involved, too.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              key is what brain science people call “cognitive flexibility”: being able to
              more freely choose your mental habits, and have greater agency in your
              cognitive phenomena. CBT and even hypnosis are options for taming an unruly
              DMN, as is the fashionable yet ancient practice of meditation. Study after
              study indicates that meditation reduces activity in the DMN. Judson Brewer,
              psychiatrist and director of research at the UMass Medical School Center for
              Mindfulness founded by Kabat-Zinn, has found that extended meditation practice
              reforms the DMN, so that the default mode itself shifts: The resting state of
              the brain becomes more like the meditative state, producing “a more
              present-centered default mode.” So maybe that’s what all that advice to live in
              the present moment is getting at: If you can invest more attention in the
              sensory world than in your narrative overlaying it, you might identify the
              former, rather than the latter, to be what’s true.</span></p>
