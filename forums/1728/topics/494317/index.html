              Thailand Isn’t on Migrants, But Monks</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">07/12/2017 Stanley A Weiss
              Huffpost</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">LONDON—
              Supporters have called it “the Buddhist Vatican.” But, at 1,000 acres, the Wat
              Dhammakaya temple is nearly ten times the size of the Holy See, and its
              larger-than-life leader, Phra Dhammachayo, is more like America’s multi-media
              evangelist Pat Robertson than Pope Francis. Its UFO-shaped stupa measures more
              than 2,000 feet in diameter. Its ceremonies attract tens of thousands of
              orange-clad monks. And it caused the largest security operation in Thailand
              since a 2014 military coup. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              February, 4,000 police officers and soldiers lay siege to the temple. Thousands
              of followers remained in defiance. After 23 days and two deaths, the government
              got into the complex, but Dhammachayo was nowhere to be found. The generals
              still don’t know where he went, but they accidentally revealed where they are
              trying to go. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              the creation of modern Thailand, its three pillars – the military, the monks,
              and the monarch – have underpinned the state’s ideology of “Nation, Religion,
              and King.” Together, they have guided the country through decades of fractured
              politics. But since the passing of the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej last
              October, and the ascendance to the throne of his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn,
              this balance of power has come to an end. During a week in which more than
              2,000 foreign workers were forced to flee the country under a new decree that
              penalizes employers for hiring undocumented workers, the real crackdown in
              Thailand isn’t on illegal immigration, but on monks. The military junta is
              attempting to reform Thai Buddhism in its own image and consolidate its hold on
              Thai politics – in ways that could profoundly impact America’s oldest Asian
              ally. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              military’s power comes from its arsenal. The monarch’s power comes from being
              semi-divine. And the monk’s authority stems from the people, who see Buddhism
              as a central part of being Thai. Thailand is both one of the most religious
              countries in the world and one of most religiously homogenous. It is more
              Buddhist than India is Hindu and Ireland is Catholic. Thai citizens organize
              their calendars and their communities around the festivals held at their local
              temple. When you add that to the fact that Thailand is just one of only four
              countries in the world with a majority Buddhist population, it may not be
              surprising that Buddhism elicits a stronger sense of national identity among
              Thai citizens than any other factor.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              in recent years, corruption and sex scandals have eroded the spiritual
              authority of Thailand’s 300,000 monks. The most common reports speak of monks
              stealing temple donations, crashing their sports cars, and getting caught in a
              variety of drug and sex scandals. But you also hear of the more exotic. One
              temple recently kept a slaughterhouse for tigers. Scandals have become so
              common that, in 2014, Thailand’s governing body for Buddhism created a 24-hour
              hotline for people to report on monks behaving badly. These scandals have
              weakened the monk’s influence and the trust they receive from the public. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              even in this context, no temple has attracted attention quite like Wat
              Dhammakaya, which some describe as “a cult best left undiscussed.” With an
              extensive patronage network and a doctrine built on the prosperity gospel, it
              rivals the biggest United States megachurches in its influence and opulence. As
              Reuters reports, the temple “has established over 90 branches in 35 countries.
              The temple runs television stations, slick websites and active social media
              accounts. It holds choreographed ceremonies of tens of thousands of people.”
              Its sermons guarantee blessings in exchange for donations and its chairs
              proclaim that you can “sit here and get rich.” And then there is Phra
              Dhammachayo. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              the past four decades, the temple’s leader has been a lightning rod for
              controversy. His bold proclamations and glaring displays of wealth have
              energized his followers and captured the attentions of the media, other monks,
              and the law. Throughout his career, he has evaded multiple accusations of
              corruption, heresy, and money laundering, among other, more minor offenses.
              Most recently, he was connected to an embezzlement scheme that took $40 million
              from a follower’s credit union. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              more than a year, the junta used these allegations to pursue Dhammachayo. They
              threatened to raid the temple – twice – to apprehend him. They revived a 1999
              case to defrock him. They banned him from leaving the country. In the process,
              they filed more than 100 cases against the temple itself. And that pattern has
              continued through today. Since the standoff ended in March, the junta has
              opened three new case investigations. They also connected the temple to an
              illegal weapons ring. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Why
              has the junta spent so much time, manpower, and money to find a diabetic, if
              diabolical, 72-year-old monk? It’s not about religion, or the law. It’s
              politics. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              the past fifteen years, Thai politics has been locked in a stalemate between
              the “Red Shirts,” rural and populist supporters of the exiled former Prime
              Minister Thaksin Shinawatra from the country’s north, and the “Yellow Shirts,”
              dominated by urban elites around Bangkok and the country’s south. The Red
              shirts have numbers on their side. The Yellow Shirts have the military.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">After
              his election in 2001, Thaksin led an ambitious program of economic reforms that
              channeled money from the Bangkok elite to the impoverished, rural north. The
              military responded by staging a coup in 2006 and exiling Thaksin. When Thaksin’s
              sister came to power in 2011, the cycle repeated itself. The military removed
              her from office in 2014 and has been in power ever since. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              I argued last year, “the final product of all of this is that Thailand is
              stuck. Red shirts lack power, and yellow shirts lack ideas.” Every time the red
              shirts win a democratic election, the yellow shirts use anti-democratic means
              to remove them from power. The result is that Thailand remains at a frustrating
              impasse. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              in the middle of these red and yellow shirts are orange robes. While it denies
              any official connection to Thaksin, many of its adherents have long supported
              the exile looming over Thai politics. In 2010, the temple nearly sent 100,000
              monks in support of Red Shirt protests. And those sympathies have not gone
              away. One of the temple’s former monks recently told The Diplomat that Thaksin
              is the reincarnation of an 18th century King and claimed that the country needs
              to “return power to the righteous one.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">To
              the military, Wat Dhammakaya isn’t a security threat. It’s a political one. And
              in attempting to restrain what the BBC describes as “the largest institution in
              the country not under the military’s control,” the junta also sees a chance to
              expand its authority at the monks’ expense. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              targeting a specific temple with the threat of force, the junta has targeted
              all temples with the threat of law. It pushed for language in the new
              Constitution empowering the military to “prevent the desecration of Buddhism in
              any form.” It sacked the government official responsible for Buddhist affairs
              in favor of a more sympathetic police officers. And it considered establishing
              a new regulatory board that would “support and protect” Buddhism, but only
              offer three seats on the 27-person board to Buddhism’s governing body.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              international media fixates this week on the 2,000 undocumented immigrants
              fleeing the country, the crackdown on religion continues. By giving itself the
              power to silence any monks who do not agree with the military’s politics, the
              junta isn’t just minimizing the long-term influence of the monks. It’s also
              neutering one of the last institutions that could effectively mobilize
              political opposition. The result is a Thailand in which dissent is silenced,
              trust in institutions has fallen, and the chances of a return to democracy are
              increasingly remote. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              they really mean to lead the country back to democracy, the junta needs to
              solve the country’s political stalemate. Unfortunately, that idea increasingly
              looks as alien as Wat Dhammakaya’s stupa.</span></p>
