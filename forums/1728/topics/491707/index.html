              the chapter on Religion from the book, “Life Lessons for Mia Rose: An
              Irreverent Guide to Living and Loving Well” by Claire Fordham that was fact
              checked by Cynthia Eller, Professor of Women’s Studies and Religious Studies at
              Montclair University, New Jersey.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><em style="line-height: 21.5pt; text-align: justify;"></em><span style="color: #353535; font-family: Cambria, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 21.5pt; text-align: justify;">Few, if any, children
              over twelve believe in the existence of Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy. I
              am one of the growing numbers of people who believe that eventually it will be
              accepted that there’s no such supernatural being as god either.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>The Romans and the Greeks
              worked out pretty quickly that Neptune and Zeus weren’t for real, so it’s
              incredible to me that the greatest, most advanced civilizations the world has ever
              known still believe in their god.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>I can’t prove He doesn’t,
              but believers can’t prove He exists either. And when people make extraordinary
              claims, it’s up to them to provide the evidence. I am writing God and He, as
              opposed to god and he, she or it, out of respect for believers who write it
              like that.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>It’s important to respect
              other people’s points of view even if you don’t share their beliefs, especially
              where religion is concerned, because it’s a subject people feel very strongly
              about. But if people believe in fairy tales, they should expect to take some
              stick. It’s really important, I believe, to at least know all sides of the
              argument.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Over the centuries,
              people with different religious beliefs have gone to war and ostracized
              neighbors who didn’t agree with their views.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>It’s fair to say that the
              vast majority of people follow the religion of their parents and rarely take
              the time to understand alternative philosophies or find out what other
              religions actually stand for.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>The important thing if
              you decide to follow a religion is to follow the one that makes most sense to
              you and not what your parents or grandparents tell you. Weigh up all the
              arguments and make your own decision. But, above all, be respectful of other
              people’s views. There’s no law that says you must follow a particular religion,
              but there are followers of some religions who will kill you for not siding with
              their team.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Unless they are
              Buddhists. Senior Buddhists say it isn’t even a religion. It’s more like a way
              of life, a philosophy with one motto: seek the truth. They also advocate
              kindness. It’s hard to argue against that ideology, but Buddhism as it’s
              practiced by ninety-nine percent of followers is very much a religion with
              temples, prayers and deities. And the Buddha recommended being kind for purely
              pragmatic reasons because it helps you (allegedly) along on the path to
              enlightenment. In practice, though, Buddhism says a lot about kindness and
              compassion for its own sake. It’s thought to be a fruit of enlightenment as
              well as a means toward enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Although even Buddhists
              are getting violent. There have been<span> </span></span><a href="http://time.com/2956180/burma-mandalay-race-riots-sectarian-violence-buddhist-muslim/"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #151d4e; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'>reports</span></a><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>of Buddhist mobs, including monks,
              who burned Muslim homes in Myanmar in a widening of ultra-nationalist Buddhist
              violence.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>This attack resulted in
              two deaths. Historically, there have been cases of Buddhist violence, some of
              it primarily ethnic, but also because of disputes over doctrine.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>They clearly forgot that
              Buddhists believe in reincarnation and karma. Karma means reaping what you sow.
              If you say or do something mean or unkind, eventually someone else will be mean
              or unkind to you. I quite like that idea. But Buddhists also think we keep
              coming back after we die (reincarnating) until we learn from our mistakes.
              That’s where they lose me. I don’t believe in reincarnation. It doesn’t pass
              the smell test. My smell test anyway. I believe we have one chance at life. I
              believe that life is not a dress rehearsal for an afterlife and we must live
              and love as well as we possibly can because this is it.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>The five most influential
              religions are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Judaism. The most
              derogatory label you can give a religion is to call it a cult. But a cult is
              really just a religion without so many followers.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>There are about 2.2
              billion Christians in the world, 1.6 billion Muslims (followers of Islam), 1
              billion Hindus, 500 million Buddhists and around 15 million Jews.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>The vast majority of God-fearing
              and worshiping people are good, honorable and law-abiding. They respect other
              religions and beliefs and want to live together in harmony. But there is an
              ever- growing number of fundamentalists who call for the destruction of
              everyone who doesn’t believe in the same supreme being as them.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Jews have been on the
              receiving end of more hatred, prejudice and bigotry than any other, although
              this has often been more a racial issue than a religious one.<span> </span><br> The horror that has been going on in the Middle East over a piece of land that
              used to be called Palestine where predominantly Muslim Palestinians lived that
              is now called Israel is the root cause of most modern religious hatred and
              killing. Historically, many Palestinians were Christians. They were a minority
              but a large and significant minority.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>“Israel” was taken away
              from “Palestine” and set up as a permanent home for Jews in 1948 after six
              million of them were killed in concentration camps by Germany during the Second
              World War.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>A group of nations led by
              Great Britain after World War Two thought they were doing the right thing by
              giving Jews their own state. But they also created hatred and resentment among
              Palestinians who had nowhere else to go and fought over the decades to get
              their land back, with the support of their fellow Muslim countries that
              surround Israel — quite a few of whom have vowed that they won’t rest until
              Israel is given back to the Palestinians and every last Jewish man, woman and
              child is dead and buried.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Politicians and diplomats
              from around the world have managed to get the two sides talking around a table
              a few times but no firm agreement has been made. The only possible hope for
              peace is that Hamas, the democratically elected party that currently governs
              Palestine, recognizes Israel’s right to exist and that a two-state solution can
              be found where both sides can live in harmony.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Christians and Jews have
              been fighting each other for nearly two thousand years and Muslims joined their
              company more than one thousand years ago.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>There’s a famous quote
              from Mahatma Gandhi, leader of the Indian National Congress in the 1940s, after
              India was partitioned (again by the Brits and again in 1948) to separate Hindus
              and Muslims. The Hindus stayed in India and Muslims were given their own state,
              Pakistan. Raised a Hindu and renowned for his wisdom, humility and for being a
              pacifist, Gandhi said, “Victory attained by violence is tantamount to a defeat,
              for it is momentary.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Gandhi was assassinated
              in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist who was resentful at what he perceived as
              Gandhi’s sympathy for India’s Muslims. Gandhi was full of good quotes such as,
              “I like your Christ. I don’t like Christians. They are so unlike your Christ.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 21.5pt; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #353535;'>Christianity is based on
              the life and teachings of Jesus. Most Christians believe Jesus is the actual,
              physical Son of God and that Jesus was born to a virgin called Mary who was
              impregnated by the Holy Spirit. They also believe that Jesus, God and the Holy
              Spirit are one and the same and, most importantly, that Jesus gave his life to
              save humankind and only by repenting our sins and acknowledging that Jesus is
              our savior can we get to Heaven. Failure to do so come Judgment Day when Jesus
              will return will result in our being sent to hell for eternity.</span></p>

              Jewish sect in the first century AD. Jesus’ followers believe that He suffered
              for people’s sins, as he was crucified and died on a cross, then buried and

              Christians were persecuted by Jewish religious authorities who disagreed with

              hundred years after Jesus was born that Christians began writing down his
              teachings and stories about him. I suspect there were a number of exaggerations
              and embellishments over those years. Some religious historians aren’t convinced
              Jesus existed at all and was invented by early Christians.</span></p>

              philosophy and way of life of Jewish people. It’s been around for more than
              five thousand years and is the oldest surviving monotheistic religion. A
              monotheistic religion is one that only believes in and worships one deity.</span></p>

              his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai and they are written down in
              the Hebrew bible, called the Tanakh. The first five books, Genesis through
              Deuteronomy, are called the Torah. Jews believe they should pray to their God
              and only Him. They do not follow the teachings of Jesus and do not consider him
              to be their savior. They don’t consider Moses to be their savior either, but do
              consider him their greatest prophet.</span></p>

              Islam, some Jews follow their religious laws and commandments more strictly
              than others. Most Jews live in Israel, America and Canada with a few million

              in the religion of Islam are called Muslims. Their core beliefs are that there
              is only one God, Allah, (monotheistic again) and that Muhammad is their prophet
              who conveyed all Allah’s teachings as told to him by the archangel Gabriel on
              numerous occasions between 610 CE and his death on June 8, 632 CE (CE is the
              same as BC, and sometimes CE is used so as not to offend non-Christians. CE is
              an abbreviation of Common Era, but denotes the same era as BC – Before Christ.
              Sometimes it’s written as B.C.E. – Before the Common Era).</span></p>

              illiterate. His followers wrote down what he told them. Those teachings are
              written in the Muslim scripture called the Qur’an or Koran. Muslims believe Muhammad
              to be the last in a series of great prophets starting with Adam and including
              Abraham, Moses and Jesus. They also believe in the Resurrection and a Judgment
              Day.</span></p>

              Muslims have split up into different sects. The vast majority of Muslims are
              Sunni. The largest minority group of Muslims is the Shia. Sunni and Shia have
              fought each other frequently over the years, but since Israel was established
              in 1948, have found enemies in common – Jews and Westerners. Muslims consider
              Westerners corrupt largely because they believe they aren’t sufficiently
              religious, not just because they are Christian.</span></p>

              Middle East, Central Asia, Indonesia and sub-Saharan Africa. The vast majority
              of Muslims are peaceful and law-abiding, but a rather scary and increasing
              number have called for the destruction of Israel, the United States of America
              and Europe. There are Persian miniatures of Muhammad, some with his face
              veiled, but, at this time in history, there is a zealous refusal to represent
              Muhammad and it is considered a sin to draw or paint Him, a sin punishable by
              death.</span></p>

              religion with most practitioners living on the Indian sub-continent or of
              Indian descent. They don’t have scripture as such, but many traditions have
              been handed down over four thousand years to form the basis. No single person
              is credited with developing this faith that has many sects, rituals and
              practices.</span></p>

              there is a lot more to it than this, Hindus worship many different gods
              (polytheistic) that all lead to the ultimate, Brahman, which they consider to
              be the ultimate reality. Hinduism is about the search for liberation that can
              be achieved through meditation, yoga and prayer.</span></p>

              has four stages: student, householder, retiree and renunciant. Fame and fortune
              is applauded — as is the pursuit of pleasure — but, near the end of your life,
              you let it all go, which will put you on the path of spiritual liberation.</span></p>

              sanctity of all life, and many are vegetarians. They also believe in
              reincarnation and karma; and understand and appreciate that other religions are
              relevant and should be respected.</span></p>

              Hinduism. Around 500 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama renounced his wealthy lifestyle in
              India (and abandoned his wife and baby) in search of spiritual liberation,
              known as Nirvana (from the ancient language of Sanskrit).</span></p>

              eluded him for many years until he sat under a bodhi tree determined not to
              move until he became enlightened. On the forty-ninth day, he opened his eyes,
              having realized through meditation that the problem with humanity is that we
              are all deluded and ego-driven; and that the sooner we ditch the three bad
              habits of desire, anger and ignorance, the better.</span></p>

              Buddha (the Awakened One), spent the next forty-five years teaching his wisdom
              to monks and nuns, promoting a solitary and spiritual way of life. He insisted
              his disciples must not write anything down, so his most important sermons were
              conveyed orally. It wasn’t until hundreds of years after his death that the
              Buddha’s teachings were finally committed to paper.</span></p>

              accounts of the Buddha’s teachings are in Pali, an ancient northwestern Indian
              dialect. I suspect a lot was lost in the translation. That said, the message of
              Buddhism is one of love, peace and non-violence, so I’ve no idea what the
              Buddhists in Indonesia were thinking. If they didn’t believe in reincarnation
              and weren’t so fond of chanting, I’d probably lean towards Buddhism.</span></p>

              people say we need religion to give people a sense of morality. I don’t buy
              that. I don’t think we have to worship anyone or anything to live a good and
              moral life.</span></p>

              must have created this amazing world. I don’t. I believe in evolution. I think
              it is just part of the miracle and wonder of life and human beings are capable
              of being moral and ethical without adhering to a religion or worshiping a god.
              That doesn’t make me a bad person, it makes me a secular humanist.</span></p>

              you were born in – and what your parents believed and therefore taught you –
              usually determines which religion, if any, you will follow. And while I don’t
              agree with atheist Christopher Hitchens that religion poisons everything, I do
              agree it poisons a lot.</span></p>

              about all religions, that their original leaders and prophets all believed the
              same things were important: love and kindness. While I don’t personally believe
              in an afterlife, in the unlikely event that there is one, I am absolutely
              certain that Jesus, Muhammad and Buddha are shaking their heads in disbelief
              and despair at what is being done in their name.</span></p>
