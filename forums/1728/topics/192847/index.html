            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Kalama Sutta</strong><br><br>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One, on a wandering tour among the Kosalans with a large community of monks, arrived at Kesaputta, a town of the Kalamas. The Kalamas of Kesaputta heard it said, "Gotama the contemplative Â— the son of the Sakyans, having gone forth from the Sakyan clan Â— has arrived at Kesaputta. And of that Master Gotama this fine reputation has spread: 'He is indeed a Blessed One, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct, well-gone, a knower of the cosmos, an unexcelled trainer of those persons ready to be tamed, teacher of human &amp; divine beings, awakened, blessed. He has made known Â— having realized it through direct knowledge Â— this world with its devas, maras, &amp; brahmas, its generations with their contemplatives &amp; priests, their rulers &amp; common people; has explained the Dhamma admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end; has expounded the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its essence, entirely perfect, surpassingly pure. It is good to see such a worthy one.'"<br><br>So the Kalamas of Kesaputta went to the Blessed One. On arrival, some of them bowed down to him and sat to one side. Some of them exchanged courteous greetings with him and, after an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, sat to one side. Some of them sat to one side having saluted him with their hands palm-to-palm over their hearts. Some of them sat to one side having announced their name &amp; clan. Some of them sat to one side in silence.<br><br>As they sat there, the Kalamas of Kesaputta said to the Blessed One, "Lord, there are some priests &amp; contemplatives who come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. And then other priests &amp; contemplatives come to Kesaputta. They expound &amp; glorify their own doctrines, but as for the doctrines of others, they deprecate them, revile them, show contempt for them, &amp; disparage them. They leave us absolutely uncertain &amp; in doubt: Which of these venerable priests &amp; contemplatives are speaking the truth, and which ones are lying?"<br><br>"Of course you are uncertain, Kalamas. Of course you are in doubt. When there are reasons for doubt, uncertainty is born. So in this case, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering' Â— then you should abandon them.<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For harm, lord."<br><br>"And this greedy person, overcome by greed, his mind possessed by greed, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"Now, what do you think, Kalamas? When aversion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For harm, lord."<br><br>"And this aversive person, overcome by aversion, his mind possessed by aversion, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"Now, what do you think, Kalamas? When delusion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For harm, lord."<br><br>"And this deluded person, overcome by delusion, his mind possessed by delusion, kills living beings, takes what is not given, goes after another person's wife, tells lies, and induces others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term harm &amp; suffering."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"<br><br>"Unskillful, lord."<br><br>"Blameworthy or blameless?"<br><br>"Blameworthy, lord."<br><br>"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"<br><br>"Criticized by the wise, lord."<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, do they lead to harm &amp; to suffering, or not?"<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, they lead to harm &amp; to suffering. That is how it appears to us."<br><br>"So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, "This contemplative is our teacher." When you know for yourselves that, "These qualities are unskillful; these qualities are blameworthy; these qualities are criticized by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to harm &amp; to suffering" Â— then you should abandon them.' Thus was it said. And in reference to this was it said.<br><br>"Now, Kalamas, don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, 'This contemplative is our teacher.' When you know for yourselves that, 'These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness' Â— then you should enter &amp; remain in them.<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of greed arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For welfare, lord."<br><br>"And this ungreedy person, not overcome by greed, his mind not possessed by greed, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of aversion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For welfare, lord."<br><br>"And this unaversive person, not overcome by aversion, his mind not possessed by aversion, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"What do you think, Kalamas? When lack of delusion arises in a person, does it arise for welfare or for harm?"<br><br>"For welfare, lord."<br><br>"And this undeluded person, not overcome by delusion, his mind not possessed by delusion, doesn't kill living beings, take what is not given, go after another person's wife, tell lies, or induce others to do likewise, all of which is for long-term welfare &amp; happiness."<br><br>"Yes, lord."<br><br>"So what do you think, Kalamas: Are these qualities skillful or unskillful?"<br><br>"Skillful, lord."<br><br>"Blameworthy or blameless?"<br><br>"Blameless, lord."<br><br>"Criticized by the wise or praised by the wise?"<br><br>"Praised by the wise, lord."<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, do they lead to welfare &amp; to happiness, or not?"<br><br>"When adopted &amp; carried out, they lead to welfare &amp; to happiness. That is how it appears to us."<br><br><strong>"So, as I said, Kalamas: 'Don't go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, "This contemplative is our teacher." When you know for yourselves that, "These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted &amp; carried out, lead to welfare &amp; to happiness" Â— then you should enter &amp; remain in them.'

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dragg:</div><div class="quote_body">its faith.<br><br>there is no way to prove that any religion is true.<br><br></div></blockquote>Exerpt from: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=179467" rel="nofollow">Buddhism &amp; Science article</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>Come and See for Yourself</strong><br><br>If you had just one person who had been confirmed as medically dead who could describe to the doctors, as soon as they were revived, what had been said, and done during that period of death, wouldn't that be pretty convincing? When I was doing elementary particle physics there was a theory that required for its proof the existence of what was called the 'W' particle. At the cyclotron in Geneva, CERN funded a huge research project, smashing atoms together with an enormous particle accelerator, to try and find one of these 'W' particles. They spent literally hundreds of millions of pounds on this project. They found one, just one 'W' particle. I don't think they have found another since. But once they found one 'W' particle, the researchers involved in that project were given Nobel prizes for physics. They had proved the theory by just finding the one 'W' particle. That's good science. Just one is enough to prove the theory.<br><br>When it comes to things we don't like to believe, they call just one experience, one clear factual undeniable experience, an anomaly. Anomaly is a word in science for disconcerting evidence that we can put in the back of a filing cabinet and not look at again, because it's threatens our worldview. It undermines what we want to believe. It is threatening to our dogma. However, an essential part of the scientific method is that theories have to be abandoned in favour of the evidence, in respect of the facts. The point is that the evidence for a mind independent of the brain is there. But once we admit that evidence, and follow the scientific method, then many cherished theories, what we call 'sacred cows' will have to be abandoned.<br><br>When we see something that challenges any theory, in science or in religion, we should not ignore the evidence. We have to change the theory to fit the facts. That is what we do in Buddhism. All the Dhamma of the Buddha, everything that he taught, if it does not fit the experience, then we should not accept it. We should not accept the Buddha's words in contradiction of experience. That is clearly stated in the Kālāma Sutta. (AN III, 65) The Buddha said do not believe because it is written in the books, or even if I say it. Don't just believe because it is tradition, or because it sounds right, or because it's comforting to you. Make sure it fits your experience. The existence of mind, independent of the brain, fits experience. The facts are there.<br><br>Sometimes, however, we cannot trust the experts. You cannot trust Ajahn Brahm. You cannot trust the scientific journals. Because people are often biased. Buddhism gives you a scientific method for your practice. Buddhism says, do the experiment and find out for your self if what the Buddha said is true or not. Check out your experience. For example, develop the method to test the truth of past lives, rebirth and reincarnation. Don't just believe it with faith, find out for yourself. The Buddha has given a scientific experiment that you can repeat.<br><br>Until you understand the law of kamma, which is part of Buddhism, kamma is just a theory. Do you believe that there is a God 'up there' who decides when you can be happy or unhappy? Or is everything that happens to you just chance? Your happiness and your suffering in life, your joy, your pain and disappointments, are they deserved? Are you responsible or is it someone else's fault? Is it mere chance that we are rich or poor? Is it bad luck when we are sick and die at a young age? Why? You can find the true answer for yourself. You can experience the law of kamma through deep meditation. When the Buddha sat under the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya, the two knowledge's he realized just before his Enlightenment were the knowledge from experience of the truth of rebirth, and the knowledge from experience of the Law of kamma. This was not theory, not just more thinking, not something worked out from discussions around the coffee table this was realization from deep experience of the nature of mind. You too can have that same experience.<br><br>All religions in the world except Buddhism maintain the existence of a soul. They affirm a real 'self', an 'essence of all being', a 'person', a 'me'. Buddhism says there is no self! Who is right? What is this 'ghost in the machine'? Is it a soul, is it a being, or is it a process? What is it? When the Buddha said that there is no one in here, he never meant that to be just believed, he meant that to be experienced. The Buddha said, as a scientific fact, that there is no 'self'. But like any scientific fact, it has to be experienced each one for themselves, paccattam veditabbo viÃ±Ã±ūhī. Many of you chant those Pāli words every day. It is basic scientific Buddhism. You have to keep an open mind. You don't believe there is 'no self', you don't believe there is a 'self' both beliefs are dogmatism. Keep an open mind until you complete the experiment. The experiment is the practice of sila, samādhi and paÃ±Ã±a, (virtue, meditation and insight). The experiment is Buddhist practice. Do the same experimental procedures that the Buddha did under the Bodhi tree. Repeat it and see if you get the same results. The result is called Enlightenment.<br><br>Men and women have repeated that experiment many times over the centuries. It is in the laboratory of Buddhist practice that the Enlightened Ones, the Arahants, arise. The Arahants are the ones who have done the experiment and found the result. That's why Buddhism always has been the scientific way. It is the way of finding out for your self the truth of Enlightenment.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guidlines are important to follow in some ways. the journey one travels is most important. the journey may turn out different from the guide book because of individual background and settings.<br><br>i have learnt not to cling onto what buddha taught and to have an open mind when i travel along this journey. to heed and see it for myself.<br><br>i have a never-ending questioning mind, i am aware of that. the monkey in my head sometimes can talk and talk and tell me do this do that, shouldn't do this shouldn't do that, should be like this should be like that, what if this what if that......... i just did one thing....... remain silent.... still...... the monkey has been subsided..... the path is clear...... it became softer and ended talking to itself. there is no more monkey in the head. i can move on with the journey without hindrance.<br><br>sound crazy? who is? the monkey or the still clear mind?<br><br>truth is profound (at least for now).... but we all will eventually get there some day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi SocialOutcast<br><br>You are right. We are mere mortals. What religions has mentioned is ultimately up to us to verify. Religions can present you their side of the story and by which claim to be the truth. Now the next part is verifying them ourselves.<br><br>The reason why I stayed on as a Buddhist are as follow<br><br>1. Buddhism never fail to impress me. Sometimes it comes in the form of widely diversified views. I see it as a form of democracy.<br><br>2. Buddhism advocate observation of all phenomena objectively -- Vipassana. Much like the spirit of Science. Until the past 500 years, ppl believed that sickenss were caused by evil spirits. W/o the pioneer scientists who started to truly observe things at deeper level, we woulnd't enjoy today's science and technology.<br><br>3. Buddhism does not let emotions rule its head. Unlike many other religons which are addicted to spiritual highs. Buddhism advocates constant investigation and spiritual well-being.<br><br>When you come to Buddhism, its not like you found a new treasure. Rather its like you are reunited with an old friend. Something which has been so near yet so far in the past. Buddhism taught me to look at things as they are. This is most valuable.<br><br>I constantly find renewed strength in the fountain of the Buddha's teachings.</div>
