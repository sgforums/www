But, due to the long laps of time in karmic return,   many will not understand that it was the same returning boomerang that hit us back. Many people may not   <strong>recognise</strong> the connection.. And thus they continue to throw boomerangs.. because they like this activity (<strong>desire</strong>). And each time, they kena hit <strong>again</strong>.<br><br>However, when they understood that throwing the boomerang was the cause of being hit or when they lose interest in boomerang throwing, only then will they not be hit by (their own) boomerangs again.</div>
