            <div class='col-md body'>There is a lot of confusion surrounding the concepts of <strong>Reincarnation</strong> and <span style="color: darkred;">Rebirth</span>. At first glance it seems like they are synonyms, but there is a <strong>big difference between </strong>these two concepts.<br><br>Anyone who study or practise buddhism know that the insight teaching of buddha <strong>DO NOT teaches Reincarnation </strong>but <span style="color: darkred;">Rebirth</span><br><br>The <strong>reincarnation idea is to believe in a soul or a be</strong>ing, separate from the body. At the death of the physical body, this soul is said to move into another state and then enter a womb to be born again.<br><br><strong>In Buddhism </strong>there is <span style="color: darkred;">no soul</span>, <span style="color: darkred;">no self,no attachment</span>,then what can be re-incarned?<br><br>Buddha <span style="color: darkred;">clearly taught that there is no inherent self, no soul, no tangible ego _(Anatman).</span> Yet he also taught <span style="color: darkred;">rebirth</span>. The Hindu teachings of his time taught reincarnation. Many people today (including ofcause <strong>JOSS STICK Buddhists</strong>) seem to have an almost superstitious belief in "their" past lives, as if there were a self that could have had them.<br><br>In contrast, Buddhism teaches the <span style="color: darkred;">doctrine of rebirth</span>. <span style="color: darkred;">Between a series of lifetimes there is a relationship of causality, not of identity.</span> To make this more clear, let's use the <span class="large"><strong>example of the falling dominos. If I place a series of dominos standing up in line next to each other, and I strike the first one to make it fall down, this causes the second one to fall down, and the next, until the last in line falls down. The fall of the first domino is the cause of the fall of the last one, but there is not a shared identity between the first and the last domino</strong>.</span><br><br>When somebody dies, <span style="color: darkred;">rebirth is caused by the continuation of the mental processes of the dead person in a new body</span>. <span class="large"><strong>The new person however is not identical to the one that left the previous body (a lot of causes and conditions come into play to shape this new being), nor a completely different person (because of causality relation</strong>).</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Dogen Zenji </span>said<br><br><span class="large">"<strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Firewood becomes ash and does not become firewood again.<br>In just the same way you do not return to birth after death<br>Death is an expression complete in this moment<br>Birth is an expression complete in this moment</span></strong>." </span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Our Mind</span>, that carries over from life to life has<span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;"> no beginning - its continuity is infinite</span></span>.<span style="color: darkred;"> Each moment of our Mind is a continuation of the previous moment</span>. Who we are and what we think and feel depends on who we were yesterday. <span style="color: darkred;">Our present Mind is a continuation of the past Mind</span>. One moment of our Mind was caused by the previous moment of our Mind. This continuity can be traced back to childhood and even to when we were a fetus in our Mother's womb. Even before the time of conception, our mind-stream existed in another body.<br><br><span class="large">Using the example of a number line, looking left from position zero, there is <strong>no first negative number</strong>, and looking right, there is <strong>no highest last number</strong> - one more can always be added. Likewise, <span style="color: darkred;">our mind-stream has no beginning or end</span>. We all have had countless past rebirths, and our <span style="color: darkred;">Mind will continue to exist infinitely</span>. By purifying our mind-stream, we can make our future existence better and better.</span><br><br>"According to Buddhism, <span style="color: darkred;">all component or conditioned things are impermanent and in a constant state of flux</span>. Therefore in <span style="color: darkred;">opposition,the existence of an unchanging and independent self, in this world,is denied since it goes against the Buddhist principle of selflessness (anatta). </span>Buddhists hold that the notion of a permanent self is one of the main root causes for the wars and conflicts in human history, and that by living by anatta or not-self, we may go beyond our mundane desires. The ineffable state of Nirvana is solely recognized as being distinct. Conventionally speaking though, the soul or self for Buddhists is spoken of socially but under the conviction that we are dependent on others and not independent unchanging selfs. At death the body &amp; mind disintegrates, but if the disintegrating mind contains any remaining traces of karma,it will cause the continuity of the consciousness to bounce back an arising mind to an awaiting being (i.e. a fetus developing the ability to harbor conciousness). <span style="color: darkred;">Thus Buddhists teach that a reborn being is neither entirely different nor exactly the same</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Everything in the Universe, be it physical (from the smallest cells of our bodies to the biggest stars) or mental (such as the thoughts running through our minds), constantly undergo change, never staying the same for even just two consecutive split seconds.</span> As <span class="large"><strong>everything is a result or effect of changing causes and conditions, everything changes constantly</strong>.</span><br><br>The <span style="color: darkred;">smallest component of the most "solid" thing is only a ball of fluxing energy</span>. The untrained Mind is even much more fickle and prone to change, having no stability of a fixed self-nature. All living and non-living elements are thus subject to decay and destruction. The is the law of natural it is neutral and unbiased. It is ungoverned by any higher power - as <span style="color: darkred;">things decay, as well as become renewed naturally</span>.(<strong>which has been proven by science</strong>)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Everything in the Universe is compounded or made up of parts</span>, <span style="color: darkred;">which are in turn made up of parts, which are in turn made up of smaller and smaller parts.</span> <span style="color: darkred;">Each of these parts changes constantly - sometimes grossly but mostly subtly (to our senses). There is no single fixed component of anything that is not subject to change. A thing exists only when the parts that constitute it come together. Thus, there is no fixed unchanging self within anything - this is called impersonality</span>. It also means that <span class="large"><strong>everything is interconnected and interdependent upon each other. Nothing exists on its own as a separate self</strong>.</span><br><br>If a real or permanent self exists, one should be able to identify it. However, <span style="color: darkred;">one's body changes unceasingly from second to second from birth to death</span>. The <span style="color: darkred;">Mind changes even much more rapidly</span>. Thus, we cannot say the body, Mind or any particular combination of the two is one's self. Neither can an independent self exist as both the body and Mind depend on many factors to exist. As the so-called self is just a collection of conditioned and changing physical and mental factors, there is no real or concrete element of self in us.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: darkred;">Today science has tell us that nothing is created nor destroyed they just changing from one form to another form</span>.</span><br><br>Take for example a candle flame.The candle is like a body hosting the flame(mind/consciousness))When the candle is fully consumed the flame will gone.So is this to say that the flame is dead ? Gone forever?Well.. as science has tell us that nothing is created nor destroyed they just changing from one form to another form.the flame is not destroyed is just that the elements that make up the flame disintegrate and these molecules will continue in the process of changing form.When encountering a similar condition the flame will be formed again.<br><br>Just like oxygen to carbon dioxide and so on and so fornth<br>just like kinetic energry to potential  energry and so on and so fornth(they don't disappear or die off but <span style="color: darkred;">constantly changing from one form to another form</span><br><br><span class="large"><strong>Our mind/consciousness which are formless elements are neither created nor destroyed</strong></span><br><br></div>

That all along is an illusion, and it is because of that illusion, we are being stuck on samara and being reborn in the samsaric planes.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises.

It is very simple, in fact rebirth happens every moment, ever instant, now. Rebirth happens every moment in our life.<br><br>Rebirth is a <strong>nature of Reality</strong> - that everything is in a constant flux, impermanent, without a self. It is impossible to say that Humans reborn, then Gods or Buddhas reincarnate. There is no such thing.

            <div class='col-md body'>Looking with sheer logic, we see that <span style="color: darkred;">functioning phenomena all come from their own continuities</span>, from previous moments of something in the same category of phenomenon. <strong>For example, a physical phenomenon, be it matter or energy, comes from the previous moment of that matter or energy. <span class="large">It is a continuum</span></strong><br><br>Take<strong> anger as an example</strong>. We can talk of the <span style="color: darkred;">physical energy we feel when we are angry, that is one thing</span>. However, consider the mental activity of experiencing anger Â– <span style="color: darkred;">experiencing the arising of the emotion and the conscious or unconscious awareness of it. An individualÂ’s experiencing of anger has its own prior moments of continuity within this lifetime,</span> but where did it come from before that? Either it has to come from the parents, and there seems to be no mechanism to describe how that happens.Actually <span style="color: darkred;">it comes from its own prior moment of continuity</span>. The theory of rebirth explains just this.<br><br>For another example we may try to understand rebirth with the analogy of a movie. Just as a movie is a continuity of the frames of film, <span style="color: darkred;">our mental continuums or mind-streams are continuities of everchanging moments of awareness of phenomena within a lifetime and from one life to the next. There is not a solid, findable, entity, such as "me" or "my mind," that gets reborn</span>. Rebirth <strong><span class="large">IS NOT </span></strong>like the analogy of a little statue sitting on a conveyor belt, going from one life to the next. Rather, it is like a movie, something that is constantly changing. Each frame is different but there is continuity in it. One frame is related to the next. Similarly, there is a constantly changing continuity of moments of awareness of phenomena, even if some of those moments are unconscious. Further, just as all movies are not the same movie, although they are all movies, likewise <span style="color: darkred;">all mental continuums or "minds" are not one mind. There are a countless number of individual streams of continuity of awareness of phenomena. </span><br><br></div>

The conveyor belt represents time and the image it implies is of some solid thing, a fixed personality or soul called "me" passing through time: "Now I am young, now I am old; now I am in this life, now I am in that life." This is not the Buddhist concept of rebirth. Rather, the analogy is like that of a movie. There is a continuity with a movie; the frames form a continuity.<br><br>Neither does Buddhism say that I become you, or that we are all one. If we were all one, and I am you, then if we are both hungry, you can wait in the car white I go to eat. It is not like that. <span style="color: darkred;">We each have our own individual streams of continuity.</span> The sequence in my movie is not going to turn into your movie, but our lives proceed like movies in the sense that they are not concrete and fixed.

The reverse process as described above in the 'visions' is experienced while the most subtle body / mind is connecting to the fertilised egg. With this, contact to a subtle and gross body is established, and gradually the subtle and gross levels of mind will arise as well. If one is attracted to the female, one will be reborn as a male and vice versa.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Ordinarily, it is difficult to remember one's past life.
