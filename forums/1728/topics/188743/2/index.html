            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha asks us not to attach to the five aggregates through which we perceive the world because they induce suffering.  We must think of these aggregates as modes which in Sanskrit is called, skandha.<br><br>The five modes are namely, <strong>appearance, sensation, concepts, impressions</strong>, and <strong>consciousness</strong>.<br><br>According to the Buddha, we take these five modes to be who they really are.  When we do this, consciousness, which is the most subtle mode of all, becomes established as subject &amp; object .  As a result, so to speak, consciousness stores the results of these five modes, including itself, because it is completely mutable.<br><br>Thus, consciousness becomes habituated to cling to the five aggregates which include itself.  When we die, this same consciousness has a propensity to continue the same course of being.<br><br>According to the Buddha, this consciousness is what gets reborn.  It can have an affinity for a particular embryo or many kinds of other forms.  When rebirth happens consciousness then gets interiorized when conception takes place between the egg and the sperm.<br><br>Right now, as you read this, you are such a consciousness which is interiorized in a body existing in five modes.  The Buddha calls our present state of being, in which our previous consciousness has been reborn and interiorized into our present body, "old karma".  The Buddha says this is suffering because we are subsisting on what we truly are not.<br><br>How can we stop becoming reborn into states of being which are suffering?  The Buddha tells us that we must turn our consciousness to that which is unestablished; which is beyond the five modes, this being who we truly are.<br><br>Consciousness which turns to what is unestablished commences in nirvana.  This means that consciousness has nothing objective upon which it might subsist.  Since consciousness is subject &amp; object based, without an object it naturally ceases.  What is thus revealed, as a result of its cessation, is the freedom of oneself as pure mind.  Pure mind is, simply put, spiritual power.  With such power, this is true liberation from any possibility of rebirth.<br></div>

Not the self is better than "no", which is nihilism, annihilationism.<br>like concerned-man said, self is changing all the time, hence it's not the real and unchanging self, hence not self. the real self is the original non-discriminating, non attached, non-labeling ..pure self. 5 year old when one see the gange river and the now when an old man see the gange river, all is changing be it the labelling mind or the river itself. but the original pure seeing itself never change, it's just seeing, without discrimnation. if one can return to that, one's very near enlightenment.<br><br>very complicated, hence Buddha was slience, when ask if there's self or not.<br>just remember, the Buddha rejected both extremes of eternalism and nihilism.<br><br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the Buddhist point of view, the main argument that "establishes" rebirth is one based on a profound understanding, of the continuity of mind. Where does consciousness come from? It cannot arise out of nowhere. A moment of consciousness cannot be produced without the moment of consciousness that immediately preceded it. His Holiness the Dalai Lama explains this complex process in this way<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"The basis on which Buddhists accept the concept of rebirth is principally the continuity of consciousness. Take the material world as an example: all the elements in our present universe, even down to a microscopic level, can be traced back, we believe, to an origin, an initial point where all the elements of the material world are condensed into what are technically known as 'space particles.' These particles, in turn, are the state which is the result of the disintegration of a previous universe. So there is a constant cycle, in which the universe evolves and disintegrates, and then comes back again into being.<br><br>Now mind is very similar. The fact that we possess something called 'mind or consciousness' is quite obvious, since our experience testifies to its presence. Then it is also evident, again from our own experience, that what we call 'mind or consciousness' is something which is subject to change when it is exposed to different conditions and circumstances. This shows us its moment to moment nature, its susceptibility to change.<br><br>Another fact that is obvious is that gross levels of 'mind or consciousness' are, intimately linked, with physiological states of the body, and are, in fact, dependent on them. But there must be some basis, energy, or source, which allows mind, when interacting with material particles, to be capable of producing conscious living beings.<br><br>Just like the material plane, this too must have its continuum in the past. So if you trace our present mind or consciousness back, then you will find that you are tracing the origin of the continuity of mind, just like the origin of the material universe, into an infinite dimension; it is, as you will see, beginningless.<br><br>Therefore there must be successive rebirths that allow that continuum of mind to be there.<br><br>Buddhism believes in universal causation, that everything is subject to change, and to causes and conditions. <span class="large">So there is no place given to a divine creator, nor to beings who are self-created; rather everything arises as a consequence of causes and conditions.</span> So mind, or consciousness, too comes into being as a result of its previous instants.<br><br>When we talk of causes and conditions, there are two principal types: substantial causes, the stuff from which something is produced, and cooperative factors, which contribute towards that causation. In the case of mind and body, although one can affect the other, one cannot become the substance of the other .Â… Mind and matter, although dependent on one another, cannot serve as substantial causes for each other.<br><br>This is the basis on which Buddhism accepts rebirth." </span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddha rejected the 2 extremes of <strong>'Permanent Self'</strong>, and<strong> 'Annihilation' </strong>concepts.<br><br>A person, or Body &amp; Mind, is but Five Aggregates (body, feeling, perception, thought formation, and consciousness) of CLINGING (to 'self', or a self-image hologram). In reality, there is not a true permanent 'self' entity. Clinging to the 'self' concept is the root of suffering, as it creates an impulse to condition that life to roll on and on, with the craving force of greed, hatred, and delusion. This results in pleasure, and pain, towards this illusive 'self' entity, as my pleasure (happiness), and my pain (suffering). Can such pleasure or pain truly be owned and labeled as yours or mine?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Suppose a person is about to die. This critical stage may be compared to the flickering of a lamp just before it is extinguished.<br><br>To this dying man is presented by<strong> a Kamma, a Kamma Nimitta, or Gati Nimitta</strong>.<br><br>By Kamma is here meant some good or bad action committed during his lifetime, or immediately before his dying moment. Kamma Nimitta, or symbol, means a mental reproduction of any sight, sound, smell, taste, touch or idea which dominated at the time of the commission of some salient activity, good or bad, - such as a vision of knives or dying animals, in the case of a butcher, patients, in the case of a kind physician: an object of worship, in the case of a devotee and so forth.<br><br>By Gati Nimitta, or "symbol of destiny" is a meant some sign of the place where he is to take rebirth. Such a symbol frequently presents itself to dying persons and stamps its gladness or gloom upon their features. When these indications of the future birth occur, and if they are bad, they might at times be remedied. This is done by influencing the thoughts of the dying man. Such premonitory visions of destiny may be fire, forests, mountainous regions, a mother's womb,  etc.<br><br>Death according to Buddhism is the <strong>cessation of the psycho-physical life of any one individual existence.</strong> It takes place by the passing away of vitality (ayu), i.e. psychic and physical life (jivitindriya), heat (usma) and consciousness (vinnana).<br><br>Death is not the complete annihilation of a being, for though the particular life-span ended, the <strong>force which hitherto actuated it is not destroyed</strong>.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Just as an electric light is the outward visible manifestations of invisible electric energy, even so we are the outward manifestations of invisible Kammic energy. The bulb may break, and the light may be extinguished, but the current remains and the light may be reproduced in another bulb. In the same way, the Kammic force remains undisturbed by the disintegration of the physical body, and the passing away of the present consciousness leads to the arising of a fresh one in another birth. But nothing unchangeable or permanent "passes" from the present to the future. </span></span><br><br><img src="http://bulbs.2yr.net/images/187w-gem-bulb.jpg"><br><br><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">Just as the wheel rests on the ground only at one point even so, strictly speaking, we live only from one thought-moment. We are always in the present, and that present is ever slipping into the irrevocable past. Each momentary consciousness of this ever-changing life-process, on passing away, transmits its whole energy, all the indelibly recorded impressions, to its successor. Every fresh energy consciousness therefore consists of the potentialities of its predecessors and something more. At, death, the consciousness perishes, as truly is does every moment, only to give birth to another in a rebirth. This renewed consciousness inherits all the past experiences. As all impressions are indelibly recorded in the ever-changing palimpsest-like mind and as all potentialities are transmitted from life to life, irrespective of temporary physical disintegrations, reminiscence of past births or past incidents becomes a possibility. If memory depends solely on brain cells, it becomes an impossibility.<br><br>The continuity of the flux, at death, is unbroken in point of time, and there is no breach in the stream of consciousness. The only different between the passing of one thought to another in lifetime and of the dying thought-moment to the rebirth consciousness, is that in the latter case a marked perceptible physical death is patent to all. </span></span><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On the very night of His Enlightenment, during the first watch, the Buddha developed retrocognitive knowledge which enable Him to read His past lives.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">"I recalled, "He declares, "my varied lot in former existences as follows: first one life, the two lives, then three, four, five, ten twenty to fifty lives; then a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, and so forth." </span></span><br><br>During the second watch the Buddha, with clairvoyant vision, perceived beings disappearing from one state of existence and reappearing in another.
