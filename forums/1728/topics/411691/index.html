              <div>Conducted personally by Healing Lama H.E. Kangyur Rinpoche</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>The great master Chandrakirti says that Naga beings are born out of karma that practises unethical generosity. Nagas in a way, behave just like human beings. There are good and bad people, just as there are good and bad Nagas. When you treat them kindly, they will reciprocate with kindness. However when offended, Nagas naturally become very bitter and angry and are likely to cause us much unhappiness and obstacles in our daily lives. We may experience a lot of unhappiness in the family or interpersonal relationships, nothing seems to be going smoothly, or might also suffer from skin-related diseases which doctor/medicine is unable to help. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>These problems stem from the wrath of the Nagas we have offended, and the only way to appease them would be to participate in such Peace pujas. Participating in such Naga pujas will make offerings and hence please the formless Nagas in our surroundings. When they rejoice, these Nagas may even lend us their assistance and help us in our daily activities. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Healing Lama H.E. Kangyur Rinpoche explained in his previous trips that most sources of cancer come about due to Naga harassments and obstacles. Hence, Rinpoche has advised that it is best to participate in Naga pujas regularly to prevent such predicaments from befalling us.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Rinpoche also specially pointed out that, should cancer patients experience re-growth of new tumors each time they have removed one, then this is a likely sign that this cancer disease has been caused by Naga attack. The only expedient way to pacify the Naga is through performance of Naga Pujas. There has been a few accounts where Dro-Phen Ling had conducted Naga Pujas and tumors of the cancer patients had miraculously disappeared; these are certainly living proofs which manifests the truth in Rinpoche’s words and advice. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>According to Buddhist Tantric practice, there are many ways of performing rituals, namely: peaceful, increasing, forceful and wrathful. The Naga Puja employs the peaceful method where the Lama offers tormas to the nagas. Tormas are conical-shaped ritual cakes which are blessed in three ways: (1) by mantras, thereby purifying them from any defilements of ordinariness; (2) by meditational stabilization, whereby infinite tormas are generated; and finally (3) by gestures or mudras, which ensures that the recipient is satisfied with the ritual cakes. Through this ritual, one can prevent or be relieved from the negative energies sent forth by nagas. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><em>Note:</em><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"><em> </em></span><em>Participants must attend the puja personally for it to be effective. There are specific items required for participation of this puja, please kindly invite it at a suggested offering of $10 per set at the puja event. </em></div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><strong>DO YOU KNOW?</strong></div>
              <div>Nagas are believed to reside in places like small ponds or tree groves. They sometimes appear in the form of snakes, or as half-snakes half-humans with elaborate jeweled crowns. Unauthorized use of land (that the naga occupies) is believed to be stealing their personal possessions. They highly cherish their clean environment; when it is exploited or disturbed, the naga will strike back at the offenders by inflicting disease, sudden catastrophe or even death. However, as they may not be able to identify the actual offenders, hence, they may simply strike at any human being they see, and these innocent people may fall ill for no apparent reason.</div>
