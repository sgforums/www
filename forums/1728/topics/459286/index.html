              <p>(Zen Master Dae Kwan, Zen Master Dae Kwang, and translator)<img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img69/7894/p1000018small.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The other day, I asked Emanrohe about the 'talk by zen master dae kwang'. That's strange, I don't know who zen master dae kwang is but his name pops up in mind and i just typed it out, later I re-checked, the website says its zen master dae bong's talk. So I sent a second sms and told him my error, it's actually zen master dae bong's talk.</p>
              <p>But anyway, today it turns out zen master dae kwang was indeed giving a speech.</p>
              <p>Halfway through, the thunder started to sound.. Someone asked a question, he said "can you hear the thunder?" *thunder claps* "that is it! that is the answer from Buddha (laughter)" And five more questions came - what is enlightened person, who can become enlightened, how to practice and become enlightened, all dharmas return to one one returns to what?, etc.</p>
              <p>And his answer to each question was, "did you hear the thunder?"</p>
              <p>Then it started to rain, it got so loud that he stopped speaking and we just sat there. The rain itself becomes the dharma talk... so everyone sat there in meditation... the zen master sat very still. Just the sound of dripping rain filling the whole universe... the sound enjoying and hearing itself... that's Buddha, clear and blissful.</p>
              <p>Then after 20 minutes he began to speak. He said you don't need to remember anything I said... the rain is the best dharma talk. So the talk ended, 15 minutes early.</p>
              <p>It was still raining and I got a chance to chat with him a little.</p>
              <p>I told him two years ago, I was contemplating on the Bahiya Sutta and that led to an awakening - in the seen, there is just the seen, in the heard there is just the heard, in the cognized just the cognized. When for you, Bahiya, there is in the seen just the seen, in the heard just the heard, in the cognized just the cognized, there is no you in terms of that, no you in there, no you here, and no you in-between. Just that is the end of suffering. Then I realized, oh, this entire notion of a self, a seer that is seeing the seen is entirely illusory! There is in seeing just the seen, seeing IS the seen only. No subject and object, inside or outside.</p>
              <p>He smiled and said "Precisely! That's why I asked - did you hear the thunder?"</p>
              <p>I said, "But I still have discursive thoughts sometimes, I feel my practice is still lacking. What do you say about it?"</p>
              <p>He said thoughts are not a problem, it's the natural functioning of the mind - Buddha's sutras all came from his thinking. Just don't be attached to thoughts, that's all.</p>
              <p>I asked him a few more questions... like, how long do you advise people to do meditation everyday?</p>
              <p>He said 24 hours.</p>
              <p>I asked, what about sitting meditation?</p>
              <p>He said maybe 20 minutes in the morning, then the rest of the day also Just Do It.</p>
              <p>I say in acting 100% action, no you remaining. He agreed and said no you practicing either. No inside, no outside, just do it.</p>
              <p>I thanked him, bowed and left.</p>

              <p>Sure, but do you mean to say that the actualization didn't come from Buddha's thinking?</p>
              <p>For example, I think Loppon Namdrol says no, Buddha doesn't think. This Zen master seems to say yes.</p>

              <p>Actually this is not just seeing one sense door, but seeing through the false view of reality (through a self) and the accurate view of reality - in seeing just the seen, in hearing just the heard, in cognizing just the cognized.</p>
              <p>All sense doors including thoughts are one taste in this recognition, and the sense of self is dropped. Perception dropped, mind/body dropped, divisions of sense doors are dropped. There is no doubt about this, whenever and wherever is.</p>

              <p>From "What The Buddha Taught" by Walpola Rahula (great book, highly recommended):</p>
              <p>"Mindfulness, or awareness, does not mean that you should think and be 
              conscious 'I am doing this' or 'I am doing that.' No. Just the contrary.
               The moment you think, 'I am doing this,' you become self-conscious, and
               then you do not live in the action, but you live in the idea 'I am,' 
              and consequently your work too is spoiled.</p>
              <p>"You should forget 
              yourself completely, and lose yourself in what you do. The moment a 
              speaker becomes self-conscious and thinks 'I am addressing an audience,'
               his speech is disturbed and his trend of thought broken. But when he 
              forgets himself in his speech, in his subject, then he is at his best, 
              he speaks well and explains things clearly.</p>
              <p>All great work -- 
              artistic, poetic, intellectual or spiritual -- is produced at those 
              moments when its creators are lost completely in their actions, when 
              they forget themselves altogether, and are free from self-consciousness.</p>
              <p>This mindfulness or awareness with regard to our activities, taught by the Buddha, is to live in the present moment, to live in the present action (this is also the Zen way which is based primarily on this teaching.) Here in this form of meditation, you haven't got to perform any particular action in order to develop mindfulness, but you have only to be mindful and aware of whatever you may do. You haven't got to spend one second of your precious time on this particular 'meditation': you have only to cultivate mindfulness and awareness always, day and night, with regard to all activities in your usual daily life. These two forms of 'meditation' discussed above are connected with our body."</p>

No. Just the contrary. The moment you think, 'I am doing this,' you become self-conscious, and then you do not live in the action, but you live in the idea 'I am,' and consequently your work too is spoiled.<br>"You should forget yourself completely, and lose yourself in what you do. The moment a speaker becomes self-conscious and thinks 'I am addressing an audience,' his speech is disturbed and his trend of thought broken. But when he forgets himself in his speech, in his subject, then he is at his best, he speaks well and explains things clearly.<br>All great work -- artistic, poetic, intellectual or spiritual -- is produced at those moments when its creators are lost completely in their actions, when they forget themselves altogether, and are free from self-consciousness.<br>10/20/2012 11:27 AM: Thusness: All past/present/future tendencies, ignorance, wisdom is in this one thought...<br>10/20/2012 11:30 AM: AEN: This mindfulness or awareness with regard to our activities, taught by the Buddha, is to live in the present moment, to live in the present action (this is also the Zen way which is based primarily on this teaching.) Here in this form of meditation, you haven't got to perform any particular action in order to develop mindfulness, but you have only to be mindful and aware of whatever you may do. You haven't got to spend one second of your precious time on this particular 'meditation': you have only to cultivate mindfulness and awareness always, day and night, with regard to all activities in your usual daily life. These two forms of 'meditation' discussed above are connected with our body."<br>10/20/2012 11:30 AM: Thusness: Yes...and insight of anatta opens the gate.<br>10/20/2012 11:32 AM: AEN: Ic..<br>10/20/2012 11:33 AM: AEN: Delma tells me today her total exertion has stabilized<br>10/20/2012 11:34 AM: AEN: "Interesting times. Nondual is becoming more and more stable. I don't understand it, but just reading your material and deeply contemplating it seems to have tremendous affect. Yesterday while driving home from work and walking to my house, there was just walking, just driving. This was is what is becoming more and more sustained. <br><br>I do follow your advice and follow the breath without counting. Then there is only breath. It's more effortless these days. So, thank you.<br>10/20/2012 11:34 AM: AEN: luminosity, but not awareness as a thing or entity. just the senses, experienced as independent streams. It's the walking experience which seems different and sustained. No one is walking. At first this would be experienced with a bit of effort, but it's becoming more natural and the feeling of it always having been this way is there.<br>10/20/2012 11:34 AM: AEN: "<br>10/20/2012 11:38 AM: Thusness: Quite good</p>
              <p>10/20/2012 11:51 AM: Thusness: When the gap between actor and action is refined till none, that is non-action and that non-action is total action. Whether this total action is understood as the natural way will depend on whether the insight of anatta has arisen. Anatta is the insight that allows the practitioner to see clearly that this has always been the case.</p>

              <p>(Zen Master Dae Kwan, Zen Master Dae Kwang, and
              translator)<img src="http://imageshack.us/a/img69/7894/p1000018small.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p>The other day, I asked Emanrohe about the 'talk by zen master
              dae kwang'. That's strange, I don't know who zen master dae kwang
              is but his name pops up in mind and i just typed it out, later I
              re-checked, the website says its zen master dae bong's talk. So I
              sent a second sms and told him my error, it's actually zen master
              dae bong's talk.</p>
              <p>But anyway, today it turns out zen master dae kwang was indeed
              giving a speech.</p>
              <p>Halfway through, the thunder started to sound.. Someone asked a
              question, he said "can you hear the thunder?" *thunder claps* "that
              is it! that is the answer from Buddha (laughter)" And five more
              questions came - what is enlightened person, who can become
              enlightened, how to practice and become enlightened, all dharmas
              return to one one returns to what?, etc.</p>
              <p>And his answer to each question was, "did you hear the
              thunder?"</p>
              <p>Then it started to rain, it got so loud that he stopped speaking
              and we just sat there. The rain itself becomes the dharma talk...
              so everyone sat there in meditation... the zen master sat very
              still. Just the sound of dripping rain filling the whole
              universe... the sound enjoying and hearing itself... that's Buddha,
              clear and blissful.</p>
              <p>Then after 20 minutes he began to speak. He said you don't need
              to remember anything I said... the rain is the best dharma talk. So
              the talk ended, 15 minutes early.</p>
              <p>It was still raining and I got a chance to chat with him a
              little.</p>
              <p>I told him two years ago, I was contemplating on the Bahiya
              Sutta and that led to an awakening - in the seen, there is just the
              seen, in the heard there is just the heard, in the cognized just
              the cognized. When for you, Bahiya, there is in the seen just the
              seen, in the heard just the heard, in the cognized just the
              cognized, there is no you in terms of that, no you in there, no you
              here, and no you in-between. Just that is the end of suffering.
              Then I realized, oh, this entire notion of a self, a seer that is
              seeing the seen is entirely illusory! There is in seeing just the
              seen, seeing IS the seen only. No subject and object, inside or
              outside.</p>
              <p>He smiled and said "Precisely! That's why I asked - did you hear
              the thunder?"</p>
              <p>I said, "But I still have discursive thoughts sometimes, I feel
              my practice is still lacking. What do you say about it?"</p>
              <p>He said thoughts are not a problem, it's the natural functioning
              of the mind - Buddha's sutras all came from his thinking. Just
              don't be attached to thoughts, that's all.</p>
              <p>I asked him a few more questions... like, how long do you advise
              people to do meditation everyday?</p>
              <p>He said 24 hours.</p>
              <p>I asked, what about sitting meditation?</p>
              <p>He said maybe 20 minutes in the morning, then the rest of the
              day also Just Do It.</p>
              <p>I say in acting 100% action, no you remaining. He agreed and
              said no you practicing either. No inside, no outside, just do
              it.</p>
              <p>I thanked him, bowed and left.</p>

              <p>This morning before I woke up, I dreamt of going to the new zen center Kwan Yin Chan Lin, <span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]." class="UFICommentBody"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[0]"> I dreamt of going to the new zen center Kwan Yin Chan Lin, when I woke 
              up I was suddenly reminded about visiting KYCL (I probably would have 
              forgotten otherwise) and realized today is a good time to visit that 
              place as it is Saturday and they have activities on Saturday. I have 
              never visited it before previously (the dharma talks I attended 
              previously were held in a tent).</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[1]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[2]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]">When
               I visited that place, they told me today is the first out of the 6 
              lessons in the meditation course. We sat in meditation for like half an 
              hour? Then it was followed by a dharma talk... and surprise!</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[4]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[5]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[6]">Zen
               Master Dae Kwang was the one giving the talk. (I was wrong, he didn't 
              go back to America after all, he is staying in Singapore for some time)</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[7]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[8]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[9]">That
               place is a cool and nice environment: simple, clean design, very zen. 
              Incidentally I once had this thought in the past, how would I like to 
              design the place if I ever were to build a meditation center myself?  
              Kwan Yin Chan Lin was exactly what I had in mind - a very clean, 
              spacious, uncluttered, simple design.</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[10]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[11]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[12]">Anyway,
               Zen Master Dae Kwang was giving a talk about meditation and zen, he 
              gives us tips about practice and meditation. His talk was also about 
              clear mind - being fully present and letting go the thoughts (but not 
              fighting them), then seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and 
              even thinking becomes very clear. Clear mind is your buddha nature, what
               is already intrinsic and complete in everyone, so we are not trying to 
              attain anything at all. As he says: in our practice and meditation, we 
              will NOT attain anything!</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[13]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[14]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[15]">It was a nice talk.</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[16]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[17]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[18]">The
               funny thing is, the ending words in the talk was the same as it was in 
              my dream - something about the teachings being about your direct 
              experience and not some (intellectual) understanding. That was followed 
              by the nun coming and commencing the vow recitation. Just the same scene
               as what I saw in my dream! Hahaha...</span><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[19]"><br id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[20]"><span id=".reactRoot[5].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373315376085772}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[21]">I told Thusness immediately after that, his comment was "auspicious karmic connection".</span></span></span></p>

               James, I think after realizing anatta, the super-clarity of mindfulness
               becomes sort of effortless and uncontrived. Pure natural aliveness and 
              crystal clarity in all six senses. Isn't it the case for you? So any 
              kind of contrivance becomes counterpr</span></span><span id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]"><span id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]."><span id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[0]">oductive.
               But if you try to practice mindfulness before penetrating no-self, it 
              is quite effortful to maintain. This is because clarity is intrinsic to 
              mind/experience rather than being produced, only the sense of self is 
              'obscuring'.</span><br id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[1]"><br id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[2]"><span id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[3]">Also
               the non-action that Thusness said is not merely 'no doer, everything 
              just happening, just being done' but total involvement, total action, 
              entire being is just action, so intention and effort is fully exterted 
              to do what is being done. It is not a contrived effort like "trying to 
              maintain a witness of what is being done", no. No contrived mindfulness 
              is involved. I'm talking about full exertion in just doing that activity
               like the whole being, whole universe is fully exerting as the action, 
              eating the apple, cleaning the stain off the toilet. Intention is fully 
              included/involved in that moment, rather than dissociated/a kind of "let
               things happen on their own".</span><br id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[4]"><br id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[5]"><span id=".reactRoot[199].[1][2][1]{comment373163899434253_373559929394650}..[1]..[1]..[0].[0][2]..[3]..[6]">Whole

              Unlike things and their reflections in the mirror, and unlike the moon

               there is total action, that is also non action because there is no
