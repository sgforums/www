              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: normal;">Buddhism is
                  not a religion, (even though it is considered as a minority religion in India)
                  because it does not worship to Gautama or any other Awakened One (Buddha).
                  Buddhism is an Ethical Way that seeks the purification of mind, ideas and
                  society. The Buddha-Dharma-Sangha is an Integrative and Reconciler
                  Spirituality, being a revolutionary movement made up of an articulation of
                  Metapsychology, Metaphi-losophy and Metapolitics. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 9.35pt; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;"> <br> To completely understand Buddhist Spirituality one must study all of its main
                  Schools, by understanding the Perennial Way that underlies all of them. <br> <br> The Monk and the Layman are spiritually equal. There are only differences
                  between the three spiritual degrees: Apprentices, Teachers and Masters. <br> <br> The Free Being (Arhat) and the Enlightened Being (Bodhisattva) are synonymous,
                  being merely different terms for the same mental state. Freedom is not only
                  personal enlightenment but also the pursuit of the Liberation of the fellow
                  beings. The synthesis of the Arhat and the Bodhisattva is the basis of the
                  unity between the Hinayana and the Mahayana. <br> <br> Thousands of Awakened Ones (Buddhas) have been existed and they will continue
                  to exist. But the main Holy Trinity of Buddha is made by the meeting of the
                  Analytic-Existential-Libertarian Discourse, which is the Spirituality of Maitriyana
                  where one may distinguish three types of Self-Awakening (Samyaksambuddhahood):
                  more wisely (prajñadhika-buddha), with more effort (viryadhika-buddha) and with
                  more faith (sraddhadhika-buddha). <br> <br> There are two types of mystic initiation by which every human being can become
                  an Awakened One (Buddha): the vehicle of the Awakened Apprentice
                  (Sravakabuddha-yana) and the vehicle of the Self-Awakened One
                  (Samyaksambuddhayana). The first possibility is the traditional Way of Lineage,
                  which is the study and transmission with a spiritual master (Arhat or
                  Bodhisattvas); the second possibility is the Self-Enlighten (Sammasambodhi),
                  which was the Way of Gautama and other great spiritual masters founders of
                  Schools. <br> <br> To completely understand Buddhist Spirituality one must study all Spiritualties
                  of the World, and how Buddhism has influenced them. Buddhism has historically
                  maintained a dialogue with movements like Vedanta, Yoga, Shamanism, Taoism,
                  Confucianism, Greek Philosophy, Christianity, Judaism and Islam. The result of
                  this dialogue has been the creation of various other Schools such as
                  Madhyamika, Yogacara, Vajrayana, Chan (Zen), Pure Land, Nichiren, Pyrrhonism,
                  Therapeutae (Essene) and Sufism. <br> <br> The highest expression of Spirituality in the West happened with the appearance
                  of three main developments: Psychoanalysis, Existentialism and Socialism. The
                  reunion of Buddhism with these disciplines is the revolutionary basis of
                  Maitriyana as the vehicle (yana) of Universal Spirituality. <br> <br> Buddhism must maintain a profound relationship with Western science, especially
                  with Relativism and the quantum theory. This will not only enrich the pursuit
                  of Truth, but also it will help to flourish and strengthen the meditative
                  science. <br> <br> Technological development is not Real Evolution. The True Evolution of Humanity
                  can only proceed through the Spiritual Evolution of consciousness, transforming
                  the mind and society through pacifism, social justice, wisdom and ecology.
                  These are the four pillars of the cure for the ills of the world which are war,
                  poverty, ignorance and pollution. Only Spirituality can save the World, guiding
                  the peoples towards the Awakening and Liberation. <br> <br> In Buddhism, there is no savior. There's no one who's going to do it for us, no
                  place can we hide out for safety. We have to face reality squarely, and we have
                  to do it alone. Even when Buddhists take refuge in the Buddha, what they're
                  really taking refuge in is the truth that there's no refuge. Not seeking
                  protection is the only real protection. <br> <br> So that's the bad news — we have to do it alone. The good news is, we can do
                  it. As human beings, we have the resources we need: intelligence, strength,
                  loving hearts, and proven, effective methods. Because of that, we can rouse our
                  confidence and renounce our depression and resentment. <br> <br> But while no one can do that for us, help and guidance is available. There are
                  teachers — women and men who are further along the path — who offer us
                  instruction and inspiration. They prove to us it can be done. Our fellow
                  practitioners support our path, while never allowing us to use them as
                  crutches. The Buddhist teachings offer us wisdom that goes back 2,600 years to
                  the Buddha himself. We can go right to the source, because the lineage that
                  started with Gautama Buddha is unbroken to this day. <br> <br> Buddhism exists to address one problem: suffering. The Buddha called the truth
                  of suffering "noble," because recognizing our suffering is the
                  starting place and inspiration of the spiritual path. <br> <br> His second noble truth was the cause of suffering. In the West, Buddhists call
                  this "ego." It's a small word that encompasses pretty much everything
                  that's wrong with the world. Because according to the Buddha, all suffering,
                  large and small, starts with our false belief in a solid, separate, and continuous
                  "I," whose survival we devote our lives to. <br> <br> It feels like we're hopelessly caught in this bad dream of "me and
                  them" we've created, but we can wake up from it. This is the third noble
                  truth, the cessation of suffering. We do this by recognizing our ignorance, the
                  falseness of our belief in this "I." Finally, the Buddha told us that
                  there is a concrete way we can get there, which basically consists of
                  discipline, effort, meditation, and wisdom. This is the fourth noble truth, the
                  truth of the path. <br> <br> 4. The way to do that is by working with your mind. <br> <br> So, according to the Buddha, the problem is suffering, the cause is ignorance,
                  the remedy is waking up, and the path is living mindfully, meditating, and
                  cultivating our wisdom. There's really only one place all that happens: in our
                  minds. The mind is the source of both our suffering and our joy. Meditation —
                  taming the mind — is what gets us from one to the other. Meditation is
                  Buddhism's basic remedy for the human condition, and its special genius. <br> <br> The Buddhist path of meditation begins with practices to calm our wild mind.
                  Once the mind is focused enough to look undistractedly into reality, we develop
                  insight into the nature of our experience, which is marked by impermanence,
                  suffering, nonego, and emptiness. We naturally develop compassion for ourselves
                  and all beings who suffer, and our insight allows us to help them skillfully.
                  Finally, we experience ourselves and our world for what they have been since
                  beginning less time, are right now, and always will be — nothing but
                  enlightenment itself, great perfection in every way.</span></p>
