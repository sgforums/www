For example if a country ordered that Buddhism be elininated. What should Buddhists do? Such incident took place in China thrice. Look at the history, did any Buddhists be it Ordain and Lay, rebelled or retaliate ? Nope! Why? Buddhists abide by the Vinaya. Forever no hatred to the country. This is truly protecting the Dharma. Why/how? Let the World's people see that Buddhist is the tolerant/wholesome residents. Will the next governor want Buddhism to recover. YES! But if the Buddhists retaliate and treat it with illwill. And other countries see this. It will leave a bad impression. And criticize Buddhism and forever reject Buddhism. For that you truely eliminate Buddhism. So how Buddhism flourish depend on how Buddhists uphold the Vinaya. If Vinaya ends, Buddhism ends.<br>when the communists soldiers beat Grand Master Xu Yun(Empty cloud), He also didn't retaliate.  the communists soldiers beat once, beat twice, third time round, can't bear to beat any more. as the heart will start to forgive, as ren2 xing1 ben3 san4(the original mind is rooted to be kind).<br>and also the depts of countless previous lifes are yi bi kou xiao.<br><br>This ying1 guo3(cause and effect) idea is very profound in vinaya/precept/jie4.<br><br>/\<br><br></div>
