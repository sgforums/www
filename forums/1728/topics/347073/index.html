              <h1>Genjo Koan: Actualizing the Fundamental Point</h1>
              <p class="OPEN">by Eihei Dogen</p>
              <p class="OPEN">As all things are buddha-dharma, there is
              delusion and realization, practice, and birth
              and death, and there are buddhas and sentient beings.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">As the myriad things are without an abiding self, there
              is no delusion, no realization, no buddha, no sentient
              being, no birth and death.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">The buddha way is, basically, leaping clear of the many
              and the one; thus there are birth and death, delusion and
              realization, sentient beings and buddhas.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Yet in attachment blossoms fall, and in aversion weeds
              spread.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">To carry yourself forward and experience myriad things
              is delusion. That myriad things come forth and
              experience themselves is awakening.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Those who have great realization of delusion are
              buddhas; those who are greatly deluded about realization
              are sentient beings. Further, there are those who
              continue realizing beyond realization, who are in
              delusion throughout delusion.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">When buddhas are truly buddhas they do not necessarily
              notice that they are buddhas. However, they are
              actualized buddhas, who go on actualizing buddhas.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">When you see forms or hear sounds fully engaging
              body-and-mind, you grasp things directly. Unlike things
              and their reflections in the mirror, and unlike the moon
              and its reflection in the water, when one side is
              illumined the other side is dark.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">To study the buddha way is to study the self. To study
              the self is to forget the self. To forget the self is to
              be actualized by myriad things. When actualized by
              myriad things, your body and mind as well as the bodies
              and minds of others drop away. No trace of realization
              remains, and this no-trace continues endlessly.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">When you first seek dharma, you imagine you are far away
              from its environs. But dharma is already correctly
              transmitted; you are immediately your original self.
              When you ride in a boat and watch the shore, you might
              assume that the shore is moving. But when you keep your
              eyes closely on the boat, you can see that the boat
              moves. Similarly, if you examine myriad things with a
              confused body and mind you might suppose that your mind
              and nature are permanent. When you practice intimately
              and return to where you are, it will be clear that
              nothing at all has unchanging self.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Firewood becomes ash, and it does not become firewood
              again. Yet, do not suppose that the ash is future and
              the firewood past. You should understand that firewood
              abides in the phenomenal expression of firewood, which
              fully includes past and future and is independent of
              past and future. Ash abides in the phenomenal expression
              of ash, which fully includes future and past. Just as
              firewood does not become firewood again after it is ash,
              you do not return to birth after death.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">This being so, it is an established way in buddha-dharma
              to deny that birth turns into death. Accordingly, birth
              is understood as no-birth. It is an unshakable teaching
              in Buddha's discourse that death does not turn into
              birth. Accordingly, death is understood as no-death.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Birth is an expression complete this moment. Death is an
              expression complete this moment. They are like winter
              and spring. You do not call winter the beginning of
              spring, nor summer the end of spring.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water.
              The moon does not get wet, nor is the water broken.
              Although its light is wide and great, the moon is
              reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. The whole moon
              and the entire sky are reflected in dewdrops on the
              grass, or even in one drop of water.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Enlightenment does not divide you, just as the moon does
              not break the water. You cannot hinder enlightenment,
              just as a drop of water does not hinder the moon in the
              sky.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">The depth of the drop is the height of the moon. Each
              reflection, however long of short its duration,
              manifests the vastness of the dewdrop, and realizes the
              limitlessness of the moonlight in the sky.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">When dharma does not fill your whole body and mind, you
              think it is already sufficient. When dharma fills your
              body and mind, you understand that something is missing.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">For example, when you sail out in a boat to the middle
              of an ocean where no land is in sight, and view the four
              directions, the ocean looks circular, and does not look
              any other way. But the ocean is neither round or square;
              its features are infinite in variety. It is like a
              palace. It is like a jewel. It only look circular as far
              as you can see at that time. All things are like this.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Though there are many features in the dusty world and
              the world beyond conditions, you see and understand only
              what your eye of practice can reach. In order to learn
              the nature of the myriad things, you must know that
              although they may look round or square, the other
              features of oceans and mountains are infinite in
              variety; whole worlds are there. It is so not only
              around you, but also directly beneath your feet, or in a
              drop of water.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">A fish swims in the ocean, and no matter how far it
              swims there is no end to the water. A bird flies in the
              sky, and no matter how far it flies there is no end to
              the air. However, the fish and the bird have never left
              their elements. When their activity is large their field
              is large. When their need is small their field is small.
              Thus, each of them totally covers its full range, and
              each of them totally experiences its realm. If the bird
              leaves the air it will die at once. If the fish leaves
              the water it will die at once.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Know that water is life and air is life. The bird is
              life and the fish is life. Life must be the bird and
              life must be the fish.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">It is possible to illustrate this with more analogies.
              Practice, enlightenment, and people are like this.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Now if a bird or a fish tries to reach the end of its
              element before moving in it, this bird or this fish will
              not find its way or its place. When you find your place
              where you are, practice occurs, actualizing the
              fundamental point. When you find you way at this moment,
              practice occurs, actualizing the fundamental point; for
              the place, the way, is neither large nor small, neither
              yours nor others'. The place, the way, has not carried
              over from the past and it is not merely arising now.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Accordingly, in the practice-enlightenment of the buddha
              way, meeting one thing is mastering it--doing one
              practice is practicing completely. Here is the place;
              here the way unfolds. The boundary of realization is not
              distinct, for the realization comes forth simultaneously
              with the mastery of buddha-dharma.</p>
              <p class="OPEN">Do not suppose that what you realize becomes your
              knowledge and is grasped by your consciousness. Although
              actualized immediately, the inconceivable may not be
              apparent. Its appearance is beyond your knowledge. Zen
              master Baoche of Mt. Mayu was fanning himself. A monk
              approached and said, "Master, the nature of wind is
              permanent and there is no place it does not reach. When,
              then, do you fan yourself?"</p>
              <p class="OPEN">"Although you understand that the nature of the wind is
              permanent," Baoche replied, "you do not understand the
              meaning of its reaching everywhere."</p>
              <p class="OPEN">"What is the meaning of its reaching everywhere?" asked
              the monk again. The master just kept fanning himself.
              The monk bowed deeply.</p>
              <p>The actualization of the buddha-dharma, the vital path
              of its correct transmission, is like this. If you say
              that you do not need to fan yourself because the nature
              of wind is permanent and you can have wind without
              fanning, you will understand neither permanence nor the
              nature of wind. The nature of wind is permanent; because
              of that, the wind of the buddha's house brings forth the
              gold of the earth and makes fragrant the cream of the
              long river.</p>
