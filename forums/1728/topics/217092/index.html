            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding Guan Yin:<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=214825&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">What are your doubts on Buddhism</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually Buddhists do not worship the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, much less any worldly deities who have not transcended samsara nor freed from the three poisons of Greed, Hatred, Ignorance. These worldly deities are often not found in Buddhism but rather in folk beliefs. There are 'celestial beings' in Buddhism, although we do not worship them. Many of them are Dharma Protectors (they protect the teachings of Buddhism), therefore we do pay our respects as such, although we do not worship them. Many celestial beings have also taken refuge in the Three Treasures. Anyway true buddhists do not pracitse 'mi2 xing4 bai4 bai4', we 'li3 bai4', pay reverence, respect, homage.<br><br>Furthermore, to be a true Buddhist, one has to take refuge in the Three Treasures. The Three Treasures are: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The Dharma is the Teachings/Truths that the Buddha taught. The Sangha is the monastic community in Buddhism.<br><br>Many people in Singapore who claim to be Buddhist are so called 'IC-Buddhist' and are not really Buddhists. Although they claim to be Buddhist they know not the teachings of Buddhism, and neither do they practise them. What they practise is a form of folk tradition that are practised since our ancestors, they are not the dharma teachings of the Buddha. To be a 'true Buddhist', one must take refuge in the Three Treasures, learn and practise the Dharma.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">By the way, Guan Yin is from Buddhism. It just happens that it becomes extremely popular in China that the figure has become idolised and worshipped. Guan Yin originates from Buddhism, and is a role model Great Bodhisattva symoblising great compassion. Buddhists should therefore learn from this Great Bodhisattva and cultivate the Bodhisattva ways. There are many other famous Bodhisattvas - i.e Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa (the great Bodhisattva who vows to save sentient beings in hell), Wen Shu Shi Li Pu Sa (the Bodhisattva known for his Great Wisdm), and many many other famous ones. A Bodhisattva is one who not only seeks his own liberation/Nirvana but also vows to save/liberate sentient beings from the world of sufferings (samsara), and thereby walking the path towards perfect Buddhahood. All sentient beings have inherent Buddha Nature, and as a Buddhist we seek to awaken our Buddha Nature, practise the Bodhisattva way and eventually attain Buddhahood ourselves. The Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (i.e Guan Shi Yin Pu Sa) is also known to be able to perceive the voices and sounds of the entire universe and help emancipate sentient beings' sufferings.</span></div></blockquote></div>

Therefore we should not be superstitious over such things.<br><br>As for your second part... such charm did not originate from Buddhism.<br><br>See: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=201224" rel="nofollow">Amulets &amp; Pendants r superstitious NOT true teaching Buddha</a> by our moderator Neutral_Onliner some months back<br><br>It is their local tradition, belief in such stuff... there is no basis for such things in Buddhism and is rejected by Buddha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nevertheless if you read Lotus Sutra 25 you will know that Avalokitesvara out of his great compassion is able to save beings in distress and need of help... cars are miraculously turned over (i've heard lots of such instances including from my relative) when they almost died from accidents, their car can just turn 360 degrees and completely avoid the disaster. This is just an example. Lots of other life saving miracles. see chapter 25: <a href="http://www.kalavinka.org/jewels/shakmuni/pumen01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kalavinka.org/jewels/shakmuni/pumen01.htm</a> So Mahayana Buddhism particularly Lotus Sutra has more teachings on aspects of Buddhism that may require faith, otherwise its hard to believe...<br><br>But there are also lots of parts of Lotus Sutra that are metaphorical, with deep meanings in it. For example I once asked how can Lotus Sutra recommend people to immolate their own bodies as an offering to the Buddha? Actually its not really what it appears to be... there's a deeper meaning behind it. It is to be a selfless service the triple gems and all sentient beings that is known as body immolation offering, and that is the highest offering according to Lotus Sutra. Lotus Sutra is full of metaphors.<br><br>I posted this 2 years ago.<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="font-style: italic;">If anyone wants to hurt you and pushes you into a great fire-pit, if you contemplate the power of Avalokitesvara, the fire-pit will change into a pond. - Lotus Sutra</span><br><br>So, this is what the translation says. But my master explained that, the "great-fire-pit" refers to the fires of hatred and anger, while the pond, clear and pure, refers to our Buddhamind. This relates to a true story, or experience, back in Taiwan.<br><br>My master had once observed that one of his disciples will meet a tribulation in the coming days... He called him up, and advised him not to be moved away from the triple jems (buddha, dharma, sangha), CHANT Guan-Shi-Yin frequently, and never to be affected by any anger. Just next day, this disciple was working at the construction site (he is a construction worker). Then, he got into an argument with someone on who should use the machine first. Tension rose, and finally they decided to "settle it" outside. Suddenly, this person remembered my master's words, and began to truly regret his earlier harshness. He chanted Namo Guanshiyin Pusa, and became very peaceful and calm, and smiled happily. The other person then went there to "settle" the issue, but seeing that he was smiling, he walked away. He threw a vegetable knife he was hiding onto the table. On seeing this, the person (who chanted guanshiyin) was extremely shocked, and realised what could have happened if he had continued the conflict. He was without any weapons, how could he be able to survive, fighting him with a fist?<br><br>From this, we should chant, pay reverence, learn, and most importantly, Be Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva. We should learn to be compassionate in all situations, a Bodhisattva's compassion is selfless.<br><br>This is the testimonial to the "power of Avalokitesvara", of course, testimonials are really a lot, many people meeting disasters, car accidents, those that one definitely could not have survived, are saved miraculously by the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Those who suffers from bad temper and strong hatred can try chanting regularly.. perhaps, 108 times a day. Most importantly, when we chant, we must not let our mind wander, and practice Samadhi (concentration, one-pointedness) on the chanting. In this way, chanting works best to remove our minds of sentient, samsaric thoughts.<br><br>We should all learn to be compassionate like Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.<br><br>Â“The ultimate goal of teaching is that Emptiness whose essence is Compassion.Â” - Great Pandita Atisha </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another metaphor from Guan Yin is the 1000 hand Guan Yin. This is taught in sutras.<br><br>Does it mean Guan Yin is really a man who has 1000 hands? That would be really scary and may even look like a monster and scare away people if Guan Yin really appeared in such a way. Thats why my master actually recommended people to honour Guan Yin having a 2 hand, 2 leg, human-looking guan yin image/statue at home.. not one that is 1000 arms. And Guan Yin does not have any fixed forms... he/she can manifest in countless forms to save sentient beings, according to chapter 25.<br><br>Actually 1000 hands is also a metaphor. 1000 hands could be you and me, and with certain level of attainment we become Guan Yin's 'Hua4 Sheng1' with the same vows as Guan Yin.</div>

Bodhisattva is pronounced as 'bo' 'di' 'sat' 'va' lor.. hahahhaa<br><br>My taiwanese dharma teacher was saved by guan yin before, almost died long time ago (got into conflict with lots and lots of spirits/ghosts by exercising his powers to protect some people)... and the guan yin that appeared was so tall that he could only see the toes, and revived him, and commented that he is pitiful. It was my master who told him it was Guan Yin who appeared. Of cos, using powers for such purposes such as to protect someone from vengeful spirits is not a wise idea at all.. but that was a long time ago and my teacher was still inexperienced/not so wise.
