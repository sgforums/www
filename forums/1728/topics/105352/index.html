            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Everything we call "the past" is, literally, nothing but present memories. Likewise, everything we call "the future" is nothing but present memories inverted, or rearranged, to form a prediction or expectation. The appearance of "time" is little more than a trick of memory, as the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Ornament Scripture) says. You can easily discern this for yourself: simply figure out what it is you consider "the past" and "the future." You will discover that it is nothing but thoughts--nothing but memories, nothing but expectations, nothing but mental commentary. It's "all in your head," so to speak. There's really no such thing as time. There is really only Now--an eternally present Present with no beginning and no ending. Everything is completely new, distinct, and original every instant, with no real "change" or "motion" at all. The mystic-philosopher Heraclitus, explaining this point, said, "A man cannot step in the same river twice."</blockquote><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm</a><br><br>This is a very good website on time.</div>

Words and thoughts being only suited to describe the time-space dimension. But because Nirvana is beyond time, there is no movement and so no aging or dying. Thus Nirvana is eternal. Because it is beyond space, there is no causation, no boundary, no concept of self and not-self and thus Nirvana is infinite. The Buddha also assures us that Nirvana is an experience of profound happiness. He says:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Nirvana is the highest happiness.<br>Dp 204</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From my understanding thus far, all past lives are actually happening in the ETERNAL NOW. This interpretation was taken from a brief moment, which felt as if I was physically, and consciously aligned with Â“Eternal Now/No TimeÂ”. I was very much awake when the amazing phenomenon occurred. I could only catch a glimpse of it.<br>Anyway, hereÂ’s what I think I perceivedÂ…<br><br>Â“TIME existed only as a perception for physical consciousness in this realm. Without consciousness, TIME does not exist. Events are all happening in the NOW moment. However, not all consciousnesses are in the present time. Past events/memories are also happening in the NOW.

            <div class='col-md body'>This topic is so much to my liking that I have to say something.<br>"Time" does it exist first of all?  Science has viewed time as a dimension that can be manipulated if "we are able to travel faster than the speed of light."  According to Einstein, a photon travelling  at the speed of light does not experience time, coz time halt at the speed of light!<br>So where is "Time" according to Science?  It is another "space" far from<br>"here" and can be reached if we are able to travel faster than light.<br><br></div>

There is simply <strong>no</strong> time!<br><br>Time becomes our greatest enemy once we divide them into Past, Present, Future. Time is thus, <strong>always</strong> against us.

Inventing the future has been his favourite game of escape."<br><br>"We think that changes in ourselves can come about in time, that order in ourselves can be built up little by little, added to day by day. But time <strong>doesn't</strong> bring order or peace, so we must <strong>stop thinking in terms of gradualness</strong>. This means that there is no tomorrow for us to be peaceful in. We have to be orderly on the <strong>instant</strong>."<br><br>"When there is real danger time disappears, doesn't it? There is immediate action. But we do not see the danger of many of our problems and therefore we invent time as a means of overcoming them. Time is a deceiver as it doesn't do a thing to help us bring about a change in ourselves. Time is a movement which man has divided into past, present and future, and as long as he divides it he will <strong>always be in conflict</strong>."<br><br>J.Krishnamurti</blockquote>When "time" disappears, we awaken to reality.
