              <p>firstly thanks AEN for sharing this very important article.</p>
              <p>second thanks longchen for bringing forth this important teaching. from my experience conditions are the most important aspects of practice.</p>
              <p>however, it is very difficult for most people as we live our lives as a wet matchstick and the automatic actions continue to create conditions that will keep the matchsticks wet. yet it will be these conditions that will bring about events with the potential to suddenly dry up the matchstick and ignite a fire.</p>
              <p>once the matchstick is on fire, slowly one will see everything around the environment as conditions for practice. some attachments will slowly lose their grip one by one along the way as one resolves to live according to the Noble Eightfold Path. from this point on the new conditions will set in motion a new direction.</p>
              <p>however there will still be attachments that continue on, and these attachments have a way of presenting themselves so subtly that it appears to not have a big impact on the practice, creating a sense of contentment and its very difficult to work with these attachments. im facing this at the moment, any suggestion on this?</p>

              Presence. Need to take care of conditions as well.</p>
              <p>Without proper conditions, the initial awakening may not even
              arise, although all along 'Reality is like that'.</p>
              <p>Just a sharing.. and its just personal opinion. Better to find

              <p>hi longchen, sorry i misunderstood the context of your first sharing.</p>
              <p>this aspect of conditions have been a big part of confusion for me since i started practicing in 2007, and especially so since im working in the financial industry. somehow reconciliation seems impossible.</p>
              <p>my search for some relief has recently brought me to a book by Jack Kornfield, im still in the midst of reading it but already the load is lighter now and im able to start integrating daily practice and work better.</p>
              <p>been reading and enjoy learning alot from your sharing, hope there will be more sharing in this area from your experience. following is an excerpt from the book taken from <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Buddhism/2000/06/After-The-Ecstasy-The-Laundry.aspx">http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Buddhism/2000/06/After-The-Ecstasy-The-Laundry.aspx</a>:</p>

              <p>For almost everyone who practices, cycles of awakening and openness are followed by periods of fear and contraction. Times of profound peace and newfound love are often overtaken by periods of loss, by closing up, fear, or the discovery of betrayal, only to be followed again by equanimity or joy. In mysterious ways the heart reveals itself to be like a flower that opens and closes. This is our nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only surprising thing is how unexpected this truth can be. It is as if deep down we all hope that some experience, some great realization, enough years of dedicated practice, might finally lift us beyond the touch of life, beyond the mundane struggles of the world. We cling to some hope that in <a id="45cd4b89-fbaf-4cef-bbd5-38797d04ccac" class="bn-keyword" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/section/quiz/index.asp?surveyid=27"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">spiritual</span></span></a> life we can rise above the wounds of our human pain, never to have to suffer them again. We expect some experience to last. But permanence is not true freedom, not the sure heart's release.</p>

              <p>Every wise voyager learns that we cannot hold on to the last port of call, no matter how beautiful. To do so would be like holding our breath, creating a prison from our past. As one Zen master puts it:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Enlightenment is only the beginning, is only a step of the journey. You can't cling to that as a new identity or you're in immediate trouble. You have to get back down into the messy business of life, to engage with life for years afterward. Only then can you integrate what you have learned. Only then can you learn perfect trust."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like the monk in the ox-herding pictures [a traditional Zen parable], most of us have to reenter the marketplace to fulfill our realization. As we come down from the mountain, we may be shocked to find how easily our old habits wait for us, like comfortable and familiar clothes. Even if our transformation is great and we feel peaceful and unshakable, some part of our return will inevitably test us. We may become confused about what to do with our life, and how to live in our <a id="b5900fa7-21ce-4413-a98e-ffac30a5221b" class="bn-keyword" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/love-family/community.aspx"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">family</span></span></a> or society. We may worry how our spiritual life can fit into our ordinary way of being, our ordinary work. We may want to run away, to go back to the simplicity of the retreat or the temple. But something important has pulled us back to the world, and the difficult transition is part of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One lama remembers:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"When I came back it was as if my 12 years of experiences in India and Tibet were a dream. The memory and value of those transcendental experiences was in some way a dream challenged by the culture shock of returning to my family and to work in the West. Old patterns came back surprisingly quickly. I got irritable, confused. I wasn't taking care of my body, I worried about money, about relationship. At the worst point I feared that I was losing what I had learned. Then I realized I couldn't live in some enlightened memory. What became clear is that spiritual practice is only what you're doing now. Anything else is a fantasy."</p>

              <p style="line-height: 149%;"><strong><span>Purpose: </span></strong><span>This study explored the first-person accounts of individuals involved in several contemporary awareness teachings regarding the nature and qualities of awareness, the relationship of awareness and its recognition to the alleviation of human suffering, and the impact that the discovery of awareness has across multiple life domains.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 10pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span>Methods: </span></strong><span>Purposive sampling was employed and individuals selected who were either senior students of or teachers within several contemporary awareness traditions (n = 28). In consultation with <span>s</span>everal teachers, a semi-structured interview protocol was developed. Interviews, which took approximately 90 minutes to complete, were then transcribed and thematic analyses subsequently carried out by two independent reviewers.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 9.5pt;"><span> </span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span>Results: </span></strong><span>Despite some diversity across respondent<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">s</span>, a number of consistent themes emerged. In general, awareness was define<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">d</span> as that which knows or cognizes phenomena or the conscious space within which phenomenal experience arises and subsides. Several qualitie<span>s</span> of awareness were noted including vital, wi<span>d</span>e-open, unobstructed, indivisible, and spontaneously present. The recognition of awa<span>r</span>eness as the fundamental ground or basis of all perceptions was consistently seen as crucial to the resolution of human suffering for several reasons: a) awareness is undisturbed or unaltered by phenomena; b) by itself, the recogniti<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">o</span>n of awareness in any moment appears to resolve the search for wel<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">l</span>-being; c) from the vantage of awareness, one recognizes that so-called negative mind states do not require management, control or alteration because they naturally resolve themselves owing</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 150%;"><span>to their impermanent nature; and d) the recognition that the context of awareness is ultimately inseparable from its dynamic content leads one to view phenomena conventionally labeled as disturbin<span>g</span>, as essentially insubstantial, empty and non-</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 13.7pt;"><span>threatening in nature.<span>   </span></span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 150%;"><span>Along with its role in the resolution of psychological suffering, participants noted several other ways they felt that the realization of awareness had positively impacted their lives. These included: greater intimacy, ease and openness in relationships; diminishment or loss of self-identification and self-focus; an enhanced capacity for skillful and innovative responsiveness to life situations; a movement to be of benefit and service to others; and, insight into the fundamental roots of suffering and a corres<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">p</span>onding natural arising of compassion for self and others.</span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 150%;"><strong><span>Conclusions</span></strong><span>: Based on these sel<span style="letter-spacing: 0.05pt;">f</span>-reports, the discovery of awareness as the essential basis or ground of all perception, and the experience that this context of awareness is ultimately inseparable from its phenomenal content appears to have important implications for our understanding of: 1) suffering, it causes and resolution; 2) the potential for human beings to realize a well-being and contentment that is increasingly less dependent upon particular circumstances or experiences; and, 3) the realization of greater equanimity and compassion, and the possibility that these qualities are actually innate, intrinsic to awareness or life itself rather than skills one must learn or cultivate. Taken together, these preliminary findings merit additional follow-up by psychologists, neuroscientists, and other researchers interested in understanding the factors that contribute to optimal</span></p>

              <p>In the past, I thought once the non-dual occurs on a more
              regular basis... I should be able to be without much experience of
              struggle with respect to all aspect of one's life experience.</p>
              <p>As a lay practitioner, one have family and other relations to
              relate to. Others, may not necessarily share the same aspirations
              as that of a serious practitioner. Notwithstanding that, what one
              does will inevitably be interwined with the close relations.
              Decisions are interwined.... many a times one may not be fully
              agreeable with certain decisions...</p>
              <p>Perhaps, that is why some kind of renunciation is still

              <p>hi geis,</p>
              <p>your point on integrating with life is very good. i have trouble with that too. I imagine everyone has.</p>
              <p>we have to practice in solitude, then go back to life to reintegrate, then solitude then reintegrate.  This kind of pattern is very helpful, in my view.</p>
              <p>Tibetan Buddhism emphasize alot on retreats.  Of course, in our context, most probably life-retreat is impossible, but then going on short retreats is possible and definitely very redefining in many sense.</p>
              <p> also jack kornfield pt is very good.  I think it can be one of the most disappointing highlights of our spiritual life to suddenly realise that you are not going somewhere and there is no escape from our daily hassles.  We have to deal with life and there are no false promises held out . </p>
              <p>on the bodhisattva path, it is said that bodhisattvas do not cling to samsara, nor nirvana. Then, if we ask, what now, if there is no escape from life.  Then i would suggest that we turn life into as selfless an endeavor as possible for helping others and bringing positivity and benefit to this world.</p>

              <p>hmmm... longchen,</p>
              <p>you seem to be a great meditator, so i dun feel qualified to
                                          comment on your experiences.</p>
              <p>from my limited understanding, non-dual awareness, assuming what
                                          u r doing is truly non-dual awareness, shd indeed loosen the
                                          struggling factor.  But maybe that your stability is not yet
                                          firm. </p>
              <p>other factors like orientating the external to your practice are
                                          still belonging to acts of hope n fear.  In fact, true
                                          practitioner try to go to difficult situations to practice, but
                                          that is after stability is firm.  sometimes, even sick also
                                          dun try to see doc. </p>
              <p>if ur stability is not yet firm, can do some reorientating. Can
                                          also suggest accumulation of merit and purification. 
                                          Traditionally, this has been the way. Even people who have
                                          accomplished Dzogchen still do accumulation of merit.</p>
              <p>u know, i am sometimes hesitant to comment on this forum due to
                                          potential for misleading people-- very bad karma.  I am just a
                                          novice, hope anything i said is useful.  Ignore those not
                                          useful.</p>

              <p>Hi Wisdomeye,</p>
              <p>I really appreciate your input.</p>
              <p>Yes, non-dual really does loosen the struggling factor.</p>
              <p>Let me put it this way. What a practitioner see as practice is not what your spouse or close relations see it. Example of dichotomy...A practitioner will have to 'pretend' to appease the fears of your close ones. Now, pretending is not a great way to honesty, isn;t it. You have to pretend to enjoy a conversation when silence is the natural way. You have to coax to appease the wondering mind of close ones when letting go of the fears is what you think the way should be. These are really the easy examples.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When one live with others who are not sharing the same state of mind, you have to pretend to keep things to their perceived sense of what is normal. What is normal is really madness.</p>
              <p>Many articles will write in a rather sweeping manner. When we go into the details, it is a whole different ball-game. I see the way forward as not being caught into any beliefs or concepts of how things should be... because there isn't any. The path we carve is entirely original and every challenge has no fixed correct answer.</p>
              <p>I hope i am being utterly honest here :)</p>

              <p>Although Buddha said in the 4 noble truths that there is nirvana/cessation, i think later on in the later turning of the wheel of dharma he said there is no need for cessation... on the bodhisattva path, it is said that bodhisattvas do not cling to samsara, nor nirvana.

              <p>true true</p>
              <p>because i have yet to experience the various kinds of insights, i tend to use imagination to integrate practice into daily life.</p>
              <p>usually i imagine that all the people im in contact with and the roles im playing are 'specially' tailored to help in progressing nearer to liberation. i imagine that they are specially tailored because these are the areas that i may have missed out advancing in previous lifetimes. i imagine that the problems that are faced in work and relationships are the ripening of previous karma.</p>
              <p>yes a retreat once every few months is good, would like to go for one this year. on sundays when i have nothing on i will do a self imposed retreat in my room, and usually after that mondays always seems to be the best day haha. also a spirit of renunciation is possible everytime we meditate. before sitting i also prepare by saying i renounce everything for this session.</p>

              <p>my heartfelt agreement here.</p>
              <p>in my course of work i have to do alot of coaching (usually is counselling) for consultants and also clients. and day in day out have to face this situation.</p>
              <p>after a lot of practice i realize many times silence is still the key. most kinds of talk is just an avenue for one to vent out emotions, a response may not be necessary.</p>
              <p>a constant reminder that the practice is on the processes behind the interaction and not on the content does help. still the content usually is the priority for the other party, and this is where some balance is required. its not easy.</p>
              <p>on a positive note, another thing i encountered is when i do coaching, i was able to relate the causes and their emotions better to the extent they find it eerie like i can read their minds. and from noting practice there are occasions where some non verbal cues are picked up and i was able to respond aptly. sometimes i may have to pretend to not notice anything hehe.</p>
              <p>generally it can be quite fun doing the daily interactions, and understanding the problems that others are facing and their inability to see the dhamma does make me feel sad and forgiving.</p>

              <p>yes a retreat once every few months is good, would like to go for one this year. on sundays when i have nothing on i will do a self imposed retreat in my room, and usually after that mondays always seems to be the best day haha. also a spirit of renunciation is possible everytime we meditate. before sitting i also prepare by saying i renounce everything for this session.</p>

              <p>hi longchen,</p>
              <p>articles or meditation manuals will always be sweeping. 
              That's why a teacher's instructions is more specific and
              situation-oriented. In Dzogchen tradition, called menngak, and this
              is very impt.  sometimes, menngak can even be opposite from
              manuals cos that's what u need at that point, for eg, ask us to do
              something that is full of attachment, when we thot we shd be
              going for non-attachment.  that's why teacher badly needed,
              their menngak based on their own experience and realisation.</p>
              <p>as for your practice situation. Many people have this problem.
              Many realised masters also separated with their spouses over
              differences.  anyway, i'm not saying you have to divorce or
              something, please dun misinterpret, i am jus saying such things are
              there. </p>
              <p>i wld also like to add that at some point when awareness is
              stable, thots and emotions become enhancement to the practice, does
              not detract from the practice.  some of the realised people i
              know are very animated people.  can talk alot also no problem,
              i dun think it detracts from their practice. Sometimes, u look
              at them, like very excited and gan cheong... inside, nothing
              move...<span style="color: #0000ff;">(this my
              assumption)</span> haha.. maybe as u practice, u will find out
              that when thots come even better still, at that time, u will not be
              looking for caves, maybe looking for cities and even
              discotheques... keke</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, all above my interpretation and not sure... please pick
              and choose as u need.</p>

              <p>While having a conversation with a friend yesterday I noticed something.</p>
              <p>There is just one thought happening spontaneously, one action 
              happening spontaneously at every moment.. but the sense that a 'me' led 
              to a thought or action is actually an illusion... is also just an 
              arising thought... therefore any effort or action to control thoughts or
               do anything is also the result of the illusion, theres actually just a 
              presently arising thought. There is always only presence and spontaneous
               arising... theres nothing 'we' can ever do or have ever done.</p>
              <p>The
               sense that theres something that must be done to experience presence is
               also really just story, actually there is always just a thought, an 
              action arising in presence.. only in concepts do we create a sense of 
              distance and a need and a 'doer' to fulfill certain<br> things like getting rid of certain thought or feeling to 'reach' 
              presence.. in direct nonconceptual looking one sees there is just always
               just presence and spontaneous arising.</p>

              <p>Repentance is necessary. But one sees that deeds are done but there is no doer... you are repenting for the deeds, but you are not adding or clinging on to a guilty self image.</p>
