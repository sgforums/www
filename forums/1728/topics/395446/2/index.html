              <p>since thots do not have a controller, sometimes, we get so guilty or self-judgemental over our own bad behavior/thots or whatsoever, does that mean that since there is actually no need for this? because in a sense, it is not really "our" fault.  i mean since there is no "I".</p>

              <p>really is just a series of thoughts conditionally arising automatically with each being a cause as well as an effect spontaneosly. how behavior or thoughts turn out depends on the 'weight' on the five aggregates and this weight is the karmic forces. in a sense everything is in auto gear, nothing ever happens by chance.</p>

              <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff9900;">A
               Simple Analogy</span></h1>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">When introducing people to 
              awareness for the first time, I often say: Just stop thinking for a 
              moment and see what remains...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">In fact, why don't you all do 
              that right now: for 5 seconds stop thinking and just see...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">It's then that you notice that 
              there is something that remains when you are not thinking. Like a 
              background that's just present.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">The goal with this is not to 
              motivate you to stop all thinking or to try and retain a non-thought 
              state of mind. Instead, that initial moment is just to help you 
              recognize awareness. It's just an introduction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Sure, feel free to stop 
              thinking for short moments repeatedly to become more familiar with 
              awareness; that alertness that remains. But don't ever believe that 
              awareness, or your recognition of awareness, is depending on your being 
              thoughtless.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><em>If you notice that you are 
              in fact believing you need to get rid of thoughts and emotions in order 
              to be free, then let this moment and this very article, be the perfect 
              moment to bring that belief to a complete stop :).</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">In fact, it is crucial in this 
              world of pace and chaos, to be able to recognize awareness even while 
              thinking and feeling many things at once. It is crucial that we all come
               to know ourselves as that which is present in each perception: 
              Awareness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></p>
              <h3><span style="color: #ff9900;">A Simple Analogy</span></h3>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Why do I tell you initially to 
              stop thinking then? It's because we have grown so accustomed to being 
              interested only in our thought-forms, that we miss the very basis of 
              every perception.<br><br> So when we stop thinking for a moment, we have
               nothing in our sight to distract us, and so we naturally notice that 
              subtle presence that underlies all thoughts. We naturally notice that we
               are in fact that awareness that remains! </span> <span style="color: #333333;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>It's like this:</strong></span></strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Have you ever watched 
              television, and suddenly the image turns black? Or the black/white 
              pixels jitter takes over? There is no content on the screen and suddenly
               you are reminded that you were actually staring at a television set...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">When the screen was filled with
               stories that interested you, kept you distracted, you never even 
              realized you were watching at a television screen. All you recognized 
              were the changing forms that were displayed and the stories they were 
              telling you. You were missing the obvious fact, that the television set 
              is the basis of every single image shown.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">And just like when something 
              that pulls your interest is reflected in a mirror you are looking at, 
              for example your face, all you see is your face and the story it seems 
              to evoke, you notice all your facial imperfections maybe, or your 
              beautiful characteristics. Because that is what you are interested in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"> But when a mirror reflects 
              nothing that pulls your interest, like for example an empty space of 
              your room, you naturally notice that there's a mirror in your room 
              instead of being distracted by its reflection. For the first time you 
              see the mirror itself, for what it really is.<br></span></p>
              <hr>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Similarly, Awareness is the 
              basis of all your changing perceptions and is most easily noticed to be 
              present, when you have no thoughts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">But as I said, it's important 
              not to dwell on this initial instruction.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">Now that you have realized that
               all images were actually just pure television screen, when the images 
              and the stories they tell you start to fill up your screen again, you 
              can start to remind yourself of the fact that every image is nothing 
              more than pure screen. You can now actually see the television screen as
               a screen!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">No matter how elaborate, 
              individual or authoritative the story of these images might seem, they 
              have no individual basis or power and have never been anything more than
               pure screen. All images are now realized to be equal, even if their 
              labels and descriptions tell you otherwise!</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">So where you might have needed 
              that initial moment of blankness to recognize what was really present, 
              now that you know this in your direct experience you can start 
              recognizing awareness in <em>every</em> perception, in <em>every</em> thought.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">For that alertness that is 
              naturally witnessing the moment of no-thought, is still that exact same 
              alertness that is witnessing the maelstrom of thoughts and emotions. 
              It's the natural perceiving that never leaves. You can't say that you 
              had a moment in your life where you weren't naturally, without effort, 
              aware of your life... How else would you know that?<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;">So instead of recognizing only 
              the images of life, commit yourself from this moment on, to recognize 
              the fact that you are aware of all these images.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"> YOU are always that same 
              peaceful, spacious, open awareness and YOU can never not be present. 
              Thoughts come and go like the wind, but YOU are the space for them to 
              either be in, or not be in. Completely unaffected, completely free 
              already!</span></p>

              <p>Awareness is so simple because it does not require the mind to figure out what it is.</p>
              <p>Just look into Who is looking?</p>
              <p>The answer comes in a form of 'feeling-realization' as Eckhart Tolle puts it. It can never be understood mentally.</p>
              <p>That non-conceptual sense of presence and knowing alone IS.</p>
              <p>It IS no matter what we are doing/not-doing.</p>
              <p>The challenge is bringing this 'feeling-realization' into everyday life engagement, even while engaging in thoughts, actions, etc.</p>

              <p>i would like to refer people to the Surangama sutra on this awareness topic.  Look for the translation in English.  It talks about this very clearly and very very vividly. Maybe cos it's sourced from Buddha himself.</p>

              <h1>A Simple, But Effective Practice</h1>
              <p>I heard one of my teachers say, “Always stick to your 
              experience.”</p>
              <p>So that is what I’m doing.</p>
              <p>My experience, my practice, on the path was simply to rest as 
              awareness as often as possible, throughout the day.</p>
              <p>To rest as awareness simply means to stop, take one moment, and rest 
              without labels about what is happening.  This means to gently allow all 
              thoughts about yourself, others, and the world to come to rest.  Then 
              just rest in and as that unknowing space of the present moment.</p>
              <p>In that rest, an openness to all thoughts, emotions, states, 
              sensations, and experiences is available.</p>
              <p>I rested as awareness repeatedly until it dawned on me that my real 
              identity is this awareness.  Then, there was no need to rest anymore.</p>
              <p>I recognized that I AM AWARENESS.  Not the personal self.  Not 
              “Scott” is awareness.  The entire story of Scott was seen to be an 
              appearance coming and going within awareness.</p>
              <p>In realizing awareness as my true identity, all thoughts, emotions, 
              states, and experiences are seen to be temporary appearances, 
              inseparable from awareness.  They don't have the power to harm or 
              torture me.  As awareness, I remain untouched by these movements.  Yet 
              all movements are seen to arise spontaneously, involuntarily, and 
              dynamically within awareness.  Therefore, all appearances were seen to 
              be equal appearances to awareness.  Nothing pushed away.  Nothing chased
               after.  All IS!</p>
              <p>This was my method.  The main one.  There were some other inquires 
              that I did.  But my main practice was to simply rest as awareness, 
              whenever possible through the day.</p>
              <p>In resting as awareness, emotions were felt directly, without the 
              filter of thought interpreting them as good or bad.</p>
              <p>Some don't need to rest as awareness repeatedly.  Taking one moment 
              to look without labels is all that it takes.  In that one moment, it 
              becomes clear that awareness is your real identity.  For others, it 
              takes repeatedly resting as awareness. </p>
              <p>Don't think of resting as a practice to reach a later point of 
              awakening in time.  Each moment of rest is an end in and of itself.  In 
              that non-conceptual awareness, time is not operating.  Time is seen to 
              be thought. </p>
              <p>In a moment of resting, don't look for results or achievement.  Don't
               look for some grand awakening experience.  Rest for rest's sake.  
              Simply rest as what you are.  If a thought arises, simply notice it and 
              allow it to pass.  Ask yourself, does it take a thought to just be?  If 
              not, rest as that thought-free awareness.  And when a thought arises, 
              ask, "Does this thought take away being?"  Nothing takes away the simple
               presence of being.  It is always here, always available, whether there 
              is thinking or no thinking. Just notice that every thought comes and 
              goes within this restful awareness. </p>
              <p>This was a simple practice and because it worked for me, I’m sharing 
              it with you.  There are other ways, other methods, and other practices.</p>
              <p>And if you meet with me, we may explore other methods, including the 
              direct path, inquire, and all sorts of other things.  But I will always 
              remind you to keep it simple.</p>
              <p>Simply rest.  Rest whenever it is convenient.  Rest whenever 
              possible.  This was the doorway to freedom for me.  So I’m sharing it 
              with you.</p>
