              <p><br> The Elder Lord said:<br> <br> The Great Tao, being formless, creates heavens and earths;<br> The Great Tao, being emotionless, runs the sun and the moon;<br> The Great Tao, being nameless, eternally nurtures all beings.<br> I do not know its name, and artificially call it "Tao".<br> <br> For things belong to Tao, some are pure, some are turbid; some are
              dynamic, and some are static. Heavens are pure, and earths are turbid;
              heavens are dynamic, and earths are static; the male are pure, and the
              female are turbid; the male are dynamic, and the female are static. It
              falls from the source and flows to the branches, therefore all things
              are produced.<br> <br> The pure is the origin of the turbid; the dynamic is the base of the
              static. If one can always be pure and tranquil, the whole universe will
              return (to its origin).<br> <br> A person's divinity likes to be pure, but his heart disturbs it; a
              person's heart likes to be tranquil, but his desires draw it away. If
              one can constantly dispel his desires, his heart will of itself become
              tranquil; if he also can make his heart limpid, his divinity will of
              itself become pure, then naturally, the six desires will not be
              produced and the three poisons will be cleansed. If one cannot achieve
              that, it is because his heart is not yet limpid, and his desires are
              not yet dispelled.<br> <br> For a person who can achieve that, when he observes inward onto his
              heart, there is no heart; when he observes outward onto his body, there
              is no body; and when he observes remote things, there is no thing.<br> <br> Since these three kinds of things have been understood by his heart of
              true self, he sees only the emptiness. Observe the emptiness by using
              the emptiness, the emptiness is not emptied. Since that which can be
              emptied does not exist, the inexistence of inexistence does not exist
              either; since the inexistence of inexistence does not exist, there
              comes the pellucid, bright, and everlasting tranquility. When it is
              tranquil but there is nothing that is made tranquil, how can desires be
              produced? Since no desire can be produced, that is the true tranquility
              -- the Reality.<br> <br> The Reality always corresponds to, and reflects all things; the Reality
              always stays in its nature. Always reflect in such a way, yet remain
              tranquil constantly, then it is the Constant Purity and Tranquility.<br> <br> By keeping such purity and tranquility, one will gradually enter into
              the true Tao. When the true Tao is entered, that is called the
              Achievement of Tao. Though it is called the Achievement of Tao, there
              is actually nothing to achieve, just in order to enlighten living
              beings, it is called the Achievement of Tao. To those who can
              understand this with the heart of their true self, the sacrosanct Tao
              can be imparted.<br> <br> The Elder Lord said:<br> <br> A superior person does not compete, an inferior person loves to
              compete; the superior virtue is free from virtue, and the inferior
              virtue clings to virtue. Those who cling to anything do not understand
              Tao and Virtue.<br> <br> The reason why living beings do not achieve the true Tao is because
              their hearts are deluded; their hearts being deluded, their divinities
              are perturbed; their divinities being perturbed, they are attached to
              myriads of things; being attached to myriads of things, greed and
              desires are produced; greed and desires being produced, worrying and
              afflictions also come. Worrying, afflictions, and illusionary
              consciousnesses torture their bodies and their hearts, and make them
              profaned by defilements and turbidities, wander among births and
              deaths, immersed in the ocean of afflictions constantly, and forever
              lose the true Tao.<br> <br> The true and eternal Tao can be achieved naturally by those who
              understand it with the heart of their true self; and those who
              understand Tao with the heart of their true self, can constantly be
              pure and tranquil.<br> <br> The Immortal Elder Gok said:<br> <br> I had achieved the true Tao. Formerly I had recited this scripture ten
              thousand times. This scripture was studied and practiced by heavenly
              gods, and was not taught to inferior persons. I received it from
              Eastern Glory Heavenly Emperor, Eastern Glory Heavenly Emperor received
              it from Golden Gate Heavenly Emperor, Golden Gate Heavenly Emperor
              received it from Western Royal Mother. As for the direct line of
              Western Royal Mother's disciples, they imparted it only by word of
              mouth, and never wrote down the words. Now for the world, I have
              recorded it by writing it down. A superior person, who understands it
              with his heart of true self, will ascend high and become a heavenly
              Immortal; a middling person, who practices it, will get his position in
              Southern Heavenly Palace; an inferior person, who gets it, will live in
              the world for a long time, and then roam through the three realms, and
              ascend into the Golden Gate.<br> <br> Tzaw-Profoundness Real Person said:<br> <br> For a person who studies Tao, if he recites and holds this scripture,
              he will be guarded by virtuous gods of the ten heavens, and then his
              divinity will be protected by the Jade Seal, his body will be refined
              by the Golden Liquid, then both his body and his divinity (sublimed
              souls) will become miraculously beautiful, and he will dissolve in Tao
              as the Reality.<br> <br> Midmost One Real Person said:<br> <br> If a family has this scripture and they truly understand it, no
              misfortune or obstruction will interfere with them, hosts of sages will
              guard their door, and their divinities will ascend to the high realm to
              worship lofty Real Persons in the present of them. When their merits
              are sufficient and their virtues are completed, the Heavenly Emperor
              will respond them, and by reciting and holding this scripture without
              retrogression, they will fly upward riding the clouds of purple light.<br> <br> (End of Translation) <br> (Translated into English by Silfong Tsun)<br> (Last Revised: Jun/23/2007)</p>
