              <p>You are thinking of a linear relationship of cause and effect.  The butterfly flapping its wings in brazil and causing a tornado in phillipines is a non-linear effect. It is like commiting a small wrong and you thought that the karmic seed is small or that your so-called good intention would help create good karma. As the law of karma is non-linear the small wrong you have committed may actually escalate into a major effect such as someone losing his job, life or possession.</p>

              <p>Your observation and understanding of nature was wrong (breathing part-lah).</p>
              <p>Your understanding of Buddha's teaching on cause and effect was faulthy and incomplete.  Your understanding was superficial and then you concluded that he was wrong. During Buddha's time there was a monk who thought like you. After listening to Buddha he thought he knew no-self and went around telling everyone who lend him a ear that Buddha was wrong. Buddha heard of it and then called a meeting of all the monks and started questioning this monk. The monk did not really understood what was no-self. Buddha really use some very harsh words then.</p>

              <p>I will say this only once. Spreading false teaching or misleading people into not believing the Buddha's teaching has very serious karmic consequences. Buddhism teaching has no specific formula or form as long as it leads to liberation from delusion.</p>
