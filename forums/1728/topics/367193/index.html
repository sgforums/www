              <p>Not in the same way as how Christians do that, e.g. massive evangelism. But we do encourage sharing dharma with others. But I do believe a more proactive effort to spread our teachings is possible.</p>
              <p>Conversion in Buddhism is also not just a "just believe and that's it" thing, the person must be interested and learn more about the dharma himself also, ultimately it is himself who is going to attain enlightenment and liberation. The important thing is not just conversion but how is he truly going to benefit from the dharma? Is he truly keen to learn and practice it to see its benefits?</p>
              <p>So in this sense, the way we see spirituality is different from the way other religions sees it.</p>

              <p>Certain level of faith is necessary for the person to start walking the path. Understanding is important, but if you understand and don't practice/walk the path then there's no use.</p>
              <p>Enlightenment, liberation is gained through walking the path and gaining direct experience. A natural confidence grows not dependent on belief but on one's experience, insights. Faith, belief, transforms into conviction and certainty born of insights and experience.</p>

              <p>The Buddha instructs the Kalama People on which basis one should decide which religious teaching to accept as true. The Buddha tells the Kalamas to not just believe religious teachings because they are claimed to be true by various sources or through the application of various methods and techniques. He urges that direct knowledge from one's own experience should be called upon. He counsels that the words of the wise should be heeded and taken into account when deciding upon the value of a teaching. This is not a dogmatic acceptance but rather a constantly questioning and testing acceptance of those teachings which can be proven to reduce suffering.</p>

                                      A (cause) + B (condition) then it may or may not result in C

              <p><em>It doesn't make sense. If I put a blue chemical and a green

                                      resulting in a yellow chemical, you're saying the reaction may or

              <p>from my personal understanding, cause &amp; effect as we understand
              it in daily life is just an extremely superficial view of how reality
              works (dependent origination). nothing wrong with A+B=C understanding
              of cause &amp; effect and it works for our simple understanding of how
              things works in daily life.  hit the bell and if the ears are working
              and we will hear the sound of bell, no problem. mix blue and green and
              u get yellow, no problem too.  but this superficial and simplistic
              understanding does not in any way fully describe the teaching of
              dependent origination or how reality, phenomenon and processes works.</p>
              <p><br>reason
              why when a person breathes, changes the air pressure but didn't cause
              tornado is simply because dependent origination is not so simplistic as
              A+B=C as we think it is. dependent origination is probably more like
              A+B+C...N=result, where N=infinity, to put it in scientific sense. 
              that's why kind person (A) + do good deeds (B) does not always = good
              outcome (not immediately anyway). we see kind people who do good still
              encounter so-called bad outcomes simply because all the conditions are
              not in place to produce the good outcome. we assume we just need A+B
              but in reality it is A+B+C....N to produce the "good outcome".  so when
              we mistakenly assume that we only need A+B=C, and we don't see it
              happens immediately (like good people encountering bad circumstances),
              we then further mistakenly thinks that dependent origination is not
              true, cause &amp; effect is not true.  fact of matter is we do not
              appreciate dependent origination deeply enough to know its implications
              and how it impacts the simplistic "cause &amp; effect" phenomenon in
              daily life.</p>
              <p><br>i think the teaching of emptiness helps me personally
              to understand dependent origination much better. the lack of inherent
              existence of A, B, C...N is exactly why the eventual and expected
              outcome can be "produced" relatively. at what exact point in time does
              a seed appear/disappear that leads to the exact point in time a sprout
              appear/disappear?  who knows...</p>

              <p>Yes nicely said.</p>
              <p>I just posted something related in another forum a few hours ago:</p>
              <p><br>What appears to be chance and chaos, is simply a manifestation with conditions beyond our understanding.<br><br>We
                  can never understand all conditionings, and even Buddha said that only
                  a Buddha who has attained omniscience can totally comprehend the
                  functioning of karma. Even Arhats (someone who is realized and
                  liberated but has not attained the omniscience of a Buddha) can't, and
                  it's known as one of the four unponderables.<br><br>Just like we can
                  forecast the weather, but we can't exactly give a 100% accurate
                  prediction. Maybe 90%, 80% accuracy if one is a good forecaster? The
                  flow of weather, the air pressure, wind, clouds, etc, and all other
                  types of conditionings changing moment by moment, it's almost
                  impossible to know what exactly will result from all the different
                  types of conditionings which appears as a chaos, but it doesn't mean
                  that it is total chaos without order, nor does it mean that weather
                  happens by chance.<br><br>As Thusness once said, <em>"Chaos theory breaks determinism, breaks boundary, yet does not deny order...<strong> a higher order that is too complex to be determined</strong>.
                  Initial cause does not result into a predetermined action. From a
                  spiritual perspective, the rigidity of ‘I’ as a fixed pattern order
                  must be broken down for life to be experienced in its full dynamics as
                  wondrous manifestation."</em></p>

              <p>ah yes.. thanks for reminding me!  i was trying to recall this term "four unponderables" that i've heard before but can't remember it when i want to.  when i google it, some also term it as "four imponderables" - karma, beginning of universe, buddha-range and jhana--range.</p>
              <p>i'm only beginning to appreciate how dependent origination breaks our simplistic assumption of cause &amp; effect.  how emptiness helps to dissolve the fixation of specific "causes" and "effects" to reveal the wonder of how things naturally are, and rationalize the mundane conflicts of "why things don't turn out the way we think/want".</p>
              <p>when i first encountered teachings on emptiness, it was easier to "break the determinism, break boundary" but difficult to "maintain order" thinking that all things should just unravel.  but through repeated self analysis and contemplations, i've since been able to understand and appreciate better the inherent "orderliness" of things even within the realm of total emptiness of self-existence. </p>
              <p>amazing how profound buddhist teachings are.  especially when bringing this appreciation back to our mundane daily life.</p>
