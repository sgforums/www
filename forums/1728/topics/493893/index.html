              Future of Climbing Mount Everest</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Saransh Sehgal April 19,
              2017 The Diplomat</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              legendary climber talks about the evolution of the climbing industry in Nepal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">This
              year’s climbing season on Mount Everest is about to begin, and many expedition
              companies believe it could be the busiest season yet on Everest. The last three
              years haven’t provided much enticement for adventurers aiming to scale the
              world’s highest mountain, mainly because of the massive avalanche in 2014 and
              earthquake in 2015. Climbing the world’s highest mountain has come under scrutiny,
              as the death toll since the last decades has inched close to 300 people. More
              Sherpas have been killed on Everest in the last three years than ever before.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">With
              the world watching, the future of climbing Mount Everest is becoming unclear.
              It’s currently a big business, as more and more Western and European expedition
              companies are bringing in clients who pay between $40,000 and $50,000, but
              costs can even climb as high as $100,000. Yet Sherpa guides and porters get
              only a little piece of that overall amount and have begun to take a stand
              demanding a higher cut.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              a look into the future of climbing on Mount Everest, I spoke with Reinhold
              Messner, the legendary climber and one of the world’s foremost experts in
              climbing without supplementary oxygen. In 1978 the South Tyrolean, together
              with Austria’s Peter Habeler, became the first person in the world to climb
              Everest without supplementary oxygen. Just to prove he wasn’t lucky, he did it
              again two years later with supplementary oxygen in the first solo attempt on
              Everest. The climb was defined as one of the most astounding feats in
              mountaineering history. Messner is also the first person to climb all 14 of the
              world’s highest peaks above 8,000 meters. Below is an excerpt from an exclusive
              interview with Messner recently in Vienna, Austria, with the famous climber
              sharing his concern over the future of climbing on Everest. It has been edited
              for clarity.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Saransh Sehgal: As summer is soon
              approaching, climbers are gearing up to make their way to Base Camp. Do you
              think that the incidents in last three years (the avalanches, earthquake, and
              the increasing number of deaths) has changed climbing on Everest?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Reinhold
              Messner: Even though the last year was okay, there will also be deaths this
              year. It’s logical that if 500 people are going there, some of them will die.
              Around 10 will die; that’s the number [I would guess].</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Climbing
              has totally changed. Today, climbing is a global issue. This year maybe 200
              Indians will go to Everest on the piste [a track of firm snow] and since it is
              possible that Everest is prepared from the base to the summit, many people can
              go there. But this is not alpinism, this is tourism. People are buying the
              possibility to go up the piste on Everest. Everything is prepared: the doctors
              are there, the guides are there, the icefall doctors are there, and they go up.
              It’s not every year that they prepare them and if the Sherpas or local guides
              do not prepare the mountains, nobody goes up. Two years ago when Everest
              was closed after the avalanche and the Nepalese [government] allowed the
              Sherpas to prepare Manaslu. So immediately 200 people changed from [climbing]
              Everest to Manaslu because they had a piste built up there. They [climbers] did
              not go to Kanchenjunga where nobody had prepared anything.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So climbing on Everest has drastically
              changed over the past two decades. In your own words: “Now, anyone with enough
              money can pay a commercial guide service to take them to the top. This isn’t
              true alpinism.” What’s your take on that?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Climbing
              Everest is becoming more like a business. But I think a commercial guide is not
              enough; you need a piste. Most of the commercial guides will not be able to go
              on Everest without a piste. [When I climbed Everest,] I could not start at
              midnight because then there was nothing but snow — no trail, nothing. A head
              lamp does not help because you won’t see anything and at the least one might
              end up finishing on the south face or the east face of the Everest. Now there
              is a piste and you can start during midnight and follow the footsteps.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sherpa climbers face various issues and
              resentment among Sherpas is increasing each year. What do you think is the real
              problem and what do you suggest to resolve this? </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              think there are two problems regarding the Sherpas. The Sherpas know that they
              are the key figures for success for their clients and the young Sherpas are
              beginning to wonder why they [climbers] are coming with foreign organizers.
              They [foreign organizers] make a lot of money because they sell Everest climbs
              for up to $90,000 to $100,000. The sherpas do it now for about $30,000, all
              inclusive. They would like to have the market in their own hands and I think
              slowly they will be able to do it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Before
              it was not a business for the Sherpa people. On my expedition, no Sherpa was
              able to go out in front one meter; he followed. We went, we put the ladders in,
              and we did some fixed ropes and they followed, prepared the food, put up the
              tent, and went back again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              remember very well I did the whole Lhotse face when preparing for our
              expedition. Only one of the Austrians helped me and partly I was alone. The
              Sherpas were following me and they had the ropes. But I went ahead. If I would
              say, “Now I’m tired, you go ahead,” They would say, “No, we follow on the fixed
              ropes.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And,
              now it’s exactly the opposite. All this is done by the Sherpas. They are very
              good climbers and they can guide like the alpine guides. The best guides in the
              Himalayas are Sherpas today. And these organizers need the Sherpas to guide
              their clients up to the summit. The Sherpas have a lot of experience, they know
              where things are dangerous and how to behave.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What is your message or advice to
              climbers wishing to summit Mount Everest in 2017 given the season is soon
              approaching?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              think they have to be careful. We do not know what is happening and how the
              Sherpas will make the rope line. But I think now they are climbing again in the
              center of the icefall. When they had this big avalanche when 16 people died,
              they were too much on the left side. I was at the base camp and I told them
              that you’re too much on the left side, because if ice breaks, you’re under it.
              And this is what happened afterwards. Staying on the left and right side is
              dangerous. There are deep crevasses which can open and a ladder can break; many
              other things are possible.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Any
              special message is not helpful. People are not listening; they only listen if
              they die there – and then it’s too late. They have the feeling that nothing can
              happen, but still it’s dangerous. I would say that some non-climbers are
              starting to climb without some infrastructure. All these people are not able to
              climb Mount Blanc; they are blindly following this line and they do not know
              what is happening up there. Often when I give a lecture some young managers come
              to me and say, “Mr. Messner, I would also like to go to Mount Everest. How do I
              have to prepare?”  I ask them, “Which mountains have you have already
              climbed up to now?” And they say none of them, and I tell them it’s better to
              start learning about climbing and start with smaller mountains. And all of a
              sudden they’re saying, “But my secretary did it last year so I would also like
              to do it.” (big laugh).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Could you share your special
              relationship with Tibetan Buddhism?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              approach to Tibetan Buddhism is double.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">First,
              Tibetan culture is a special culture. I’m not a Buddhist but the Milarepa [a
              famous Tibetan Yogi] is one of the most important mountaineers for me of all
              time. The European, American, and Japanese world is based on consumption and
              this is one of the world’s biggest problems today. The world is becoming more
              and more a consuming world. And the Milarepa philosophy focuses on doing
              exactly the opposite — that is to live and have a minimalist lifestyle and I
              truly believe in that.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Secondly,
              I wish that the Tibetan people would get autonomy. When I was in Brussels I had
              many contacts with the Dalai Lama and I also went to China to discuss these
              things but the Chinese were very strict. But you have to know that now there is
              a small hope. These Tibetan stones and Tibetan art are not mostly bought by the
              Swiss, the English, or by me. The market is now in Hong Kong and young rich
              Chinese are paying a fortune to get Tibetan art. That means they respect it and
              if they come in power they will change their behavior in front of Tibetans. I
              have hope now that slowly, by discussing the whole issue, it would be possible
              to give Tibetans their autonomy. And only if the Tibetans become autonomous and
              can save their culture and their religion will Tibet have more tourism. The
              Chinese will understand [that] because they always think in money.</span></p>
