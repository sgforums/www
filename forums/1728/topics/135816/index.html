From time immemorial it has been the practice for one Buddha to pass to his successor the quintessence of the Dharma, and for one Patriarch to transmit to another the esoteric teaching from heart to heart.</span></strong><br><br>The true mind can be transmitted via energy that would empty our mind temporarily and make us feel really peaceful and easy no matter what the medium is. ThatÂ’s why MahÃ¢kÃ¢Ãºyapa smiled on the Spiritual Mountain.<br><br>If youÂ’d like to experience it. There are many ways to do it. My advice is try to feel it from the sutras or any master who has the ability to do that. Personally, I recommend reciting the Diamond Sutra or studying the Platform Sutra.<br><br>Some of you may think this is outrageous and it's not the orthodox Buddha Dharma. In fact, it has been kept as a secret in the School of Patriarch ChÂ’an. And before the Sixth Patriarch, only a patriarch-to-be was eligible for transmission. However, Master Hui Neng shared it with all his pupils and all ChÂ’an masters thereafter. Since the energy is transmitted via media, it fades and accumulates with space and time. ThatÂ’s why I recommend the above Sutras. They have been blessed and strengthened by numerous masters.<br><br>However, not everyone can feel the transmission right away because barrier may block the transmission. Reciting the Diamond Sutra will remove the barrier gradually.<br><br>I like this forum. And this is what IÂ’d like to share with you all.<br></div>

Awaken to it!</div></blockquote>If someone asks us:<br><br>Awaken to what?<br>What is to be awakened?<br><br>How should we reply? The purpose is for us to realize Â‘what it isÂ’ through direct knowing. So there are two sayings from ChÂ’an masters,<br><br>If you open your mouth, then you are wrong. (kai ko gi tsou)<br>If you come up a thought, then you are in the wrong direction. (dun nien gi guai)<br><br>ItÂ’s beyond languages and words. ItÂ’s non-dual. Anything we say about it is dual and wrong. Yet, how does a master know whether a pupil is enlightened or not, if his pupil cannot open his mouth and express it? ItÂ’s simple. The pupil can still speak or write. ItÂ’s only a matter of how he doest it. If he uses his analytical mind then he is wrong. If he uses his true mind then he is right. And how can we tell the difference? WeÂ’ll know if we are enlightened.<br><br>And by the way, if we are enlightened, we'll find Â‘somethingÂ’ there that we don't perceive it as Â‘somethingÂ’. But there is actually something there we clearly realize its existence. That is exactly the same thing that Master Hui Neng said in the Platform Sutra,<br><br>"I have an article which has no head, no name nor appellation, no front and no back. Do any of you know it?"<br></div>

Just retrace the wave of our thoughts back to its origin then we'll know what the ocean is.<br><br>And itÂ’s best to retrace it by asking a question. Such as Â‘Why am I alive?Â’ However, this question can be a good start only. The best question would be a question that is unable to break it down anymore. If we can find the ultimate question, and retrace it, it will be much faster.<br><br>The ultimate question would be: <strong><span class="large">Where is X from?</span></strong><br><br>And what does X stand for?<br><br></div>
