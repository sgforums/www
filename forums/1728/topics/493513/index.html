              Nagarasobhanis need recognition for legalised sex trade ? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">2017-02-20 Daily Mirror
              K.K.S Perera</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><em style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Gauthama Buddha not only accepted an
              invitation for alms by  Ambapali, but acknowledged a donation of ashram by
              the lady sex-worker  of Vaisali. On another occasion the Buddha used a
              corpse of a prostitute  to convey a message to those who patronised her
              services by spending  thousands of Kahavanu for a night. He first
              auctioned the carcass, there  were no bidders—next he offered it free, yet
              there was no response :  perhaps they gained insight over the repulsive
              nature of human body. Sex for sale is an ancient profession that needs to
              be legalised.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Roughly
              speaking, there are two types of prostitutes: those enforced into the trade by
              social deprivation or poverty [harlot, street walker or bandhaka in Buddhist
              literature] and those who wished to do it as they feel it is a convenient way
              to earn ‘good money’; this type is called a courtesan [ganika or
              nagarasobhini]. The intention of the first is survival and is therefore,
              karmmically far less harmful than the other type whose motive might be lack of self-respect.
              The first is not gladly involved in wrong occupation while the second obviously
              is. Buddha or kings never attempted to punish or ban the profession. Buddhist
              literature is full of stories about ganika or nagarasobhinis. The story of 30
              young men and 29 wives plus a harlot hired by the only bachelor in a group of
              excursionists accidentally meet the Buddha while searching for the missing
              harlot, who vanished with valuables collected from the affluent party. The term
              ‘sex worker’ was coined in 1978 by sex worker activist Carol Leigh. Its use
              became fashionable after publication of the text, ‘Sex Work: Writings By Women
              In The Sex Industry’ in 1987. The term “sex worker” is widely used, including
              in academic work by agencies, such as WHO.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hazards of ‘free operation’….  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              use our laws to prohibit, ban and arrest the ‘wrongdoers’ or sex workers’ like
              in most other countries, where sex workers are regarded as worthy of disgrace,
              disapproval and marginalized preventing them from seeking legal redress for
              discrimination that deem them spreaders of disease. We think they are a public
              nuisance and offenders against decency. Sex workers never disclose their work
              to medical authorities due to fear of such disapproval. The criminalization of
              sex trade leads to reluctance in disclosure as there is very little legal
              protection for them. In many cases, a victimized sex worker may not be able to
              take action against her attacker. Many sex workers, as per research do not use
              condoms due to the fear of confrontation and cruelty from clients. Education
              about disease prevention through condom use and other health practices needs a
              legally monitored healthcare system.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“All
              professions are conspiracies against the laity” - said George Bernard Shaw -
              the oldest profession is not excluded.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              society must treat all professions alike without discrimination. It’s worth
              noting here what “Tina” Fey, the American actress, comedian, writer and
              producer once said, “Politics and prostitution have to be the only jobs where
              inexperience is considered a virtue. In what other profession would you brag
              about not knowing stuff?   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">They
              rightfully opposed Casinos, the idea was dropped; but hoards of ‘imported’
              labour, working at construction sites since then have encouraged the trade.
              Latest news warns of brothels mushrooming around their lodging places in the
              city where long queues of mongoloids waiting for their turn are seen. 
               </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Kalidasa, Kumaradasa and Royal
              Courtesan   </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hindu
              Scriptures always condemned Prostitution. Parashara Smriti says, ‘selling Wine
              and meat, consuming prohibited foods, patronizing prostitutes a shoodra falls
              from his caste’. But the greatest Indian poet Kalidasa, a Classical Sanskrit
              writer and dramatist was murdered by a courtesan in Sri Lanka during the reign
              of King Kumaradasa 513-522 AD. Kumaradasa, the poet and the son of King
              Mugalan, who defeated brother Kassapa of Lion Rock Sigiriya, during his
              eighteen year-stay in India had developed a close friendship with Kalidasa, the
              poet, dramatist and literati. Having read Janakiharanaya authored by the King,
              an elated poet visited him in Sri Lanka. During his sojourn Kalidasa patronised
              a ‘high-end’ courtesan and found two lines of an incomplete poem inscribed on
              the wall of her luxurious bedroom.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">‘The bee settled to draw the nectar  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              the lotus with tender care’ , - [The forest bee got to the honey without
              hurting the flower, but got away only in the morning when the lily unfolded its
              petals.] The king who visited the ‘lady’ on an earlier occasion, and whilst in
              the passionate company of her, inspired by a bee entangled in the petals of a
              lotus flower, wrote the two poetic lines, and offered an incentive to anybody
              who could complete the other two lines. Kalidasa recognized the handwriting of
              his friend Kumaradasa, and wanted to take the King by surprise, he completed
              the verse which read,‘Bursting the ensnaring petals it escaped like ensnared
              here the whole night awake,’ - [The relation of the sun seeking the society of
              the lotus-eyed enjoyed, indeed, her company , but sleepless was caught in his
              toils].  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              courtesan was plagued with greed. The woman seized the opportunity; she
              murdered Kalidasa, concealed the body in order to claim the reward for herself.
              The king in turn on his next visit recognised Kalidasa’s handwriting bringing
              the whole fatal trick to light. As the story goes, at the State funeral
              accorded to his friend, King Kumaradasa, unable to stand the grief, he king
              threw himself upon flames of the pyre, followed by his five ‘Queens’. Though
              the validity or accuracy of the story, given in semi-historical records namely,
              Pujavaliya and Perakumba Sirita cannot be completely trusted, we could
              reasonably surmise that the Kings and their ilk [while enjoying the comforts of
              five queens] also frequented Deluxe abodes of ‘Royal Courtesans’ in the
              good-old days as well.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Sex workers never disclose their
              work to medical authorities due to fear of such disapproval. The
              criminalization of sex trade leads to reluctance in disclosure as there is very
              little legal protection for them"</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist views on the practice  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              does not support or oppose prostitution. Gauthama Buddha only seized an
              opportunity to prove a point or to explain that prostitution is an unpleasant
              act. Buddhists do not look down upon the worker. It provided and encouraged the
              practitioners an opportunity to practice dharma, that they have an equal
              opening to become liberated.   </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There’s
              no concept of sexual offence in Buddhism, that being a sex worker is morally
              wrong. It may be or it may not be, depending upon the person. Sex work takes a
              profound toll on a person physically and psychologically. It’s probably not the
              best occupation to get into if you want a peaceful and steady life. But having
              said so, there is no crime involved and it surely wouldn’t be unconditionally
              forbidden.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Legality of profession in ancient India  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Lords, Senators, Merchants, Generals; everyone had one wish.....get married to
              beautiful Ammbapali [Amrapali]. The State decided to make her a prostitute,
              they thought it was dangerous to hand over Amrapali to any one, that others
              would not accept it simply. It would create violence in Vaishali, the most
              influential democracy of ancient India. Amrapali was forced to be a ‘Nagar
              Vadhu’ meaning ‘wife of the city’, a prostitute, by order of Parliament.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddha never looked down upon sex workers. On the contrary he provided a chance
              for them to go into the correct path in the same manner as anybody else. When
              he accepted the invitation from Ambapali for lunch; the Licchavi princes
              offered an invitation too. He declined it honouring Ambapali’s. Jivaka, the
              Buddha’s physician was mothered by a prostitute. He was never grimaced upon for
              his birth. There are many instances where prostitutes attained enlightenment,
              after being diligently practised Dhamma. In fact, the experience of a
              prostitute might help her towards illumination sooner than others. Although
              cherished as the original expressions of the Buddha, these teachings were
              preserved vocally for about four centuries before being scripted, providing
              many openings for some passages to be intentionally or inadvertently
              ‘corrected’ by people less enlightened than the Buddha.  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Legal dimensions of sex work  </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Exchange
              of sexual services for money is legal in England, but a few related activities,
              like soliciting in a public place and owning or managing a brothel and pimping
              are crimes. Pornography is legal in the USA, but prostitution is illegal in
              most States. However, in other nations, both prostitution and pornography are
              illegal; whereas, in some both are legal. However, those who oppose the
              legalisation of the sex trade argue that it is naturally unfair and can never
              be practised in a way that compliments the rights of those who engaged in it.
              The World Health Organization recommends decriminalization of sex work. A
              recent WHO report says, “Violence against sex workers is associated with
              inconsistent condom use or lack of condom use, and with increased risk of STI
              and HIV infection. Violence also prevents sex workers from accessing HIV
              information and services.”  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Lancet, the top medical journal published that there is “no other option” to
              decriminalization of sex work in order to protect participants from HIV. Rhode
              Island legalized prostitution in 1980 by accident. When lawmakers deemed the
              State statute on prostitution to be overly broad they unintentionally removed
              the part defining the act itself as an offence while trying to revise it; they
              didn’t realize the error for two decades. This caused the new cases of
              gonorrhoea among women statewide to decline by 39%, over the next six years.
              Interestingly, sexual brutality also declined by 30%.   </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              a first step, the health and law enforcement authorities may carry out a
              research on the local sex trade prior to introduction of guidelines regulating
              the running of ‘ill-famed’ houses - the legal draughtsman could prepare the
              basic structure for liberalizing the trade on lines of similar legislation in
              other nations. The indecencies are not prostitutes; it’s the poverty which is
              indecent, and the criminal unreliability of the rulers who make this poverty a
              deadening certainty. </span></p>
