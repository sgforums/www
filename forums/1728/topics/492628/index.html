              globalization of religious terrorism</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Wibawanto Nugroho |
              September 9 2016 | </span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; ">Jakarta Post</span><span style='font-size: 9.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>‎</span><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: 18.7pt; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Acta-Book","serif";  '> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Terrorism is a multidimensional phenomenon, and until today
              the existence and latent threat of Islamist terrorism confronts global society
              with formidable challenges. As a global phenomenon, it is indeed easy to
              recognize the manifestation of terrorism, but it is rather difficult to clearly
              define it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">However, based on at least 109 available definitions of
              terrorism, the key elements are obvious: violence; targeting of civilians and
              noncombatants; intention of spreading fear; and political aims that can be
              mixed with ideological and religious ones. This common denominator reflects the
              utility of terror as a tool of change used throughout human history.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As an old tactic, terrorism has been used by governments to
              suppress revolution as well as by revolutionaries seeking to overthrow
              governments. The terrorist, whether in possession of or in want of governmental
              power, uses terror to achieve a political, social or religious goal. Modern
              terrorism is at least 200 years old and has not aged a day.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Religious terrorism is even older, reaching back more than
              2,000 years in Hinduism (the Thugs), Judaism (the Zealot Zicariis), Islam (the
              Assassins during the Turkish Seljuk Empire), and Christianity (the Ku Klux Klan
              in the US).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In the early 1980s, the world entered the era of a modern
              religious terrorist movement, which is not limited to any one state, which is
              bound by a rationality incomprehensible through secular thought, and which has
              religious symbolic meaning in its commitment to change the structure of
              society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Al-Qaeda and its associated movements, including the
              so-called Islamic State (IS), are part of this wave, and they have the
              strategic aim of establishing a global Islamic caliphate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Correspondingly, by definition Islamist terrorism is a form of
              political violence that is partly manifested in the form of terrorism as a
              criminalized armed tactic that rejects democracy and pluralism while aiming to
              produce sudden, deep socio-political economic changes and legitimating the
              violent action by selective, extreme interpretations of Islamic texts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The religion itself is actually not the inherent cause of
              violence or terrorism, since violence might occur with or without religious
              context. However, religion provides symbols that make horrific bloodshed easier
              to vindicate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Jews and Christians, as well as Muslims, have much to answer
              for as fomenters of religious terror. Nevertheless, the Islamist fanatics have
              a much greater opportunity for mayhem because of the alienated hordes in the
              Middle East that see no hope at all in the status quo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The opportunity created by despair and rage, not the
              intrinsic elements of the religion itself, give Islam an edge over Christianity
              and Judaism as a force for terror.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Consequently, the cure for religious violence may ultimately
              lie in a renewed appreciation of religion itself and in the acknowledgement of
              religion in public life. The solution is not secularization, but a
              renewed/revived understanding of religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As for Indonesia, this great archipelago actually used to be
              a Buddhist, Hindu and Christian nation before the arrival of Islam. The coming
              of Islam to Indonesia in the 14th century was filtered by the preexisting
              culture, thus making Islam in Indonesia an Indonesian version of Islam.
              However, over the years the streams of transnational Islamist movements from
              the Middle East began to transform the Indonesian version of Islam into the
              “pure”/Middle Eastern version of Islam.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The Middle Eastern influence appears a profound one on
              Indonesian radical fundamentalists. The dissemination of ideas from the Middle
              East to Southeast Asia is actually grounded in age-old cross-regional and
              global processes of the transference of ideas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">New methods of communication (i.e. the internet and physical
              transportation) further facilitate the general process of the globalization of
              Islam, including the dissemination of radical fundamentalist ideas to the
              Indonesian archipelago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The fundamentalist movements, consisting of Islamist
              transnational movements, have similar characteristics, which are part of the
              international Sunni pan-Islamist political movement. They are commonly
              associated with a goal of unifying all Muslim countries under an Islamic
              caliphate ruled by Islamic law and led by a caliph as the head of state elected
              by Muslims.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Having identified such global patterns, Indonesia should
              address this particular phenomenon as no longer a tactical, temporary
              phenomenon, but as a strategic, national security threat, which in turn calls
              for the involvement of all instruments of national power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Historically, Indonesia’s national security is characterized
              by the fact that global conflicts would always permeate through Indonesian
              society, so the Indonesian government must be vigilant about the threat of
              global violent Islamist movements permeating through Indonesian society and
              exacerbating potential domestic conflicts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">All that said, to better formulate the right counterterrorism
              policy, strategy, and operations for our nation, we should engage terrorism
              from four levels of analysis: individual, group, state and world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Ending terrorism should become the goal of any
              counterterrorism policy and strategy, and this is not a simple task.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In dealing with radical Islamist groups, the Indonesian
              government so far has engaged in decapitation through eliminating group
              leaders, negotiation and repression.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">However, the case of the Santoso terrorist group, which
              recently lost its leader in a security operation and saw many of its members
              captured, suggests that violent Islamist groups in Indonesia do not simply
              self-implode when they fail to reach their ultimate goals, but rather
              transition to another modus operandi, where their cells engage in illegal
              criminal activities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">There is no guarantee that they have abandoned their goal of
              establishing an Islamic state and will refrain from terrorist attacks in the
              future.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Unity between the national security apparatus, the government
              and the people is highly relevant in protracted counterterrorism struggles,
              since in the view of Islamist radicals, they are engaging in an unfinished war
              to achieve their utopian goals that may be unachievable during their lifetime,
              so their war becomes their heritage to future generations.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As a nation guided by the state ideology of Pancasila,
              Indonesia must be highly vigilant to ensure this country will become neither a
              producer of terrorists nor the battlefield of a global terrorist movement.</span></p>

When born in English speaking family, they learned English, when born in a Malay family, they acquired Malay, when in France, France language etc. Baby felt harmony when embraced Islam or Christian, Catholic faith since birth, gradually they absorbed the knowledge of possessive the faith and their terror or radical minds developed subtely, and much more stronger for some. Creating an Islamic state is not the cause of going heaven, in fact, it does more harm or sin to themselves, as it desired for a separate human identity instead of a humanity as a core basis. To attain heavenly status, they need to develop their personality of kindness, benevolence, tolerance and love, completely free from the stigma of race, sex, language and religion. The consistency of kindness and love towards all beings in their short lifespan on earth :)</p></div>
