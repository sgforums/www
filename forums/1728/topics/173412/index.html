I am not against wearing of amulets although I have no knowledge of it.<br><br>Reason why I mentioned Brahmanism is because Thai Buddhism was indeed influenced by Brahmanism/Hinduism. For example the 4 Faced Buddha is actually Brahmanism's Four-Faced-Brahma.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Thailand" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Thailand</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The second major influence on Thai Buddhism were Brahmanist beliefs received from Cambodia, particularly during the Sukhothai period. Vedic Brahmanism played a strong rule in the early Thai institution of kingship, just as it did in Cambodia, and exerted influence in the creation of laws and order for Thai society as well as Thai religion. Certain rituals practiced in modern Thailand, either by monks or by Brahmanist ritual specialists, are either explictly identified as Brahmanist in origin, or are easily seen to be derived from Brahmanist practices. While the visibility of Brahmanism in Thai society has been diminished substantially during the Chakri dynasty, Brahmanist influences- particularly shrines to the god Brahma- continue to be seen in and around Buddhist institutions and ceremonies.</span></blockquote>Perhaps it is not Brahmanism but the animistic Thai culture that influenced the monks to make Buddha image amulets.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Animism antedated both Hinduism and Buddhism in Thailand and has persisted to the present day, chiefly in the form of spirit shrines in doors, yards and business premises.</span><br>-------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">In his work, A Model for the Study of Thai Buddhism (Journal of Asian Studies vol xxxv, No. 3, May 1976), B J Terwiel presents an analysis of the Magico mystical base of the religion and the animistic order of the system at Wadsaancaw, the monastery, and area of study. The use of protective amulets and holy relics with the animistic spirit cosmology is similar to that found in Java and elsewhere in Indonesia and South East Asia.</span></div>

Born in Kumpangpetch province, he was, by some accounts, the son of King Rama I. He studied the Buddhist scriptures of the PÃ¢li Canon with several Buddhist masters. After becomeing a well-known monk, he became the preceptor for Prince Mongkut, later King Rama IV, when Mongkut became a monk. It was during Rama IV's reign that Somdej Toh was given the ceremonial name Phra Bhudhacharn Promrangsi; during this time, Toh was living in Wat Rakang Kositaram. He was noted for the skill of his preaching and his use of Thai poetry to reflect the beauty of Buddhism.<br><br>In a retreat, Phra buddhacharn Toh was in a deep samadhi meditation. In his vision, He saw bright light shining towards his direction and an bright image of Buddha appeared sitting in the cave like window whereby BuddhaCharn Toh Himself latter carved out the vision he encountered into clay powdered made pendents and present to the Thai King Rama royalty as a national blessings for the thai people.<br><br>The Buddhacharn Toh's somdej buddha images are some the of the most rare, ancient and sought after available anywhere. Many of these amulets were created by Buddhist Monks who dedicated their entire lives to the betterment of mankind through the promotion of a peace and tranquility as laid out by the principals of the Great Buddha. The Thai amulets pictured in this site are from Temples in Thailand and date back as far as 1300 years, each having a unique history and in many cases a story that has been passed down through generations.<br><br>Thai Amulet forms were created and blessed in temples by revered Monks from ancient till present era ; one of the most notable being Somdej Puttajarn (Toh) who made the highly prized Somdej amulets from Wat Rakang, Wat Bang Khun Prom and Wat Gad Chiyo some 140 years ago. This monk holds a high place in the hearts and minds of the people of Thailand since he was instrumental in the teaching and training of the countries most famous King V (Somdej Phra Julajomklaw Jawouhou): In later years King V extended the ultimate honor and title of Somdej back to him. King V is most noted as being responsible for opening up the world to Thailand (then Siam). He was the first King to travel extensively around the world meeting Kings, Queens and heads of state spreading awareness of his country and of the great Buddha. During his travels he presented as good will gifts, Somdej Thai amulets (made by Somdej Puttajarn Toh) to those he met.<br><br>Thai amulets have 4 main categories: Powder based Amulets; Clay based Amulets; Metal based Amulets and Thai Medallions.<br><br><img src="http://www.buddha-image.com/images/somdej_toh.jpg"><br><br>Phra Buddhacharn Toh of Wat Rakang, blessed and made top famous Wat Rakang Somdej. Venerable passed away in B.E 2415 at the age of 85. His somdej amulets are blessed with ChinnaBangchorn Gatha (Pali: Jinapanjara Gatha). Materials for making the somdej comprises of: Shell limes, Phong Vises, assorted flowers from shine, rice remains after his meals, lotus. banana, ashes from the burner urn, candle wax, honey and tang oil etc.<br><br>There is a very holy mirage story about somdej image.<br><br>A century plus ago, King Rama 5th, visited Europe 1st time in B.E 2440. One day, King Rama 5th visited the Germany Emperor William Kaiser. Suddenly, Emperor Kaiser saw bright coloured rainbow light shines out of King Rama's top upper pocket. Emperor Kaiser was very excited and anxious. So King Rama took out the Pra SomdeJ Phim Song Kaiser that made by Phra Buddhacharn Toh and presented to Emperor Kaiser.<br><br><img src="http://www.thai-amulets.com/amulets/kaiser_small.jpg"><br><br>After Emperor Kaiser seen that somdej image, he proclaimed in German essence," Lime...? Shine...!!? Interesting !!!" King Rama knew Emperor Kaiser shown great interest and love towards this somdej image. Later King Rama 5th explained the origins of this somdej image and present this Somdej to Emperor Kaiser as a gift of friendship and mutual peace harmony of Thailand and the western powers.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I hope my writings will clear the doubts of all misunderstanding of Thai amulets. As I know that there are many commercial dealing of Thai amulets going on in the market, but this shall not diminished one's faith in the Buddha Dharma esp Thai Therevada Buddhism. Dharma is always pure, but depends how we intrepret it and view it.....Sadhu...sadhu....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

However the four-faced Buddha is still a direct influence of Brahmanism. The thing about Buddhism is that its quite flexible so its ok (Buddhism from different places have different cultural influences), as long as they remember only the Triple Gems are worthy sources of refuge, and not to be too superstitious about anything in particular.</div>
