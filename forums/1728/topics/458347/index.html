              </p><p>From Sutra,</p>
              <p>Robe offering, extremely glorious.</p>
              <p>Always born in high cast and have good physical shape.</p>
              <p>A person will have sense of good conscience.</p>
              <p>Person will be renowned due to having accumulated the good karma.</p>
              <p>~ by Buddha.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this life the person will be free from obstacle, healthy and have perfect body form. Success will be attained in business, good fortune and possessions will be obtained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The act of offering robes to the Sangha, it’s a symbol of offering protection from the heat and cold. Due to this merit accumulated, in the next life the person will be</p>
              <p>1) Liberated from the suffering of the hell (hot and cold realms).</p>
              <p>2) By doing this action of robe dana, one will be free from the suffering of hungry ghost realm (thirst and hunger).</p>
              <p>3) Take rebirth in the human form with complete perfect physical shape, attractive, conceivably pleasant and beautiful. Having high status like the lineage of a King. One will have a good sense of conscience and integrity, well esteemed by others, peace and happiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having accumulated good karma by this deed, for e.g. – In the past the Brahmin offered a white robe to the Buddha Bhagavan. The Buddha then prophesized him to be born in the future as Ngonshy Zangpo, who attained Buddhahood from the merits of offering the robe to Buddha. Likewise these are the great benefits of offering robes to the Sangha. </p>

              <p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha’s Park.</p>
              <p>2. Then MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ« took a new pair of cloths and went to the
               Blessed One. After paying homage to him, she sat down at one side and 
              said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir, this new pair of cloths has 
              been spun by me, woven by my, especially for the Blessed One. Venerable 
              sir, let the Blessed One accept it from me out of compassion.”</p>
              <p>When this was said, the Blessed One told her: “Give it to the Sangha,
               GotamÄ«. When you give it to the Sangha, both I and the Sangha will be 
              honored.”</p>
              <p>A second time and a third time she said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir,…accept it from me out of compassion.”</p>
              <p>A second time and a third time the Blessed One told her: “Give it to 
              the Sangha, GotamÄ«. When you give it to the Sangha, both I and the 
              Sangha will be honored.”</p>
              <p>3. Then the venerable Ä€nanda said to the Blessed One: “Venerable sir,
               let the Blessed One accept the new pair of cloths from MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« 
              GotamÄ«. MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ« has been very helpful to the Blessed One, 
              venerable sir. As his mother’s sister, she was his nurse, his foster 
              mother, the one who gave him milk. She suckled the Blessed One when his 
              own mother died. The Blessed One too has been very helpful to 
              MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ«, venerable sir. It is owing to the Blessed One that 
              MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ« abstains from killing living beings, from taking 
              what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false 
              speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants, which are the basis of 
              negligence. It is owing to the Blessed One that MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ« 
              possesses perfect confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, 
              and that she possesses the virtues loved by noble ones. It is owing to 
              the Blessed One that MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ« is free from doubt about 
              suffering, about the origin of suffering, about the cessation of 
              suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering. The 
              Blessed One has been very helpful to MahÄ�pajÄ�patÄ« GotamÄ«.</p>
              <p>4. “That is so, Ä€nanda, that is so! When one person, owing to 
              another, has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, I
               say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying 
              homage to him, rising up for him, according him reverential salutation 
              and polite services, and by providing robes, almsfood, resting places, 
              and medicinal requisites.</p>
              <p>“When one person, owing to another, has come to abstain from killing 
              living beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual
               pleasures, from false speech, and from wine, liquor, and intoxicants, 
              which are the basis of negligence, I say that it is not easy for the 
              former to repay the latter by paying homage to him…and medicinal 
              requisites.</p>
              <p>“When one person, owing to another, has come to possess perfect 
              confidence in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and possesses the 
              virtues loved by noble ones, I say that it is not easy for the former to
               repay the latter by paying homage to him…and medicinal requisites.</p>
              <p>“When one person, owing to another, has become free from doubt about 
              suffering, about the origin of suffering, about the cessation of 
              suffering, and about the way leading to the cessation of suffering, I 
              say that it is not easy for the former to repay the latter by paying 
              homage to him…and medicinal requisites.</p>
              <p>5. “There are fourteen kinds of personal offerings, Ä€nanda. One gives
               a gift to the TathÄ�gata, accomplished and fully enlightened; this is 
              the first kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to a 
              paccekabuddha; this is the second kind of personal offering. One gives a
               gift to an arahant disciple of the TathÄ�gata; this is the third kind of
               personal offering. One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way
               to the realization of the fruit of arahantship; this is the fourth kind
               of personal offering. One gives a gift to a non-returner; this is the 
              fifth kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to one who has entered
               upon the way to the realization of the fruit of non-return; this is the
               sixth kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to a once-returner; 
              this is the seventh kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to one 
              who has entered upon the way to the realization of the fruit of 
              once-return; this is the eighth kind of personal offering. One gives a 
              gift to a stream-enterer; this is the ninth kind of personal offering. 
              One gives a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realization 
              of the fruit of stream-entry; this is the tenth kind of personal 
              offering. One gives a gift to one outside [the Dispensation] who is free
               from lust for sensual pleasures; this is the eleventh kind of personal 
              offering. One gives a gift to a virtuous ordinary person; this is the 
              twelfth kind of personal offering. One gives a gift to an immoral 
              ordinary person; this is the thirteenth kind of personal offering. One 
              gives a gift to an animal; this is the fourteenth kind of personal 
              offering.</p>
              <p>6. “Herein, Ä€nanda, by giving a gift to an animal, the offering may 
              be expected to repay a hundredfold. By giving a gift to an immoral 
              ordinary person, the offering may be expected to repay a thousandfold. 
              By giving a gift to a virtuous ordinary person, the offering may be 
              expected to repay a hundred-thousandfold. By giving a gift to one 
              outside [the Dispensation] who is free from lust for sensual pleasures, 
              the offering may be expected to repay a hundred-thousand times a 
              hundred-thousandfold.</p>
              <p>“By giving a gift to one who has entered upon the way to the 
              realization of the fruit of stream-entry, the offering may be expected 
              to repay incalculably, immeasurably. What, then, should be said about 
              giving a gift to a stream-enterer? What should be said about giving a 
              gift to one who has entered upon the way to the realization of the fruit
               of once-return…to a once-returner…to one who has entered upon the way 
              to the realization of the fruit of non-return…to a non-returner… to one 
              who has entered upon the way to the realization of the fruit of 
              arahantship…to an arahant…to a paccekabuddha? What should be said about 
              giving a gift to a TathÄ�gata, accomplished and fully enlightened?</p>
              <p>7. “There are seven kinds of offerings made to the Sangha, Ä€nanda. 
              One gives a gift to a Sangha of both [bhikkhus and bhikkhunÄ«s] headed by
               the Buddha; this is the first kind of offering made to the Sangha. One 
              gives a gift to a Sangha of both [bhikkhus and bhikkhunÄ«s] after the 
              TathÄ�gata has attained final NibbÄ�na; this is the second kind of 
              offering made to the Sangha. One gives a gift to a Sangha of bhikkhus; 
              this is the third kind of offering made to the Sangha. One gives a gift 
              to a Sangha of bhikkhunÄ«s; this is the fourth kind of offering made to 
              the Sangha. One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many bhikkhus and 
              bhikkhunÄ«s for me from the Sangha’; this is the fifth kind of offering 
              made to the Sangha. One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many bhikkhus 
              for me from the Sangha’; this is the sixth kind of offering made to the 
              Sangha. One gives a gift, saying: ‘Appoint so many bhikkhunÄ«s for me 
              from the Sangha’; this is the seventh kind of offering made to the 
              Sangha.</p>
              <p>8. “In future times, Ä€nanda, there will be members of the clan who 
              are ‘yellow-necks,’ immoral, of evil character. People will give gifts 
              to those immoral persons for the sake of the Sangha. Even then, I say, 
              an offering made to the Sangha is incalculable, immeasurable. And I say 
              that in no way is a gift to a person individually ever more fruitful 
              than an offering made to the Sangha.</p>
              <p>9. “There are, Ä€nanda, four kinds of purification of offering. What 
              four? There is the offering that is purified by the giver, not by the 
              receiver. There is the offering that is purified by the receiver, not by
               the giver. There is the offering that is purified neither by the giver 
              nor by the receiver. There is the offering that is purified both by the 
              giver and the receiver.</p>
              <p>10. “And how is the offering purified by the giver, not by the 
              receiver? Here the giver is virtuous, of good character, and the 
              receiver is immoral, of evil character. Thus the offering is purified by
               the giver, not by the receiver.</p>
              <p>11. “And how is the offering purified by the receiver, not by the 
              giver? Here the giver is immoral, of evil character, and the receiver is
               virtuous, of good character. Thus the offering is purified by the 
              receiver, not by the giver.</p>
              <p>12. “And how is the offering purified neither by the giver nor by the
               receiver? Here the giver is immoral, of evil character, and the 
              receiver is immoral, of evil character. Thus the offering is purified 
              neither by the giver nor by the receiver.</p>
              <p>13. “And how is the offering purified both by the giver and by the 
              receiver? Here the giver is virtuous, of good character, and the 
              receiver is virtuous, of good character. Thus the offering is purified 
              both by the giver and by the receiver. These are the four kinds of 
              purification of offering.”</p>
              <p>14. That is what the Blessed One said. When the Sublime One had said that, the Teacher said further:</p>
              <p>“When a virtuous person to an immoral person gives</p>
              <p>With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained,</p>
              <p>Placing faith that the fruit of action is great,</p>
              <p>The giver’s virtue purifies the offering.</p>
              <p>When an immoral person to a virtuous person gives</p>
              <p>With untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtained,</p>
              <p>Nor places faith that the fruit of action is great,</p>
              <p>The receiver’s virtue purifies the offering.</p>
              <p>When an immoral person to an immoral person gives</p>
              <p>With untrusting heart a gift unrighteously obtained,</p>
              <p>Nor places faith that the fruit of action is great,</p>
              <p>Neither’s virtue purifies the offering.</p>
              <p>When a virtuous person to a virtuous person gives</p>
              <p>With trusting heart a gift righteously obtained,</p>
              <p>Placing faith that the fruit of action is great,</p>
              <p>That gift, I say, will come to full fruition.</p>
              <p>When a passionless person to a passionless person gives</p>

              <p>provided you genuinely dunno they are fake monks. if you know that they are fake monks and you still chose to donate, there is still some merit cos  you are practising giving (dana).</p>
              <p>anyway if you think of getting good kamma or good merit by donating thus, that is not the correct way of practising.</p>

              <p>Hi Dawn, this part answers your question:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>8. “In future times, Ä€nanda, there will be members of the clan
                                          who are ‘yellow-necks,’ immoral, of evil character. People will
                                          give gifts to those immoral persons for the sake of the Sangha.
                                          Even then, I say, an offering made to the Sangha is incalculable,
                                          immeasurable. And I say that in no way is a gift to a person
                                          individually ever more fruitful than an offering made to the
                                          Sangha.</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you give a offering to an "immoral" monk or nun in the name of the Sangha as a whole, that merit is still immeasurably great.</p>
              <p>Now, even if you meet someone who is a "fake monk" - that means, he is not a monk at all but merely wearing fake robes, this is what the Buddha said:</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>6. “Herein, Ä€nanda, by giving a gift to an animal, the offering
                                      may be expected to repay a hundredfold. <strong>By giving a gift to an
                                      immoral ordinary person, the offering may be expected to repay a
                                      thousandfold.</strong> By giving a gift to a virtuous ordinary person, the
                                      offering may be expected to repay a hundred-thousandfold. By giving
                                      a gift to one outside [the Dispensation] who is free from lust for
                                      sensual pleasures, the offering may be expected to repay a
                                      hundred-thousand times a hundred-thousandfold.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
