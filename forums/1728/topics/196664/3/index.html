            <div class='col-md body'>Actually there are many cases of near death experiences. Out of body experiences etc. Some also recalled exact details of life experiences within that moment.<br><br>There was one moment I thought that I actually had died and I felt that I had a long fall. I initially thought that I am heading to hell, sadly. (But actually I just fainted on where I stood just at ground level). First indication of time is abstract.<br><br>Also from Ajahn Brahn talk, near death experiences some saw God, some saw Guan Yin and for some their respectively faith leaders. Each was very sure about what they saw and very convinced. But according to Him, it is really the works of the mind.<br><br>Ajahn Brahm has quite a records about this. I believe there is also a CD on "What Happen After Death".<br><br></div>
