When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the illusionary nature of the individuality, subject-object division does not take place.  A person experiencing Â“AMnessÂ” will find Â“AMness in everythingÂ”.  What is it like?<br><br>Being free individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness.  The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ residing anywhere, neither within nor without; rather it is experienced as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take place.  Even the moment of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it can be.  We cannot lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-emerges from it.  The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going.  This "AMness" is Â“GodÂ”.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>You are close, if I do not sound too arrogant for saying that.

            <div class='col-md body'>Anatta<br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br><br>The Buddhist term Anatman (Sanskrit) or Anatta (Pali) is an adjective that specifies the absence of a supposedly permanent and unchanging self or soul in any one of the psycho-physical (namo-rupa) constituents of empirical existence; eg. "none of these skandhas are my Soul, are anatta (non-Self)". What is normally thought of as the "Self" is in fact an agglomeration of constantly changing physical and mental constituents ("skandhas" ) which give rise to unhappiness if clung to as though this temporary assemblage formed some kind of immutable and enduring Soul ("atman" ).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anatta or soul-lessness<br><br>This Buddhist doctrine of rebirth should be distinguished from the theory of reincarnation which implies the transmigration of a soul and its invariable material rebirth. Buddhism denies the existence of an unchanging or eternal soul created by a God or emanating from a Divine Essence (Paramatma).<br><br>If the immortal soul, which is supposed to be the essence of man, is eternal, there cannot be either a rise or a fall. Besides one cannot understand why "different souls are so variously constituted at the outset."<br><br>"It should be said," writes Bertrand Russell, "that the old distinction between soul and body has evaporated quite as much because 'matter' has lost its solidity as mind has lost its spirituality. Psychology is just beginning to be scientific. In the present state of psychology belief in immortality can at any rate claim no support from science."<br><br>from: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/nutshell09.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/nutshell09.htm</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anatta - The Teaching on Not-Self<br>Who am I?<br>One of the most challenging teachings of Buddhism is that relating to the idea of 'not-self' or anatta. Whereas both Christianity and Islam have the notion of an individual soul, and whereas Hinduism has the idea of atman, Buddhism offers a different perspective altogether. Buddhism argues that there is no such thing as a permanent self or soul, a very difficult notion to grasp,  even on a conceptual level, let alone realizing it experientially. But if there is no such thing as a permanent self or soul, then the obvious question is - who is this person that eats, drinks, breathes, thinks, forms relationships and has a career? Who am I?<br><br>from: <a href="http://buddhism.about.com/library/weekly/aa070702a.htm" rel="nofollow">buddhism.about.com/library/weekly/aa070702a.htm</a></div>
