When the mind attempts to understand the phenomenon existence through our current mode of knowing that works through  comparison and measurement, the conclusion we derived seems paradoxical.  When we choose to see the 'arising', the thinking mind cannot see the cessation. Neither 'arising' nor 'cessation' 'is before nor after the other.  The sequence is caused by the mind.  By choosing one, it has to give up the other.  The thinking mind needs a base and the base becomes an 'entity', a ''something'.  That 'something', that 'entity' is required due to the poverty of our thinking mechanism, it is not the true face of reality.  A lighting flash of moment exhibits the entirety of the Dharma seals and it is only in Buddhism that is pointed out.  Not only that, Buddha also taught us the systematic way of developing the intuitive insight into reality.</div></blockquote>Buddha says: <span style="font-style: italic;">Subhuti, it is impossible to retain past mind, impossible to hold on to present mind, and impossible to grasp future mind for in none of its activities does the mind have substance or existence.</span><br><br>Past is 'present' memories, present is ungraspable obviously, future, just a mental concept or expectation. Empty.<br><br><blockquote>Everything we call "the past" is, literally, nothing but present memories. Likewise, everything we call "the future" is nothing but present memories inverted, or rearranged, to form a prediction or expectation. The appearance of "time" is little more than a trick of memory, as the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Ornament Scripture) says. You can easily discern this for yourself: simply figure out what it is you consider "the past" and "the future." You will discover that it is nothing but thoughts--nothing but memories, nothing but expectations, nothing but mental commentary. It's "all in your head," so to speak. There's really no such thing as time. There is really only Now--an eternally present Present with no beginning and no ending. Everything is completely new, distinct, and original every instant, with no real "change" or "motion" at all. The mystic-philosopher Heraclitus, explaining this point, said, "A man cannot step in the same river twice."</blockquote><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhism_and_the_illusion_of_time.htm</a><br><br>Now we all know that our body's cells are all totally renewed after 7 years, there is not a part of your body cell that remains the same after 7 years.

In answer to the question: "how can all these jewels be considered one jewel?" it is replied: "If you don't believe that one jewel...is all the jewels...just put a dot on the jewel [in question]. When one jewel is dotted, there are dots on all the jewels...Since there are dots on all the jewels...We know that all the jewels are one jewel" ...".<br><br>The moral of Indra's net is that the compassionate and the constructive interventions a person makes or does can produce a ripple effect of beneficial action that will reverberate throughout the universe or until it plays out. By the same token you cannot damage one strand of the web without damaging the others or setting off a cascade effect of destruction.<br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/the_wanderling/awakening101.html" rel="nofollow">Awakening 101</a><br><br>---<br><br>...One of the images used to illustrate the nature of reality as understood in Mahayana is The Jewel Net of Indra. According to this image, all reality is to be understood on analogy with Indra's Net. This net consists entirely of jewels. Each jewel reflects all of the other jewels, and the existence of each jewel is wholly dependent on its reflection in all of the other jewels. As such, all parts of reality are interdependent with each other, but even the most basic parts of existence have no independent existence themselves. <strong>As such, to the degree that reality takes form and appears to us, it is because the whole arises in an interdependent matrix of parts to whole and of subject to object. But in the end, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there is nothing (literally no-thing) there to grasp</span>....</strong><br><br>Source: <a href="http://www.purifymind.com/SunyataEmp.htm" rel="nofollow">Sunyata ('Emptiness')</a></div>

Are there Waves and Ocean?<br><br>Is there inherent emptiness without inherent existence?</div></blockquote>Quoted: (taking just one chunk out of the whole thing )<br><br>The concept of Universal oneness-- that things in their essential nature have no distinguishing marks-- is called " Sunyata". Sunyata means non substantiality, the un-born, having no self nature, no duality. It is because things in themselves have no form or characteristic that we can speak of them as neither born nor being destroyed. There is nothing about the essential nature of things that can be described in terms of discrimination; that is why things we called non-substantiable. As pointed out, All things appear &amp; disappear because of causes and conditions. Nothing ever exists entirely alone; everythings is in relation to everything else. Whenever there is light, there is shadow. Whenever, there is lengthy, there is shortness. Whenever there is head, there is tail of the coin. Just like these as the self nature of things cannot exist alone, they are called non-substantial. By the same reasoning, Enlightenment cannot exist apart from ignorance, nor ignorance apart from enlightenment. Since things do not differ in their essential reality, there can be no duality.<br><br>People cherish the distinction of purity and impurity, but in the nature of things, there is no such distinction, except as it raises from false and absurb imagines in their mind. In like manner, people make distinction between the good and evil, but good and evil does not exist separately. Those who are following the path to enlightenment recognize no such duality, and it leads them to neither praise the good and condemn the evil, nor depise the good and condone evil.People naturally fear misfortune and long for good fortune; but if the distinction are to studied carefully, misfortune often turns out to be good fortune and good fortune to be misfortune. The wiseman learns to meet the changing cirumstances of life with an equitable spirit, being either elated by success nor depressed by failure. Thus one realise the truth of non-duality.<br><br>Therefore, all words that express relations of duality such as existence and non-existence, good and evil; purity and impurity- none of these terms are of contrast in one thinkings are expressed or recongized in their true nature. When people keep free from such terms and emotion engendered by them, they realise Sunyata'S universal truth............<br><br>http://www.gotaro3.homestead.com/DalaiLama26.html<br></div>
