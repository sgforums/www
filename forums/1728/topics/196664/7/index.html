What is it like?<br><br>Being free individuality -- coming and going, life and death, all phenomenon merely pop in and out from the background of the AMness.  The AMness is not experienced as an Â‘entityÂ’ residing anywhere, neither within nor without; <strong>rather it is experienced as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take place</strong>.  Even the moment of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that reality; experiencing the Â‘RealÂ’ as clear as it can be.  We cannot lose that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-emerges from it.  The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going.
