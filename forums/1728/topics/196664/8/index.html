Obviously you are very confused right? </div></blockquote>There is nobody that life and death of the body does not belong to. Body is just body. Body (part of Form skhanda) and the other 4 skhandas make up the 5 skhandas that sentient beings commonly perceive to be self, but in reality, 5 skhandas are empty in nature. Empty not as non-existence, but as I described earlier, what exactly in 'weather' is real?<br><br>When I say "he who does not matter whether the body lives or dies", the "he" mentioned here is only for convinient way of saying. When enlightened there is no perception of a 'self'.<br><br><blockquote>Who must let go of "self?" Nobody? Nobody must let go of self? There is no entity? This non entity is in existence but is not an entity? How then does this non existing entity give up anything when it is non existing?</blockquote>There is no self, there is only the illusion of a self. And when the light of awareness/wisdom shines on that illusion, it is gone. It does not come from the effort of "I" but comes from our Buddha Nature.<br><br>Letting go comes from a flash of illumination, knowing that what "you" are holding is a hot charcoal, it is dukkha, the letting go is <strong>effortless and natural</strong>, meaning it does not come from the effort of a 'self'. This is probably what Lao Tzu meant by Non-action. In reality you don't need effort to let go, you only need effort to keep on holding the hot charcoal (i.e the illusion).<br><br>It can be likened to a dark room that has been dark for 5000 years, but once the door is opened, light pours into the room and illuminates everything.</div>
