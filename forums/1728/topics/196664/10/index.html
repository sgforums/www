            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Casino_King,<br><br>There could not be change unless something changes.  There must be someone there to think before thinking takes place.  Most of us have molded ourselves to perceive Reality in accordance to the grammatical structure and tenses of languages.  This takes place unknowingly and seems natural.  So much so that when there is this illumination of Consciousness as a ceaseless stream, effort to describe consciousness correctly becomes a problem.  Descriptions are presented in a manner that nouns become verbs; it becomes confusing and complex at times.  This I believe, is not a problem peculiar to you alone but in fact to any serious seekers when they first came into contact with the profound teaching of the doctrine of No-Self and Emptiness.<br><br>Why all the fuss? Is No-Self and Emptiness that important? What that is most problematic is how consciousness works and what happened when we identify and get attached.  The immense power of identification, I cannot help but to emphasize and re-emphasized.  A mere Â“identificationÂ” has such amazing power.  Fusing into all aspect of our experiences, mental, spiritual and physicalÂ…The weight, the burden and the suffering, like holding on to a charcoal and unwilling to drop.  How true is that? Again it is not in words, we have to experience the magical effect of identification and attachment ourselves.<br><br>Confusions can be quite frustrating and the degree of frustration differs according to oneÂ’s causes and conditions.  For you, I think the frustration is understandable but I believe it is nothing compared to some that have undergone certain transcendental experiences like Â“I AMnessÂ” or disassociation of consciousness from body, this doctrine can be really difficult for them to swallow.  Rare are those that have such experiences and still take patience to understand the profound teaching of the Blessed One.  The karmic affinity is strong.  I seriously do not want to make it a topic of argument; I do not have the capacity to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">   I hope that you can put sincere effort into understanding the meaning it and make discussion fruitful.  May patience be with us always.<br></div>

When the mind attempts to understand the phenomenon existence through our current mode of knowing that works through  comparison and measurement, the conclusion we derived seems paradoxical.  When we choose to see the 'arising', the thinking mind cannot see the cessation. Neither 'arising' nor 'cessation' 'is before nor after the other.  The sequence is caused by the mind.  By choosing one, it has to give up the other.  The thinking mind needs a base and the base becomes an 'entity', a ''something'.  That 'something', that 'entity' is required due to the poverty of our thinking mechanism, it is not the true face of reality.  A lighting flash of moment exhibits the entirety of the Dharma seals and it is only in Buddhism that is pointed out.  Not only that, Buddha also taught us the systematic way of developing the intuitive insight into reality.</div></blockquote></div>
