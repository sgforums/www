If God can be an object, then it is not the ultimate. Because if it is an object/thing/Being, then who is the creator of this object/thing/Being?</div></blockquote>GOD is Spirit according to the Bible. What is spirit, you might say? I can only speak based on my own relationship with God and I tell you that I have no wish to define God for you or anybody because as far as I am concern, GOD is beyond's any man's comprehension and you only communicate and have a relationship / be aware of God in your own life.<br><br>How a man ends up being aware and have a relationship with God is by being "born of the spirit." I certainly know that I was born again. When you are born again, "angels" and "heaven" and your whole being rejoices.<br><br>It is not much different then when a baby is born, except that this is personal. You are the one that rejoices with the "heavenly beings."<br><br>I put them all in " " because you might have a different understanding of those words in " " that I used.<br><br>Many Christians here cannot accept what I say, even though it was Jesus who said, "You must be Born Again" and "You must be born of the Spirit" and insists that it is simply "believe, have faith" and not a "new birth" in you (the other school hope that as long as you believe you then assume you have new birth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) As if you need to hope and not know something so obvious as a new birth in yourself.<br><br>I believe that Enlightenment has the same effect. If you are Enlightened please tell me what it is like.</div>
