              <p>Dharma can mean two things. One is the teachings of Buddha, the other is any kind of sensory objects. You must know which one is being spoken of, in your context, it is refering to mental impurities, it is not talking about Buddha's teachings.</p>
              <p>For example, 6 sense organs, 6 sense dust (objects), 6 sense consciousness altogether make up 18 dhatus.</p>
              <p>Then there are teachings such as our nature is like a mirror that is covered by dust (mental impurities) and hence obscuring its true light.</p>
              <p>However, this is also not a complete understanding, as Hui-Neng said -- originally Bodhi has no tree, the Mirror has no stand, where does dust alight? -- If you realise who you truly are, you will see that our true nature is fundamentally void, forever shining and pure from the beginning and never truly obscured at any moment.</p>
              <p>Yet, even that is also not a complete understanding, though it is description of his level of realisation at that moment, that verse is written before his 'great awakening' where he realised that "realized
                          that all Dharmas in the universe are the Essence of Mind itself." At this point he no longer separate Essence from Dharmas, for there is no 'essence' to speak of apart from phenomena.</p>

              <p>Ken Wilber:<span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br>There
               are many things that I can doubt, but I cannot doubt my own 
              consciousness in this moment. My consciousness IS, and even if I tried 
              to doubt it, it would be my consciousness doubting. I can imagine that 
              my senses are being presented with a fake reality – say, a completely 
              virtual reality or digital reality, which looks real but is merely a 
              series of extremely realist images. But even then, I cannot doubt the 
              consciousness that is doing the watching…<br><br>The very undeniability 
              of my present awareness, the undeniability of my consciousness, 
              immediately delivers to me a certainty of existence in this moment, a 
              certainty of Being in the now-ness of this moment. I cannot doubt 
              consciousness and Being in this moment, for it is the ground of all 
              knowing, all seeing, all existing…<br><br>Who am I? Ask that question 
              over and over again, deeply. Who am I? What is it in me that is 
              conscious of everything?<br><br>If you think that you know Spirit, or if
               you think you don’t, Spirit is actually that which is thinking both of 
              those thoughts. So you can doubt the objects of consciousness, but you 
              can never believably doubt the doubter, never really doubt the Witness 
              of the entire display. Therefore, rest in the Witness, whether it is 
              thinking that it knows God or not, and that witnessing, that undeniable 
              immediacy of now-consciousness, is itself God, Spirit, Buddha-mind. The 
              certainty lies in the pure self-felt Consciousness to which objects 
              appear, not in the objects themselves. You will never, never, never see 
              God, because God is the Seer, not any finite, mortal, bounded object 
              that can be seen…<br><br>This pure I AM state is not hard to achieve but
               impossible to escape, because it is ever present and can never really 
              be doubted. You can never run from Spirit, because Spirit is the Runner.
               To put it very bluntly, Spirit is not hard to find but impossible to 
              avoid: it is that which is looking at this page right now. Can’t you 
              feel That One? Why on earth do you keep looking for God when God is 
              actually the Looker?<br><br>Simply ask, Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?<br><br>I
               am aware of my feelings, so I am not my feelings – Who am I? I am aware
               of my thoughts, so I am not my thoughts – Who am I? Clouds float by in 
              the sky, thoughts float by in the mind, feelings float by in the body – 
              and I am none of those because I can Witness them all.<br><br>Moreover, I
               can doubt that clouds exist, I can doubt that feelings exist, I can 
              doubt that objects of thought exist – but I cannot doubt that the 
              Witness exists in this moment, because the Witness would still be there 
              to witness the doubt.<br><br>I am not objects in nature, not feelings in
               the body, not thoughts in the mind, for I can Witness them all. I am 
              that Witness – a vast, spacious, empty, clear, pure, transparent 
              Openness that impartially notices all that arises, as a mirror 
              spontaneously reflects all its objects…<br><br>You can already feel some
               of this Great Liberation in that, as you rest in the ease of witnessing
               this moment, you already feel that you are free from the suffocating 
              constriction of mere objects, mere feelings, mere thoughts – they all 
              come and go, but you are that vast, free, empty, open Witness of them 
              all, untouched by their torments and tortures.<br><br>This is actually 
              the profound discovery of… the pure divine Self, the formless Witness, 
              causal nothingness, the vast Emptiness in which the entire world arises,
               stays a bit, and passes. And you are That. You are not the body, not 
              the ego, not nature, not thoughts, not this, not that – you are a vast 
              Emptiness, Freedom, Release, and Liberation.<br><br>With this discovery…
               you are halfway home. You have disidentified from any and all finite 
              objects; you rest as infinite Consciousness. You are free, open, empty, 
              clear, radiant, released, liberated, exalted, drenched in a blissful 
              emptiness that exists prior to space, prior to time, prior to tears and 
              terror, prior to pain and mortality and suffering and death. You have 
              found the great Unborn, the vast Abyss, the unqualifiable Ground of all 
              that is, and all that was, and all that ever shall be.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">But why is that only halfway home? </span>Because
               as you rest in the infinite ease of consciousness, spontaneously aware 
              of all that is arising, there will soon enough come the great 
              catastrophe of Freedom and Fullness: the Witness itself will disappear 
              entirely, and instead of witnessing the sky, you are the sky; instead of
               touching the earth, you are the earth; instead of hearing the thunder, 
              you are the thunder. You and the entire Kosmos because One Taste – you 
              can drink the Pacific Ocean in a single gulp, hold Mt. Everest in the 
              palm of your hand; supernovas swirl in your heart and the solar system 
              replaces your head…<br><br>You are One Taste, the empty mirror that is 
              one with any and all objects that arise in its embrace, a mindlessly 
              vast translucent expanse: infinite, eternal, radiant beyond release. And
               you… are… That…<br><br>So the primary Cartesian dualism – which is 
              simply the dualism between… in here and out there, subject and object, 
              the empty Witness and all things witnessed – is finally undone and 
              overcome in nondual One Taste. Once you actually and fully contact the 
              Witness, then – and only then – can it be transcended into radical 
              Nonduality, and halfway home becomes fully home, here in the 
              ever-present wonder of what is…<br><br>And so how do you know that you 
              have finally and really overcome the Cartesian dualism? Very simple: if 
              you really overcome the Cartesian dualism, then you no longer feel that 
              you are on this side of your face looking at the world out there. There 
              is only the world, and you are all of that; you actually feel that you 
              are one with everything that is arising moment to moment. You are not 
              merely on this side of your face looking out there. “In here” and “out 
              there” have become One Taste with a shuddering obviousness and certainty
               so profound it feels like a five-ton rock just dropped on your head. It
               is, shall we say, a feeling hard to miss.<br><br>At that point, which 
              is actually your ever-present condition, there is no exclusive identity 
              with this particular organism, no constriction of consciousness to the 
              head, a constriction that makes it seem that “you” are in the head 
              looking at the rest of the world out there; there is no binding of 
              attention to the personal bodymind: instead, consciousness is one with 
              all that is arising – a vast, open, transparent, radiant, infinitely 
              Free and infinitely Full expanse that embraces the entire Kosmos, so 
              that every single subject and every single object are erotically united 
              in the Great Embrace of One Taste. You disappear from merely being 
              behind your eyes, and you become the All, you directly and actually feel
               that your basic identity is everything that is arising moment to moment
               (just as previously you felt that your identity was with this finite, 
              partial, separate, mortal coil of flesh you call a body). Inside and 
              outside have become One Taste. I tell you, it can happen just like that!<br><br>(Source:

              <p><br>ohhh.... thanks for the post... need some time to read...</p>
              <p>I mistaken the meaning of the term Dharma...</p>
              <p>&lt;Copy pasted from your post&gt;</p>
              <p>Dharma can mean two things. One is the teachings of Buddha, the other is any kind of sensory objects. You must know which one is being spoken of, in your context, it is refering to mental impurities, it is not talking about Buddha's teachings.</p>
              <p>Ermm i read very layman books... published locally.. shall I not reveal the name here? I might sound like I am advertising... thanks</p>

              <p>Hi Mod,</p>
              <p>Sorry got some doubts... I read and re-read again.. I felt that the term Dharmma is also refering to the teachings of Buddha...</p>
              <p>At 1st I find it contradicting... but on further thoughts, to have no attachments, even Buddha's teaching is considered dust too... it only serves as a guide but not to attach to it...</p>
              <p>I don't know how to write it correctly without misunderstanding... maybe u got better explanations?</p>

              <p><br>Oh haha paiseh lah.. no intention to make myself look knowledgeable..</p>
              <p>The book I read is "Zen Inspiration". Publisher: AsiaPac Books</p>
              <p>Very nicely illustrated, and the translation is aimed to make laymen readers like me easier to understand. I can say it is interesting and entertaining.</p>
              <p>Some books are quite wordy and difficult to understand. I will get bored if I have to read wall of text hahaha... maybe my concentration span is limited</p>

              <p>Hi 2009novice,</p>
              <p>Well, I must advertise! I am actually a fan of asiapac buddhist comic books. Especially the book on the laughing Buddha and the book you are reading, Zen Inspirations. Firstly, the laughing Buddha book I find it very humourous and yet at the same time, it has deep meaning and lessons to be learnt. It teaches the value of forgiveness and having a bigger capacity and also the importance of being happy in an easy to understand manner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Secondly, for Zen inspirations, I find it to be a really good book for beginners in zen. The illustrations in the book and the stories summarise the whole history and main points in zen and reading one Zen Inspiration is equivalent to reading 2 or 3 books on zen history and like another 4 books on zen practice of the various schools. Very good book! Highly recommended for all!!</p>
