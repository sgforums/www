It is the degenerated form of the true yoga practised in the past. A few exercises and stretching cannot develope your samadhi and insights. (By the way what meditation do you practise?)<br><br>As I posted in EH,<br><br>--------------------<br><br>Nowadays yoga is usually for body and mind wellbeing, with no spiritual components. It is completely different from the past.. so you can say yoga nowadays are all 'False Yoga', not 'True Yoga'.<br><br>And Indian yoga is more towards Hinduism (but they say that yoga is practiced in one form or another in all religions) originally [although now its non-religious], although Tibetan Buddhism does practise certain yogas, its nature is very different from the yogas that we usually see and is fully for spiritual purposes. They are not taught in yoga classes and institutions and needs direct instructions from qualified Tibetan Lamas.<br><br>--------<br><br>Pls see the hindu website: <a href="http://www.swamij.com/ancientyoga.htm" rel="nofollow">Modern  Yoga versus  Ancient Yoga</a><br><br><blockquote><strong>Ancient View of Yoga and postures (asanas)</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.swamij.com/images/hatha1.gif"><br><br>Ancient view: To the ancients, Yoga is a complete system, of which the postures are a small, though useful part. The word "Yoga" referred to the whole, not merely one part, which is the postures, or Asanas. The entire purpose of Yoga is spiritual in nature, according to the ancient sages.<br><br><strong>Modern View of Yoga and postures (asanas)</strong><br><br><img src="http://www.swamij.com/images/hatha2.gif"><br><br>----------<br><br><strong>The goal of Yoga is Yoga</strong>: The goal or destination of Yoga is Yoga itself, union itself, of the little self and the True Self, a process of awakening to the preexisting union that is called Yoga. While it is not the intent of this article to give a final or conclusive definition of the term  Yoga--which can be described in different ways--it has to do with the realization through direct experience of the preexisting union between Atman and Brahman, Jivatman and Paramatman, and Shiva and Shakti, or the realization of Purusha standing alone as separate from Prakriti. The mere fact that one might do a few stretches with the physical body does not in itself mean that one is headed towards that high union, referred to as Yoga.<br><br>-------------<br><br><strong>Perception has recently shifted:</strong> The typical perception of Yoga has shifted a great deal in the past century, particularly the past couple decades. Most of this is due to changes made in the West, particularly in the United States, though it is not solely an American phenomenon. (Similar shifts have happened with Tantra as well.)<br><br>pls read entire article in that website</blockquote>Another interesting article is <a href="http://www.swamij.com/religion.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.swamij.com/religion.htm</a></div>
