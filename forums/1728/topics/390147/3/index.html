              <p>It is like an illusion but it is not an illusion. For eg, ask

              life is like an illusion.</p>
              <p>You can also feel that life is an illusion when few days ago,
              you spoke to that person, few days later you called him but his hp
              was not in use, worse still someone called and told you that he had

              <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The non-solidity of existence</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This article describes a spiritual insight. It may be quite hard to understand.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The things that we experience are registered by all the sense organs. The eye sight registers vision, the ears register sound, the body registers sensations. These perception, sensations and experiences are not happening in some places. They are the experience of the arising of certain conditions. There is no solidity and physicality in the actual experience.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What we experienced is not universal and common to all. Here's an example to illustrate that: We know that as human beings, we see in term of colours. Some animals are however colour-blind, thus they see differently from us. But none of us, is really seeing the truth nature directly. The senses of different species of sentient beings experience things differently. So who is seeing the real image of an object? None.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Likewise, the various planes of existence are due to different conditions arising. In certain types of meditation, one is said to be able to access these planes of existence. This is because they are not specific locations. They are mental states and are thus non-localised. In these meditations, our consciousness changes and 'aligned' more with these other states or planes of existence.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">All the planes of existence are simultaneously manifesting, but because our senses are human-based conditioned arisings, we only see the human world and other beings that shared 'similar' resonating arising conditions. But nevertheless, the other planes of existences are not elsewhere in some other places.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">What we think of as places are really just consciousness and there is no solidity whatsoever. Even our touch sense is just that. The touch sense gives an impression of feeling something that is physical and three-dimensional. But there is really no solid self-existing object there. Instead, it is simply the sensation that gives the impression of physical solidity and form.</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">OK, that all I can think of and write about this topic. I will revise and improve this article where the need arises.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">For your necessary ponderance. Thank you for reading.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">These articles are parts of a series of spiritual realisation articles .</span></p>

              <p>When we see things only  in one plane, things appears solid or permanent.</p>
              <p>Think of a flower, chances are you will visualise a stalk with petals and colours, but in real life, the origin of the flower begins with a flowering plant, branching out with a bud slowing sprouting into a flower. Then the flower start to wilt into  shriver ing clump and drops to the ground later to decompose back into the ground.</p>
              <p>We are fortunate to be educated in science  to understand cycle of life, and the processes that influence it. Buddhism is about this examination, it's called impermanence</p>
              <p>We are all processes in action, only difference is timespan. All go through the same processes, even inanimate objects. Even the sun will eventually be no longer be! </p>
              <p>Our conciousness as of now are dependant of our body and the senses, it is conditions depending. So this also different from other concepts of an independent entity or "soul",and also an external entity "creator", God if you so choose to call it.  </p>

              <p>What you are fear losing is due to attachment to form. Someone you know, is alive,talking and kicking one moment, the next, he is dead not longer alive. That why the form of the person is not "real" or is actually impermance. </p>
              <p>Everything is subject to change, nothing remains the same! In fact everthing within our conciousness should be attached with the label "conditions apply"!</p>

              <p>Obviously you haven't been following what I've been telling you.</p>
              <p>As a brilliant 20 year old guy from another forum who had experiential realisation of Anatta (after practicing Buddhism for just a year. Thusness said he has deep karmic connection with Buddhism) said -</p>
              <p>(Just a note: when he talks about 'mind', he is not talking about mind as a thought or a concept. He is talking about 'mind' as your undeniable true self, pure awareness, that which knows everything, it is pure presence and existence that pervades and is not other than the entire manifest universe [non-dual])</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Look, there is a reality out there. There is something present that
                                  doesn't just vanish when you approach it. Now what is present is
                                  ungraspable but it is not a nothingness. Like take a mirage for
                                  instance. That is a perfect example of an actual illusion. When you
                                  approach and investigate that mirage, it dissapears. That means there
                                  was never anything there to begin with. It was actually just a
                                  nothingness that you were tricked into believing was something actually
                                  present. Now if I am looking at this chair and I find that the chair
                                  cannot be said to exist, not exist, both or neither then the chair
                                  still doesn't disappear does it? Now, there is still a dependently
                                  arisen chair obviously present. Yet as is said, the chair is like an
                                  illusion because it is always changing and it has no self substance.
                                  But it not actually an illusion because it isn't actually just a
                                  nothingness. It doesn't vanish like a real illusion that I described
                                  would. So the chair is both real and <em class="bbc">like</em> an illusion but not an illusion. </em></p>
              <p><em>...............</em></p>
              <p><em><br> I just told you. When you said "where is it?", it is right there. It is
                          that which knows, it is that knowingness, that awakeness. It is
                          formless, that is you cannot see that basic illuminating quality of
                          awareness yet, really, it is also all forms. Because there is no seeing
                          apart from the seen, hearing apart from the sound, etc. I'll quote
                          Bodhidharma for you in his "Bloodstream Sermon"<br><br> "Student: But if they don't define it, what do they mean by mind?<br><br> Bodhidharma: You ask. That's your mind. I answer. That's my mind. If I
                          had no mind how could I answer? If you had no mind, how could you ask?
                          That which asks is your mind. Through endless kalpas" without
                          beginning, whatever you do, wherever you are, that's your real mind,
                          that's your real buddha. This mind is the buddha" says the same thing.
                          Beyond this mind you'll never find another Buddha. To search for
                          enlightenment or nirvana beyond this mind is impossible. The reality of
                          your own self-nature the absence of cause and effect, is what's meant
                          by mind. Your mind is nirvana. You might think you can find a Buddha or
                          enlightenment somewhere beyond the mind', but such a place doesn't
                          exist."<br><br> Got it?<br><br> If you deny that you have a mind, you are a nihilist and you are not
                          following any tradition of Buddhism. As I've said numerous times, the
                          mind is obviously present. For instance, in order to deny you had a
                          mind, you would have to use your mind thereby refuting your own
                          position. The mind may be the one and only thing that we absolutely
                          cannot doubt the existence of because it as sensations, thoughts, etc.
                          is the first and final basis of our reality. It is present but it just
                          that it is dependently arisen and impermanent (always changing).
                          Dependent arising means that there is something (well not a "thing")
                          present. That is what it implies. There is something there that is
                          arising dependently. That is why it avoids nihilism. This "something"
                          is sometimes called a "clearly apparent non existent" or a "mere
                          appearance." It is clearly apparent because you can't deny that there
                          is something there yet it is not truly existent.<br><br> I don't laugh at the question of "who am I?." I've thoroughly
                          investigated that and I have found that "I" am a individual mindstream
                          which has currently taken the form of a human being and which
                          continuously changes and arises dependently and is thus empty. This
                          mindstream is not nothing but it is not something (truly existent). It
                          is beginningless and endless. There is no controller in this mindstream
                          which is outside of the sensations manipulating the sensations. Any
                          supposed controller would be inseparable from the sensations
                          themselves. That is, there are not "two" things in this mindstream - a
                          hearer and hearing. There is just one happening in which the hearer and
                          hearing are undivided. Now I don't know everything about who "I" am yet
                          but I do know some very very important things. And I am not going to
                          deny that.<br><br> No, no, no no, those words are not flexible at all. They have very
                          precise meanings within Buddhism. Dependent arising can't be used to
                          mean independent and impermanence cannot be used to mean permanence.
                          You can't just have words mean whatever you want them to mean. You will
                          get absolutely nowhere and will only confuse yourself.<br><br> As to how the mind "comes" from immaterial things, you have to
                          understand that at the deepest level, the mind and material things are
                          said to be undivided. There is no border between them. You can see this
                          for yourself if you investigate deeply. Now this particular area - the
                          "all is mind" stuff is something that I'm just getting into right now.
                          So bear with me here. The ways I see this is that the mind is the all
                          and the mind has parts and whatever has parts if empty. For instance,
                          the mind as hearing is the all - yet that mind as hearing has parts -
                          the person, the stick, the bell, the ears, etc. So it is empty because
                          that mind does not have own being apart from all those parts. The whole
                          which is the mind does not have independent being apart from the parts
                          which make it up and the parts do not have independent being apart from
                          other parts. Thus the parts and whole (the mind) are both empty.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>...............</em></p>
              <p><em><br> Look, this is it basically. First, all is mind. This means that if we
                                  really look into our own experience, all we can find is the mind. There
                                  is actually no border or division between mind and matter at the
                                  deepest level. So we can say "all is mind". Yet this mind is empty
                                  because it is always changing and because it arises dependently. What
                                  does it depend on? Take a moment of hearing for instance. In that
                                  moment, the stick, bell, a previous moment of mind, etc. are conditions
                                  for (or parts that make up) that total moment of experience of mind.
                                  Without these things, that moment of mind could not be. Thus it and all
                                  other moments of mind come about dependently on parts, causes and
                                  conditions. So the mind is not truly existent. Yet it is also not non
                                  existent. This is because there is obviously something present. And it
                                  is because without a "thing" (existence) there cannot the absence of a
                                  thing (non existence). In order for there to absence, there must be
                                  something that is absent. This is why the term unborn is sometimes
                                  used. If something has never been born, it cannot be absent. It has
                                  never been there to be absent in the first place! Because there is not
                                  existence or non existence, there is also not both. How could there be
                                  both? That is just taking two wrong views and putting them together. So
                                  not both. Then we can't say neither either. For to say neither
                                  existence or non existence we would still be presuming that there is
                                  existence and non existence both of which we have previously refuted.
                                  So we can't say neither. <br><br> So the mind (or mindstream) is undeniably present yet it is not
                                  existent, not non existent, not both and not neither. In the end, it is
                                  ultimately ungraspable. Yet we can still talk about it's presence
                                  validly on the relative level. And actually the relative and absolute
                                  are the same. I should mention here that the relative is dependently
                                  arisen phenomena and the ultimate is emptiness. The relative and
                                  absolute are actually the same because whatever is dependently arisen
                                  is empty and vice versa. So in the end, the mind's undeniable
                                  dependently arisen relative presence is it's ultimate ungraspability.
                                  Strange huh? This is why I talked about being in the world and out of
                                  it at the same time. Being in the world IS being out of the world
                                  (unaffected by it). It is really the best of both worlds. That's it, a
                                  very very basic summary of the mind's nature. This is certainly not all
                                  there is to the mind. Not by a long shot. But as to the whole thing
                                  about the stick, the bell, immaterial, material, arising, etc. this is
                                  basically it.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>...............</p>
              <p><br><em><br> No, reality is very real. It's just that mind is really all there is.
                              Reality is certainly not an abstraction. If you kick a rock that pain
                              you feel is not an abstraction, it is very real. Thinking like this is
                              going into more nihilism, saying that everything is just an
                              abstraction.</em></p>

              there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost
              complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever
              appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent
              existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely
              luminous yet empty, mere Appearances without inherent/objective
              existence. What gives rise to the differences of colours and

              <p>Conditioned by the mind, one becomes strongly
                  habituated to illusory actions. And then it's the same as far as pure
                  Enlightenment is concerned; beyond one's own mind there is no dazzling
                  light to come shining in from outside to wake one up. If one recognizes
                  one's own intrinsic State as pure from the beginning and only
                  temporarily obscured by impurities, and if one maintains the presence
                  of this recognition without becoming distracted, then all the
                  impurities dissolve. This is the essence of the Path. Then the inherent
                  quality of the great original purity of the Primordial State manifests,
                  and one recognizes it and becomes the master of it as a lived
                  experience. This experience of the real knowledge of the authentic
                  original condition, or the true awareness of the State, is what is
                  called Nirvana. So Enlightenment is nothing other than one's own mind
                  in its purified condition. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>For this reason Padma Sambhava said: "the
                  mind is the creator of Samsara and of Nirvana. Outside the mind there
                  exists neither Samsara nor Nirvana." </strong><strong>Having thus established that the
                  basis of Samsara and Nirvana is the mind, it follows that all that
                  seems concrete in the world, and all the seeming solidity of beings
                  themselves, is nothing but an illusory vision of one's own mind.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Just
                  as a person who has a 'bile' disease sees a shell as being yellow even
                  if one can see objectively that that is not its true color, so in just
                  the same way, as a result of the particular karmic causes of sentient
                  beings, the various illusory visions manifest. Thus, if one were to
                  meet a being of each of the six states of existence on the bank of the
                  same river, they would not see that river in the same way, since they
                  each would have different karmic causes. The beings of the hot hells
                  would see the river as fire; those of the cold hells would see it as
                  ice; beings of the hungry ghost realm would see the river as blood and
                  pus; aquatic animals would see it as an environment to live in; human
                  beings would see the river as water to drink; while the demi-gods would
                  see it as weapons, and the gods as nectar. This shows that in reality
                  nothing exists as concrete and objective. Therefore, understanding that
                  the root of Samsara is truly the mind, one should set out to pull up
                  the root. Recognizing that the mind itself is the essence of
                  Enlightenment one attains liberation. Thus, being aware that the basis
                  of Samsara and Nirvana is only the mind, one takes the decision to
                  practice.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Your conceptualization about self is what makes you scared. Because you want your self to exist concretely. Such fears dissolve when one sees what Mind is. One should start enquiring 'Who am I?' Negating all concepts and ideas, we're left with a basic undeniable aliveness, presence, knowing - which is unconstructed, naked, bare, not conjured up by thoughts but is just simply and undeniably present.</p>
              <p>In reality, all there is is Mind, awareness, knowingness. Nothing could arise or exist apart from your present knowingness. There is no separate identity, separate experiencer, self, behind things, because whatever arise is basically the manifestation of pure presence and awareness. Awareness and phenomena are not-two. And as phenomena, they dependently originate, as explained above, different people experience things differently, so the world actually does not exist in a separate, concrete and objective manner, but is actually a manifestation of Mind - it is not unreal, because it is vividly and clearly and undeniably present as the manifestation of pristine awareness. As we see, Mind does not exist in a permanent and separate way, but it is not the same as non-existence, because everything is clearly experienced, clearly seen, so there is a basic undeniable presence of awareness. Mind, your true nature, is empty of extremes like existence, non-existence, etc.</p>
              <p>Everything is clearly, vividly, undeniably, presently appearing. But nothing is graspable or inherently existing, but simply appears due to dependent origination. Everything is just a magical, empty yet vivid appearance of Mind.</p>

              <p>Yes because everything is just combinations and aggregations, there is no separate or permanent 'self' entity to be found, just as there is no permanent or separate entity 'weather' to be found. There is no human 'being', there is only a stream of becoming, of sensations, thoughts, manifesting and subsiding in lightning speed - in other words there is only human Becoming (not a static being).</p>
              <p>As Toni Packer said:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"><em> A somber day, isn't it? Dark, cloudy, cool, moist and windy. Amazing,
                      this whole affair of "the weather!" We call it "weather," but what is
                      it really? Wind. Rain. Clouds slowly parting. Not the words spoken
                      about it, but just this darkening, blowing, pounding, wetting, and then
                      lightening up, blue sky appearing amidst darkness, and sunshine
                      sparkling on wet grasses and leaves. In a little while there'll be
                      frost, snow and ice-covers. And then warming again, melting, oozing
                      water everywhere. On an early spring day the dirt road sparkles with
                      streams of wet silver. So — what is "weather" other than this incessant
                      change of earthly conditions and all the human thoughts, feelings, and
                      undertakings influenced by it? Like and dislike. Depression and
                      elation. Creation and destruction. An ongoing, ever changing stream of
                      happenings abiding nowhere. No entity "weather" to be found except in
                      thinking and talking about it. </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"><em> Now
                      — is there such an entity as "me," "I," "myself?" Or is it just like
                      the "weather" — an ongoing, ever changing stream of ideas, images,
                      memories, projections, likes and dislikes, creations and destructions,
                      which thought keeps calling "I," "me," "Toni," and thereby solidifying
                      what is evanescent? What am I really, truly, and what do I think and
                      believe I am? Are we interested in exploring this amazing affair of
                      "myself" from moment to moment? Is this, maybe, the essence of retreat
                      work? Exploring ourselves minutely beyond the peace and quiet that we
                      are seeking and maybe finding. Coming upon clarity about this deep
                      sense of separation which we call "me," and "other people," without any
                      need to condemn or overcome. </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"><em> Most
                      human beings take it totally for granted that I am "me," and that "me"
                      is this body, this mind, this knowledge and sense about myself which so
                      obviously feels separate from other people. The language in which we
                      talk to ourselves and to each other inevitably implies separate "me's,"
                      and "you's" all the time. All of us talk "I" and "you" talk, we think
                      it, write it, read it, and dream it with rarely any pause. There is
                      incessant reinforcement of the sense of "I," "me," separate from
                      others. Isolated. Insulated. Not understood. How is one to come upon
                      the truth if separation is taken so much for granted, feels so common
                      sense? </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"><em> The difficulty is not
                      insurmountable. Wholeness, true being, is here all the time, like the
                      sun behind the clouds. Daylight is here in spite of cloud cover. </em></p>

              <p>There are many ways to go about dealing with anger.</p>
              <p>For me... rather than feed the anger, simply observe anger for what it is. If we become aware of our anger, then we no longer become identified with our mental stories and just see anger for what it is. Just completely accept whatever we experience to be as it is. They will dissolve on their own accord as long as we do not feeding them through our mental stories.</p>
