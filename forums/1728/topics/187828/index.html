            <div class='col-md body'>There are many who believe that <strong>miracles are proof of godÂ’s existence</strong>. We hear wild claims that a healing has taken place but we never get an independent testimony from a medical office or a surgeon. We hear second-hand reports that someone was miraculously saved from disaster but we never get an eyewitness account of what is supposed to have happened. We hear rumors that prayer straightened a diseased body or strengthened a withered limb, but we never see X-rays or get comments from doctors or nurses. Wild claims, second-hand reports and rumors are no substitute for solid evidence and solid evidence of miracles is very rare.<br><br>However, sometimes unexplained things do happen, unexpected events do occur. But our <span style="color: red;">inability to explain such things does not prove the existence of gods. It only proves that our knowledge is as yet incomplete</span>. Before the development of modern medicine, when people didnÂ’t know what caused sickness people believed that god or the gods sent diseases as a punishment. Now we know what causes such things and when we get sick, we take medicine. In time when our knowledge of the world is more complete, we will be able to understand what causes unexplained phenomena, just as we can now understand what causes disease.<br><br>The Buddha knew of the power that could be developed by training the human mind. He also knew that his disciples could acquire such powers through mental development. Thus the Buddha <strong>advised them not to exercise such psychic power in order to convert less intelligent people</strong>. He was referring to the <strong>'miraculous' power to walk on water,</strong> to <strong>exorcise spirits, raise the dead </strong>and <strong>perform the so-called supernormal practices</strong>. He was also referring to the 'miracles of prophesy' such as thought-reading, soothe-saying, fortune-telling, and so on. When the <strong>uneducated believers see the performance of such powers, their faith deepens</strong>. <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">But the nominal converts who are attracted to a religion because of these powers embrace a faith, not because they realise the truth</span>,</span> <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">but because they harbour hallucinations</span></span>. Besides, some people may pass remarks that these miracles are due to certain charms. In drawing people to listen to the Dharma, the Buddha appealed to their reasoning power</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In certain religions, a man's miraculous performance can help him to become a saint. <strong>But in Buddhism, miracles can be a hindrance for a person to attain sainthood, which is a gradual personal attainment and individual concern.</strong> Each person himself must work for his sainthood through self-purification and no one else can make another person a saint.<br><br>The Buddha says that a person can gain miraculous power without gaining spiritual power. He teaches us that if we first gain spiritual power, then we automatically receive the miraculous or psychic powers too. But if we develop miraculous powers without spiritual development, then we are in danger. We can misuse this power for worldly gain. There are many who have deviated from the right path by using their miraculous powers without having any spiritual development. Many people who are supposed to have obtained some miraculous powers succumbed to the vain glory of obtaining some worldly gain.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Many so-called miracles talked about by people are merely imaginations and hallucinations created by their own minds due to a lack of understanding of things as they truly are</span>.</span> All these miracles remain as miracles as long as people fail to know what these powers really are.<br><br>Many psychic powers were attributed to Shakyamuni Buddha, <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">but he did not consider these important</span>.</span> To him, the <strong>greatest miracle was to explain the Truth and make a man realise it</strong>. As a teacher with deep compassion, he was moved by human suffering and determined to <strong>free men from its fetters by a rational system of thought and way of life. </strong><br><br>When we study Buddhism, we are <strong>studying ourselves</strong>, the <strong>nature of our own minds.</strong> <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Instead of focusing on some supreme being, Buddhism emphasizes more practical matters, such as how to lead our lives, how to integrate our minds and how to keep our everyday lives peaceful and healthy</span></span>. In other words, Buddhism always accentuates experiential knowledge-wisdom rather than some dogmatic view.<br><br>The human mind instinctively seeks happiness. East, WestÂ—thereÂ’s no difference; everybodyÂ’s doing the same thing.How buddhism do that?Well by making us<span class="large"> Rediscover </span>our <span style="color: red;">true nature</span>.What is this true nature of ours?It is Our <span style="color: red;">buddha nature</span>.The nature of <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">loving-kindness </span></span>and <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Compassion</span></span><br><br><span class="large">We do good not because we can use this as a <strong>bargain to go to heaven</strong>.<br>We do good not because we are <strong>afraid of being punished to hell</strong>.<br>We do good because this is what we are.<br>We do good because we are <strong>happy </strong>to do so<br>We do good because we have <strong>loving-kindness </strong>and <strong>Compassion</strong><br>This is what we really are and Buddha has certainly made us realise that.</span><br><br><span class="large"><span style="font-style: italic;">According to the Buddha, the <span style="color: red;">miracle of realisation is a real miracle</span>. When <strong>a murderer, thief, terrorist, drunkard, or adulterer is made to realise that what he had been doing is wrong and gives up his bad, immoral and harmful way of life, this change can be regarded as a miracle.</strong> The change for the better arising from an understanding of Dharma is the highest miracle that any man can perform. </span></span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Science today does not deny the possibility of miracies.;s <strong>it once did but is beginning to accept that what were known as miracles were but manifestations of phenomena as yet unknown</strong>. The Buddha himself expounded this view: to him <strong>miracles were not in themselves to be regarded as demonstration of truth, but showed only a mastery of little-known powers that may be developed by some people</strong>. It <strong>did not necessarily</strong> follow that their possessor was an enlightened or divine being.<br><br>This being so, the Buddha not only taught his followers to be wary in the exercise of any miraculous powers they might acquire, but also warned others not to be unduly impressed by such exhibitions Thus whereas other religions exploit their miraculous elements to the greatest possible extent in order to convince the masses. Buddhism treats all such things as of very minor importance and <strong>irrelevant to the real task of spiritual development and emancipation</strong>. According to the Buddha the <span class="large"><strong>highest miracle is the conversion of an ignorant manto become a wise man</strong></span>.<br><br>In this connection, Swami Vivekananda says. "<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="color: green;"><span class="large">The idea of supernatural beings may arouse to a cerain extent, the power of action in man, but it also brings dependence; it brings fear; it brings superstion. It degenerates into a horrible belief in the natural weakness of the man</span></span>."  </span><br><br>The scientific attitude and content of Buddhism has led <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> to say that "<span class="large"><span style="color: green;">If there is any religian that would cope with modern scientific needs it would be Buddhism</span></span>."<br></div>
