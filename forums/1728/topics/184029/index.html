            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is not a monolithic faith, but an exceptionally excellent educational system which is capable of wide variation and is adaptable to most, if not all, circumstances.<br><br>So I think it is really ok for people to study about Buddhism, regardless of their preferred choice of faith.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Isis:<br>A person who has a religion other than buddhism- which isnt a religion in the first place, can still be enlightened? pls note that some people whom claim that they are enlightened but they are really not... Enlightenment can be such an exploitive term.</blockquote>It is many's belief that people like Jesus Christ himself is a Bodhisattva. Although his teachings differ, it was taught expediently according to the needs of the people. He hardly emphasizes on liberation, but ascending to heavens, considered as the celestial realms in Buddhism. (In fact he did, in Gospel of Thomas, he did teach about attaining Deathlessness)<br><br>People like Lao Tzu (father of taoism) is also enlightened, he can be considered a Pratyekabuddha. A pratyekabuddha can become enlightened during the times when Buddhist teachings are not present. But even a Pratyekabuddha has learned under a Buddha in a previous lifetime before attaining such a state.<br><br>For most of us, it is extremely important to find a teacher who is capable to lead you to enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>No matter which religion u r in it now, does it matter as long it make u a happy person i.e is to reduce ur suffering..?</blockquote>Any religions that makes one happy is good, that teaches morality, being virtuous and avoiding evil, is good.<br><br>But Buddhism is best because <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=98125" rel="nofollow">Buddhists are Happier</a>, and unlike most religions is the only teaching that emphasizes liberation, enlightenment, attaining the highest bliss in life.<br><br><blockquote>u can believe in XXX and cultivating kindness and compassion... does it matter which religion u r from? Practising compassion and giving can be considered a form of cultivation and gaining 'merits' for future birth... hopefully a chance to learn dhamma - to understand our reality more...</blockquote>What other religions practise can be considered 'virtues', 'wholesome deeds', but not merits. Such a person can attain rebirth as human or celestial beings. Merits is different can only come by liberation, from dharmakaya.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</span><br><br><blockquote>we shld aso sieze our opportunity here to cultivate as being born as a human and be able to come into contact with dhamma is very fortunate...</blockquote>Indeed..<br><br><blockquote>i think mst problem with some religion are that people tend to get OVERly-attached to their religion so much that it can cause delusion or hatred to arise which can cause future suffering.. even if you are overly attached to ur religion but do keep in mind to be tolerance to other beliefs. =) The world has many diversities and things unknown to us with our limited experiences and knowledge.</blockquote>I think the reason for this is due to their DOGMATISM and BLIND FAITH. These narrow minded people tend to be egotistic and stubborn, clinging to their own views.<br><br>Kalama Sutra:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Rely not on the teacher/person, but on the teaching. Rely not on the words of the teaching, but on the<br>spirit of the words. Rely not on theory, but on experience.Do not believe in anything simply because you<br>have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do<br>not believe anything because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything because it is<br>written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and<br>elders. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is<br>conducive to the good and the benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it."<br><br>- the Buddha</span><br><br>As I said in another topic,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You realise those who are into contemplation, whether christian, sufi mystics (which is why I posted sufi links in the islam forum - <a href="http://islam.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=162957" rel="nofollow">The True Meaning of Jihad</a>), etc, buddhists, they never have a history of violence. It is always those religious scholarly types who are binded by dogmas and they are the ones who are intolerant and fought wars, and are highly egotistic.</span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong>No fanaticism</strong><br><br>Of Buddhism alone can it be affirmed it is free from all fanaticism. Its aim being to produce in every man a thorough internal transforming by self-conquest, how can it have recourse to might or money or even persuasion for effecting conversion? The Buddha has only shown the way to salvation, and it is left to each individual to decide for himself if he would follow it.<br><br>- Prof. Lakshmi Narasu, "The Essence of Buddhism"</blockquote>----<br><br><blockquote>Since Buddhism isn't a religion, so what it is to you?<br><br>comment pls =)</blockquote>A way of life, way of bliss; enlightenment; liberation, and also an education.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is possible to believe in another religion while practising buddhism teaching.<br>But the effectiveness will be greatly reduced. Ask yourself how do you have faith in a god that claimed to be world creator and saviour that can bypass karma, while at the same time you practise buddhism like karma, precepts or mantra.<br>Furthermore, being a buddhist will give you an environment that you will have contact with other buddhist friend and teacher that will help you on the path towards enlightenment.<br>Buddhism at some stage can be very complicated, if you learnt it by just reading books without a teacher, you might go the wrong way.<br><br>If you have some difficulty to convert to buddhism, maybe you can share with us.<br>It is true that religion XXX teach you to be good and loving kindness, that will also bring you to heaven if you really put in the effort. But that doesn't solve the problem, even one in heaven still have to die one day. In heaven, you will have no chance to learn buddhism, your memory, diligence and intelligence may not be as good as human. Last time, buddha saykamuni was invited by di4 shi4 (deva that rule the celestial world) to heaven preaching dharma. But after buddha left, di4 shi4 totally forgot what buddha has taught him. So when their life in heaven ends, some will go down as human, animal or even hungry ghost. Then again, when condition meets, up and down again and again for aeons till they become a buddhist again. Clearly, we should believe in buddha instead of a deva that couldn't even save himself.<br><br>Although, strictly speaking, buddhism is not a religion, but to allow it to spread the teaching to some layman people, it has to take the form of religion.<br><br>Some people said Jesus might be a bodhisatva. If it is true, I don't know what level of bodhisatva he was at. Perhaps reading the teaching in bible will give you a better understanding on this.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Isis:</div><div class="quote_body">A person who has a religion other than buddhism- which isnt a religion in the first place, can still be enlightened? pls note that some people whom claim that they are enlightened but they are really not...

He causes them to grow and brings them to realization. He is the savior of all living beings, because he plucks them out of suffering and hardships. He is the refuge of all beings, because he protects and guards the world. He is the rescuer of all beings, because he delivers them from fear. (EDR II 70)<br><br>"When the Bodhisattva walks the Bodhisattva Path, he does what is very difficult. From an ordinary point of view, a Bodhisattva practicing the Bodhisattva Path appears quite stupid. If he were not, then why would he choose to undergo suffering himself in order to come and teach and transform living beings? But no matter what kind of suffering there is, he can endure it. He undergoes intense suffering even to the point of enduring the suffering due other living beings.<br><br>He wants to forsake himself for the sake of the multitudes. He forsakes his own small self in order to bring living beings' great selves to realization. When you walk the Path of the Bodhisattva you benefit yourself and you benefit others. In doing this you shouldn't fear any kind of suffering. The Bodhisattva undergoes suffering just as if he were eating candy. He undergoes suffering as if there were no suffering to undergo.

It is a real pity that some people take Buddhist teachings as an academic thing, thus cannot appreciate the true essence of its teachings, to transform ourselves, conquer ourselves, and achieve wisdom that we can call our OWN - but just blindly knowing Buddha's words, and what others said.<br><br><blockquote>From this forum i have learnt alot abt buddhism... esp from the sutra posted by the forumers..and their experiences...

Even for someone who don't have contact with dhamma can have a certain level of realization ( level mst likely not high though ) cos' i believe unspoken dhamma existed every now and then..infact all the time in our life..<br><br>i once attended a 4 days metta meditation retreat but cannot sit long.. @ mst ard 30 mins cos i was not a regular meditator... if im not wrong, can meditate anywhere, anyplace, anytime depending on yourself.. first of all must know yourself well first...<br><br>there are also many kinds of meditation.. i heard abt the s h it ing meditation! heheheh<br><br>Regarding to answing your questions, i learnt from tapes in sec, did my own experiment and learining from venerables in dhamma camps.... breahting meditation help tame my monkey mind.... i aso like walking meditation... i also heard abt the insight-meditation.. want to try but don't have the time yet..<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>thnks 4 sharing  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>may u hav peace &amp; happiness</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The various methods of meditations are only a few out of the '84000' dharma doors. Depending on your practise, you may not necessarily need to practise sitting meditation. And yes, meditation is not limited to sitting, it is also practised in life. But its best to learn from a teacher, whatever the teacher teaches you, just practise accordingly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
