              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">12 Jan 2017 Alison Lesley World
              Religion News</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How different religious groups feel
              about religious freedom.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">January
              16 is Religious Freedom Day, a day when we celebrate the right to practice
              religion freely, while for at least a while setting aside the controversy and
              debate that surrounds the ideal of religious freedom. It commemorates the
              Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom adopted on January 16, 1786, which,
              according to President Barack Obama in his presidential proclamation on
              Religious Freedom Day last year, “formed a blueprint for what would become the
              basis for the protection of religious liberty enshrined in our constitution.”
              Thomas Jefferson wrote the statute, which proclaims “all men shall be free to
              profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion,
              and that the same shall in no wise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil
              capacities.” Americans are called upon to observe the day appropriately in
              their homes, schools and places of worship.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the spirit of Religious Freedom Day, World Religion News has compiled what
              various major religious denominations say about religious freedom.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What ideas do different faiths have
              about religious freedom?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), religious freedom
              does not only mean freedom to believe, but to act and speak on one’s beliefs as
              well. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Religious
              freedom is more than just the freedom to believe what you want. It’s also the
              freedom to talk about and act on your core beliefs without interference from
              government or others, except when necessary to protect health and safety. It
              also allows people with similar beliefs to form religious organizations that
              govern their own affairs.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">William
              Penn, an early member of the Quakers and founder of the Province of
              Pennsylvania, the colony which would become the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,
              gave his Charter of Privileges which became the earliest prototype for the
              United States Bill of Rights. The Charter reflected the 50 years of persecution
              the Quakers suffered in Britain and proclaimed: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“…no
              persons who shall confess and acknowledge the One Almighty God…; and
              profess…themselves, obliged to live quietly under the civil government, shall
              be in any case molested or prejudiced…because of…conscientious persuasion or
              practice, nor be compelled to frequent or maintain any religious worship or
              ministry contrary to …their mind, or to do or suffer any other act or thing
              contrary to their religious persuasion.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Pope
              Francis spoke about the unavoidable influence of religion on society and the
              nation. He stated that:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Religion
              [cannot] be relegated to the inner sanctum of personal life, without influence
              on societal and national life.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According to the United States
              Conference of Catholic Bishops website: </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“If
              religious liberty is not respected, all people suffer and are deprived of the
              essential contribution to the common good, be it in education, health care,
              feeding the hungry, civil rights, and social services that the Church and other
              people of faith make every day, both here at home and overseas.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              2015, Pope Francis also spoke about religious freedom in front of the historic
              building in Philadelphia, PA where the Declaration of Independence was signed.
              He declared the right to religious freedom:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“is
              a fundamental right which shapes the way we interact socially and personally
              with our neighbors whose religious views differ from our own.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Several
              Baptist men in history have staunchly fought for religious freedom, suffering
              persecution and even sacrificing their own lives. For example, Thomas Helwys
              questioned the King’s overarching authority on religious matters which caused
              him to be thrown in prison, where he died. Baptists believe that integral to
              religious freedom are biblical truths that include: the freedom to follow
              Christ, the freedom to read and interpret the Bible, the freedom to be
              baptized, the freedom to choose and support a church, the freedom to govern a
              church and the freedom to witness and minister. Baptists also believe that we
              must guard religious freedom, uphold the separation of church and state and use
              freedom for the benefits of others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">According
              to Rabbi Alderstein, the Jewish attitude towards religious freedom is
              inevitably intertwined with consistency with what the Jewish law prescribes.
              The rabbi points out two parts of Jewish law that shape the discussion of
              religious freedom. First is exclusivity, in that Jewish law proscribes that the
              righteous nations of the world will be a part of heaven. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Any
              religion that claims exclusivity in holding the keys to the Kingdom of Heaven
              has difficulty in making room for The Other.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              second is responsibility for the misdeeds of others, which comes in two forms –
              punishing the sinner (that Jews have no jurisdiction over the lives of non-Jews
              and therefore do not feel compelled to “root out the infidel”) and dissociating
              from the sins of others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> also does not preach exclusivity in that it deems its
              followers free to learn the teachings of other religions. Buddha himself
              encouraged his followers to learn from other religions and view their teachings
              comparatively with that of Buddhist teachings. Buddha taught that if one can
              garner reasonable and rational teachings in other religions, Buddhists have the
              freedom to respect them; and the choice of religion depends upon free choice.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Church of Scientology</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> is a strong defender of the ideals of religious
              freedom. In the Creed of the Church of Scientology, it is written: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“We
              of the Church believe: that all men of whatever race, color or creed were
              created with equal rights. That all men have inalienable rights to their own
              religious practices and their performance.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the Code of a Scientologist, Scientologists also pledge to support the freedom
              of religion. In addition, Scientologists pray “A Prayer For Total Freedom,”
              which states: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“We
              think of those whose liberty is threatened; of those who have suffered
              imprisonment for their beliefs; of those who are enslaved or martyred, and for
              all those who are brutalized, trapped or attacked. We pray that human
              rights will be preserved so that all people may believe and worship freely, so
              that freedom will once again be seen in our land.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Hinduism considers itself a religion of
              freedom. </span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Hinduism
              allows absolute freedom to the rational mind of man. Hinduism never demands any
              undue restraint upon the freedom of human reason, the freedom of thought,
              feeling and will of man…It allows the widest freedom in matters of faith and
              worship. It allows absolute freedom to the human reason and heart with regard
              to questions such as the nature of God, soul, creation, form of worship, and
              goal of life. It does not force anybody to accept particular dogmas or forms of
              worship. It allows everybody to reflect, investigate, enquire and cogitate.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Quran in the Islam faith</span></strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;"> teaches that religious belief is up to the person’s
              choice. Accepting the truth is for his own good and rejecting it is to his own
              detriment. Some quotations in the text show this:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              Truth is from your Lord; so let him who please believe and let him who please
              disbelieve.” — 18:29</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Clear
              proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord: so whoever sees, it is for his
              own good; and whoever is blind, it is to his own harm. And I am not a keeper
              over you.” — 6:104</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Abdul-Baha,
              son of Baha’u’llah and appointed head of the <strong>Bahai faith</strong> in 1892, had this to say about religious liberty: </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              the religion of God, there is no practice of declaring believers to be morally
              corrupt or of declaring them not believers, nor is debasing or showing contempt
              for others permitted.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              shining spark of truth cometh forth only after the clash of differing opinions”
              and “The conscience of man is sacred and to be respected.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The Satanic Temple teaches:</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To
              willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forego your
              own.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1999, the Circle Sanctuary, one of America’s oldest Wiccan churches, defended
              the right of Wiccans in the Military to practice their religion. The Wiccans
              freedom to practice their faith was attacked by several federal government
              officials. Anti-Wiccan legislation was not passed in Congress and did not
              succeed. Another positive outcome of the Wiccans’ battle to practice their
              religion was that people came to better understand the Wiccan religion and
              paganism, because of the extensive media coverage that ensued as a result of
              the controversy.</span></p>
