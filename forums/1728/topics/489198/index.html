                  one.” </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">— Benjamin Franklin<br> <br> That quote can be found in a place that serves as a stark reminder of why
                  Americans are less secure with our infatuation with homeland security than we
                  were on Sept. 11, 2011.<br> <br> The place is Manzanar National Historic Site in a desolate stretch of Inyo
                  County. It marks were 11,700 Americans were interned for the mere crime of
                  being part of an ethnic group at the wrong time in history.<br> <br> They were forcibly sent there without due process out of fear they were
                  terrorists living among us in the aftermath of Japan’s sneak attack on Pearl
                  Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.<br> <br> Some weren’t American citizens but many were. <br> <br> Their crime was basically being Americans of Japanese descent. The fear that
                  gave President Roosevelt the authority to issue an executive order rounding up
                  120,000 Japanese Americans on the West Coast was based on the assumption they
                  were agents of espionage for Japan. Yet by the end of World War II not one of
                  them even had charges of espionage brought against them.<br> <br> They were forced to abandon businesses, farms, homes, pets and virtually all of
                  their belongings. Those fortunate enough had neighbors who watched over their
                  property and took care of it while they were interned. Some lost everything by
                  the war’s end.<br> <br> Manzanar stands as much as to the foolishness of suspending freedom in times of
                  fear as it does as mute testimony of what 120,000 loyal Americans suffered
                  while housed at 10 internment camps in desolate desert regions as well as in
                  swamps in the western United States.<br> <br> The willingness of many of us today to suspend freedom and liberty in exchange
                  for the false sense of security belies the fact such a strategy can easily make
                  you the victim of some future mass hysteria based on ethnicity, beliefs, or
                  political views.<br> <br> In a way, it is no different than those who opted to turn a blind eye to the
                  mass extermination of the Jews. They did so because they weren’t Jewish but it
                  ignores the fact that the target could be the Jews today and them tomorrow<br> <br> The point is not to sit in judgment of what the United States did in 1942 after
                  Pearl Harbor. Instead it is to remember the truism that those who forget
                  history are doomed to repeat it.<br> <br> We did not intern Americans of Middle Eastern descent after Sept. 11, 2001.
                  That said our treatment as a society as a whole and the government in
                  particular of those Americans who have ethnic ties to the Middle East hasn’t
                  exactly been stellar.<br> <br> Years ago when I was still in high school in Lincoln, my group of friends got
                  into a discussion on religion. One guy believed Marvin Hata was a Buddhist
                  simply based on his ethnicity. He refused to believe Marvin when he told him
                  that he was a Methodist as were his parents and his grandparents. They were
                  parents and grandparents, by the way, that had been among the 120,000 internees
                  taken from their homes, farms, and businesses simply because they were
                  Americans of Japanese descent.<br> <br> Fast forward to 15 or so years ago: An anonymous caller to the Bulletin was
                  “upset” that “Thomas” had bought the Texaco station at Powers and Yosemite
                  avenues here in Manteca. The caller said he was “one of them” referencing the
                  Iraqis that were “religious fanatics” that Americans fought in the Gulf War.<br> <br> It turns out Thomas and his family are Christians that fled the Saddam Hussein
                  regime. The odds of them being executed for their faith if they had stayed was
                  extremely high.<br> <br> We are never more wrong when we make blanket decisions based on a person’s skin
                  tone in regards to who they are.<br> <br> America is supposed to value the individual yet as a society we spend most of
                  our time trying to pigeonhole people based on skin tone, religion, political
                  beliefs, sexuality, socio-economic background, and even the way they dress.<br> <br> We still have the lingering attitude DNA that gave the Balkan States a verb —
                  balkanization. We need to work harder at stopping the tendency to make
                  wholesale judgments of groups of people.<br> <br> Just because they watch the Dukes of Hazards doesn’t make them a racist nor if
                  they support abortion does it make them murders.<br> <br> Yes, both statements are shaped by perspective. If every time you saw a
                  Confederate flag and you are black and you experienced racism, you may jump to
                  the conclusion  — however wrong it might be — that the Confederate flag is
                  a sign of racism in all cases where you see it. By the same token not everyone
                  by a long shot agrees at what point life begins.<br> <br> People don’t have to sacrifice their values and beliefs.<br> <br> What they need to do, though, is to refrain from passing blanket judgments that
                  ultimately rob us all of freedom for a false sense of security.<br> <br> America is only as strong as individuals banding together — not out of fear or
                  prejudice — but from seeking common ground.<br> <br> And anytime we willing allow anyone’s freedoms to be sacrificed without due
                  process we all become a little less secure.</span></p>
