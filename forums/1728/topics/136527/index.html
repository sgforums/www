            <div class='col-md body'>Just learn from Ven Shen Kai's audio how dreams works:<br>(so can clear some doubts)<br><br>Buddhism wants you to doubt. Big doubt = big realisation. Small doubt = small realisation. No doubt = no realisation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Kinds of dreams:<br>1) se yin chan meng (form-based dreams) - what we see in color can become dream. Example you see a base-ball tournament, then when you come back you dream about it.<br>2) shou yin chan meng (feeling-based dreams) - you go to a place and there's feelings, example when people insult you or praise you. They can cause one to dream about it.<br>3) xiang yin chan meng (perception-based dreams) - think of it now and daily, like thinking of fishing, then one day, you really will go fishing.<br>4) xing yin chan meng (mental fabrication-based dreams) - example when you come back from fishing, and you feel happy about it, then when you dream, you'll still dream of fishing.<br>5) si yin chan meng (consciousness-based dreams) - 'si' or consciousness is dualism. Thinking of how in the past people used to fish and how people use to fish now, then when you see documentary on fishing and you knew the know how. Our dualistic views can cause dreams too.<br>6) sickness/4 elements imbalance based dreams - Another form of dreaming is condition by the weather or in other word the 4 elements. Due to sickness, our 4 elements are in balance.<br>7) karma seed based dreams - Dreams that are due to the accumulation of karma seeds be it good or bad, in our Alaya (Stored Consciouness) through out our cycle of rebirths.<br>8 ) karma fruition based dreams - Dreams that are due to the coming fruition of karma (future karmic events about to unfold)<br>9) emotional based dreams - Dreams that are due to family love, friendship love, spouse love, etcs. The emotion of 2 party coming together<br>10) divine intervention based dreams - Dreams that are cause by intervention of Buddha, bodhisattvas or saints, for the sake of delivering sentient beings.<br><br>note:<br>All the 5 aggregates can cause dreams. Another form of dreaming is condition by the weather or in other word the 4 elements. Due to sickness, our 4 elements are in balance. Example when dream of flying, the wind element is in balanced. For people who always get angry easily, they are bound to dream a lot. If one imagine of flying, one can also dream of flying. Like for children who watch Superman, at night they too can dream of flying. All are projection from the 8th consciousness.<br><br>Amituofo!<br>/\<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In page 22, there's also stated...<br>According to san jian lÃ¼4 (?), dreams are divided <strong>basically</strong> into 4 types:-<br><br>1) 4 abstract element based dreams - Like dream of valley, dream of flying, chased by tigers or wolves etcs can be cause by in-balance of abstract earth, water, fire and wind. Mentally uneasy(?)<br><br>2) Dreams based on past sightings - Anything we see in the day can be cause of our dreams.<br><br>3) Deva based dreams - When one cultivate good deeds, might evoke devas to enter one's dream to encourage him/her; while for one to do unwholesome deeds, devas can also enter to create nightmares so as to demote one's evil acts.<br><br>4) Thought based dreams - thinks a lot, dreams a lot. Think of good, creates good dream. Think of bad, creates bad dreams.<br><br>--<br><br>The above 10 kinds posted earlier are from Ven Shen Kai.<br><br>/\<br>Amituofo!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Controlling dreams? If you're a Bodhisattva practitioner or a Buddha, you won't have dreams. (even if a Bodhisattva have dreams they are about perhaps saving other sentient being or doing the saintly work of Shakyamuni Buddha).<br><br>My own dharma teacher says that she does not have dreams, perhaps due to her daily meditation before sleep. She was also quite conscious throughout the night.<br><br>Otherwise there are people who practise Lucid Dreaming. Have you heard of it? This practise is found in Buddhism, it is called Dream Yoga.<br><br>It is a practise of becoming conscious in your dream - and you can control your dreams/what you want to dream! If you want to fly through the sky, yes, you can fly through the sky in your dreams consciously.<br><br>I have personally discussed with a friend on IRC, he's been practising this Yoga for many years and it has been very very successful for him. He could easily have lucid dreams. But he hasn't been coming online these days.<br><br></div>

Some people can control their dreams 'consciously', that is called Lucid Dreaming. At a higher level there is no dreams at all, only awareness. I think this might not necessarily means one does not fall asleep - just that she has a very clear state of mind and is aware of her state of mind. For my dharma teacher, she doesn't really "sleep" like we do, she lies on her bed and is fully aware/mindful. She says that is enough for her.<br><br>People who meditate usually says that a small amount of true meditation can equate to long periods of sleep. Even though a person doesn't lose awareness during meditation, it makes a person very awake afterwards (if he is a skillful meditator).<br><br>Perhaps science can study more on these people. Buddha 'sleeps' mindfully only 1 hour a day.. Rest of his day is fully packed with other things.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, very true!<br><br>Come to think of it, once my master said that a Bu Tong Di bodhisattva doesnÂ’t dream usually, but if he does, it's a 'real' mindful dream - meaning everything in his dream actually exists in the form of 'Dharma Land' or Pure Land.
