Just be a peaceful observer while you dream. Because your state of mind is much more important than what your dream is. Don't be distracted by it.<br><br>ThatÂ’s what the dream is about. ItÂ’s the same as what our living is about. They are all fingers pointing at the moon Â– our original peaceful state of mind.<br><br>Living is indeed dreaming. The peaceful feeling you have is truly valuable, donÂ’t lose it. It will take care of the rest and lead you to enlightenment.<br></div>

I apologise here if i happen to offend anybody. But my guiding intuition compel me to write this to Surf188.<br><br>Hello Surf188,<br><br>From my understanding only...<br><br>You are a lucid dreamer... and i am quite sure you have done some sort of spiritual practice before.<br><br>I use certain dreams as a tool for karmic pattern clearing. Certain dreams are link to the karmic/memories storehouse. They can actually tell what will happen within a month or so... why? because karma is simply our intents/desire stored in the subsconscious.<br><br>If we acknowlegde the dream, this is like saying a go-ahead to activate the karma clearing. Several days after the dream occurs, expereince in life will manifest the effect for cleansing.<br><br>All the characters in the dream must be seen as aspects/symbols of ones' own habit/personality personified. I observe this characters to spot my own karmic pattern and habits...The more i dig, the more i discover what i really am, not just in this life , but in other lives as well.<br><br>You may be asking why do this kind of thing? It is precisely karmic habit that prevent us from seeing our true nature.<br><br>For me, the more i clear, the less habits binds me to compulsive action... the more aware i becomes of my own thoughts... so much so that the thoughts can at times appears to be 'in front' of my awareness.<br><br>However, i may say that dreams are a tools and not a goal. Ultimately, every state of consciousness( be it waking or not) is like a dream. And I know you know what i mean.<br><br>my 2 cents<br><br></div>

But can you control/turn the dreams? It is particularly common among Vajrayana practitioners, those who practise Dream Yoga. I am aware that you have a Vajrayana teacher, perhaps you should talk to them about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In Buddhism, we do not however focus on finding out about our lives using dreams..</div>
