This meal consisted of a preparation called <em>sÅ«karamaddava</em> which can be translated as ‘pig’s delight’ (D.II, 127). There has been a great deal of speculation as to what this meal consisted of. Some say that it was a pork dish, which is quite possible, as the Buddha was not a vegetarian and did not advocate <span>vegetarianism</span>. One of the more bizarre theories and one that has gained wide acceptance is that it was a type of truffle. Early European scholars of Buddhism theorized that because the French use trained pigs to find truffles, the ‘pig’s delight’ mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures might be a variety of truffle. This theory is based on the false premise that what is so of the French countryside must have been so in ancient India. In fact, truffles do not grow in India and the use of trained pigs to find them even in France is a recent practice. Thus the theory that the Buddha’s last meal was truffles is without any foundation.</span></span></p>

Again, the facts contradict such fanciful speculations. All we can say is that <em>sÅ«karamaddava</em> was some kind of preparation, the ingredients of which have long ago been forgotten.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In the months before his passing the Buddha had suffered ‘a severe illness causing him sharp pains as if he were to die’ and which he ‘endured mindfully, fully aware and without complaint’ (D.II, 99). He was 80 years old, unusually long-lived for the time, and <span>Ä€nanda</span> described him at this stage as having ‘slack and wrinkled limbs and being stooped’ (S.V, 217). He himself said that his <span>body</span> could ‘only be kept going by being patched up’ (D.II, 100). After his last meal, he had a severe bout of ‘diarrhoea with blood’ (<em>lohitapakkhandikÄ�</em>), a continuation of the <span>sickness</span> he had been suffering from for some time, and later the next day he passed away. Obviously the Buddha died of the typical complications brought on by exhaustion, sickness and <span>old age</span>, not because of what he had eaten the day before.</span></span></p>

When he realized that the end was near, he immediately thought that Cunda might be blamed for causing his death. To prevent this from happening he instructed Ä€nanda to return to Cunda’s village and tell him that to serve a Buddha his last meal was a most auspicious and blessed act. Thus, even being sick, exhausted and nearing death the Buddha’s only thought was for the welfare of others.</span></span></p>

              <p>I think you misunderstood my question. what I want to ask is, did the Buddha knows before he ate the meal as he is omniscience isnt it, that this would cause him to fall seriously ill and finally pass away in 3 months time?</p>
              <p>so assuming he knew that he would fell ill and passed away in 3 months time, he ate it anyway. I am wondering, if he would have contemplated not eating it, as not as afraid of death, as he is already beyond death, so that his presence would benefit the people in that era.</p>

              <p>yes he has taught the dhamma in his 45 years of expounding. but if he did not ate the meal and supposing he can still live for a few more years, the few more years can benefit quite a lot of people during that time. he could have expounded more sutras even.</p>

              <p>He has many disciples who were more acquainted to people in India due to past karma. These people would only listen his disciples instead of Buddha Sakyamuni personally. And the dharma rooted people in India then were practically liberated lest those that were not ready for Buddha dharma. In addition, the buddha dharma was gradually swifted and flourished in China etc. It is in accordance with the advantage lifespan of people then, and if he would to live for another 300 years, it invited more contempt rather than good.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
