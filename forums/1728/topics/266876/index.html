            <div class='col-md body'>Fascinating site.<br><br>http://www.firethegrid.org/eng/home-fr-eng.htm<br><br>Here are some excerpts:<br><br><blockquote>At this point I took EvanÂ’s little body and pushed it over the seat, hoping beyond hope that he would find air. As I struggled to free us from this coffin on wheels, I realized I had to breathe. As I drank the deep breath of water into my lungs, the fiery feeling added panic to the moment. I wanted my baby back and I swung my arms feverously about in an effort to find his body. I couldnÂ’t, and I needed to breathe again. That is when I heard a voice, a calm majestic voice, directing me to relax. This voice cooed in my ear, reassuring me that all would be well. I was infused with the knowledge that if I fought the water, my rescuers would not be able to revive me when they arrived. The voice said that if I fought the water I would drownÂ…no shit I thought, I get a wise ass ghost on my deathbed. The voice continued to give me instructions about what was to happen, and that all would be well if I just followed the instructions. I relinquished myself to this voice from beyond, and passed quietly into the other side.<br><br>While on the other side I saw beings of light, who once again assured me that my son and I would not only get out of this car, but we would both be fine. They were definite in explaining that I must follow instructions implicitly and not lose faith in their words. I was told to have faith that I would be divinely directed, and I was.</blockquote><blockquote>They want desperately for me to give the humans of this world a message from "beyond," that we have inside of us the power to unite this planet as one race with peace and prosperity for all. This power lies inside us all, and when combined with the loving energy of other humans, we can do for this planet what we did for my son. We can revive this Earth and catapult it into healing. With this healing will come a new phase of humanity. We will have a time of peace and harmony. All it will take is our intention, as a united group, and one hour of our time. </blockquote><blockquote>The light beings have told me we can stop much of this harmful behaviour and destruction if enough humans decide that they want to become spiritually connected. It is possible to re-form a grid connection between us that will allow us to realign the energy of this planet and with each other. They have told me that on July 17, 2007 at 11:11 Greenwich Mean Time.Â— there will be a surge of creation energy which will make our reconnection possible. Please read about this in The Plan. There is hope for a miracle!<br><br>You have just read about how this earth is being harmed by us. This is the section I happily present as the plan to help remedy the situation in which we find ourselves. This is the plan which will allow us to more fully connect to the earth grid and begin the healing of this planet. Together we will reset Mother Earth with a bio-electric "SURGE OF LOVE" from humanity. When we do sit in meditation simultaneously and fire the Grid for one hour, we will unite the globe and connect all the regions of the earth simultaneously. In the process, we will unite our souls in love, peace, harmony and collective cooperation for a better world for our people, today and in the future.</blockquote><blockquote>The light beings use the term "fire the grid" when they speak of the energizing of humanity with divine power, on July 17, 2007. They say firing the grid will accomplish two things. First, it will pulse healing energy into the center of the earth and regenerate the core, or the heart of the planet. Just as we poured our energy into my dying son, we will individually give the gift of our true intention, the gift of our individuality and the gift of our healing energy. As they explained, my sonÂ’s energy field was badly deteriorated, as is the Earths. We must pour some of our living energy into the Earth, and the accumulation of our combined energy will regenerate the Earth. They told me humans are like little lightening rods, channelling God's energy to the planet. Because we have separated ourselves from our complete connection to The Source, by not having a fully functioning human grid, God's energy has not been able to easily flow into the Earth. If we choose to come together to rebuild our grid, then the natural flow of energy between us and God, God and the Earth, and from person to person, will be restored. Do you see what a wonderful gift you will give? This energy will live on eternally with the earth and its inhabitants; the splendour of the creatorÂ’s intention for us realised in the creation of this new energy field for our planet.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unless you are in a coma or you are a frog in a pot of slow-boiling water, you would have noticed that the environment we live in is constantly changing. Changes for better as well as for worse!  We know nothing remains static and if it does, it is dead!<br>So, do we need some kind of spiritual vision or divine revelation to tell us that the world now is not exactly the same as it was before?<br>There will always be claims of sighting spirits, hearing divine calls, and so forth. So are such claims real?<br>Rainbow is both real and a reality. It exists - so it is real. But only on certain conditions. That's when it becomes a reality.<br><br>So saving this world is common-sense. You don't need divine calls. The problem is common-sense is not so common and people are moved by divine instructions more than by their own inertial.<br><br>There have been predictions of what the world will become one day, just as much as we speculate what becomes of us when we stopped breathing. This has gone on for eons since, and do we have any answer?</div>
