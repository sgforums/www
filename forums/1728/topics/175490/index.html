            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, basically the dealing with horoscope is not within the field of Buddhism but nevertheless intriguing. How does horoscope works? According to Ven. Dr K Sri Dhammananda,<br><br><a href="http://www.ksridhammananda.com/pictures/PUBLI/Buddhism%20And%20Astrology%20-%20edited.pdf" rel="nofollow">www.ksridhammananda.com/pictures/PUBLI/Buddhism%20And%20Astrology%20-%20edited.pdf</a><br><br>BUDDHISM AND ASTROLOGY<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">(read website for entire article)....Astrology, however is a completely different area of study altogether. Ever since early<br>man began to think, he was deeply concerned about his relationship with the universe.<br>When man developed from hunting to agriculture, he began to notice a link between the<br>movement of the sun through the year and his own activities of planting, harvesting and<br>similar projects. As he became more sophisticated he was able to predict the movement<br>of the sun and he invented time, dividing it into years, months, days, hours, minutes and<br>seconds.<br>He associated this knowledge with his existence whereby he felt that there was a<br>relationship between his own life cycle and the movement of the planets. This gave rise<br>to the Zodiacs - the apparent path of the sun. It contains twelve constellations. A study<br>of these movements in relation to the human beingÂ’s personal life is called a horoscope.<br><br>The study of astrology involves a great understanding of human nature, an ability to<br>assess planetary movements precisely, together with an insight into the seemingly<br>unexplainable phenomena in the universe. There have been many brilliant astrologers in<br>the past and some exist even today. Unfortunately there are an even larger number of<br>charlatans who give astrology a bad name. They hood-wink people by predicting<br>seemingly true events about their future. They make large sums of money by exploiting<br>the ignorance and fear of the gullible. As a result scientists scoffed at astrology and did<br>not depend on it. However their hostile attitude is not really justifiable. The main<br>purpose of reading a horoscope should be to give one an insight into oneÂ’s own<br>character, in the same way that an x-ray photograph can show the physical make-up of<br>a man.<br>Statistics have shown that the influence of the sun in the signs of the Zodiac accounts<br>for the birth of unusual people during certain months. Certain crimes have been found to<br>correspond with Zodiac signs in which the sun is moving during certain months of the<br>year.<br>Thus an understanding of this relationship will help a man to plot his life more<br>meaningfully in harmony with his innate tendencies, so that there is less friction as he<br>goes through life.<br>A new born baby is like a seed. It contains within itself all the ingredients which will make<br>him a similar, yet completely different individual from all fellow human beings. How his<br>potential is developed depends like the seed, on the kind of training he receives. The<br>nature of a man born within him, but his own freewill determines whether he will make<br>really good use of his talents and abilities. Whether he will overcome his potential for<br>vice or weakness depends on how he is trained in his youth. If we recognize our nature<br>Â– our tendency towards laziness, irritability, worries, frustrations, wickedness,<br>cunningness, jealousy Â– we can take positive steps to overcome them. The first step in<br>solving problems is to recognize them for what they are.<br>Astrological interpretations indicate our inclinations and tendencies. Once pointed out we<br>must take the necessary steps to chart our lives in a manner that will make us useful<br>citizens of the world. Even a person with criminal tendencies can become a saint. If he<br>recognizes his nature and take steps to lead a good life.<br>A horoscope is a map drawn to shown the karmic force man carries, calculated from the<br>time of his birth. The force determines the time of birth and knowing this time, a skilful<br>astrologer can accurately chart a manÂ’s destiny within a given life-span.<br>Everybody knows that the earth takes approximately one year to move around the sun.<br>This movement, viewed from the earth, places the sun in various zodiacal areas during<br>year. A person is born (not accidentally but as a result of karmic influence) when the sun<br>is in transit in one of the twelve Zodiacal signs.<br>Through the horoscope, the map of your life, you can determine certain times in your life<br>when you have to slow down, certain times when you can push yourself to great levels of creativity, and certain period when you have to watch your health and related<br>activities.<br>The question most people ask is whether Buddhism accepts or rejects astrology. Strictly<br>speaking, the Buddha did not make any direct pronouncement on this subject because<br>as in many other cases, he stated that discussions on matters such as these do not<br>pertain to spiritual development. Buddhism, unlike some other religions, does not<br>condemn astrology and people are free to use the knowledge they can get from it to<br>make their lives more meaningful. However, if we study the BuddhaÂ’s teaching carefully<br>we will come to accept that a proper and intelligent understanding of astrology can be a<br>useful tool. Modern science is in accordance with the teachings of Buddhism. This<br>means that there is a direct link between the life of an individual human being and the<br>vast workings of the cosmos. We know for example that there is a close link between the<br>movement of the moon and our behavior. This is seen especially among mentally<br>disturbed and abnormally violent people. It is also true that certain sicknesses like<br>asthma and bronchitis are aggravated when the moon waxes. There is therefore no<br>reason for us not to believe that other planets can also influence our lives.<br>Buddhists accepts that there is an immense cosmic energy which pulsates through<br>every living thing, including plants. This energy interacts with the karmic energy which<br>individual generates and determines the course that a life will take. The birth of an<br>individual is not the first creation of a life but the continuation of one that always existed<br>and will continue to exist so long as the karmic energy is not quelled through final<br>liberation in the unconditioned state. Now, for a life to manifest itself in a new existence,<br>certain factors, namely seasons, germinal order and nature must be fulfilled. These are<br>supported by mental energy and karmic energy and all these elements are in constant<br>interaction and interdependent with each other resulting in constant changes to a human<br>beingÂ’s life.<br>According to astrologers the time at which a person is born is predetermined by the<br>cosmic energy and the karmic energy. Hence, it can be concluded that life is not merely<br>accidental; it is the result of the interaction between an individualÂ’s karma and the<br>universal energy force. The course of a human life is predetermined, cause partly by a<br>beingÂ’s own actions in the past and the energies that activate the cosmos. Once started,<br>a life is controlled by the interaction between these two forces even to the moment at<br>which a birth takes place. A skilful astrologer then, as one who understands cosmic as<br>well as karmic influence, can chart the course of oneÂ’s life, based on the moment of the<br>personÂ’s birth.</div><div class="quote_body">While we are in one sense at the mercy of these forces, the Buddha has pointed out a<br>way through which we can escape its influence. All karmic energies are stored in the<br>subconscious mind-normally described as mental purities and impurities. Since karmic<br>forces influence oneÂ’s destiny, a person can develop his mind and negate certain evil<br>influences caused by previous bad kamma. A person can also Â“purifyÂ” his mind and rid<br>himself of all karmic energies and thus prevent rebirth. When there is no rebirth, there is<br>no potential life and there will consequently be no Â“futureÂ” existence which can be<br>predicted or charted. At such stage of spiritual and mental development, one will have<br>transcended the need to know about his life because most imperfections and<br>unsatisfactoriness would have been removed. A highly developed human being will have<br>no need of a horoscope.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe even if the horoscope/astrology tells you about something, ultimately it is YOU who can change it... deities cannot do the work for you or change your destiny/karma. But it is ok to pay respect to them.<br><br><blockquote>some even said to me that to be enlightened, one has to be a virgin (like monks or nuns) but after examining a little more..... think thats not necessarily true needed. after all the historic buddha was a prince married, a father to his son before renouncing. its all in the mind to know.</blockquote>Very true. In fact I would like to add that many Lay-persons like us, who are not monks and nuns, also attained enlightenment. So practise and cultivation is not really for monks and nuns only, it is for everyone. Everyone has Buddha Nature, everyone will attain enlightenment.<br><br><blockquote>my inlaws are buddhist yet they advice me to pray to the "tai sui" cos i offend the "tai sui".... i have no intention naturally and have no intention to criticise anything either. </blockquote>Are you sure they are Buddhists? Those who follow just folks traditions, worship deities, are not considered as Buddhists, nor practising Buddhism. It is those who took refuge in the three treasures: Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, that are considered as Buddhists.<br><br>BTW, a very happy Chinese New Year in advance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the interesting articles and exchanges on horoscope and astrology.<br><br>good or bad, i know..... i have to cope with them naturally and most importantly is for me to learn not to cling on to either of them.<br><br>i believe i really believe we can change our destiny ourself.....<br><br>this is a blessing in some ways i could receive guidance even virtually. everyone of you and everything is my teacher. i always keep in mind what the awakened one said to believe in the spirit of the words and find search seek investigate for oneself...... yes be brave without fear.... step out and search seek..... realise and accept and....... let go........ even if one is alone......( just as HE did it alone all by HIMSELF)......<br><br>everything in this universe is too subtly profound for us to understand and judge with our unawakened minds. but we ought to understand that we must respect each and every individual for what and who they are - a universal unity in oneself.<br><br>thanks again....<br><br>happy lunar new year to all!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our Chinese ancestorsÂ’ idea of Time is controlled by the 10 heavenly stems and Space is governed by the 12 earthly branches.  The space-time interacts to produce the 60 year-cycle - 60 Hua Jia Chart (A combination of the 10 heavenly stems and earthly branches).  Since men reside within the space-time continuum, we are influenced by their movements and interactions.  This is the way our ancestors understand the universe.  It is a development from the Chinese Yin-Yang and Five Element philosophy -- not so much of a superstition.<br><br>However our tradition also believes that every of this Hua-Jia (each year in the 60-yearly cycle) is reigned by a deity.  Â“Tai SuiÂ” is a generic term to indicate the deity that is controlling the year of the hua-jia.  So there are a total of 60 Tai Sui.  If the earthly branch of the year in which we are born is in conflict or offended Â“Tai SuiÂ” (according to the five-element interaction philosophy), then the elderly will advise us to Â“pray to the tai sui".<br><br>In whatever case, in addition to non-clinging, a sincere heart towards all beings is equally important.  Not to offend them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Happy New Year.<br><br></div>

(karma) for this is the result of if i buy &amp; use i'll have radiant improved flawless skin or if didn't buy, my skin will turn from bad to worst deterioting skin problems.<br><br>am i in the right view? correct me....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cause can be conditions and can be effect. all 3 are inter changable.<br>example a smoke addict feel like buying cigarette to smoke. that urge or craving is an initial cause. then there are conditions such as money, distant of shop, advertisment, friend encouragment etcs...to add to your cause and then actual buying the cigarette is the effect. smoking can be a new cause where getting cancer is the effect.<br><br>but i think, karma of yin guo is not quite the usual action, reaction of object.<br>it takes 2 person for it to work. if u see the precepts. it's to stop killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, all and all greed, hatred, and folly.<br>because one make another person suffer, hence a back fire to oneself.<br>say if you kill/steal/lie to a person, that person will hold a revengeful mind on you. this energy don't vanish in mid air, it will come back like a ripple. in times to come, this energy will come back to u, and you don't even feel it, as it can come back as your close friend or love ones.<br><br>life is like a train trip. u board the train, then there are people stepping out and people stepping in. ppl who sit by your side is your close relatives. sooner or later, we also need to get off.<br><br>/\<br></div>
