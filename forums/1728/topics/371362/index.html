              <div><em></em> </div>
              <div>I arrived early to lead my meditation class in a low-security prison. A 
                      crim who I had never seen before was waiting to speak with me. He was a giant of 
                      a man with bushy hair and beard and tattooed arms; the scars on his face told me 
                      he’d been in many a violent fight. He looked so fearsome that I wondered why he 
                      was coming to learn meditation. He wasn’t the type. I was wrong of course.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He told me that something had happened a few 
                      days before that had spooked the hell out of him. As he started speaking, I 
                      picked up his thick Ulster accent. To give me some background, he told me that 
                      he had grown up in the violent streets of Belfast. His first stabbing was when 
                      he was seven years old. The school bully had demanded the money he had for 
                      lunch. He said no. The older boy took out a long knife and asked for the money a 
                      second time. He thought the bully was bluffing. He said no again. The bully 
                      never asked a third time, he just plunged the knife into the seven year-old’s 
                      arm, drew it out and walked away.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He told me that he ran in shock from the schoolyard, with blood streaming 
                      down his arm, to his father’s house close by. His unemployed father took one 
                      look at the wound and led his son to their kitchen, but not to dress the wound. 
                      The father opened a drawer, took out a big kitchen knife, gave it to his son, 
                      and ordered him to go back to school and stab the boy back.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That was how he had been brought up. If he hadn’t grown so big and strong, 
                      he would have been long dead.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The jail was a prison farm where short-term prisoners, or long-term 
                      prisoners close to release, could be prepared for life outside, some by learning 
                      a trade in the farming industry. Furthermore, the produce from the prison farm 
                      would supply all the prisons around Perth with inexpensive food, thus keeping 
                      down costs. Australian farms grow cows, sheep and pigs, not just wheat and 
                      vegetables; so did the prison farm. But unlike other farms, the prison farm had 
                      its own slaughterhouse, on-site.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Every prisoner had to have a job in the prison farm. I was informed by many 
                      of the inmates that the most sought-after jobs were in the slaughterhouse. These 
                      jobs were especially popular with violent offenders. And the most sought-after 
                      job of all, which you had to fight for, was the job of the slaugterer himself. 
                      That giant and fearsome Irishman was the slaughterer.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He described the slaughterhouse to me. Super-strong stainless steel 
                      railings, wide at the opening, narrowed down to a single channel inside the 
                      building, just wide enough for one animal to pass through at a time. Next to the 
                      narrow channel, raised on a platform, he would stand with the electric gun. 
                      Cows, pigs or sheep would be forced into the stainless steel funnel using dogs 
                      and cattle prods. He said they would always scream, each in its own way, and try 
                      to escape. They could smell death, hear death and feel death. When an animal was 
                      alongside his platform, it would be writhing and wriggling and moaning in full 
                      voice. Even though his gun could kill a large bull with a single high-voltage 
                      charge, the animal would never stand still long enough for him to aim properly. 
                      So it was one shot to stun, next shot to kill. One shot to stun, next shot to 
                      kill. Animal after animal. Day after day.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Irishmen started to become excited as he moved to the occurence, only a 
                      few days before, that he had unsettled him so much. He started to swear. In what 
                      followed, he kept repeating, ” This is God’s f…ing truth!” He was afraid I 
                      wouldn’t believe him.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That day they needed beef for the prisons around Perth. They were 
                      slaughtering cows. One shot to stun, next shot to kill. He was well into a 
                      normal day’s killing when a cow came up like he had never seen before. This cow 
                      was silent. There wasn’t even a whimper. Its head was down as it walked 
                      purposely voluntarily, slowly into position next to the platform. It did not 
                      writhe or wriggle or try to escape.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once in position, the cow lifted her head and stared at her executioner, 
                      absolutely still.</div>
              <div>The Irishmen hadn’t seen anything even close to this before. His mind went 
                      numb with confusion. He couldn’t lift his gun; nor could he take his eyes away 
                      from the eyes of the cow. The cow was looking right inside him.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He slipped into timeless spaces. He couldn’t tell me how long it took, but 
                      as the cow held him in eye contact, he noticed something that shook him even 
                      more. Cows have very big eyes. He saw in the left eye of the cow, above the 
                      lower eyelid, water begin to gather. The amount of water grew and grew, until it 
                      was too much for the eyelid to hold. It began to trickle slowly all the way down 
                      her cheek, forming a glistening line of tears. Long-closed doors were opening 
                      slowly to his heart. As he looked in disbelief, he saw in the right eye of the 
                      cow, above the lower eyelid, more water gathering, growing by the moment, until 
                      it too, was more than the eyelid could contain. A second stream of water 
                      trickled slowly down her face. And the man broke down.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The cow was crying.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He told me that he threw down his gun, swore to the full extent of his 
                      considerable capacity to the prison officers, that they could do whatever they 
                      liked to him, ” BUT THAT COW AIN’T DYING! “</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He ended by telling me he was a vegetarian now.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That story was true. Other inmates of the prison farm confirmed it for me. 
                      <span style="color: #ff007f;">The cow that cried taught one of the most violent of men 
                      what it means to care.</span></div>

              <p>It's difficult to become a full vegetarian (and I unfortunately, am not), but one can at least start the practice. For example my Master recommends having vegetarian breakfast everyday.</p>

              <h1>Matakabhatta Jataka: The Goat That Laughed and Wept (Jat 18)  <a id="jat018" class="back" title="Go up" name="jat018" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl135.html#top"> </a></h1>
              <p>One
              day, while the Buddha was staying in Jetavana, some bhikkhus asked him
              if there was any benefit in sacrificing goats, sheep, and other animals
              as offerings for departed relatives.</p>
              <p>"No, bhikkhus,"
              replied the Buddha. "No good ever comes from taking life, not even when
              it is for the purpose of providing a Feast for the Dead." Then he told
              this story of the past.</p>
              <div class="excerpt">Long, long ago,
              when Brahmadatta was reigning in Baranasi, a brahman decided to offer a
              Feast for the Dead and bought a goat to sacrifice. "My boys," he said
              to his students, "take this goat down to the river, bathe it, brush it,
              hang a garland around its neck, give it some grain to eat, and bring it
              back."
              <p>"Yes, sir," they replied and led the goat to the river.</p>
              <p>While
              they were grooming it, the goat started to laugh with a sound like a
              pot smashing. Then, just as strangely, it started to weep loudly.</p>
              <p>The
              young students were amazed at this behavior. "Why did you suddenly
              laugh," they asked the goat, "and why do you now cry so loudly?"</p>
              <p>"Repeat your question when we get back to your teacher," the goat answered.</p>
              <p>The
              students hurriedly took the goat back to their master and told him what
              had happened at the river. Hearing the story, the master himself asked
              the goat why it had laughed and why it had wept.</p>
              <p>"In
              times past, brahman," the goat began, "I was a brahman who taught the
              Vedas like you. I, too, sacrificed a goat as an offering for a Feast
              for the Dead. Because of killing that single goat, I have had my head
              cut off 499 times. I laughed aloud when I realized that this is my last
              birth as an animal to be sacrificed. Today I will be freed from my
              misery. On the other hand, I cried when I realized that, because of
              killing me, you, too, may be doomed to lose your head five hundred
              times. It was out of pity for you that I cried."</p>
              <p>"Well, goat," said the brahman, "in that case, I am not going to kill you."</p>
              <p>"Brahman!" exclaimed the goat. "Whether or not you kill me, I cannot escape death today."</p>
              <p>"Don't worry," the brahman assured the goat. "I will guard you."</p>
              <p>"You don't understand," the goat told him. "Your protection is weak. The force of my evil deed is very strong."</p>
              <p>The
              brahman untied the goat and said to his students, "Don't allow anyone
              to harm this goat." They obediently followed the animal to protect it.</p>
              <p>After
              the goat was freed, it began to graze. It stretched out its neck to
              reach the leaves on a bush growing near the top of a large rock. At
              that very instant a lightning bolt hit the rock, breaking off a sharp
              piece of stone which flew through the air and neatly cut off the goat's
              head. A crowd of people gathered around the dead goat and began to talk
              excitedly about the amazing accident.</p>
              <p>A tree deva<a id="t-5" class="noteTag" name="t-5" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/kawasaki/bl135.html#n-5">5</a> had observed everything from the goat's purchase to its dramatic death,
              and drawing a lesson from the incident, admonished the crowd: "If
              people only knew that the penalty would be rebirth into sorrow, they
              would cease from taking life. A horrible doom awaits one who slays."
              With this explanation of the law of kamma the deva instilled in his
              listeners the fear of hell. The people were so frightened that they
              completely gave up the practice of animal sacrifices. The deva further
              instructed the people in the Precepts and urged them to do good.</p>
              <p>Eventually,
              that deva passed away to fare according to his deserts. For several
              generations after that, people remained faithful to the Precepts and
              spent their lives in charity and meritorious works, so that many were
              reborn in the heavens.</p>
              </div>
              <p>The Buddha ended his lesson and identified the Birth by saying, "In those days I was that deva."</p>
