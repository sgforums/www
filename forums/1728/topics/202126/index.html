Buddha's viewpoint is not the same as sentient being's kind of viewpoint. Sentient being's viewpoint lies under the catergory of "mental perceptions", and because of that there is always a "me", "you", "mine", etc. Buddha's "viewpoint" is what some people call Pure Vision - seeing all as Buddha Nature, manifestations of Buddha Nature. When we attain this kind of Pure Vision, the world we live in is not different from Pure Land.<br><br>Rather, Buddha's viewpoint IS REALITY. First of all when enlightened, it is not someone who awakens or attains another viewpoint. It is simply realising that "Scott" or "Joe" are just dream characters. The dream character Scott or Joe didn't wake up. Therefore there is no such thing as "Scott becomes an enlightened person" or "Joe becomes an enlightened person". Buddha Nature is already awakened, the true nature of who we are is already awake, Buddha Nature is never asleep, only illusions fooling illusions.<br><br>Is reality connected to dream character?<br><br>Well reality is reality, the dream character Scott and Joe is also empty. The ground reality applies for all beings, there is no such thing as "my version of reality" or "your version of reality", when you wake up. The reality of Buddha applies to sentient beings too, and we are in reality not separate. So seeing that we are not separate, the Buddha feels compassionate for all of us and wants to wake us up, to realise that what we think we know, and all the sufferings, is in fact fictitious.</div>
