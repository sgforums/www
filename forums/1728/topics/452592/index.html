              <p>"Even if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others,<a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag" title="I.e., not skilled in reading the minds of others." name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.054.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> he should train himself: 'I will be skilled in reading my own mind.'</p>
              <p><a id="mirror" name="mirror"></a>"And how is a monk skilled in 
              reading his own mind? Imagine a young woman — or man — fond of 
              adornment, examining the image of her own face in a bright, clean mirror
               or bowl of clear water: If she saw any dirt or blemish there, she would
               try to remove it. If she saw no dirt or blemish there, she would be 
              pleased, her resolves fulfilled: 'How fortunate I am! How clean I am!' 
              In the same way, a monk's self-examination is very productive in terms 
              of skillful qualities:<a id="fnt-2" class="noteTag" title="I.e., if he conducts it in this way." name="fnt-2" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an10/an10.054.than.html#fn-2">[2]</a> 'Am I one who achieves internal tranquility of awareness, or am I one 
              who does not achieve internal tranquility of awareness? Am I one who 
              achieves insight into phenomena through heightened discernment, or am I 
              one who does not achieve insight into phenomena through heightened 
              discernment?"</p>
              <p>"If, on examination, he knows, 'I am one who achieves internal 
              tranquility of awareness but not insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment,' then his duty is to make an effort for the 
              maintenance of internal tranquility of awareness and for insight into 
              phenomena through heightened discernment. At a later time he will then 
              be one who achieves both internal tranquility of awareness and insight 
              into phenomena through heightened discernment.</p>
              <p>"But if, on examination, the monk knows, 'I am one who achieves 
              insight into phenomena through heightened discernment but not internal 
              tranquility of awareness,' then his duty is to make an effort for the 
              maintenance of insight into phenomena through heightened discernment and
               for internal tranquility of awareness. At a later time he will then be 
              one who achieves both insight into phenomena through heightened 
              discernment and internal tranquility of awareness.</p>
              <p>"But if, on examination, the monk knows, 'I am one who achieves 
              neither internal tranquility of awareness nor insight into phenomena 
              through heightened discernment,' then he should put forth extra desire, 
              effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; 
              alertness for gaining those very same skillful qualities. <a id="turban" name="turban"></a>Just
               as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra
               desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp;
               alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head; in the same way, 
              the monk should put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, 
              relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; alertness for gaining those very same
               skillful qualities.</p>
              <p>"But if, on examination, the monk knows, 'I am one who achieves both 
              internal tranquility of awareness and insight into phenomena through 
              heightened discernment,' then his duty is to make an effort in 
              maintaining those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for 
              the ending of the effluents.</p>
              <p>"Monks, I speak of robes in two ways: to be partaken of and not to be
