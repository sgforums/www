              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Role of Gods and Deities in Buddhism</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Barbara O'Brien June 30, 2017 ThoughtCo.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Are There Gods, or Aren't There?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is often asked if there are gods in Buddhism. The short
              answer is no, but also yes, depending on what you mean by "gods."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It also is often asked if it is all right for a Buddhist to
              believe in God, meaning the creator God as celebrated in Christianity, Judaism,
              Islam and other philosophies of monotheism. Again, this depends on what you
              mean by "God." As most monotheists define God, the answer is probably
              "no." But there are lots of ways to understand the principle of God.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism is sometimes called an "atheistic"
              religion, although some of us prefer "non-theistic"--meaning that
              believing in a God or gods really isn't the point. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">But it's certainly the case that there are all kinds of
              god-like creatures and beings called devas populating the early scriptures of
              Buddhism. Vajrayana Buddhism still makes use of tantric deities in its esoteric
              practices. And there are Buddhists who believe devotion to Amitabha Buddha will
              bring them to rebirth in the Pure Land.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So, how to explain this apparent contradiction?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What Do We Mean by
              Gods?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Let's start with poytheistic-type gods. In the world's
              religions these have been understood in many ways, most commonly, they are
              supernatural beings with some kind of agency---they control the weather, for
              example, or they might help you win victories. The classic Roman and Greek gods
              and goddesses are examples.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Practice in a religion based on polytheism mostly consists of
              practices to cause these gods to intercede on one's behalf.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If you deleted them the various gods, there wouldn't be a
              religion at all. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In traditional Buddhist folk religion, on the other hand, the
              devas are usually depicted as characters living in a number of other realms,
              separate from the human realm. They have their own problems and have no roles
              to play in the human realm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There is no point praying to them even if you believe in
              them, because they're not going to do anything for you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Whatever sort of existence they may or may not have really
              doesn't matter to Buddhist practice. Many of the stories told about the devas
              have allegorical points, but you can be a devoted Buddhist for your whole life
              and never give them any thought.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Tantric Deities</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Now, let's move on to the tantric deities. In Buddhism,
              tantra is the use of rituals, symbolism and yoga practices to evoke experiences
              that enable realization of enlightenment. The most common practice of Buddhist
              tantra is to experience oneself as a deity. In this case, then, the deities are
              more like archetypal symbols than supernatural creatures.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Here's an important point: Buddhist Vajrayana is based on
              Mahayana Buddhist teaching. And in Mahayana Buddhism, no phenomena has objective
              or independent existence. Not gods, not you, not your favorite tree, not your
              toaster (see "Sunyata, or Emptiness"). Things exist in a kind of
              relative way, taking identity from their function and position relative to
              other phenomena. But nothing is really separate or independent from everything
              else.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With this in mind, one can see that the tantric deities can
              be understood in many different ways.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Certainly there are people who understand them as something
              like the classic Greek gods--supernatural beings with a separate existence who
              might help you if you ask. But this is a somewhat unsophisticated understanding
              that modern Buddhist scholars and teachers have altered in favor of a symbolic,
              archetypal definition.Â  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Lama Thubten Yeshe wrote,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">"Tantric meditational deities should not be confused
              with what different mythologies and religions might mean when they speak of
              gods and goddesses. Here, the deity we choose to identify with represents the
              essential qualities of the fully awakened experience latent within us. To use
              the language of psychology, such a deity is an archetype of our own deepest
              nature, our most profound level of consciousness. In tantra we focus our
              attention on such an archetypal image and identify with it in order to arouse
              the deepest, most profound aspects of our being and bring them into our present
              reality." (Introduction to Tantra: A Vision of Totality [1987], p. 42)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Other Mahayana Godlike
              Beings</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Although they may not practice formal tantra, there are
              tantric elements running through much of Mahayana Buddhism. Iconic beings such
              as Avalokiteshvara are evoked to bring compassion to the world, yes, but we are
              her eyes and hands and feet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The same is true of Amitabha. Some may understand Amitabha as
              a deity who will take them to paradise (although not forever). Others may
              understand the Pure Land to be a state of mind and Amitabha as a projection of
              one's own devotional practice. But believing in one thing or another really
              isn't the point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What About God?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Finally, we get to the Big G. What did the Buddha say about
              him? Well, nothing that I know of. It's possible the Buddha was never exposed
              to monotheism as we know it. The concept of God as the one and only supreme
              being, and not just one god among many, was just coming into acceptance among
              Jewish scholars about the time the Buddha was born. This God concept may not
              have ever reached him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the God of
              monotheism, as commonly understood, can be dropped seamlessly into Buddhism.
              Frankly, in Buddhism, God has nothing to do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The creation of phenomena is taken care of by a kind of
              natural law called Dependent Origination. The consequences of our actions are
              accounted for by karma, which in Buddhism is also a kind of natural law that
              doesn't require a supernatural cosmic judge.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And if there is a God, he is us, too. His existence would be
              as dependent and conditioned as ours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Sometimes Buddhist teachers use the word "God," but
              their meaning is not something that most monotheists would recognize. They may
              be referring to the dharmakaya, for example, which the late Chogyam Trungpa
              described as "the basis of the original unbornness." The word
              "God" in this context has more in common with the Taoist idea of
              "the Tao" than with the familiar Judaic/Christian idea of God. </span></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">So, you see, the question as to whether there are or are not
              gods in Buddhism can't really be answered with a yes or no. Again, though,
              merely believing in Buddhist deities is pointless. How do you understand them?
              That's what matters.</span></p>
