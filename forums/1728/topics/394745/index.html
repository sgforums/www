              <p>I'm reading a book called 'Self-Inquiry' by Advance Yoga Practice founder Yogani. Self-Inquiry is not particularly Buddhist - it is utilized in Buddhist traditions (e.g. Ch'an Master Hsu Yun, and many other previous Zen masters), but also in Hinduism and other religions. Though the experience of I AMness and then non-duality is discussed, the realisation of emptiness is not reached through self-inquiry. For that we have to go into Buddhism. However, the following article which is a slightly modified form of a particular chapter in the e-book, and the e-book/book itself is very relevant to me because self-inquiry is one of my main practices currently.</p>

                      of Mind<br> <br> </span><span style="font-size: xx-small;"><span style="font-size: 18px;">From: Yogani<br> Date: <span lang="en-us">May 3</span>, 2009<br> <br> New Members: It is recommended you read from the beginning of the 
                      web archive, as previous
                          lessons are prerequisite to this one. The first lesson is, "<a href="http://www.aypsite.org/10.html">Why
                          This Discussion?</a>"</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> <br> <br> <br> As we have discussed in the previous lesson, there are many styles 
                      of 
                          self-inquiry, embodying a variety of systems of practice. Each may 
                      emphasize 
                          a particular angle, with its own philosophy, terminology and mental 
                          algorithms.<br> <br> The <span lang="en-us">styles</span> can vary widely, from 
                      prescribing 
                          complete conscious engagement in the minutest details of the 
                      identification 
                          of awareness with objects of perception (sometimes called <em>mindfulness</em>),
                       
                          to letting go of life altogether, including all seeking. Whatever 
                      the 
                          teaching may be, it will always reflect the experience of the 
                      particular 
                          teacher who is transmitting the knowledge. There will be a bias, and
                       the 
                          teaching may or may not resonate with all students who come to study
                       that 
                          approach. It is up to the student to find a teaching that does 
                      resonate. <br> <br> All self-inquiry teachings have one thing in common – they seek to 
                      dissolve 
                          the identification of awareness with objects of perception, 
                      including all 
                          thoughts, feelings and objects of the world. The goal of 
                      self-inquiry is to 
                          eliminate the bondage of "me and mine," as fabricated by the mind. <br> <br> We all come at different stages of readiness to undertake this 
                      unwinding of 
                          the ego, as it has been called. In truth, it will not make any sense
                       at all 
                          to most of us, until we have tasted the peace of inner silence 
                      within us. 
                          Then we know there is something more to us than the many props we 
                      have used 
                          to create our identity in the world – <span lang="en-us">the</span> identity 
                          that <span lang="en-us">we </span>all know will end as the body 
                      decays and 
                          dies. As soon as we have glimpsed the eternal within ourselves, it 
                      is a 
                          whole new ball game. There is something more than the limited and 
                          ever-grasping ego. To know it we must make a journey that 
                      encompasses heart, 
                          mind and body. Nothing less will do. <br> <br> Times are changing. Now it is time for spiritual teachings to serve 
                      the 
                          people, instead of the other way around. And in order to do so, the 
                          teachings must be open, flexible, and, most importantly, effective. 
                      To be 
                          effective, such teachings must be capable of addressing every 
                      student at 
                          every level of readiness. If the student has the desire to grow and 
                      is 
                          willing to make a commitment of time and some discipline, then the 
                      teaching 
                          must be able to deliver viable means, or it will be in need of some 
                          improvement. This is okay. If teachings are flexible, they will 
                      serve the 
                          people where they are, and evolve as the people evolve. <br> <br> Self-inquiry is a particularly tricky one for application for 
                      different 
                          levels of students. In the case of AYP, we begin with daily deep 
                      meditation, 
                          which will cultivate inner silence. Additional methods of yoga are 
                      be added 
                          as appropriate. A foundational knowledge of self-inquiry is also 
                      necessary.<br> <br> First, it is good to know that in our essential nature we are 
                      unbounded pure 
                          bliss consciousness, and that all we are doing in practices is 
                      unfolding 
                          what we already are in our daily life. It is also good to know that 
                      this 
                          will lead to many practical benefits. So, it is a worthwhile 
                      endeavor to be 
                          on the path.<br> <br> Next, it is also good to know that there is a natural progression in
                       our 
                          spiritual unfoldment which occurs over time, usually over a long 
                      time, 
                          except in the rare cases of people who are born near enlightenment. 
                      In spite 
                          of what we may have heard, enlightenment is not an overnight event 
                      for most 
                          people. There is no getting around this, because each of us must go 
                      through 
                          a process of inner purification and opening, and it takes time, even
                       with 
                          the best of teachings. Along the way, there are grades and stages, 
                      and the 
                          journey never ends, even for those who are very advanced. Perhaps 
                      especially 
                          for them, because they become much more aware of the wider need for 
                      rising 
                          inner silence in the community, world and beyond, and find 
                      themselves on the 
                          front line of that great endeavor. We all help as we can, and the 
                          enlightened can help so much more. The more we can do, the more we 
                      will be 
                          called to do.<br> <br> For the individual, there is a progression of integrated practices 
                      that is 
                          mapped out in a step-by-step way throughout these lessons for 
                      cultivating 
                          the necessary purification and opening. For self-inquiry, there is a
                       
                          progression also. Not that it is required for everyone to go through
                       a 
                          progression of self-inquiry methods. One may not even use structured
                       
                          self-inquiry methods at all, and still be going through the process 
                      of 
                          self-inquiry based on the natural emergence of inner silence and the
                       
                          increasingly clear perceptions of <em>Self </em>(witness) in relation 
                      to the 
                          objects of experience. <br> <br> Regardless of structured self-inquiry methods, or the lack of them, 
                      some 
                          recognizable stages of mind will evolve, and it can save time and 
                      some 
                          confusion to be aware of these, particularly for those who have a 
                      tendency 
                          to try and run to the end before covering the beginning or the 
                      middle. The 
                          beginning and the middle can be just as fulfilling as the end if we 
                      are 
                          reasonably well in touch with where we are on our path. It does not 
                      have to 
                          be so mysterious. With some basic knowledge, we will do much better,
                       and not 
                          be so much exposed to the hazards of taking blind leaps led by our 
                          over-eager mind (more on the "pitfalls of the mind" in an upcoming 
                      lesson).
                          <br> <br> Assuming one is engaged in daily deep meditation, here are five 
                      stages of 
                          mind that self-inquiry may play itself upon as we move along in our 
                          development: </span></p>
              <ol><span style="font-size: medium;">
              <li>
              <p>Pre-Witnessing – Information and intellectual 
                      assessments about truth 
                            provide inspiration, and a tendency to build mental castles in the
                       air, 
                            ideas reacting with ideas, which is non-relational self-inquiry. 
                      So we do 
                            what is necessary to cultivate the witness.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Witnessing – Perceiving the world, our thoughts 
                      and feelings as 
                            objects separate from <em>Self</em>. It is the beginning of 
                      relational 
                            self-inquiry, chosen or not.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Discrimination – The reversal of identification by
                       logical choices 
                            based on direct perception rooted in stillness. This is more 
                      advanced 
                            relational self-inquiry which is able to discern the real from the
                       unreal.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Dispassion – Rise of the condition of no judgment 
                      and no attachment. 
                            The process of self-inquiry becoming automatic to the point of all
                       objects 
                            and self-inquiry itself being constantly dissolved in the witness.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Unity – The merging of subject and object: "I am <em>That</em>.
                       You are
                            <em>That</em>. All this is <em>That</em>." Ongoing outpouring divine 
                      love and 
                            service to others as<span lang="en-us"> universal </span><em>Self</em>.</p>
              </li>
              </span></ol>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;">While progress 
                      on the road to enlightenment may be 
                          erratic, difficult or non-existent when engaged in self-inquiry as a
                       
                          stand-alone approach, it is quite a different story when 
                      self-inquiry is 
                          used in concert with a path based on an integration of tried and 
                      true yoga 
                          methods.<br> <br> The cultivation of inner silence (the witness) in deep meditation 
                      assures 
                          that our perception will be expanding from within over time, and 
                      this 
                          provides for an increasingly fertile field for the process of 
                      self-inquiry 
                          to occur. So too, does our experience in daily samyama practice 
                      cultivate 
                          our ability to release in stillness and live more from the level of 
                      our 
                          abiding inner silence<span lang="en-us">.</span><br> <br> As purification and opening proceed within us, our self-inquiry 
                      methods will 
                          change and refine over time, as we migrate from pre-witnessing to 
                          witnessing, discrimination, dispassion and <span lang="en-us">u</span>nity.<br> <br> The steady emergence of inner silence and our ability to release our
                       
                          intentions and perceptions within it are the dynamics behind the 
                      progression 
                          of self-inquiry from non-relational to relational, until the 
                      experiencer and 
                          the experience have merged to become <em>One</em>, self-sufficient, 
                      active in 
                          the world, and free of the bondage of identification and suffering.<br> <br> <strong><em>Pre-Witnessing</em> </strong><br> How meaningful is self-inquiry of the absolute <span lang="en-us"> (non-duality) </span>kind when we are still in the pre-witnessing 
                      stage of 
                          mind? This is when all things are still considered primarily on the 
                      level of 
                          thinking and logic. In this state, what does it mean to us when we 
                      hear, 
                          "All this you see here in the world is illusion, and you are the 
                      reality 
                          behind it."<br> <br> We might have some inspiration, a desire may be kindled to know 
                      more, to be 
                          more. Hopefully. But the more we think about it, the more layers we 
                      will 
                          create around that essential desire to know the truth. How many 
                      times will 
                          we have to repeat the question "<em>Who am I?</em>" before we will 
                      have a 
                          glimmer of who and what we really are? And how many books will we 
                      have to 
                          read? This is why we call pre-witnessing the stage of <em>inspiration
                       and 
                          building castles in the air</em>. Not much more than this can happen 
                      until we 
                          move to the next stage. With suitable inspiration, we will be 
                      compelled to 
                          take action beyond pounding the idea against the infinite with our 
                      tiny 
                          brain! The mind can only run in circles for so long before we 
                      realize that 
                          we must add something else to the mix.<br> <br> Once we are inspired to uncover the truth, it is important to take 
                      action, 
                          intelligent action. Self-inquiry purists will say, "Take no action. 
                      Do 
                          nothing. Just be!" Well, we can attempt to do that for a very long 
                      time in 
                          pre-witnessing mode. No doubt we can develop some witness quality by
                       working 
                          on just being. But there is a much faster way. <br> <br> If we commit to take action using all the tools that are available 
                      to us, we 
                          can travel very quickly along the road of realizing what we already 
                      are – 
                          our inner most<em> Self.</em> With deep meditation and a full battery 
                      of 
                          supporting practices we will move surely into the witnessing stage.<br> <em><br> <strong>Witnessing </strong><br> </em>As mentioned before, the witnessing stage is a whole new ball 
                      game. It 
                          should be pointed out that there is witnessing and there is 
                      witnessing. 
                          There is a continuum of development as witnessing emerges. It begins
                       as a 
                          passive inner condition perceived as a separation from the events 
                      going on 
                          around us, often first noticed during the occurrence of dynamic 
                      events. 
                          Everyone has had the experience of <em>time standing still</em> when a
                       dynamic 
                          event occurred, like a car crash, explosion or other sudden change 
                      in our 
                          physical environment. When the witness begins to emerge, ordinary 
                      events are 
                          gradually experienced more in this way also. As witnessing continues
                       to 
                          advance, our body, thoughts and feelings become objects of 
                      perception that 
                          are separate from our sense of self, our witness. This is an 
                      important 
                          development.<br> <br> Before the witness has developed to the point where our thoughts and
                       
                          feelings become objects of perception, self-inquiry will be mostly 
                          non-relational, meaning not fully connected with who we are – pure 
                          consciousness. The dawn of the witness sets the stage for real 
                      self-inquiry, 
                          and an ongoing change in our life experience, for this is when the 
                      process 
                          can move beyond ideas to the direct experience. And the direct 
                      experience is
                          <em>beyond</em> all experience. In the initial witness condition, we 
                      are 
                          experiencing, but we are not the experience. We are beyond it, 
                      seeing from 
                          the point of view of separate pure awareness.<br> <br> There are a few more steps beyond the emergence of the witness that 
                      we must 
                          go through. It is not enough to be strongly established in inner 
                      silence, 
                          seeing the changing world as separate from ourselves. We must do 
                      something 
                          with it to move it forward. Evolution compels us to do so. With a 
                      little 
                          nudging, it happens naturally enough. This is where self-inquiry can
                       have 
                          its greatest impact on our over all path to enlightenment, because 
                      we are 
                          able to make conscious choices based in our stillness. We see our 
                      thoughts, 
                          feelings and perceptions of the world for what they are, without 
                      being 
                          entirely identified with them. We are then able to engage in a way 
                      that is 
                          liberating rather than binding, both for ourselves and for others. <br> <br> Other yoga practices are an aid to this process, such as samyama, 
                      spinal 
                          breathing pranayama, and additional practices that cultivate 
                      ecstatic 
                          conductivity (kundalini awakening) in the body. As we become more 
                          established in both inner silence and ecstatic conductivity, we 
                      experience 
                          refinements in perception and the movement of dynamic stillness into
                       our 
                          thought processes. These developments support steadily increasing 
                          effectiveness in relational self-inquiry. <br> <em><br> <strong>Discrimination</strong><br> </em>When we think of discrimination, the normal interpretation is 
                      that we 
                          are choosing between this or that thing – choosing between this or 
                      that 
                          idea. Non-relational self-inquiry is like that, choosing between 
                      things, 
                          ideas, and ways we imagine we would like for life to be. This kind 
                      of 
                          discrimination is circular, goes nowhere fast, and may go nowhere 
                      for a long 
                          time. Even choosing not to think is a gigantic task when undertaken 
                          non-relationally, without the witness present to support our 
                      endeavor. <br> <br> With the rising presence of the witness, the entire dynamic of 
                      self-inquiry 
                          changes. Then we are choosing between that which is object (things, 
                      ideas, 
                          emotions) and that which is subject (witness, <em>Self</em>). And that
                       kind of 
                          choosing is not a doing at all. It is a letting go. A surrender, 
                      even while 
                          we are being active in the world. <br> <br> We all know what we want. We want to know the truth. We want to be 
                      happy. We 
                          want to be free. Since childhood we have been told that the truth 
                      will set 
                          us free from the burdens of this life. So we want <em>That</em>.<br> <br> As the witness becomes more and more abiding and quietly observing 
                      every 
                          thought and feeling, we come to know ourselves as <em>That</em>, 
                      unshaken and 
                          independent of all of our experiences, including our own thoughts … 
                      then we 
                          are finally in the position to make choices that will unwind the 
                      habitual 
                          identification with experiences and the dream we have been in up 
                      until now.
                          <br> <br> It is a new perspective from which we can clearly see what is real 
                      and what 
                          is not. At the same time, it is both as profound and as simple as 
                      directly 
                          perceiving what is eternal and what is not. And we can discriminate 
                          accordingly, making logical choices that are grounded in stillness, 
                          unwinding the lingering habit of the mind to identify itself with 
                      the 
                          objects of experience, both outside and inside us.<br> <br> In the language of advaita (non-duality), it is called <em>neti neti</em>,
                       
                          which means <em>not this and not this</em>. When the witness is 
                      sufficiently 
                          present for relational self-inquiry to occur in the form of 
                      discrimination, 
                          then neti neti becomes a reality. We directly perceive what is true 
                      and what 
                          is not, and we can easily choose. Before then, neti neti will be an 
                      exercise 
                          of the intellect, and can be as ineffective and exhausting as any 
                      other 
                          non-relational self-inquiry. We will know the witness is dawning in 
                      earnest 
                          when discrimination becomes easier. It is a telltale sign. <br> <br> A certain excitement comes with the realization that we have arrived
                       at the 
                          point of being able to choose with certainty that which is real over
                       that 
                          which is not. There can even be an enthusiasm to the exclusion of 
                      all else, 
                          and we have to guard against throwing out the practices that have 
                      brought us 
                          to this point. There can be a tendency to plant our flag on the 
                      notion that 
                          we are <em>That</em>, and fixate on the idea that all we have to do 
                      from then 
                          on is hang onto <em>That</em>. <br> <br> If this happens, it can be slipping into non-relational self-inquiry
                       again. 
                          It can happen to advanced practitioners. Much better we should 
                      continue with 
                          the practices that brought us to this point and strengthen the 
                      presence of 
                          the witness beyond all tendencies we might have to imagine that we 
                      have 
                          attained anything. Even the most advanced practitioners must guard 
                      against 
                          falling into non-relational self-inquiry.<br> <br> Certainly we can take giant leaps toward realization when our 
                      ability has 
                          risen to clearly discriminate between objects (external and 
                      internal) and 
                          the subject (the witness – our <em>Self</em>). It is prime time for 
                          self-inquiry. But it will not be the only thing going on, assuming 
                      we have 
                          been wise and continue with our daily routine of yoga practices. All
                       methods 
                          combined will assure our rapid forward progress.<br> <br> Self-inquiry is useful, but it cannot be trusted to operate alone. 
                      Certainly 
                          not at the discrimination stage, or at any prior stage. <br> <br> There will come a time when discrimination begins to give way to 
                      something 
                          else. It is the letting go of the need to make choices anymore. The 
                      subject 
                          (witness) becomes so well established that choices no longer need to
                       be 
                          made. We just are, and we can allow everything in our field of 
                      awareness to 
                          just be, even as we are interacting normally in every day living. We
                       call 
                          this the dispassion stage. It is the stage of being completely 
                      unruffled by 
                          anything that happens inside or outside us. <br> <em><br> <strong>Dispassion</strong><br> </em>The condition of dispassion is one of the primary goals of 
                      self-inquiry. 
                          Those who are very enthusiastic and dedicated to self-inquiry are 
                      very 
                          passionate about developing dispassion. This is non-relational 
                      self-inquiry, 
                          of course. We all have to begin somewhere. We can’t begin at the 
                      end, though 
                          we may certainly be passionate about the ideal we have chosen, and 
                      that 
                          serves a purpose. It is our bhakti (devotion to our chosen ideal). <br> <br> Dispassion is not a doing at all, and is beyond self-inquiry itself.
                       It 
                          isn’t even a letting go, for it is beyond choice. Dispassion is a 
                      state of 
                          being. It is the subject (the witness, our sense of <em>Self</em>) 
                      developed 
                          through an integration of practices to the point where all the 
                      objects of 
                          experience are taken in stride, without identification. This applies
                       to 
                          events, relationships, and all that is going on in the body, heart 
                      and mind.<br> <br> Is dispassion a state of indifference, a state of uncaring? Does it 
                      mean we 
                          do not act or react in the world? It does not mean that. It is just 
                      the 
                          opposite. Much of spiritual development is paradoxical, with less 
                      becoming 
                          much more. <br> <br> The gradual emergence of dispassion means we are becoming more free 
                      to act 
                          for the good of all. Inner silence will <em>move</em> to do this 
                      through us 
                          more and more, the further we travel along the path. It is the 
                      paradox of 
                          enlightenment. The more we have gone beyond, the more engaged we 
                      will become 
                          for the benefit of others. This is the nature of divine 
                      consciousness.<br> <br> We really have to give credit where credit is due. Deep meditation 
                      (if we 
                          are doing it) is the primary cultivator of dispassion, because 
                      dispassion is 
                          an advanced stage of the witness. A stand-alone path of self-inquiry
                       can 
                          lead to dispassion also, but it is rare. To succeed, self-inquiry 
                      must 
                          ascend to the level of meditation, the transcendence of all objects 
                      of 
                          attention. If self-inquiry is done like this over time, then the 
                      witness 
                          will dawn and, in more time, there will be dispassion. It is a 
                      difficult 
                          path, because it lacks a structured and efficient routine of 
                      practice. The 
                          concept of <em>practice</em> itself may be lacking. Self-inquiry of 
                      the 
                          stand-alone variety will be about constantly remembering to release 
                      all 
                          objects of perception, including all thoughts, feelings and 
                      perceptions of 
                          external objects. When self-inquiry becomes a deeply ingrained 
                      habit, then 
                          that will be a kind of ongoing meditation. How an approach like this
                       will 
                          fit into daily life is another question, since it requires ongoing 
                          self-inquiry to be incorporated into every nook and cranny of our 
                      daily 
                          life. This may not be practical for someone with a family and 
                      career. There 
                          can be direct conflicts, particularly before the witness has dawned.
                       <br> <br> On the other hand, if deep meditation and other sitting practices
                          <span lang="en-us">are </span>undertaken in a structured twice-daily
                       
                          routine, and life is lived normally, the witness will be coming up 
                      naturally 
                          as a support to family and career, and also as a support to 
                      undertake 
                          self-inquiry in a way that does not disrupt the normal flow of life.
                       Deep 
                          meditation provides the witness, and self-inquiry provides the 
                      perspective 
                          in a way that is not replacing everyday life and activities, but 
                      enhancing 
                          them.<br> <br> Dispassion is at home in the marketplace, as well as in the remote 
                      retreat. 
                          It is all the same. The combination of daily deep meditation and 
                      gradually 
                          emerging self-inquiry provides flexibility for living, and is a much
                       faster 
                          path as well. <br> <em><br> <strong>Unity</strong><br> </em>No one knows what the true nature of existence is outside the 
                      realm of 
                          time and space. Yet, oddly enough, we can experience it directly. 
                      The reason 
                          we say "We cannot know" is because the reality we are all able to 
                      experience 
                          through deep meditation and self-inquiry is outside the field of 
                      knowing. It 
                          is <em>That</em>, and thousands of volumes have been written 
                      attempting to 
                          describe <em>That</em>. <br> <br> In the end, the best we can do is say, "I am <em>That</em>." Then we 
                      can carry 
                          on with the many descriptions of <em>That</em> – pure bliss 
                      consciousness, 
                          void, Tao, God, Allah… It doesn’t really matter what we call it. <em>That</em> is as good a word as any, and we are <em>That</em>. All that exists is
                       <em>That</em>.<br> <br> If it sounds a little impersonal, it is not intended to be. For <em>That</em> is the source of all love, compassion, goodness, creativity and 
                      happiness in 
                          the world. <em>That</em> illuminates us with these divine qualities, 
                      and is 
                          the source of all good deeds. <br> <br> There is a misunderstanding that has been perpetuated by some 
                      teachers – the 
                          premise that becoming <em>That</em> is the only thing of importance 
                      and 
                          nothing here on earth matters at all. In fact, according to this 
                      premise, 
                          nothing here on earth exists. In a philosophical sense this may be 
                      true. We 
                          learned it in high school quantum physics, yes? Yet, when taken on 
                      the level 
                          of intellect, it is one of the biggest traps for getting stuck in 
                          non-relational self-inquiry. <br> <br> There is the idea that it matters not one bit what becomes of this 
                      earth or 
                          the multitude of life that is on it. There is a distinction between 
                      one who 
                          is truly enlightened and one who has created a division between 
                      themselves 
                          and the rest of the world through non-relational self-inquiry, 
                      enforced by a 
                          rigid intellectual view. With clear relational self-inquiry based in
                       
                          stillness, we can reject this out of hand. <em>Neti neti!</em> <br> <br> The enlightened one will be he or she who remains engaged for the 
                      benefit of 
                          all as <em>That</em>. Advancement on the path to enlightenment brings 
                      with it 
                          the perception that we can only be free when all are free, for we 
                      are <em>One</em> with all who are suffering. <br> <br> The image of the lone sage on the mountaintop, indifferent to the 
                      travails 
                          of the world, is fiction. If a sage is not engaged in some way for 
                      the 
                          benefit of others, their condition will be in question. True 
                      enlightenment 
                          is the spontaneous outpouring of divine love, which is working 
                      constantly to 
                          uplift everyone. The sage becomes a willing and wide open channel 
                      for <em> That</em>,<em> </em>which does nothing even while doing everything. <br> <br> So, while yoga and self-inquiry are often viewed as a going beyond, 
                      never to 
                          return, it is not so. We can never leave what is here and now, for 
                      it is 
                          what we are in our own <em>Self</em>. The journey of yoga, and of 
                          self-inquiry, is a journey beyond all that is, ending in a return 
                      and full 
                          engagement for the betterment of humankind – a journey from <em>here 
                      to here</em>. 
                          This is the highest knowledge, and its highest manifestation in this
                       world.
                          <br> <br> "<em>I am That. You are That. All this is That.</em>" <br> <br> It is an unending outpouring of divine love, whose fundamental 
                      nature and 
                          ultimate fruition is life everywhere residing in the <em>Oneness</em> of 
                          unity. It has always been <em>That</em> and will always be <em>That</em>.
                       The 
                          witness and self-inquiry lead to direct realization of <em>That</em>.<br> <br> The guru is in you.<br> <br> <strong>Note:</strong> For <span lang="en-us">detailed discussion on the

              <p>I think the e-book is really quite complete and a good guide for those practicing self-inquiry.</p>
              <p>Posting another small excerpt from the book:</p>
              <p><strong>Practical Applications of Self-Inquiry</strong></p>
              <p><br>We know now that self-inquiry is practical when it<br>is relational, and not very practical when it is nonrelational.<br>What does this mean?</p>
              <p><br>If we are inquiring about who we are (Who am I?),<br>or making affirmations about who we are (I am That),<br>and these are only ideas making more ideas, rather than<br>releasing into the actual presence of inner silence (the<br>witness), then the inquiry or affirmation will be nonrelational,<br>and therefore not very practical. From this, it<br>stands to reason that the level and kind of self-inquiry</p>
              <p>we are doing will, by necessity, be matched up with the<br>degree of witness we have present in our awareness.<br>The more prevalent the witness, the more far-reaching<br>our self-inquiry will be, while remaining relational.<br>So, logically, the first step on a path of self-inquiry<br>will be the ongoing cultivation of the witness. In the<br>approach we use in AYP, that will be via deep<br>meditation. In any effective system where self-inquiry<br>is employed, some kind of meditation will be present,<br>whether it be in the form of a regular sitting practice, or<br>an aspect of the self-inquiry itself.</p>
              <p><br>Once we have been cultivating the witness, the next<br>step will be to notice its presence. It may be noticed as<br>a calmness – events occurring without leaving<br>impressions as they did before, more happiness, a<br>bubbling up of creative energy, increased desire to<br>know the truth via more study and inquiry. Or we may<br>notice a silent wakefulness in-between our waking<br>thoughts, during dreaming while we are asleep, or<br>while we are in dreamless deep sleep. Any or all of<br>these.</p>
              <p><br>Once we have noticed the witness, we may still find<br>the absolute philosophical tenet of non-duality to be<br>quite foreign – the idea that there is only That, and all<br>this I experience in the world and in my mind is<br>illusion, unreal. Hammering on this idea will not help<br>us much to see that it is so, though anyone is welcome<br>to do that. It will likely remain non-relational for some<br>time before the truth begins to peek through.</p>
              <p><br>Much better to continue with daily sitting practices,<br>and then take on self-inquiry right where we are in<br>more mundane ways. If we learn to crawl first, and then<br>stand up while holding on to something, we will be<br>much less likely to fall flat on our face when we try to<br>walk. If we take it step-by-step, we will be running</p>
              <p>before we know it. At some point we may find<br>ourselves having the time to notice who is noticing. It<br>doesn’t take any time at all really – only the witness. It<br>begins in the many gaps of stillness that occur inbetween<br>everything that happens in our daily<br>experience, between our thoughts, feelings and<br>perceptions of the world. Eventually, the gaps expand<br>and merge to encompass our experience twenty-four<br>hours per day. Then we notice our stillness has become<br>the blank movie screen upon which the entire drama of<br>life is being projected.</p>
              <p><br>Let’s consider the five stages of mind discussed in<br>the previous chapter. When we get to the point where<br>we begin to witness our surroundings, thoughts, and<br>feelings as being somehow outside ourselves (see last<br>chapter, stage 2 – witnessing), then this is not<br>necessarily the time to drop our active engagement in<br>the world in favor of asserting, “I am That!”<br>It isn’t necessarily the time either for pressing hard<br>in our every waking moment with the inquiry, “Who am<br>I?” While noticing and becoming identified with the<br>witness puts us in the position to discriminate between<br>the objects of our perception and the witness (stage 3),<br>it does not mean we are ready to jump straight into<br>dispassion (stage 4) and full realization of “I am That”<br>(stage 5). It would be nice, but it seldom works that<br>way. For those who try and leap that far immediately<br>when they find a taste of real discrimination, it can be a<br>rocky road with a lot of confusion and non-relational<br>backsliding. Or is it forward sliding?</p>
              <p><br>Either way, instead of taking the leap, we will be<br>wise to inquire about our every day experiences in the<br>here and now first, and begin to find relational selfinquiry<br>in those. By bringing in the witness through<br>daily deep meditation and gradually taking a different</p>
              <p>tact in our relationship with our own thoughts, we can<br>improve our effectiveness and happiness in daily living.<br>This kind of self-inquiry has tangible benefits, and is<br>worth doing. Then we will be on our way to a more<br>ultimate kind of self-inquiry. There is a natural<br>progression in it.</p>
              <p><br>We all know how difficult it can be to change our<br>life by thinking alone, and some of us struggle with it<br>constantly. It seems no matter how hard we try, our<br>relationships seem to keep going along the same tracks,<br>and the realization we are working to achieve may<br>elude us for a long time. The reason is because we are<br>wrapped up in the ways we relate and in the ways we<br>pursue our objectives in life. In short, we are identified<br>with the life we have been living, including our style of<br>thinking and relating. Deep inside, we believe that this<br>is who we are.</p>
              <p><br>The witness is beyond these deep-seated beliefs, so<br>when we begin to inquire from that perspective, the<br>identification begins to unwind. Then we begin to see<br>beyond our dream, and can interact in ways that may<br>have seemed impossible to us before.</p>
              <p><br>Freedom! It is very practical.</p>
              <p><br>We don’t have to worry about realizing the ultimate<br>truth, because once we begin to get our every day house<br>in order with relational self-inquiry, the big picture will<br>not be far from us. It is important to avoid overextending<br>ourselves. We should learn to stand up and<br>walk before we try and run.</p>
              <p><br>There is great truth in the advice that if we want to<br>measure the merit of a sage, we should look first at<br>their ordinary relationships, rather than at their mystical<br>attainments.</p>
              <p>There are a variety of self-inquiry systems and<br>they fall into two categories:</p>
              <p><br>ô€‚ƒ Inquiry about our every day interactions and<br>activities, with the aim to live in greater harmony<br>and happiness.<br>ô€‚ƒ Inquiry about the ultimate nature of existence, and<br>who we are in relation to That.</p>
              <p><br>To be honest, the various kinds of self-inquiry<br>systems in these two categories will work equally well<br>if the witness is present. If there is a grain of truth in<br>them, the witness will know, and self-inquiry will be<br>good. Even if there is only little truth in a particular<br>angle of inquiry, the witness will find the truth in that<br>also. All inquiry for truth, whether on the level of every<br>day living or the cosmic level, depends on that kind of<br>resonance with truth (the witness). The presence of that<br>resonance in self-inquiry is what makes it relational and<br>practical.</p>
              <p><br>Not everyone is inclined to engage in structured<br>self-inquiry, using specific mental algorithms, or<br>formulas. That is okay. Structured self-inquiry is not<br>mandatory if we are cultivating the witness. Our<br>ongoing desire for truth and the presence of the witness<br>will be enough to bring us along into full realization in<br>good time. In that situation, we will know the truth,<br>whether we are deliberately inquiring or not.</p>
              <p><br>Ironically, those who are the most enthusiastic<br>about doing self-inquiry will often be those who will<br>gain the least from it. These are people with very<br>curious and analytical minds, constantly testing mental<br>algorithms, but perhaps with less inclination to bring<br>the mind to stillness in daily deep meditation. So there</p>
              <p>will be a lot of non-relational inquiry and analysis<br>going on there, but very little relational self-inquiry.<br>There are numerous systems of self-inquiry that are<br>offered in the spiritual marketplace these days. All will<br>be effective if they are done relationally, with presence<br>of the witness. And not one of them will be effective if<br>it is done non-relationally, with thoughts manipulating<br>and interacting with thoughts. For this reason, we are<br>not laying out specific schemes of structured selfinquiry<br>in detail here. The effectiveness of self-inquiry<br>does not rely very much on the particular mental<br>algorithm we happen to be using.</p>
              <p><br>Therefore, it is not necessary to examine the many<br>structured systems of self-inquiry in this small book. It<br>will be easy enough to look them up and gravitate<br>toward approaches that suit our nature. Or perhaps we<br>will evolve our own way of inquiring deep into the<br>nature of things in relation to the rise of our own<br>witness consciousness. In self-inquiry especially, the<br>natural approach is usually the best approach, because<br>it carries no pretense. We call it as we see it. We will<br>know the approach to self-inquiry we are using is<br>relational by its ease and effectiveness.</p>
              <p><br>Until we have found our own way by direct<br>experience in stillness, this book can be a help in<br>understanding the underlying principles of self-inquiry,<br>and put us in a better position to evaluate any system of<br>self-inquiry, or any philosophy and its mental strategies<br>for unfolding full human potential. In taking a wise<br>approach by cultivating the witness first, we will be<br>able to easily distinguish useful methods from those<br>that are not so useful for us at every step along the way.<br>We will find the truth everywhere when we have the<br>inner witness to see it.</p>
              <p>In discussing self-inquiry here, we will make a<br>fundamental distinction between how we regard our<br>every day experiences, and how we might regard the<br>ultimate truth of existence and our role in it. These are<br>different categories of self-inquiry directly related to<br>the stages of mind discussed in the last chapter. Both<br>are essentially about the same thing, and are leading to<br>the same realization.</p>
