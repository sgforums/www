              <p>I am very confused as to what to practice. I received vajrayana initiations, boddhisattva vow, dzogchen transmission, did a little zazen and a ten days vipassana retreat. I feel great atraction for devotional buddhism ( I practiced bhakti-yoga - hare krishna- for 16 years ). So sometimes I do a little practice of Tara, Amitabha and Guru Rinpoche. Sometimes I do guru yoga, anapana and vipassana. I read buddhist books of all schools.  Maybe I am searching for an " easy way" to practice.  At the moment, I try the best to not cause harm and to help beings if possible. I feel vey sad with how beings are suffering and I can't do nothing. I want to get enlightement so that I could help beings in samsara. I do not want to enter nirvana and let beings suffering in samsara. I am 42 years old.  I need to stop reading and practice some real thing. </p>

You need to know which one resonates with you more then follow in that direction. I personally have my own path that I practiced as well (i.e. <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html</a>) but this is not to say my path must be everyone's path.<br><br>Ultimately you should make a decision which path and practice to follow... What resonates with you most? Do you have a sangha which you can go to at your place? Which city do you stay in?</p></div>

              <p>Yes. You can do whatever methods you want but unify it with guru yoga. <br><br>"when we do Guru Yoga we can unify all knowledge and masters into Guru

              <p>Hi Waldik108, Dzogchen teachings may entail the highest realisation or wisdom on the path, but you shouldn't consider it too high for you. If you have interest in it, it signifies that you have some kind of affinity with it already. So you should make an effort and try.  Within the Dzogchen teachings, there are also graduated paths.  So it is not that either you realise your true nature totally right at once or else you can't practice Dzogchen.  You can also go by the gradual way.</p>

                                 John, all appearances can teach us, but only few lend ears to suffering
                                 and the lessons in samsara, while most people continue or choose to 
                                delude themselves with worldly foolishness. First of all, not many 
                                people know about the dharma, but among those that knows, many continue 
                                giving themselves excuses for dwelling deeper into "worldly foolishness"
                                 and not bothering to learn and practice the dharma. Of the countless 
                                excuses, some may include foolish reasonings like "maybe I'll practice 
                                the dharma when I get old, now earning money is more important" (well, 
                                how do you even know if you'll live until oldage or even to tomorrow?), 
                                or even more foolish statements like "why do I need the dharma?" or 
                                "dharma are for monks, I'm just a lay person and probably can't achieve 
                                much from spiritual practices", etc etc.</span><br id=".reactRoot[44].[1][2][1]{comment598586316835255_600110640016156}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[1]"><br id=".reactRoot[44].[1][2][1]{comment598586316835255_600110640016156}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[2]"><span id=".reactRoot[44].[1][2][1]{comment598586316835255_600110640016156}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[3]">First
                                 of all, we have to consider that we have undergone countless lifetimes 
                                (as stated in the "Life is like a passing cloud," thread) suffering 
                                birth, ageing, sickness, death, and countless untold sufferings in the 
                                wheel of samsara. Not knowing this truth itself is folly, and we can say
                                 majority of mankind is foolish or short sighted. Ignorance in fact was 
                                defined by Buddha as the ignorance of the four noble truths. i.e. Most 
                                people are not only unaware of the circumstance of samsaric cycles of 
                                rebirth, they actually consciously ignore the "bad things" in life like 
                                "sickness, ageing, death", they try to block these things off their mind
                                 with endless sensual distractions, or they reason to themselves "I'm 
                                brave, I can deal with death, no problem" (but nonetheless when the time
                                 comes they can't cope with the psychological trauma and attachments and
                                 fears), or the materialists ignorantly think "well, sickness and death 
                                will come anyway and then we'll be gone forever, we can't do anything 
                                about it, so why bother about spiritual practices, just enjoy life while
                                 it lasts" (but actually, you CAN do something to overcome mental 
                                suffering and the cycle of birth and death, i.e. practise the dharma). </span><br id=".reactRoot[44].[1][2][1]{comment598586316835255_600110640016156}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[4]"><br id=".reactRoot[44].[1][2][1]{comment598586316835255_600110640016156}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[5]"><span id=".reactRoot[44].[1][2][1]{comment598586316835255_600110640016156}.0.[1].0.[1].0.[0].[0][2].0.[6]">These

                                reality of life (and afterlife). Ignorance isn't bliss. When suffering 
                                comes, when death, ageing, sickness, loss, etc etc comes they suffer 
                                more because they are not prepared for it. They are confused, attached,
