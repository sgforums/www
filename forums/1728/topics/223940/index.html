            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Sutra Of Casket Seal Dharani From The Secret Whole Bodies' Relics Of All Buddhas' hearts</strong><br><br>Thus I have heard, at one time, The Buddha was at the Precious Bright Pond in the No-dirt Garden in the country of Moqietuo, surrounded by an assembly of uncountable high Bodhisattvas, high Sound Hearers, Heavenly Dragons, Yaochas, Jiandapos, Asuluoes, Jialouluoes, Jinaluoes, Mohouluoqies, Human beings and Non-human beings.<br><br>At that time, a high Bhraman in this assembly whose name was No-dirt and Subtle Light. He was a wise man of profound knowledge. All people were delightful to meet him. He took refuge with Triple Gems and always did ten good deeds. He was very mercy and wise. He always wished all living beings to be completely good and rich.<br><br>This Bhraman No-dirt and Subtle light stood from his seat. He walked to The Buddha and surrounded Him for seven times. He offered The Buddha with many flowers and incense. He put very expensive clothes and jewellery on The Buddha. He made obeisance to The BuddhaÂ’s feet , stood by one side and said: Â“ We invite The World Honoured One and all of you to accept my offering in my home tomorrow morning. Then The Buddha promised.<br><br>The Bhraman knew The Buddha accepted his invitation. He returned home quickly and prepared one hundred delicious food and drinks at night. He cleaned all his halls and rooms. He hanged many banners. He brought his relatives with incense, flowers and good music in the next morning. They came to The Buddha and said: Â“It is the right time, please come to my homeÂ”. The Buddha answered the Bhraman No-dirt Subtle Light kindly and announced to the mass: Â“All of you should go to the BhramanÂ’s home and receive the offering to let them receiving big benefit. Then The Buddha stood up from his seat. Various colour light from The Buddha shown to ten directions as soon as The Buddha stood. All the people saw and started to walk.<br><br>Then the Bhraman brought with him incense and flowers respectively with his relatives and Heavenly Dragons, Eight Departments, the four Bhraman Kings walking in front to open and guide the way for The Buddha.<br><br>At that time The Buddha walked to a small distance and arrived at a garden named" RICH"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was an old Stupa which was damaged with brambles and grass. It was buried with tiles and rocks. It looked like a mound of mud. The Buddha walked to this Stupa. The Stupa shone very brightly. A sound from this mound of mud praising:<br><br>Â“Good indeed, Good indeed, Shakyamuni. Your walk today is in a very good situation. And Bhranman, you will receive great benefit today.Â” Then The Buddha paid respect to the Stupa and walked surrounding clockwise to the Stupa. The Buddha took off his gown and put it on the mound of mud. He wept seriously. After weeping He smiled again. At that time all Buddhas from ten directions saw and wept. They emitted bright lights to shine this Stupa. All the people was frighten and confused. At that time The Varjrapania Bodhisattva wept seriously. He walked to The Buddha in a dignified manner with his pestle turning and said to The Buddha:Â”<br><br>Why is it so bright? Why do you weep? And The Buddhas from ten directions are appearing with such a brightness. We wish The Thus Come One to explain my question to the mass.<br><br>Then The Bhagavad told Varjrapania.Â“ All Buddhas' uncountable kotis heart dharani secrete seal Dharma is in this great whole body relics concentration BuddhasÂ’ Stupa. This Stupa became overlapping with no gap, as many as sesames. Hundreds and thousands of kotis Buddhas<br><br>Bodies are also as many as sesames. Hundreds and thousands of kotis Buddhas' whole bodies relics concentration, even the eighty four thousand Dharmas are inside this Stupa.<br><br>Ninety nine hundreds of thousands of millions kotis Buddhas' heads' form  are also inside. Because of this wonderful reason, no matter where this Stupa is, it is very spiritual efficacious. The wonderful virtue may satisfy all Earthly good wishes."<br><br>When the mass heard The Buddha said like that. They left all the dirty thoughts, and all the worries were gone. They obtained clean Dharma eyes. They obtained one of the result according to their different conditions. Their benefit were also different. Some body obtained Sakadagamin, Sotapannas, Anagamin, Arhat, Pratyeka Buddhas and Boddhisattva, Avarvartyas, Sabuoruo wisdom. Some people were certified to obtain the primary stage, the second stage until the tenth stage of Boddhisattva position. Some of them obtained satisfied six paramita. The Bhraman  left dirty thoughts and obtained five spiritual penetrations.<br><br>When Varjrapania Bodhisattva saw this strange matter, he said to The Buddha: Â“ Good indeed, so strange. We obtain such wonderful merit and virtual since we hear about it. If we hear the truth and wholeheartedly believe it, how much merit and virtual we can obtain?Â”</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha said: Â“ Listen Varjrapania. If there are faithful men or faithful ladies and the four groups of disciples of mine in the future bring forth to write this Sutra, it is equal to write all Sutras spoken by ninety nine hundred thousand kotis Buddhas. They have planted good roots in front of ninety nine hundred thousand kotis Buddhas. All the Buddhas take care of them just like protecting their eyes, also like the mercy mothers taking care of their sons. If anybody read this one Sutra, it is equal to reading all Sutras spoken by all Buddhas from the past, present and the future. Because of this reason, ninety nine hundred thousand kotis Buddhas, Proper Enlightened Ones as many as sesames come range upon range without any gap. They show up day and night to bless this people. So all Buddhas as many as uncountable sand grits in the Ganges will arrive even when the previous Buddhas range hasnÂ’t left. They come by turns like the sands revolving in the whirling water. They come to and fro without stop. If anybody offers this Sutra with incense, flowers, beautiful clothes and wonderful decorations. They become Heavenly flowers, beautiful clothes and wonderful decorations made from seven gems appearing in front of ninety nine hundred thousand kotis Buddhas from the ten directions of the Universe. These things piled up like The Sumero Mountain for offerings. The good roots they plant are also so many.Â”<br><br>At that time, the Heavenly Dragons, the Eight Departments, Humans and Non-humans heard about this. They felt very strange and talked to each other:Â” So strange is this spoiled mound. It has such spiritual change because of the BuddhasÂ’ blessing.Â” Varjrapani asked The Buddha again:<br><br>Â“The World Honored One, why is the seven gems Stupa becomes a mud mound now?Â”<br><br>The Buddha told Varjrapania: Â“ This is not a mound. It is a wonderful great Stupa. It does not appear because the massÂ’s bad kharma. The Stupa was hidden but the whole bodies of Buddhas are not destructive. How can the varjra bodies of Buddhas be destroyed!<br><br>When I enter nirvana, in the age of decadence and compelling. If anybody who do illegal deeds, They should be punished to the Hell. They do not believe the Triple Gems. They do not plant any good roots. Buddhism will be hidden because of this reason. But this strong and durable Stupa would not be destroyed because  of blessing from all BuddhasÂ’ spiritual power. The living beings without wisdom are covered by kharma. They spoil the gems and do not know to use it. Today I weep because of this reason. All Buddhas weep also.<br><br>Moreover, The Buddha told Varjrapania: Â“If anybody writes this Sutra and put it into a Stupa. It will be a Stupa of all BuddhasÂ’ Varjra Store. It is also a Stupa of all BuddhasÂ’ Dharani Heart Secrete Blessing. It is a Stupa of ninety nine hundred thousand kotis Buddhas. It is also a Stupa of all BuddhasÂ’ tops and eyes. It will be protected by all BuddhasÂ’ spiritual power. If anybody put this Sutra into a Stupa or a Buddha statue, This Statue will be made by seven gems. It will be very efficacious and will fulfill all wishes. The umbrellas, covers, nets, wheels, plates, bells, bases and steps will be made by power. The material from mud, wood, stone or brick will become seven gems because of the power of this sutra.<br><br>All Buddhas will add their powerful force and continuousely bless this Sutra by honest speech.</div>

Sakya King and all Heavenly girls come down to do offering three times day and night. This place is blessed by all Buddhas. This Stupa is like that because the Sutra is inside.<br><br>If anybody establishes a Stupa with mud, stone, wood, gold, silver, cupper and lead, and he writes this spiritual Dharani and put it inside. The Stupa become seven gems as soon as the Dharani is put. The steps, plates, umbrellas, covers, bells and wheels become all seven gems.

All Heavenly beings pay respects to, protect, pay offering to this Stupa day and night when it rises to the Heaven.<br><br>Varjrapani asked: Â“Why is this dharma so wonderfully virtuous?Â” The Buddha said:Â” Because of the spiritual power of this Casket Seal Dharani.Â”<br><br>Varjrapani said:Â” We wish The Buddha take pity on us and speak this Dharani.Â”<br><br>The Buddha said:Â” Listen and think, do not forget. The bright appearance of branch bodies of all Buddhas of the present and the future. The whole body relics of all Buddhas in the past are in this  Casket Seal Dharani. All the BuddhasÂ’ three bodies are also inside.Â” Then The Buddha spoke the Dharani:</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When The Buddha finished speaking this Dharani, All Buddhas spoke from the mound to praise:Â”Good indeed, good indeed, Shakyamuni, you come to this turbid world and speak this profound Dharma for the benefit of those living beings who have nobody to rely on. This important Dharma will stay for the benefit, serene and happiness of the world for a long time.Â”<br><br>At that time, The Buddha told Varjrapani: Â“ Listen, listen, this important Dharma has immeasurable spiritual power and uncountable benefit. It is like the precious gratified pearls on the banner. It spread gems to fulfil all wishes.<br><br>I just tell you one ten thousandth of this dharma. You should remember for the benefit for all.<br><br>If any bad person felt into the Hell. He suffered seriously and did not know when he could be<br><br>relieved. If his son or grandson calls the dead personÂ’s name and read this Dharani for seven times. The melting copper and hot iron becomes suddenly a pond with eight virtual water.<br><br>A lotus flower carries him with a precious cover upon his head. The door of Hell will be broken and the road of Bodhi opens. The lotus flower flies to the World of Ultimate Bliss. All the wisdom appears naturally. He is happy to speak and stay at a position of supplement of a Buddha.<br><br>If any person suffers many diseases and is suffering acute pain because of his cause of serious sin. If he reads this spiritual Dharani for twenty one times. All the diseases and worries will disappear. He will enjoy uncountable blessings and long life.<br><br>If any body lives in a poor family because he was miserly, his clothes can not cover his body. His food can not keep him survival. He appears to be very week and thin, people donÂ’t like to see him. This person feels ashamed. He goes to a mountain taking some wild flowers. He grinds some wood to make incense. He goes to the front of this Stupa to prostrate and make offerings. He walks around the Stupa seven times clockwise. He weeps and repents. The poor effect is deleted and wealth comes suddenly. Seven gems come like raining. Nothing is in shortage. But at this time he should offer to The Buddha and The Dharma; and donate to the poor. If he is miserly, the wealth will disappear suddenly.<br><br>If anybody establishes a Stupa with a height of four fingers for planting good roots. He uses mud or bricks according to his ability. He writes this spiritual Dharani and puts it into this Stupa. He prostrates himself before this Stupa with fragrant flowers. Frangrant cloud comes out from the small Stupa because of the power of the Dharani and his  faith. The fragrance and cloudy light spread all over the Dharma Realm.  This fragrance and brightness will do Buddhist deeds. The merit and virtual are as the same as abovementioned. That is to say no any wishes are not satisfying.<br><br>In the age of decadence, if noble men and noble women of the four families of believers, strive to build this Stupas and  settle the miraculous Dharani in it, the resulting virtue and merits will be immeasurable.</div>

Because of such merits, the person will automatically gain happiness, high position and fame without striving; obtain longevity and richness without asking; defeat enemies and thieves without fighting; diminish hatreds and curses without expelling; avoid diseases and plagues without curing: get a noble husband or a lovely wife without searching: bear smart sons and pretty daughters without praying; and all wishes will be fulfilled.<br><br>If there are birds, pigeons, dogs, wolves, mosquitoes and ants, coming to the shadow of this Stupa or stepping on the grassland, they will destroy the obstruct and understand from ignorance.

If anybody uses a little mud to repair the spoiled wall of the Stupa, or uses a small stone to<br><br>Prop up the leaning Stupa. His blessing and lifespan will be raised. He will become a  Wheel Turning King after this life.<br><br>After my nirvana, if anybody in the four families of my believers offers incense and flowers, sincerely vows to read this Dharani in front of the Stupa aiming to relieve the suffering of those in evil patterns, every sentence will eliminate great light to shine the three evil patterns. All<br><br>Suffering will be gone. The living beings will be relieved from pain and the seed of Buddha will sprout.

Or anybody touches his clothes or steping on the footprint of this person. Or anybody meets him and has a talk with this person. The serious sin of this person will be demolished and he will fulfill a success.<br><br>At that time, The Buddha told<br><br>Varjrapania: " Now I enjoin this secret mysterious Dhrani Sutra to you. You should pay respect and protect it. Let this Dhrani Sutra be spread all over the world. Don't let<br><br>the living beings stop learning  it.<br><br>Varjrapania  said: " Now I am so lucky to be enjoined by The Hounable One. We wish to protect and spread this Sutra day and night to the world for paying a debt of gratitude to The Buddha.<br><br>If anybody writes ,up holds and remind continuously this Sutra. We will urge the Shakra Emperor and the four Kings of the Heaven, all Dragons and the Eight Departments on the Heaven to protect this person day and night and do not leave him.<br><br>The Buddha said: " Good indeed, Varjrapania.
