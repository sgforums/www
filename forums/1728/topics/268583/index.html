            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by oldkid:<br><br>1) The actions of raising his hands are natural phenomena?<br></blockquote>It is a phenomena. There is actually no need for distinctions between natural and man-made. What we call man-made, is to facilitate communication. We can also called it compounded too. It is by convention of language, and a common subscribed mindset that we depend on the ego to function in this world. The crux lies in us being forever trapped in this state of ego-identification, being mind dependent on mental labels that we fail to experience this world in all its real nature. Just like everyone in this world subscribe to time. While we know it is just a Concept, to get trapped by it is suffering. But if everyone don't follow, this world will be in chaos.<br><br><blockquote><br>2) The hands are tired are the natural phenomena of raising his hands up. This I understand.

If it is natural phenomena that raises the hands, I am stuck here again. What caused these natural phenomena? </blockquote>Everything in this universe is conditioned, subjected to birth and decay. The tiredness of hands is a display of "Progression to expiry" of that phenomena. Herein, energy inside your body is being used to withstand the weight of your hand. Energy, in the form of say carbohydrates are expended to fuel the muscles and generates heat. The slow, but steady and surely depletion of energy gives you the sense of tiredness. Note that in accordance with science and Buddhist doctrine, there is no fundamental creation nor destruction. But a change of state of matter. Energy is not created nor destroyed but changes from one state to another. Universal flux or impermanence as we call it. That is the meaning of Buddha nature neither increase nor decrease in the Heart Sutra<br><br><blockquote><br>If everything are nautral phenomena, then we are part of natural phenomena or we are natural phenomena itself. By doing something, we get something. Hope someone can disspell my darkness. Thanks!  </blockquote>Being aware of phenomena  is not an end because we are aware and yet a part of it. Therefore the real practitioner is a Dharma Master - or a Master of Phenomena. An analyst, a doer and a wheel turner</div>

My questions are:<br><br>1) The actions of raising his hands are natural phenomena?</blockquote>It depends on what you mean by natural. Some people think that 'natural' means actions arising without intentions, while unnatural are actions that arises out of our intention. That is seeing things dualistically. Actually both intentional and non-intentional actions are <span style="font-style: italic;">natural</span> in the higher sense -- they are conditioned arising, and that is perfectly natural as it is, but it must not be misunderstood.<br><br>My taiwanese teacher also talk about walking as being natural, what he meant is not that somehow your walking is somehow controlled by some natural forces.<br><br>What he meant is that there is completely no need for a sense of doer or dualistic volition involved in walking, it is so natural that you never gave it a second thought, and that is possible to be natural because in the first place the sense of a doer or there being a 'controller' of an action is an illusion.<br><br>A sense of a doer, controller or the necessity for you to "think" (here I mean dualistic thinking, thinking in terms of a Subject and Object) your walking (i.e "I want to walk, I want to walk, I want to walk" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) in order to walk is absolutely unnecessary, because whatever arises, arises spontaneously and naturally as part of conditioned arising at that very moment. It is not caused by a self, there is no self and no doer.<br><br>Means whether intention, or thinking, or action, all these arise SPONTANEOUSLY and NATURALLY with no agent, thinker, or doer.. it just self-arise out of conditions.<br><br>The reason why you think there is a doer/self/thinker is because you review the previous thoughts and find a coherence and chain them up together, causing the impression of a 'doer' or 'thinker'. This is called dualistic thinking. In reality reality is spontaneous and disconnected.<br><br>That is why in Buddhist practise we must not dwell in meaning, content and dualistic thinking, we must let go and plunge into moment to moment experience with naked awareness to experience/BE the arising and ceasing as it is moment to moment. If you can do that, then that very moment is unborn, because you no longer see time or the birth and death of a 'self' or entities.<br><br>So back to topic, whatever arises, whether there is intention or no intention, arises spontaneously and is not caused by any Doer. This is a profound truth and easily misunderstood.<br><br>Please read our forummer Longchen (he has profound insights on the reality of No Doer and No Self, you may want to check out other similar articles in that website): <a href="http://www.dreamdatum.com/doer-beingdone.html" rel="nofollow">Doer and the being done</a><br><br>If theres anything you don't understand from my explanation please ask... and I do appreciate if other insightful forummers can share their opinions and understandings.<br><br>If you don't understand so far, continue to read on, you might understand later.<br><br><blockquote>2) The hands are tired are the natural phenomena of raising his hands up. This I understand. You do something, you will get something. But what truely puzzle me is the above. If it is no I who raise the hands, then what raise the hands? Natural phenomena?

What caused these natural phenomena?</blockquote>Everything occur spontaneously out of conditions, it occurs so fast but our mind mistakenly interpretes them to be linked and connected by a sense of doership or a sense of self. It's like this:<br><br>Moment1, intention of raising hands arises.<br>Moment2, the intention conditions the raising up of the hands.<br><br>Meanwhile, there is never at any point a separate self behind the intention or the action of raising hand itself, intention arise without thinker, raising hand occurs without doer. They just arise spontaneously out of conditions (conditioned arising) yet in a disconnected, spontaneous fashion. There is continuity <strong>but in a spontaneous fashion</strong>, ultimately an action is not caused by a a self (it can't be found), it is also not even caused by a thought, the thought arise and ceases instantaneously as it arise, the action too arise and ceases out of conditions, spontaneously.<br><br>When I said "the thought does not cause the action" it is again easily misunderstood. I don't mean that all actions arises without any intentions. What I mean't is, thought is not a discrete entity (i.e a separate self/doer) causing the action, <strong>but rather action arises conditioned by thought, they are not separate. This means that at that very moment, the intention is a conditioning factor for action to arise, they arise simulataneously and spontaneously in an interdependent and conditioned fashion.</strong> Does this make sense?<br><br>And therefore, every moment of arising arises out of conditioned arising, but there is no doer, no observer and no agent/self.<br><br>But you mistaken it to be a self -- you think you raised your hand because there is a doer or controller giving commands to raise up your hands. This is because you observe your previous thoughts and thought it was your separate self that is 'willing' your action. Actually, the thought is just a thought, it is not the self or doer, or rather a self or doer cannot be found anywhere in your thoughts. A thought is not the 'doer' or a 'self'! It is merely a thought at that very moment, get it?<br><br>p.s. what I mean by disconnected and spontaneous fashion means moment to moment arises in this way:<br><br><img src="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559-2.jpg"><br><br>and <strong>NOT</strong> this way:<br><br><img src="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-JOCP/jc26559-1.jpg"><br><br>Please read 'Non-dual thinking' to have a much much better understanding on this, the author is highly enlightened and explains much better than I could ever explain: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=247058" rel="nofollow">Nondual Thinking and the Mahayana Deconstruction of Time</a><br><br><blockquote>If everything are nautral phenomena, then we are part of natural phenomena or we are natural phenomena itself.

[/b]</blockquote>There is no separate self/doer/observer apart from moment to moment arising, this is a Dharma Seal!<br><br>By doing something we get something that's true, but I'm not sure what you're trying to say..?<br><br>Anyway these things are quite difficult for me to explain and in the first place I don't have any direct insights into this reality, unlike some forummers here.. but does my post makes senses to you?

There is a difference between leaking-blessings and non-leaking-blessings. Leaking blessings may be good deeds but tainted by not keeping the 5 precepts, or that it may be good deeds done with certain agenda/wish behind it, some desire for some good outcome from that doing. There is still attachment to the 4 forms will performing the virtuous deeds. That blessing resulted will be small and will 'leak away'.<br><br>If you are liberated constantly, one who like in Diamond Sutra said, does not hold onto the form of a self/doer, of an other, of a sentient being, and of age/time. At that time whatever good deeds you do are not done due to any agenda, or due to craving, and there is no dualistic illusions or the four forms. Then the merits will be immeasurable.<br><br>So when you are doing good deeds or doing anything, practise the dharma, and do not give rise to the four forms, do not give rise to dualistic thinking or craving. When doing good deeds, just do it without any extra thinking, and practise the Dharma.<br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/understa.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/understa.htm</a><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Real merits</strong><br><br>Merits are consequences of the non-orignation and non-cessation of the mind. During the Tang Dynasty in ancient China, Emperor Liang Wu-Ti asked the patriarch Bodhidharma, "Venerable One, I have built many monasteries for the well being of the Sangha and I have also performed many virtuous deeds. What merits have I accumulated? Bodhidharma answered, "You have no merits." Why is that so? It is because when Emperor Liang Wu-Ti performed those acts of giving, he was attached to them. Thus, even though he had performed many virtuous deeds, because he had not cultivated the purity of his mind, he did not attain "non-origination and non-cessation". Therefore, his actions can only be considered as cultivation of blessings, not merits. Without liberation there are no merits. On the other hand, when there is liberation, all virtuous deeds will reap merits.</span></div>

Your motivation for sentient beings will probably 'increase' your merits by many many times. Relative Bodhicitta is also very important and sets one on the paths towards Buddhahood.<br><br>But the highest Bodhicitta, or the absolute Bodhicitta, is still the realization of emptiness. If you never realise emptiness or attain liberation, then your merits will still not be as great. When you reach that level, your merits will really be immense beyond bounds.<br><br>The 6th Zen Master Hui Neng said:<br><br><a href="http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/platform-sutra.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/realm/bodhisattva/platform-sutra.html</a><br><br><blockquote>One day Prefect Wei entertained the Patriarch and asked him to preach to a big gathering. At the end of the feast, Prefect Wei asked him to mount the pulpit (to which the Patriarch consented). After bowing twice reverently, in company with other officials, scholars, and commoners, Prefect Wei said, "I have heard what Your Holiness preached. It is really so deep that it is beyond our mind and speech, and I have certain doubts which I hope you will clear up for me." "If you have any doubts," replied the Patriarch, "please ask, and I will explain." "What you preach are the fundamental principles taught by Bodhidharma, are they not?" "Yes," replied the Patriarch. "I was told," said Prefect Wei, "that at Bodhidharma's first interview with Emperor Wu of Liang he was asked what merits the Emperor would get for the work of his life in building temples, allowing new monks to be ordained (royal consent was necessary at that time), giving alms and entertaining the Order; and his reply was that these would bring no meritsar all. Now, I cannot understand why he gave such an answer. Will you please explain." "These would bring no merits," replied the Patriarch. "Don't doubt the words of the Sage. Emperor Wu's mind was under an erroneous impression, and he did not know the orthodox teaching. Such deeds as building temples, allowing new monks to be ordained, giving alms and entertaining the Order will bring you only felicities, which should not be taken for merits. Merits are to be found within the Dharmakaya, and they have nothing to do with practices for attaining felicities." The Patriarch went on, "Realization of the Essence of Mind is Kung (good deserts), and equality is Teh (good quality). When our mental activity works without any impediment, so that we are in a position to know constantly the true state and the mysterious functioning of our own mind, we are said to have acquired Kung Teh (merits).<br><br>Within, to keep the mind in a humble mood is Kung; and without, to behave oneself according to propriety is Teh. That all things are the manifestation of the Essence of Mind is Kung, and that the quintessence of mind is free from idle thoughts is Teh. Not to go astray from the Essence of Mind is Kung, and not to pollute the mind in using it is Teh. If you seek for merits within the Dharmakaya, and do what I have just said, what you acquire will be real merits.<br><br>He who works for merits does not slight others; and on all occasions he treats everybody with respect. He who is in the habit of looking down upon others has not got rid of the erroneous idea of a self, which indicates his lack of Kung. Because of his egotism and his habitual contempt for all others, he knows not the real Essence of Mind; and this shows his lack of Teh. Learned Audience, when our mental activity works without interruption, then it is Kung; and when our mind functions in a straightforward manner, then it is Teh. To train our own mind is Kung, and to train our own body is Teh.<br><br>Learned Audience, merits should be sought within the Essence of Mind and they cannot be acquired by almsgiving, entertaining the monks, etc. We should therefore distinguish between felicities and merits. There is nothing wrong in what our Patriarch said. It is Emperor Wu himself who did not know the true way.".....etc</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(continued from above)<br><br>Â“There is only a subjective happening, never an action done by any entity.Â”<br><br>This is a very profound statement that unfortunately isn't very apparent to most people.<br><br>Longchen said: <strong>At non-duality (non-duality of subject &amp; object) realisation, body is not seen as entity but as perceptions and sensations that are 'not separated from environment'. In fact perception and sensation is the 'environment'.</strong><br><br>This is very important. Even our thoughts, and all our perceptions and sensations are the UNIVERSE arising in naturalness. There is no inner and outer, there is only One Universal Mind ultimately. "Inner" and "outer" are deduction and interpretation of the dualistic mind.<br><br>What does this mean? This is not some poetic expression, but a very important experiential insight. What this implies is that it is the Universe eating an apple, it is the Universe scrubbing the stains in the toilet. Everything self-arises naturally as conditioned arising including your thoughts.<br><br>Everything that is done just arise spontaneously, there is no doer, there is only the Whole Universe in action, it is one interdependent Wholeness, like the <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=214669" rel="nofollow">Net of Indra</a>.<br><br>Thusness said: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/different-degrees-of-non-duality.html" rel="nofollow">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/05/different-degrees-of-non-duality.html</a><br><br>When insight of non-duality peaks, the experience is described as such:<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">4. Only one tremendous spontaneous clarity flows, there is no differentiation between what that spins the earth or what that pumps your heart beats or what that makes the plants grow. When you eat an apple, it is the entire universe that eats the apple. Just one whole clarity spontaneity flow.

The Dharma standpoint (or so I had heard) is that everything is of natural phenomena be it cause or effect. So lemme give an example: When a person raises his hands up, he will say "I raise my hands up." The mechanics in raising his hands up will be the movement of his muscles with the instructions from his brain. And the results from this will be his hands are raised and he gets tired after awhile. My questions are:<br><br>1) The actions of raising his hands are natural phenomena?<br><br>2) The hands are tired are the natural phenomena of raising his hands up. This I understand. You do something, you will get something. But what truely puzzle me is the above. If it is no I who raise the hands, then what raise the hands? Natural phenomena? If it is natural phenomena that raises the hands, I am stuck here again. What caused these natural phenomena?<br><br>If everything are nautral phenomena, then we are part of natural phenomena or we are natural phenomena itself. By doing something, we get something.

'Self' is just a deeply rooted way that our mind perceives due to the karmic momentum, it's like a sort of unconscious habit to see in terms of 'self'. It is just how the mind works and tries to understand things. But it is not truth.</div>
