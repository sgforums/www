There are three topics we should be careful and mindful of in our discussion on this forum. They are on the subject of race, language and religion. If it gets too offensive, we should get rid of it before it brings problems and ill feeling among us Singaporeans. It is not worth getting into such situation. </span></p>

              <p>Sofar, I've practised releasing life 3 times sofar. The first time was with a Buddhist Venerable in China. Basically, we went to the wet market and buy many fishes that are to be killed and slaughtered. Then we drive to a nearby lake. On our way, we chant Namo Jiuku Jiunan Guanshiyin Pusa (Namo Save the lives Avalotekiteshvara). At the lake, we chant the Releasing Life Ritual (æ”¾ç”Ÿä»ªè½¨), of which includes the Compassion Mantra, heart sutra, taking refuge in triple gems, and then release them into the lake. It's only with my family and the venerable and we save their lives. I feel so happy after saving them.</p>
              <p>After coming back to Singapore, I've practised twice (went to Shensong) and then release life in my nearby canal.</p>
              <p>But this time, I've decide that it's best to go with a venerable and with groups of people.</p>

              <p>Edit: I just happen to know that those creatures meant to be released on such events, were caught... for that event. Am I right? It would actually mean something if they release something not caught to be released.</p>

              <p>In the first place, Buddhist do not hunt, fish or engage in any form of profession that involves killing/butchery/fishing etc. One who practises Buddhism as laid out in the Buddha's noble eighfold path mentions the right livelihood, that means jobs that do not constitute to the unwholesome harms to sentient beings.</p>
              <p>In the Rituals for releasing life, it specifically mention "no ordering of animals in prior that will lead to hunting". That means to say, you don't order some animals in advance, as ordering some animals in advance will lead to people catching them and trying hunt them, which is equal to imprisoning them.</p>
              <p>As for poultry or fishing farms, releasing life typically involves buying many fish and poultry that are waiting to be slaughtered to be sent to markets, and then releasing their life and preventing them from being killed. What matters are saving their lives.</p>

              <p>With all due respect... you underestimated the power of consumerism and the cruelty of nature on farmed creatures. To live is to die someday... What matters is if there is a value to their death.</p>

              <p>You don't have to worry about all these things. Venerables and devotees in the temple know what to do. It defeats the purpose of "fang sheng" if the seller purposely catch them for us to "fang sheng". I've been several times with the temple. The temple will not inform the seller in advance.Those fishes were meant to be killed and sold in the market. The temple is also aware what kind of fishes to release into the sea.</p>
              <p>I will not object if farmed fishes are released. You said farmed fishes should not be released, do you mean they should be killed and ended up on our tables? I would rather release them and let nature takes its course if their ending is to be killed by humans. Before releasing the animals, the Venerables will let them take the 3 refuge which I find them lucky because some humans don't even have the chance to take the 3 refuge.</p>

              <p>Somehow, the Logistic / Procurement have to forecast their stock level. Live seafood will be badly depleted if Bhuddist where to purchase without any forecast. There will be angry customer from the meat clan.</p>
