              <p>Yes, I think we had also discussed in the past... Indiscriminate liberation of animals into the wild, without regard for those animals' natural habitat and ability to survive in the wild, is actually more detrimental than beneficial. </p>
              <p>Thanks for reminding us.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks Yhjow for posting this activity. I have called up Buddhist life Mission to enquire. This Sunday 28th they'll be going to Sembawang Yatch Club to release fishes. I will try to wakeup early to go. (1)Do Not be perturb by whether the fishes will be catch back or whatever as long as Your Own Kind Intention is to release them during the ritual. You are not the one who catch them, karma wont fall on you. (2)If you ask how I know animals are eligible to take 3 refuge. Ok, since animals cant talk, we perform the 3 refuge ceremony for them. Even your own pet dogs you can perform 3 refuge for them too. For example, let the animal face you. Chant and invite buddha to witness the ceremony, chant the 3 refuge to the animal, then chant a mantra to the animal, bless a cup of water sprinkle on the animal to purify its negative karma. End off by giving the animal a buddhist name.</div>

              <p>Are those fishes to be released farmed or caught in the wild ?</p>
              <p>Sembawang ship yard is nearby. What is the BOD (Bio Oxygen Demand) or COD (Chemical Oxygen demand)  in the water ?</p>
              <p>Kusu island may be a better place to release fishes caught in the wild.</p>

              Hi Punggol and likeyou
              
              Sorry I didn't make it on Sunday 28th. Saturday 27th stay up till late watching election.
              
              But from the call enquiries I made, 
              
              1) nearest Mrt is Aljunied, then from there walk down to their address. 
              
              2) no need to buy anything on your side. The temple already prepared the fishes.
              As to how many boxes of fishes they prepared will probably be according to the number
              of participants who call up to register. But don't ask me each one release how many fish, that I wouldn't know. 
              
              3) each one will have a chance to release the fishes, but I didn't ask them whether the water is sea or normal water, except that they told me they are releasing at a place called
              Sembawang Yatch Club.
              
              4)There is no fix cost for participating in this activity. But participants can just donate
              any amount to the temple. If you are just giving an hongbao of $2 is acceptable to them too. Its up to your free will. The fishes they bought is of course more than the $2 already but they are not asking you to pay for the fishes. (I believe they bought the fishes, the temple people wouldn't be so free to go catch loads of fishes back for you to release. But as to where they bought the fishes I wouldn't know)
              
              5) Any other info you may call up Buddhist Life Mission at 68369088 to enquire and also to book for Sept month last Sunday fangsheng activitiy.

              <p>okay, perhaps the "taking refuge" is mean like they had an encounter with the triple gems, then they will gain great merits for their next rebirth. we do see some Jataka stories regarding:-</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">ANIMALS GO TO HEAVEN<br><br>The Buddha teaching is unique amongst the world religions: it is not only for humans and gods; it is also for animals. There are numerous stories that relate how animals who associate with good humans or are well treated, go to heaven after they die.<br><br>The first example is that of the Bodhisattva’s HORSE Kanthaka. The Introduction to the Jataka Commentary (which is one of the earliest records we have of the Buddha’s early life) tells us how when the Bodhisattva Siddhattha renounces the world, his horse Kanthaka is so deeply saddened that he dies broken-hearted, but obviously with a wholesome last thought-moment. He is reborn as the deva Kanthaka in the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods (Sakra’s heaven).<br><br>The next famous animal story is found in the story of the Buddha’s solitary retreat in the Parileyya. The Vinaya (V 1:337-357) records how in the 10th year of the ministry, when a dispute arises amongst the monks of Kosambi who even tell the Buddha off when he tries to counsel them. After trying hard to reconcile them and failing, he quietly leaves for a solitary retreat in the Parileyya forest where he is attended by a like-minded ELEPHANT (he leaves his own tribe for the joy of solitude). Watching how the Buddha prepares warm water every morning the elephant Parileyyaka himself prepares it for the Buddha. He also offers the Buddha wild fruits and takes care of his robe and bowl.<br><br>A MONKEY, watching the elephant, offers the Buddha a honeycomb. Later, however, in his excitement, the monkey falls on a sharp stump, immediately dies and is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods. So too the elephant, who becomes the deva Parileyyaka. This full story is given in the Dhammapada Commentary (see “Buddhist Legends,” book 1 story 5).<br><br>Then there is the well known story of the FROG deva in the Vimana Vatthu (Vv 852-88). It is said that once a frog sits listening to the Buddha teaching. Although not knowing human language, it is captivated by the Buddha’s soothing voice. As he listens entranced, a farmer, leaning on his pole, immediately pierces him to death. The frog is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three as Manduka Deva (the frog deity). He appears before the Buddha in all his glory to sing his praises. (The full story is given in the Vimana Vatthu Commentary: see “The Minor Anthologies” vol 4 pages 102 f.)<br><br>One of the longest stories in world literature, that is, the Udena cycle, found in the Dhammapada Commentary (book 2 story 1). It is actually a cycle of nested stories spanning many lives leading to the Buddha’s time. In one of the stories, during a plague, a poor luckless wandering man named Kotuhalaka reaches a herdsman house and is given some food. The herdsman feeds his DOG with the same food. Kotuhalaka looks with envy at the dog. That night, Kotuhalaka dies from over-eating, and his thinking about the dog leads him to be reborn as the bitch’s puppy.<br><br>Now, a pratyeka Buddha (a solitary fully self-awakened Buddha who does not establish his teaching) regularly comes to the house for alms, and the dog (Kotuhalaka) takes a liking to him. When the pratyeka-buddha finally leaves, the dog is saddened and dies. The commentators remarks that dogs, unlike humans, are straightforward and lack deceit. So upon dying, he is reborn in the heaven of the Thirty-three as a deva.<br><br>One of the most famous animal stories is that of the Abhidhamma bats. The Dhammapada story (book 14 story 2) tells us in an interesting aside, that 500 youths, witnessing the Buddha perform the twin wonder (a miracle of fire and water radiating from his body), decide to go forth under Sâriputta. It is said that in Kassapa Buddha’s time, they were BATS living in a cave where two monks were reciting the Abhidhamma. So enthralled were they by their sound, although not knowing its meaning, they pass away into the heavens, and are reborn in Sâvatthî. (See “Buddhist Legends” 3:51 f)</span></p>
