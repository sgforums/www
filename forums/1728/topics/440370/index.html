              <h5>translated by Anzan Hoshin roshi<br> and Joshu Dainen zenji</h5>
              <p><strong>Chapter 29: Bodhidharma</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Koan</strong></p>
              <p>The Venerable Prajnatara asks Bodhidharma, "What is it that is formless amongst things?"</p>
              <p>Bodhidharma says, "Formlessness is unborn."</p>
              <p>Prajnatara asks, "What is the highest amongst things?"</p>
              <p>Bodhidharma says, "The Actual Nature is the highest."</p>
              <p><strong>Comments</strong></p>
              <p>Bodhidharma was born into the Kshtraya caste. His original name was 
              Bodhitara and he was the third son of the king of Koshi in southern 
              India. This king was a great devotee of the Buddhadharma and once he 
              made an offering of a precious jewel to Prajnatara.</p>
              <p>The king had three sons, named Chandravimalatara, Punyatara and 
              Bodhitara. Wishing to test the wisdom of these three princes, Prajnatara
               held up the jewel that their father had offered and said, "Is there 
              anything which can compare to this jewel?"</p>
              <p>The first two princes said, "This jewel is the finest of all precious
               gems and can be surpassed by none. Only one of your spiritual greatness
               would be worthy to receive it."</p>
              <p>The third prince was Bodhitara, and he said, "This is just a mundane 
              gem and cannot be counted within the highest rank because the highest of
               all jewels is the jewel of reality. This has only a mundane glittering 
              and cannot be considered to be the highest because the lustre of wisdom 
              is supreme. This has a mundane clarity and cannot be considered to be 
              the finest because the clarity of Awareness is supreme.</p>
              <p>"This jewel cannot even sparkle as it does without the luminosity 
              that knows its gleaming. If you know, you know that this is a jewel and 
              knowing it as a jewel, you know that it is precious. If you know that it
               is precious, then you should know that it’s value is not true value 
              itself. If you know that this is a jewel, you should also know that the 
              jewel is not a jewel itself.</p>
              <p>"This jewel is not a jewel because it is only the jewel of knowing 
              that can discern it as even a mundane jewel. Its value is not true value
               itself because it is only the jewel of knowing that has true value.</p>
              <p>"The Way that you teach is a treasury of knowing and thus you have 
              been offered this mundane treasure. Just as this treasure has appeared 
              due to your wisdom, so may the treasure of Awareness appear in those who
               awaken to it."</p>
              <p>When the Venerable Master Prajnatara heard this eloquent 
              understanding from the third prince, he knew that this was the 
              incarnation of a sage and saw that the prince would be the heir to his 
              Dharma. However, the moment was not yet ripe, and so he kept silent and 
              left Bodhitara still mixed with the others.</p>
              <p>Later, however, Prajnatara asks the prince, "What is it that is formless amongst things?"</p>
              <p>The prince answers, "Formlessness is unborn."</p>
              <p>The Venerable Master asks, "What is it that all things are hung on?"</p>
              <p>The prince answers, "All things hang on the sense of self and other."</p>
              <p>Finally, Prajnatara asks, "What is the highest amongst things?"</p>
              <p>The prince says, "The Actual Nature is the highest."</p>
              <p>Although this discussion showed the resonance between the minds of 
              teacher and student, Prajnatara still waited until the moment had 
              ripened.</p>
              <p>Some time after this, the king died. While everyone was mourning, 
              Bodhitara sat before the coffin in samadhi for seven days. When he left 
              this he went to Prajnatara and requested ordination as a monk. Seeing 
              that the moment had arrived, Prajnatara conferred the precepts and 
              ordained the prince.</p>
              <p>Following this, Bodhitara sat and practiced for seven days before the
               presence of Prajnatara and received complete instructions from 
              Prajnatara on the subtleties of practice. On hearing these teachings, 
              Bodhitara realized supreme insight.</p>
              <p>Prajnatara said to him, "You have complete wisdom into all principles
               of the Dharma. "Dharma" means complete knowing. Thus I shall name you 
              Bodhidharma."</p>
              <p>Having received the transmission, Bodhidharma knelt and asked, "I 
              have realized the Dharma. Now where shall I go to do the work of the 
              Buddhas?"</p>
              <p>Prajnatara said, "You have realized the Dharma. Stay here in southern
               India for a time. Sixty-seven years following my death you should 
              travel to China and establish there strong medicine to teach those of 
              excellent potential."</p>
              <p>Bodhidharma asked, "Will I be able to find those who can become 
              vessels this teaching? Will there be troubles there over the next 
              thousand years?"</p>
              <p>Prajnatara answered, "There will be numberless people who will wake 
              up in that land where you shall teach. There will be some trouble so you
               should lay low. When you arrive in China, don’t tarry in the south 
              because the people there are only interested in ‘good works’ and do not 
              know the essence of the Buddhadharma." Prajnatara then gave a teaching 
              verse to Bodhidharma:<br> <cite><br> On the way you will cross a stream<br> and meet a sheep.<br> Alone and restless<br> you will cross the dark water.<br> Under the sun, kindness<br> to two animals: elephant and horse.<br> Two cassia saplings will flourish forever.<br> </cite></p>
              <p>He also said, "You will encounter one in the forests who will realize enlightenment."</p>
              <p>He spoke this verse as well:<br> <cite><br> China is broad but there is no other road<br> for you to find those who will follow your path.<br> A golden rooster can pick up a single grain<br> to sustain all of the sages of the world.<br> </cite></p>
              <p>Having thus received the transmission and instructions, Bodhidharma 
              attended Prajnatara for forty years. Following Prajnatara’s death, 
              Bodhidharma began to teach as did his fellow heir Buddhasena. Another 
              heir named Bodhisanta had broken the transmission into six different 
              sects but Bodhidharma was able to unify these through his teaching and 
              was revered throughout the land.</p>
              <p>After sixty years had thus passed, Bodhidharma knew that the time was
               come to journey to China. He went to the ruler of the people and said, 
              "Dedicate yourself to the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha and thus be 
              of benefit to the people. It is now time for me to go to China. When 
              this work is done, I shall return."</p>
              <p>The king wept and said, "What crime has this country commited and why
               is that one so auspicious? Still, when your work in China is completed,
               do not forget the land of your birth and come back to us." The king 
              accompanied him to the part and watched his departure.</p>
              <p>Bodhidharma travelled for three years by sea and finally arrived in 
              southern China in the year 527. From there he was called to his meeting 
              with Emperor Wu of the Liang dynasty of southern China. This is what 
              Prajnatara was speaking of when he said, "don’t tarry in the south." 
              From there Bodhidharma travelled to the northern kingdom of Wei. It is 
              said that he travelled on a reed; some people have taken this literally 
              and so Bodhidharma is sometimes painted standing on a river but this is 
              wrong. The reed was a reed-shaped boat, not an actual reed. "Meeting a 
              sheep" was a reference to Emperor Wu of Liang. "Crossing the dark water"
               meant the Yangzi river which was the border between the kingdom of Wei 
              in the north and Liang in the south.</p>
              <p>Bodhidharma then arrived at the Shaolin-si near Songshan and stayed 
              there in the eastern hall. He sat there throughout the day and night. No
               one could understand anything about him and they just referred to him 
              as the "wall-gazing Brahmin." Bodhidharma just sat in this way without 
              complicated explanations or trying to hurry up his presentation.</p>
              <p>After nine years he passed on his "skin, meat, bones, and marrow" to 
              his four disciples Daofu, Daoyu, Congzhi, and Huike when he saw that 
              their potentials were ripe.</p>
              <p>At this time there were two teachers of deviant paths called 
              Bodhiruci and Guangtong who were angered because of the way that 
              Bodhidharma’s virtue was known throughout the land and that he was 
              honoured and trusted by so many. Once they stoned him and smashed out 
              his front teeth and they even tried to poison him five times.</p>
              <p>The sixth time, Bodhidharma poured the poison out onto a large rock 
              and the rock split. Finding that his work was now complete, he thought 
              to himself, "Having received the transmission and predictions from my 
              Master, I saw in the sky signs that there will be people with capacity 
              for this great teaching but since my meeting with Emperor Wu of Liang I 
              was unable to find anyone suitable. I sat in coolness, doing nothing for
               nine years until I found the unexcelled Huike and to him I have 
              transmitted my realization of the Way. I have done this and now the time
               is over. I will leave." Having said this, he then died in zazen. He is 
              buried on Mount Xionger. There is a later story that a man named Songyun
               met him in the Himalayan mountains, but the truth is that he was buried
               at Mount Xionger.</p>
              <p><strong>Teisho</strong></p>
              <p>Through the transmission and final teachings of the Venerable Master 
              Prajnatara, Bodhidharma became the founder of Zen in China. In his first
               meeting with Prajnatara when he was explaining about the jewel, 
              Prajnatara asks him, "What is it that is formless amongst things?" 
              Bodhidharma says, "Formlessness is unborn."</p>
              <p>Even if you speak about silent emptiness, this isn’t really formless.
               Thus he said, "Formlessness is unborn." If your understanding is like 
              scaling a mile high sheer cliff, then you can clearly understand it as 
              everything and realize that everything is nothing else. But this is 
              still not the unborn and so it is not formlessness. Before any division 
              betwen heaven and earth how can there be any split between holy and 
              profane? In this realm, not a single thing appears and there is not even
               a speck that can stain it. It is not that there is originally some kind
               of blankness but rather that you are emptied and open, cleary aware, 
              wide awake and without confusion. There is nothing to compare anything 
              to and there is nothing other than just this. Thus it is called "the 
              highest among things." Thus the highest is called "beyond concept" and 
              this "beyond concept" is called the Actual Nature.</p>
              <p>Even a priceless gem cannot be compared to it and even the clear 
              luminosity of the mind cannot objectify itself. Thus Bodhidharma said 
              that the jewel had only a worldly glitter that could not be considered 
              the finest because the clarity of Awareness is supreme. This 
              understanding was natural to him and so when he sat for seven days and 
              received the complete and subtle teachings he realized the supreme 
              wisdom of the Way.</p>
              <p>You should know that is through such detailed examinination and true 
              entry that you know for yourself what the Buddhas and Zen Masters have 
              realized. Through clarifying what the Awakened Ones of the past have 
              realized, one becomes a true descendant of the Buddhas. We can see this 
              fact through the example of this worthy one; although he had already 
              deep natural wisdom, he went on and realized the supreme wisdom of the 
              Way. As well he Mastered the mind of being able to preserve and maintain
               it for the future. He practiced deeply through forty years of attending
               to Prajnatara and then for another sixty carried Prajnatara’s gift for 
              the future. After three years crossing the sea he arrived in a foriegn 
              land and sat in coolness for nine years until he found persons with the 
              capacity for this great teaching. Finally he was able to repay his debt 
              to his teacher by establishing the True Dharma of the Buddhas. His 
              hardships were the hardest and his austerities the most austere.</p>
              <p>Zen students these days though want to take it easy even though the 
              times are so degenerate and people’s capacities are so small. I am 
              afraid that I must tell you people who would like to claim to have 
              attained what you have not that you are just too full of yourselves and 
              that you should just withdraw from the practice of Zen.</p>
              <p>If you have any penetration at all into this koan then you will see 
              just how profound it all is and that it gets more and more so. Break up 
              this "mind" and let go of this "body." Just deeply question into the Way
               and through the subtle transmission of the Awakened Ones you will 
              directly meet for yourself what the Buddhas have realized. Don’t think 
              that your little understandings and insights are all that there is.</p>
              <p>Once more, I’ve got a little poem:</p>
              <p>Nothing is located anywhere:<br> no boundary<br> and no outside.<br> Is there even<br> the slightest thing?</p>
