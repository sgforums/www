              <p>Rigdzin Namkha Gyatso Rinpoche was born in december 1967 in Dza-Chu-Kha in the province of Kham, Tibet. His father Thupten Sherab, and his mother Dawa Sherab called him Drupa Tharchin. Both his father and grandfather were ngagkpas, and before he died, his father told him to be particularly careful, since he represents the 18th generation of this yogic lineage. Therefore, since his early childhood, he has been involved in activities related to the Holy Dharma.</p>
              <p> The most important lamas for Namkha Rinpoche were Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche’s daughter, Semo Dechen Yudron, and her husband Chonyi Rinpoche. Rinpoche also received teachings from Kyabje Dodrubchen Rinpoche, Kyabje Dzogchen Rinpoche, Kyabje Tseley Khandro Rinpoche and Kathog Moktsar Tulku Rinpoche.</p>
              <p>His masters were his own father Thupten Sherab, as well as Dza-Gyal Khenpo Bumthar, Arig Dza Khenpo Pema Tsewang, Khenpo Jigme Phüntsok, Tulku Pema Kalsang, Khenpo Munsel, Khenpo Chokyab, Khenpo Pema Wangyal, Khenpo Wanglo, Khenpo Kalsang Khedrub, Khenpo Pema Lodro, Khenpo Wangdu, Gotsa Phurba Tulku Rinpoche, Kulong Lama Lungtok Rinpoche, Muge Samten Rinpoche, Troru Tsenam Rinpoche, and Tseten Shadrung.</p>
              <p>The main practice of Namkha Rinpoche is that of the new treasure of Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche (Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, 1904-1987), the Dudjom Tersar. He received it from the daughter of Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, Semo Dechen Yudron, under whose direction he accomplished the traditional three year retreat. This retreat took place in Kongpo Lama Ling, in Kongpo province, where Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche lived.</p>
              <p>At present Semo Dechen Yudron is in charge of this monastery. It is near the lake Nam-Tso Chug-Mo, so large that it takes a full month to go around it. The lake is a pilgrimage spot for Dorje Kundragma, one of Tibet’s twelve local protectors (Tenma Chu-Nyi). When the lake is calm and peaceful and no wind ripples its surface, if you climb a mountain and look at it you can see clearly on its surface the mark of the hands of Guru Rinpoche. In the middle of this lake there is a tiny mountain island. There are no boats nor any other means of reaching it during summertime. During wintertime the lake is covered by ice for around three months, which allows people to reach this mountain island by foot. Namkha Rinpoche went to this very special island walking on the frozen surface of the lake and remained there in retreat for two years. To return one needs to wait for the following winter for the surface of the lake to freeze again. However, it can happen sometimes that the water does not freeze, and then one is stuck there for another year. This lake is not like those in the west. It resembles the sky or outer space. There is nothing there and nobody uses it for any reason whatsoever. There is no activity around it. Also there is no particular reason for going there. After his retreat on this mountain island, Namkha Rinpoche gathered around forty-eight monks and nuns, who were all his close disciples and they prostrated around this lake for six months.</p>
              <p>Later on, Namkha Rinpoche did a pilgrimage to Mount Kailash, which lasted for eight months. He left Lhasa (Tibet’s capital) to reach the border of Buthan. He continued along the border until he reached Mount Kailash, following a pilgrimage route marked out by stops established by Milarepa and other great masters.<br>Further, Namkha Rinpoche made two retreats at Samye, being the heart place of the body, speech and mind of Guru Rinpoche, one lasting for two years, the other one six months.</p>
              <p>The moment Namkha Rinpoche realized Domang Yangthang Rinpoche was there, he immediately went to see him. Domang Yangthang Rinpoche was truly happy to see him and asked if he had already been recognized as a tulku (reincarnation). Namkha Rinpoche answered him that he had been recognized as the reincarnation of Rigdzin Trag Ngak Lingpa by Dilgo Kyentse Rinpoche, who gave him the name Rigdzin Namkha Gyatso. Yangthang Rinpoche then joined his hands in a gesture of thanks for Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. But he immediately added that, even though what the latter had said was certainly true, he had himself had an extraordinary dream the previous night. In this dream he clearly saw that Namkha Rinpoche is also the reincarnation of a tulku from his own lineage, Domang Yeshe Dorje, who was the root lama of both Domang Yangthang Rinpoche and Drubwang Penor Rinpoche.</p>
