              <div class="mhs quote">Life is tender and fragile. We maybe here now but in the next moment, we may not be. What is the purpose of amassing wealth, the 5 Cs if we cannot bring the wealth over after we died? Shouldn't we be spending energy and time on cultivating the mind, do good and spend quality time with our loved ones/friends/strangers-who-can-be-friends?</div>
              <div class="mhs quote">On the other hand, It is so expensive to fall sick in singapore because of how expensive the hospital bills can be. Therefore some of us may work so hard for our future retirement, payment to our health insurances coverage and preparing the inevitable things - our loved ones or ourselves will fall sick and died. In the process, we place priority on world matters more than spiritual matters. We may lose touch with ourselves and neglect the spiritual aspects.</div>

              <p>erm... no... don't quit your job too easily. There is no such thing as a less stressful job. It depends on how you handle stress.</p>
              <p>Well... try to do meditation... breath in the air.... when you are irritated by the mundane stuff... walk around. Look at the green plants outside your office window if you have (lol) Don't sit and let your thoughts go wild. Exercise and eat healthily.</p>
              <p>Talk to your friends and family about your problems in your work. It can be a good outlet to release stress. In my case, i still trying to be as mindful as possible.. although i can't completely be unaffected, i try to minimize it. I have never been angry at people for a long long time... frustration yes hahaha. (peace) Be patient... Soon you will be a happier person.</p>
              <p>if the job is really making you miserable... try finding a job that suits your personality... good luck!</p>

              As suggested by your nom de plume; Metta with Mindfulness!
              Bring the equanmity of your practice into daily life, develop an attitude of ordinary mind, a lighthanded constant vigilance!
              It is all well to want a lighter livelihood, but we are so attached to  the needs and wants of ourselves and our loves ones that we may quickly realise that the lack of money is the real root of evil when we transition to a slower pace! Ha! Ha!

              Acknowledge life is unsatifactory and embrace it wholeheartedly. Master life as you would a warrior, swift and direct without indulging in all those internalizing, negative habits and emotions! We get burnt out due to mental overdrive! Sense the ebb and flow in different aspects of your life and you find the leisureliness and the ease of flow!
              Perhaps a retreat is in order, to develop and maintain deeper equanmity and optimism to continue over in daily life.
              Without seeing life as drudgery,engage and celebrate life and you will find an increase bountiful energy!

              Hi Metta
              Gene Reeves wrote in,  The Stories of Lotus Sutra, â€œWhile Medicine Buddha is the Buddha of the East, just as Amida Buddha is the Buddha of the West, Shakyamuni Buddha is the Buddha of this world in which suffering both has to be endured and can be. He is special to us because he suffers himself in order to understand the suffering of others, be compassionate toward them, and offer wise and compassionate help, like a wise and good physician. He is the Medicine Buddha of this world who offers us the Dharma as the good medicine. He is a loving father who long to lead us to enter the Buddha way.â€�
              
              No doubt the first noble truth of suffering does pinpoint us to the truth of Dukkha. However, it does also call us to have a balance view of life via the middle path. Buddha did not ask us to escape the world but to live in the world so that our body may become the embodiment of his teaching. 
              
              Whatever tough time one is going thru in life, do hang on. There will be days when one is down and lonely. However, know that Shakyamuni had also gone thru that path of life, hang on it will change. Shakyamuni will always be there for us but we need to be the wise child to partake the medicine which is Dharma to detoxify our negativity. 
              
              I shall end with Dalai Lama kind reminder, â€œIf a problem is fixable, if a situation is such that you can do something about it, then there is no need to worry. If it's not fixable, then there is no help in worrying. There is no benefit in worrying whatsoever.â€�

              <p>It is possible to integrate Dharma teachings into one's daily life. Every aspect, in fact.</p>
              <p>For example, when there are things you can't do for a particular customer, you explain as patiently and as sincerely as possible. When he or she lashes out at you, you remind yourself to be mindful of any negative feelings that might arise in you, and you continue to listen as patiently as possible to the customer's complaint.</p>
              <p>Buddhist practice basically revolves around the core teaching of 'Do all that is good, do no evil, and purify your mind'.</p>
              <p>So anything that is helpful to achieving the above behaviour or outcome, can be considered as practising or integrating the Dharma into one's life.</p>
              <p>In terms of work stress, maybe you can identify what are those causes of stress and what are the possible ways to reduce or even eliminate those causes.</p>
              <p>If you feel that after trying out many ways and you still find yourself unable to cope, or from your personal experience, you can tell that this job will not bring you the kind of satisfaction you are looking for in the long run, especially in terms of practising the values taught in Buddhist teachings, then perhaps it is time to consider looking out for another job.</p>
              <p>I wish you all the best.</p>
