            <div class='col-md body'>Mock meat is technically not a problem for vegetarians. But then it is totally pointless bcos from my experience mock meat is usually not nice to eat, genuine vegetarian food are better. And more nutritious. And another thing is mock meat is unhealthy.. I cant remember what they put inside, but a vegetarian friend of mine told me that mock meat is unhealthy and if you eat a lot of mock meat and you are a vegetarian, you will even become more unhealthy than a non-vegetarian who doesn't eat mock meat.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not written on the buddhism aspect but mock meat is unhealthy because it is made from gluten.<br><br>"Gluten is an amorphous ergastic protein found combined with starch in the endosperm of some cereals, notably wheat, rye, and barley. It constitutes about 80% of the proteins contained in wheat, and is composed of the proteins gliadin and glutenin. "<br><br>"Gluten can be extracted from the flour of wheat and other grains by washing out the starch. To do this, a simple dough of flour and water is rinsed with plain water and kneaded until the rinsing water remains clear and free from starch and bran. For chemical, non-food purposes, a saline solution provides better results. The remaining lump of gluten should have a stringy, sticky texture reminiscent of chewing gum."<br><br>"Cooked gluten becomes firm to the bite and soaks up a certain amount of the surrounding broth and its taste. It is therefore commonly used in vegetarian cuisine, notably Buddhist cuisine and vegan cuisine, where one variety is called seitan. Some consider it a convincing imitation meat (particularly duck) when the broth is flavored accordingly.<br><br>In the process of baking with yeast, gluten is responsible for keeping the fermentation gases in the dough, allowing it to rise. After baking, the coagulated gluten ensures that the final product keeps its shape (although starch is also essential for structural integrity). Recently, gluten has also been implicated as being at least partially responsible for bread staling."<br><br>Btw, some people are allergic to gluten. Anyway gluten is not easily diegestable and puts alot of stress on your digestive system.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluten</a><br><br></div>

Mock meat just makes vegetarian meals abit more colourful and creative, though also greatly depending on how the cook cooks it.</div>
