              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jealousy Is a Warning - Middle Way Manager</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Shozan Jack Haubner FALL 2015 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Think your teacher is not competitive? Think again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">At night I lie in bed, unable to sleep. Worst-case scenarios
              run through my head—and then I remember that they’re not worst-case scenarios
              at all. I’m living them. My teacher died, our community has torn itself apart
              in his absence, and I’m 42, single, and still not totally sure what I want to
              do with my life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Plus I have the prostate of a 70-year-old man, which is not
              as fun as it sounds. At night I pee in an old plastic mozzarella cheese bucket
              I keep by the side of the bed, because I pee a lot and the bathroom is too far
              down the hall. I mean, it’s not in another zip code or something, but the stone
              hallway tile is really hard and cold, and anyway, don’t judge me. One man’s sad
              little habit is another man’s life hack.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I live at and manage a city temple founded by my teacher 50
              years ago. The halls are haunted by his absence. The place is full of ghosts.
              At night they all seem to take up residence in my room—in my head. I can’t stop
              worrying. Mostly I worry about how the temple will survive on my limited
              charisma and Cracker Jack insights. Who will want to come study with me? Is it
              my job to be spiritually impressive, to draw in new students, or is this just
              ego?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I never wanted to make a career out of Zen. I simply wanted
              to find a way to live. Making a living at being wise seems to come so naturally
              to some people. They write a few books, smile from a few lifestyle magazine
              covers, and suddenly they’re filling auditoriums. Bastards. I belong to a
              different class. Not a spiritual superstar, but not a freshman practitioner
              either. Not enlightened, but I can help a rookie upgrade her practice. I deal
              in small volumes of local dharma.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I’m a middle way manager.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After my suiji-shiki, or priest/teacher ordination ceremony,
              they put me in the temple tearoom as a kind of dharma show pony. There I stood,
              in 30 pounds of hand-sewn garments, trying to make sense of my new red and gold
              fan, when a Japanese woman, about 50 years of age, approached me, went down on
              her knees before me, and began bowing and saying “Shozan-san! Thank you! Thank
              you!” “Okay,” I said, bowing my head, “Yes, thank you.” “Thank you! Thank you
              Shozan-san!” She stayed down there an awfully long time and I began to go red
              in the face. “Okay, yes, thank you too. Okay . . . ” “Thank you Shozan-san! ”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There were tears in people’s eyes. Everyone looked so in love
              with their idea of me just then. And who was I to argue? Much of your job as a
              new Zen priest involves pretending that you actually are the kind of person
              that people keep mistaking you for. You are constantly walking the thin line
              between growing into your new role and faking the part.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">That being said, whatever you do, don’t try to hide your
              weaknesses. This is the spiritual equivalent of the guy who combs the hair down
              by his ears up over the shiny bald spot on the top of his head. No one’s
              fooled. The only thing worse than trying to look younger than you are is trying
              to look wiser than you are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Of course you can’t win, because once you’re open about your
              flaws, students judge you every bit as harshly as you used to judge the
              teachers in your own life. They even compare you to your own spiritual heroes,
              often with a look on their face as though they’ve eaten a bad piece of fish,
              and suddenly you realize that those deep souls who inspired you are somehow now
              your competitors—and you go from admiring to envying them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I started thinking about how many truly extraordinary
              Buddhist teachers there are in this world, and how lucky I am that they all
              live so far away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Envy is born from insecurity. We often think that insecurity
              comes from a weak ego, but in my experience it is the result of an inflexible
              ego that has mistaken itself as the center of the universe, which keeps
              contradicting it on this key point. Whatever its origin, envy is not the proper
              response to spiritual decency in others. Yet there it was, rising up in me just
              the other night after I had peed in my cheese bucket. I lay back down and
              started thinking about how many truly extraordinary Buddhist teachers there are
              in this world, and how lucky I am that they all live so far away. I mean, how
              could I compete for students with the Dalai Lama?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I tried to puff myself up by thinking about the book I wrote
              and its dozens of fans. Then I remembered who is shelved next to me at Barnes
              &amp; Noble. Thich Nhat something or other. There are about 500 titles in the
              Eastern religions section, and at least one thousand of them are written by
              him. Who writes this many books? How does he do it?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I went on in this vein until the sun started to rise and I
              had to pee again. I stumbled out of bed and stepped right into my bucket of
              urine—at which point I utterly freaked out. I thought I’d fallen into a frigid
              pool of death or something. I screamed and kicked my foot, and the pee bucket
              shot right through my paper shoji screen and across the room, where it hit the
              wall and landed with a thud.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I cleaned up my mess, cursed a great deal, crawled back in
              bed, and lay there like the middle-aged ersatz Eckhart Tolle I am. No way I was
              falling asleep now. I replayed the pee bucket incident again and again in my
              head, audibly groaning each time. The worst person to be embarrassed in front
              of is yourself, because out of everyone you know you’re probably the least
              willing to forget any of the stupid things that you do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Humility, however, brings clarity. Sometimes you’re just too
              busy thinking about yourself to really see yourself clearly. That’s when life
              puts a banana peel—or a pee bucket—in your path. That morning I clearly saw
              just how heavy I had grown with the burden of trying to be someone who I am
              not. I needed to go back to the core of Zen practice: doing simple things
              completely, not trying to do big things for a large audience. I’m a monk, not
              Tony Robbins. If people get something out of practicing with me, great. But I
              can’t carry anyone into the zendo with me, either through charisma, insight, or
              marketing. That’s just not what this path is about. People have to bring
              themselves to the practice. And when they do, I’m there to practice with them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">My job as a middle-aged middle manager of the middle way is
              the same as that of any lay practitioner, right on up to the most enlightened
              being on the planet: we all must commit wholeheartedly, moment after moment, to
              the life we have, instead of fantasizing about a different life while putting
              down or envying those who are supposedly living it. When I start feeling
              jealous of others, it’s a warning sign that I’ve become a little bit too
              entranced by some idea of myself and have lost touch with the reality of my
              life. Someone else seems to better represent this idea of myself than I do, and
              suddenly I want his life instead of my own.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Zen practice, however, teaches you to completely be
              yourself—if you don’t, who will? Someone’s got to hold down your corner of the
              universe, and no one else is qualified. If you are not fully present in your
              life, there will be an absence in the world where you should be. That absence
              won’t be big or small, it will be the exact same size as your presence:
              perfectly you-sized.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After the Japanese woman finally got up from her knees that
              day in the tearoom, a tall, funny-looking monk friend of mine took her place
              before me. He saw my expression and growled. “Don’t forget the most important
              thing about being a Zen priest—wear your responsibilities lightly!”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It was one of those rare moments where someone says something
              that you didn’t know you needed to hear, and it makes all the difference. A
              well-put spiritual phrase usually happens like this, by accident or chance, in
              response to some particular need. Genuine teaching arises in small moments,
              person to person. At least that’s always how it’s been for me. When you’re
              fully present in your life, the teachings have a way of finding you—and when
              you’re not, a bucket of piss becomes the Buddha and wakes you up.</span></p>
