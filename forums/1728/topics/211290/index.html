            <div class='col-md body'>I have been wondering for a long time that does spinning the mantra wheels really produce merit ? Or is it based on faith alone where if you belive it will then it will have the effect otherwise it won't have the effects of creating merits ? And does writing the Noble Mahayana Sangatasutra dharma-paryaya or in chinese called the seng jia tuo jing produce merits ? What are your stand on such things ? Why issit that some believe in it while others don't belive or even say not true . Is there really any merit in writing sutras ? How should we store such sutras ?</div>

If you can copy the sutra, and pass it to someone else, isn't that great merits? But even today... there are still merits. Because by copying the sutra you will also deeply look into the content of the sutra, and that itself is great merits. And I believe somehow if you copy the sutra by hand, you will treasure it more because it is done with great effort. And even to keep, recite, read, and expound the sutras, all these have very vast merits that are immeasurable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for Mantra wheels, I am not a Tibetan Buddhist but you can refer to this article which is well written on this subject: <a href="http://www.fpmt.org/resources/lzrbenefits.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fpmt.org/resources/lzrbenefits.asp</a><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So what about the storing of sutras ? Can anyone tell me some ways to keep or store a sutra properly ? Can i after writing a sutra seal it in a hard cover cupboard box then put it somewhere like for example behind a statue of shakyamuni or just put it on a table to pray to ? And must it be facing the window or can let it face anywhere ? ( of cos not the toilet for sure ) . Cos i know taoist god have to be facing the sky/window but buddha wise i wonder if this rule still applies .</div>

Just make sure you put it in respectful places (i.e never on the floor or toilet, etc). Put it somewhere not messy.</div>

It is a symbol of the end of suffering and true peace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
