              <p>His meeting with Niguma came about in this fashion. After he had 
              received teachings from many great Siddhas, Khyungpo Naljor again 
              searched for highly realized teachers from whom he could receive more 
              advanced instruction. The most realized teachers he encountered told him
               that one with his qualities should seek the great Bodhisattva who was 
              not separate from Dorje Chang in her realization and in the profound 
              teachings she could skillfully transmit.
              <br> <br> Khyungpo Naljor asked where he could meet such an enlightened being and 
              was told that her presence could manifest anywhere to highly purified 
              beings. Unfortunate beings, those still caught in emotional afflictions,
               would find it very difficult to encounter her at all, since she had 
              dissolved her physical form, attained the rainbow body, and achieved the
               level of Dorje Chang. Every now and again, however, she would visit the
               most sacred cremation grounds and, leading a host of dakinis, would 
              preside over great ritual offering feasts (ganacakras). There someone 
              might have an opportunity of seeing the great Niguma.
              <br> <br> As soon as Khyungpo Naljor heard the name of the great dakini, he felt 
              such devotion, like an electric shock, that tears swelled up in his 
              eyes. Immediately he set out to find her at the great charnel ground 
              called Sosaling. As he traveled, he continuously made supplications to 
              the Three Jewels. When he reached the cemetery, he saw above him in 
              space at the height of seven banana trees, a female deity bluish in 
              appearance, who wore elaborate bone ornaments and held a trident and a 
              skull. As he gazed at her, he sometimes saw one deity, and sometimes 
              many; some were in meditation posture, and some were dancing or making 
              graceful gestures. He felt sure that this was the great Bodhisattva 
              Niguma, and began to make reverent prostrations to her, sincerely 
              imploring her for transmission of the teachings.</p>
              <p>On the day of the full moon, Niguma gave Khyungpo Naljor the empowerment
               and transmission of the teachings of the profound Dream Practice. In 
              the middle of this, she said to him: "Son from Tibet, arise!"
              <br> <br> Suddenly Khyungpo Naljor found himself in midair at the height of three 
              banana trees. Looking up towards Niguma, he saw that the great being was
               on top of a golden mountain, surrounded by a vast retinue of dakinis. 
              Down the four sides of the mountain, rivers fell. Khyungpo Naljor 
              wondered out loud if this amazing mountain was truly there or whether he
               was witnessing a miraculous performance by the dakini.
              <br> <br> Niguma answered, "When the ocean of samsara is turned over, when all 
              attachment and ego-clinging are totally uprooted, then every place and 
              every thing is covered with gold, forming a golden field of 
              non-attachment. The actual nature of samsara, this phenomenal world, is 
              like a play of dreams and illusion. When you have realized 
              experientially that the play of the phenomenal world is nothing but a 
              dream, or is like the illusion created by some magician, then you have 
              gone beyond the ocean of samsara. This requires the greatest devotion to
               your Lama. Understand this. Now you must leave here. Go and grasp your 
              dream.”
              <br> <br> Khyungpo Naljor understood her instructions and entered the dream as he 
              had been taught. In the dream state he was given full empowerment for 
              the Five Golden Dharmas of Niguma. Three times in the dream he received 
              the empowerments, including those of the Six Yogas of Niguma. At the 
              end, Niguma told him this: "In this land there have been no other beings
               except yourself who received the total transmission of these doctrines 
              three times in one dream.”
              <br> <br> On the following day, Niguma once again gave him three times the 
              complete transmissions, with the detailed explanations of these 
              doctrines; this time the transmission took place in the waking state. 
              One commitment she asked him to keep was this: only he and another 
              Mahasiddha, by the name of Lavapa, had the transmission into the six 
              doctrines of Niguma; the teachings should be kept secret until seven 
              generations had passed in an unbroken line of transmission from one Lama
               to one chosen disciple in each generation. After the seventh 
              generation, it would be appropriate to give these teachings more widely 
              for the benefit of all beings.</p>
