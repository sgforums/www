              <p>If depend how attached you are to the issue, the person who've hurt you. The more hurt and indignant you are, the more you want the perpetrator to suffer!
              However, if you are not overly attached to the incident, the moment will slide!
              The point is to recognise the rising or stirring of emotions before you lose control of your feelings. Losing control of our emotions is not good as we usually end up hurting ourselves and others. Usually, you are lower down the ladder, that suffer such unfairness, you build unneccessary stress for yourselves, only to vent your anger to somebody who happen to trigger your anger!
              I used to be angrier, but have since mellowed. However, you can use awareness on the arising of emotions as a type of practice!</p>

              <p>hahaha, you come to this forum Eternal Now will tell you do vipassana meditation. This will bring you to mind that you are nothing and that's why you are treated badly, scolded and bullied. If you cross over to Eternal Hope, they will tell you to turn the other cheek.</p>
              <p>Revenge or eye for an eye is viewed negatively, but you can apply Newton's law of Action and Reaction - a force has an equal and opposite force.  If someone scold you, you scold back!  Isn't this fair?  You cannot call this revenge.  It is nature's law.</p>

              <p>no doubt newtonian physics have taught us with force exerted you get equal reactionary force...but with human understanding, this could be controlled and passively absorbed and released through transcendental truth, which makes us and our surrounding less reactionary or less violent...</p>
              <p>still, humans are all too human, the degree of self control and understanding requires effort...for a better world...</p>

              <p>Normally, in Buddhism, we practise tolerance åŒ…å®¹ and foreberance å¿�è¾±. Even if someone is treating us very badly, as long as we do not commit any form of evil, our own "hatred" will slowly give in to compassion. Do not revenge, do not speak ill of others, do not use any harsh words, do not curse them. It will only bring bad karma not just to others, but yourself. You will suffer ultimately. Hatred will slowly give in to the loving-kindness and compassion.</p>
              <p>You must learn the following Buddhist wisdom:</p>
              <p>äººå®¶æ°£æˆ‘æˆ‘ä¸�æ°£ ï¼ˆA person angers me, but I'm not angry)</p>
              <p>æˆ‘è‹¥ç”Ÿæ°£ä¸­ä»–è¨ˆ(If I'm angry, I will fall into his ploy)</p>
              <p>æˆ‘å€‘æ‡‰è©² (we should)</p>
              <p>å¿�äººæ‰€ä¸�èƒ½å¿� (tolerate what cannot be tolerated)</p>

              <p>Even the most evil person can be tamed with the Buddha's mind. Only two words: Loving-kindness and Compassion.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, not all parents are well-educated in the art of parenting. In 8 sufferings (å…«è‹¦ï¼‰ of buddhism, one of them is <span class="st">æ€¨æ†Žä¼šè‹¦ (sufferings of hatred/anger). Sufferings of hatred can take place within a family. You're reborn into a family due to law of karma, causes and conditions and because you do have a relationship with your parents in the past life (Buddhism calls it å› ç·£ or causes/conditions). Your karmic relationship with your parents in the past life can be good or bad. If you've done some wrong-doings to your parents in the past life (bad karma), then in this present life, if you're reborn as the parents (while your parents in the former life are reborn as your kids), you might receive bad treatment from your kids (in the form of unfilial piety). This is why physical abuses within the family (notice that some kids kill their parents - considered one of the 7 heaviest bad karmic act). On the otherhand, some parents physically abuse their kids (beat them, rape, molest etc.). It's an endless cycle unless compassion is practised. </span></p>
              <p><span class="st">So, why do people who hate each other are 'destined' to be together in a family? Even husbands and wives find themselves at loggerhead.   This is again subjected to the law of karma, something we can never escape.</span></p>
              <p>Kids who are reborn into a family of abuse are generally living in the "realm of hell" in the human world. However, the dharma does provide relieving of sufferings.</p>
              <p>If family abuse constitute violation of criminal offence, it's important to seek legal help. Spiritual healing from Buddhism can complement the fear and sufferings. On the other hand, repentence and practising of compassion can help relieve the spiritual sufferings. This is where chanting or meditation will come in hand.</p>
