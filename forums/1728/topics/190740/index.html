Gotta know him when I started dharma sharing at KBC, and realised that he is a very talented person at heart.  In fact, there are many inmates like Barry who have accepted punishment, and repented.  I firmly believe that all beings have the heart of buddha within them, but we are clouded by greed, anger and ignorance.  However, always repent and make sure we'll never do it again, forgive ourselves and move on.

I'm not an inmate, only a volunteer that goes in weekly to do dharma sharing..  I've met with alot of difficulties while engaging people to go to prison to make friends with inmates.  However, much I can see, this is slowly changing, at least among the buddhist communities.  There's some hope at least.</div>
