            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Isis,<br><br>My feelings are that the monk you'd met probably is a bogus one. To my understanding, these bogus monks and those "8-precept ladies" (those ladies in pure white clothing) seems to be controlled by overseas syndicate.<br><br>Now firstly in Singapore begging for alms on the street is not a common practice. Any local monks would know this. And if it is a visiting monk, then he should be housed by a temple that he had registered himself in.<br><br>Testing the monks by asking them to chant the sutta is rather pointless, probably he may really know how to recite and whatnot. But you can try for entertainment purpose. My friend did this to a chinese "monk" who claimed he know many sutra. Then my friend asked him to recite ended up he only kept repeating "Nan Wu(yes he pronounced Wu) A Mi Tuo Fo" with that confidence look on the face. My friend ended up calling police on the spot. And apparently in his bags, there were cigarettes, condoms (the police was laughing over this), passport, a small book that records how much donation he had received and not forgetting cold hard cash.<br><br>Usually these bogus people often got away successful because they prey on people's kindness; and some common people's perception that "they-also-come-out-to-make-a-living-so-be-it". I think as disciples of the Buddha we should be careful and aware of the situation. Compassion should be accompanied with Wisdom.</div>
