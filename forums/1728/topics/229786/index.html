            <div class='col-md body'><strong>5th Jan 07<br><br>Wild Wide Eyes</strong><br><br><span style="color: green;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I noticed that the world looks brighter and sharper when I opened my eyes bigger. Don't laugh! Maybe you think we should have realised this since we were toddlers. But I don't think this is exactly true. Seeing the world through new big eyes brings a new wave of life to everything. Try it on your loved ones-see them renewed with a tinge of amazement at their being and infinite complexities from head to toe. It is because kids live their days with perpetually wild and wide eyes that they have endless fun, is that not true? Try a simple experiment: look at the palms of your hands. Aren't they amazing? Better still, gaze upon the serene countenance of a Buddha image.<br><br>Yes, we never saw the Buddha in real life-but many Buddha images are amazing enough. Then look into your own big wide eyes in the mirror-look at the shine. You are alive! And the Buddha Nature within shines on bright!</span></span><br><br><img src="http://www.aimwell.org/AIMLogo.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>12th Jan 07<br><br><strong>Maybe</strong><br><br>There's this book I'm about to finish reading called "Maybe (Maybe Not)" by Robert Fulgum (author of the famous "Everything I Needed to Know I Learnt in Kindergarten" ) On the back sleeve are these words-<br><br>"I once began a list of contradictory notions I hold:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Look before you leap.<br>He who hesitates is lost.<br><br>Nothing ventured, nothing gained.<br>Better safe than sorry.<br><br>You can't tell a book by its cover.<br>Clothes make the man..."</span><br><br>Isn't it interesting yet scary that sometimes we live by a "wise old saying," believing with all our hearts that it is absolutely true, only to realise much later that it isn't necessarily so? We are all searching for the absolute unchanging Truth (or HAPPINESS) in capital letters, that has no expiry date.<br><br>There's this poster-ad with a picture of a young man yelling at his girlfriend. His girlfriend's fists were clenched, and she was pouting back in anger. In that black and white freeze frame, there is the question on it with no black or white answer, "Life is not knowing whether to hit him or kiss him." The message sets one's mind thinking. It seems funny, serious, bizarre and understandable at the same time. Life is indeed full of contradictions and paradoxes that we have to figure out-like a seemingly ridiculous Zen koan which can lead to Enlightenment when seriously meditated upon.<br><br><strong>There is a set of Buddhist contradictory notions that no one really voiced out-<br><br>1. Hey! What do you expect? I'm a Buddhist! Not a Buddha yet!<br>versus...<br><br>2. Hey! Come on! We are already all perfect Buddhas inside! (Referring to us possessing Buddha Nature)<br><br>Is 1. a consolation or an excuse when we fail to do what we should? How and when should we use 2. to motivate ourselves instead of using 1. to excuse ourselves? How true is 1. or 2. at that point in time when you make each statements? Do you live more by 1. or 2.? Why? </strong></div>
