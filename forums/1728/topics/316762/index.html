              <p>I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a> at Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</a>.</p>
              <p>There he addressed the monks, saying, "Monks."</p>
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "I will teach &amp; analyze for you the Noble
                  Eightfold Path. Listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, is the Noble Eightfold Path?
                  Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right
                  livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right view? Knowledge with regard to stress,
                  knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with
                  regard to the stopping of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of
                  practice leading to the stopping of stress: This, monks, is called
                  right view.</p>
              <p>"And what is right resolve? Being resolved on renunciation, on
                  freedom from ill will, on harmlessness: This is called right resolve.</p>
              <p>"And what is right speech? Abstaining from lying, abstaining from
                  divisive speech, abstaining from abusive speech, abstaining from idle
                  chatter: This, monks, is called right speech.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right action? Abstaining from taking life,
                  abstaining from stealing, abstaining from unchastity: This, monks, is
                  called right action.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right livelihood? There is the case where a
                  disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood,
                  keeps his life going with right livelihood: This, monks, is called
                  right livelihood.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right effort? (<strong>i</strong>) There is the case
                  where a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence,
                  upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of
                  evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen. (<strong>ii</strong>) He
                  generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp;
                  exerts his intent for the sake of the abandonment of evil, unskillful
                  qualities that have arisen. (<strong>iii</strong>) He generates desire,
                  endeavors, activates persistence, upholds &amp; exerts his intent for
                  the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen.
                  (<strong>iv</strong>) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence,
                  upholds &amp; exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion,
                  increase, plenitude, development, &amp; culmination of skillful
                  qualities that have arisen: This, monks, is called right effort.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right mindfulness? (<strong>i</strong>) There is the case
                  where a monk remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself — ardent,
                  aware, &amp; mindful — putting away greed &amp; distress with reference
                  to the world. (<strong>ii</strong>) He remains focused on feelings in &amp; of
                  themselves — ardent, aware, &amp; mindful — putting away greed &amp;
                  distress with reference to the world. (<strong>iii</strong>) He remains focused
                  on the mind in &amp; of itself — ardent, aware, &amp; mindful — putting
                  away greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. (<strong>iv</strong>) He
                  remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves — ardent,
                  aware, &amp; mindful — putting away greed &amp; distress with reference
                  to the world. This, monks, is called right mindfulness.</p>
              <p>"And what, monks, is right concentration? (<strong>i</strong>) There is the
                  case where a monk — quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from
                  unskillful (mental) qualities — enters &amp; remains in the first
                  jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by
                  directed thought &amp; evaluation. (<strong>ii</strong>) With the stilling of
                  directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the
                  second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification
                  of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal
                  assurance. (<strong>iii</strong>) With the fading of rapture, he remains in
                  equanimity, is mindful &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body.
                  He enters &amp; remains in the third jhana, of which the Noble Ones
                  declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.' (<strong>iv</strong>)
                  With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier
                  disappearance of elation &amp; distress — he enters &amp; remains in
                  the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither
                  pleasure nor pain. This, monks, is called right concentration."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted at his words.</p>
