            <div class='col-md body'><p>"Sometimes the experiences of practice are given a lot of importance by new practitioners, who become attached to them. But actually, although experiences inspire us to have faith so that we can go beyond ordinary samsaric phenomena, having experiences means that there is still a connection with substance. All experiences only exist in relation to the practitioner's path of enlightenment and not in relation to the result of enlightenment, since they still exist within circumstances. As long as there is attachment, there is experience. All practice has the intention of increasing new experiences in order to release us from former experiences until we are released from all experiences to the natural quality of enlightenment." ~ Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, "White Sail," Chapter on "Love and Faith"</p></div>

              <p>If the implication of view is not understood, then one may get the impression that all that is necessary is to realize the I AM, the pure Beingness, and abide in the pure non-conceptual Presence-beingness 24/7.</p>
              <p>However, once the Implication of View is understood, you will understand also why learning the books, the texts, trying to have correct understanding is so important to advance on one's realization.</p>
              <p>Also, practice, in the form of contemplation, is necessary for realization.</p>
              <p>I wrote in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/443643?page=1#post_10459560">http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/443643?page=1#post_10459560</a></p>
              <p>Excerpt:</p>
              <p><br> <strong>Implication of Views</strong><br> <br> The implication of views wasn’t very clear to me until more recent
                                      months (some time after I realized Anatta and Shunyata), when I
                                      began to see that what was causing grasping, clinging, the wrong
                                      way of perception, sense of self and so on was actually the latent
                                      view of inherency and duality. Even though previously realization
                                      has arisen that clearly done damage to such views, the impact of
                                      views in our experience and living wasn’t fully clear until more
                                      recently.<br> What is view? View is a deeply held notion, belief, position,
                                      stance, with regards to the reality of self and objects. This view
                                      has direct implications on how we view things - how we form a
                                      mental conception of self and things which causes grasping and
                                      contraction. When you want to cut ignorance, you go for its roots,
                                      not cut off its leaves and branches. In this analogy, sense of
                                      self/Self is its manifest form (leaves and branches) in the form of
                                      a sense of contraction, alienation and self-grasping in the form of
                                      craving and emotions, while the latent view is its roots.<br> <br> As an example: if you view that your self abides in the heart
                                      center, then you may sense a contraction in the heart center, if
                                      your belief/position is that your self abides in the head, you may
                                      sense a contraction or clinging there, as well as that sense of
                                      alienation from the sensate world at large, a sense that there is
                                      this seer behind the eyes looking outwards at the world in a
                                      distance. That felt-sense of contraction and alienation, that sense
                                      of self/Self, is its manifest form, while the
                                      self-view/position/belief/ignorance is its root. This is why we
                                      cannot successively get rid of the sense of self/Self by will and
                                      effort without effectively cutting off self-view from its root
                                      through a paradigm shift via realization. There times of peak
                                      experiences which everyone has experienced some time in their lives
                                      (usually in childhood) where the sense of a self/Self goes into
                                      temporary abeyance and there is just the sensate world, magnificent
                                      and wonderful, untainted by any sense of self or emotional
                                      contents, just the pristine purity and clarity of the sensate world
                                      at large. Yet most of us tend to forget those moments, and continue
                                      our lives not transformed by such experiences at all. Why is that
                                      so? Our self-view is intact, and no amount of glimpses of PCE (Pure
                                      Consciousness Experience) or NDNCDIMOP (non-dual, non-conceptual,
                                      direct, immediate mode of perception) is fundamentally going to
                                      transform us unless we cut off the roots of ignorance.<br> <br> It should be understood that these latent tendencies or view of
                                      inherency and duality runs so deep down in our psyche that it is
                                      not merely a matter of conceptual belief but a deeply rooted,
                                      habitual way of perceiving things through a particular paradigm or
                                      framework... so deep and habitual that it cannot be removed even if
                                      one has come to an intellectual conclusion or inference that the
                                      doctrine of anatta and emptiness is actually something that makes
                                      more sense than the view of duality and self. For instance, I
                                      myself have faith and am convinced intellectually about the truth
                                      of anatta and emptiness way before I had a direct experiential
                                      realization that effectively resulted in the liberation of false
                                      view. But I can say in those years where I remain a mere
                                      intellectual or conceptual conviction or inferred understanding of
                                      this matter, I do not experience any sense of a freedom from
                                      self-contraction, from afflictive emotions, and so on... all these
                                      come from tendencies so deeply latent that it cannot be resolved by
                                      a mere intellectual transformation of views and beliefs (such as by
                                      training yourself in the Madhyamaka reasonings). For false view run
                                      far deeper into our psyche that require you to truly realize things
                                      from experiential awakening/knowledge and vision of things as they
                                      are.<br> <br> Also, a lot of people think 'The Right View is No View' which is
                                      true since all metaphysical views pertain to false views of
                                      existence and non-existence, however the way they go about
                                      resolving the problem is by 'forgetting all concepts'. They think
                                      that by suspending all beliefs, by forgetting all concepts and
                                      sitting quietly in a state of pure awareness, somehow merely by
                                      that, they can overcome false views. Let me offer something for you
                                      think about: every day we go into a state of deep sleep where all
                                      our beliefs, concepts, views, thoughts are temporarily suspended.
                                      But when we wake up, what happens? We are as ignorant as ever. Our
                                      framework of viewing self and reality is still the same. We still
                                      experience the same problems, the same sufferings, the same
                                      afflictions. This analogy should clearly show you that sustaining a
                                      state of non-conceptuality or mastering a state of 'forgetting the
                                      self' is not going to result in a fundamental change or
                                      transformation or effortless seeing, unless true wisdom and insight
                                      arises. I shall offer two more analogies which are related: a
                                      person deluded as to see a rope as a snake, will live in fear,
                                      trying to tame the snake, trying to get rid of the snake, escape
                                      from the snake. Maybe he managed a way to distant himself from the
                                      snake, yet the belief that the snake is still there is nevertheless
                                      going to haunt him.<br> <br> Even if he managed to master the state of
                                      forgetting the snake, he is nonetheless in a state of delusion. He
                                      has not seen as it truly is: the snake is simply a rope. In another
                                      analogy, the child believes in the existence of santa claus and
                                      awaits eagerly for arrival of his presents on Christmas day. One
                                      day the parents decide that it's time the child be told the truth
                                      about santa claus. To do this, beating the hell out of the child is
                                      not going to work. You simply need to tell the child that santa
                                      claus doesn't truly exist. In these analogies, I try to showcase
                                      how trying to deal with the problem of false views through means of
                                      'forgetting conceptuality, forgetting the self' is as useless or
                                      deluded as 'trying to forget the snake, trying to tame the snake,
                                      trying to beat the hell out of the child' when the simple, direct
                                      and only true solution is only to realize that there is only a
                                      rope, and that santa claus isn't real. Only Awakening liberates us
                                      from a bondage that is without basis.<br> <br> Without the right contemplation and instilling of right view, you
                                      can 'sit quietly in pure awareness' for an entire lifetime without
                                      waking up. I cannot stress this point enough because this is a very
                                      prevalent erroneous understanding - even someone at the I AM level
                                      of realization will talk about non-conceptuality, non-conceptual
                                      Presence-Awareness and think it is final. Same goes for other
                                      stages. By overemphasizing on non-conceptuality, they will miss the
                                      subtler aspects of insight, they will fail to grasp right view,
                                      they will fail to tackle the subtler imprints and mental framework
                                      of viewing dualistically and inherently. They will not even see
                                      their framework of perceiving self and things as false that is
                                      causing some subtle effort and clinging (to a Self or to an actual
                                      ground here/now or to an actual world), just like you will never
                                      see your dream as a dream until well... you wake up.<br> <br> As Zen writer and speaker Ted Biringer says, "Accurate
                                      understanding is not authentic realization. At the same time,
                                      authentic realization can hardly be expected to occur without
                                      accurate understanding. And while an absence of "right
                                      understanding" almost excludes the possibility of authentic
                                      realization, the presence of "wrong understanding" excludes even
                                      the slimmest hope of success. If we aspire to realize what Zen
                                      practice-enlightenment truly is, then, as Dogen says, "We should
                                      inquire into it, and we should experience it." To follow his
                                      guidance here we will need to understand his view of what "it" is
                                      that needs to be inquired into, and who the "we" is that is to do
                                      the inquiring."<br> <br> <strong>Non-conceptuality does not mean non-attachment. For
                                      example when you realize the I AM, you cling to that pure
                                      non-conceptual beingness and consciousness as your true identity.
                                      You cling to that pure non-conceptual thought very tightly – you
                                      wish to abide in that purest state of presence 24/7. This clinging
                                      prevents us from experiencing Presence AS the Transience. This is a
                                      form of clinging to something non-conceptual. So know that going
                                      beyond concepts does not mean overcoming the view of inherency and
                                      its resultant clinging clinging. Even in the substantial non-dual
                                      phase, there is still clinging to a Source, a One Mind – even
                                      though experience is non-dual and non-conceptual. But when inherent
                                      view is dissolved, we see there is absolutely nothing we can cling
                                      to, and this is the beginning of Right View and the Path to Nirvana
                                      – the cessation of clinging and craving.</strong><br> <br> So as you can see, non-conceptual, even non-dual experience does
                                      not liberate - so we have to use the intellect to understand right
                                      view, and then investigate it in our experience. This is like a
                                      fire that in the end burns up the candle it is burning on,
                                      consuming itself in the process, leaving no trace even of itself.
                                      In other words, conceptual understanding of right view, coupled
                                      with investigative practice, results in true realization that
                                      dissolves concepts leaving non-conceptual wisdom - but without that
                                      process of investigating and trying to understand right view,
                                      merely remaining in a state of non-conceptuality isn't going to
                                      help you get free. People who fear engaging in thought, trying to
                                      understand the right view, challenging their views and
                                      understanding of things, are unfortunately going to stick with
                                      their own deluded framework of perceiving things.<br> <br> Now having diverted our attention so much, let us return to the
                                      subject at hand.<br> <br> There are two kinds of views (with sub categories):<br> <strong><br> 1. View of Subject-Object Duality</strong><br> <br> The view of subject-object duality is prevalent in everyone up to
                                      the realization of I AM. If you have not realized I AM, it is felt
                                      as a sense of alienation, separation, distance, between I as a
                                      subjective perceiver inside my head looking at the world 'outside'
                                      from a distance.<br> <br> Having realized the I AM, one no longer doubts one's Existence,
                                      Pure Presence, Consciousness. It cannot be unseen, because
                                      luminosity is the unconditioned characteristic or essence of mind
                                      that can never be removed from sight. In that moment of
                                      realization, there is no longer any doubts as it is a direct
                                      non-conceptual realization of a fundamental fact of reality.<br> <br> Yet, due to the taints of dualistic view, this luminosity is
                                      abstracted from other experiences (from sense perceptions,
                                      thoughts, etc). Due to the view that there is a subjective self, or
                                      observer, apart from the perceived objects, there is always this
                                      split between Me, the Observing Awareness, and 'that' - the
                                      observed objects. Even if one perceives Awareness to be an infinite
                                      background container and manifestations to be finite appearances
                                      popping in and out of this background container awareness like
                                      waves on the ocean, there is always this split between 'awareness'
                                      and 'contents of awareness'. Contents of awareness appears 'in'
                                      awareness, but is not awareness. The view that Awareness is a
                                      container for phenomena but is not a phenomena is a kind of
                                      dualistic view/position/stance that is unfounded, but in ignorance
                                      taken to be true. This is the subject-object dualistic division.
                                      When one realizes non-duality, one no longer sees awareness as the
                                      background container of appearances.<br> <br> However even though dualistic bond is gone and one no longer sees
                                      distance, separation, inside or outside, but an intimacy with
                                      everything, nonetheless there can still be the bond of inherency -
                                      seeing Awareness as something inherent (independent, unchanging), a
                                      subtle clinging to the view of a Subjective Self even though
                                      usually seen as impersonal [in fact probably seen to be universal]
                                      and furthermore without subject-object division: 'IT' is
                                      inseparable from, and manifesting itself as, all
                                      appearances.<strong><br> <br> 2. View of Inherency</strong><br> <br> The view of inherency is twofold: the view that a subjective self
                                      [whether personal or universal], and the view that
                                      objects/phenomena have intrinsic, objective substantiality (whether
                                      gross such as 'a tree', or subtle, such as elemental existence of
                                      atoms).<br> <br> All metaphysical views come down to 'is' or 'is not'. Either
                                      something exist, or something does not exist. The former is
                                      eternalism, the latter is nihilism. Both views are extremes and to
                                      be rejected according to Buddha.<br> <br> What is subjective self? Self is seen as being an unchanging
                                      subject - in other words, moment by moment, the objects of the
                                      field of experience come and go, but there is this unchanging
                                      subject or Self that remains unchanged and independent of the
                                      objective field of things and events. There is something that is me
                                      (what I feel as subjectively existing, unchanging and independent),
                                      and something that is not me (that which is experienced apart from
                                      myself). The former is subjective self, the latter is the objective
                                      pole.<br> <br> For example, the view that there is a self in here, in this body,
                                      that remains unchanged even as the body undergoes birth, growing,
                                      ageing, and so on, even death for some (view of eternalism - a soul
                                      remains unchanged and continues into eternity even after death) or
                                      perhaps only in this life (view of annihilation - the self ceases
                                      upon death) constitutes the view of a subjective self or soul. If
                                      you were to lose your hand, you still feel "I am the same old me".
                                      That view that the self remains unchanged pertains to the stance or
                                      position of an existent self.<br> <br> However, exactly how we view subjective self can get more
                                      complicated than that, and this view changes and transforms
                                      accordingly, it differs from person to person, and depends also on
                                      your spiritual practice and experience (if you have one).<br> <br> The view of what Self is can be very coarse or subtle. For most
                                      people, their view of self is not very clear - if you ask them do
                                      you think you exist? They will say 'yeah, of course I do'. If you
                                      ask them, do you feel you exist as a self? They will say 'yes, of
                                      course I FEEL [perceive/project/believe/sense] that I do exist'.
                                      But if you ask them, where you located? They usually cannot answer
                                      you immediately. They may give you vague answers like, well, I'm
                                      here, of course. But if you probe them where is the 'here' they
                                      refer to, they need to think. They aren't sure (unless they have
                                      contemplated about it before). You ask them, are you located in
                                      your hands, your legs, and so on? Doesn't seem like likely
                                      candidates since if you remove your hands or legs, you still feel
                                      like you're there, unchanged - in other words hands and legs are
                                      seen as possessions (mine) rather than self (me). As they try to
                                      pinpoint where the Self is, usually some will point to the center
                                      behind the eyes inside the head, or somewhere in the heart region.
                                      Depending on where they cling to as their seat of the Self, they
                                      will feel some tension, tightness, and contraction to that region
                                      of self.<br> <br> Also, regardless of where you pinpoint your self to be at, there is
                                      always this ongoing sense of alienation from the sensate world at
                                      large, a sense that there is this seer behind the eyes looking
                                      outwards at the world in a distance. This clinging to a subjective
                                      self veils us from having an intimate, non-dual, non-conceptual,
                                      direct, immediate mode of perception of the sensate world as it is.
                                      It keeps "us" in a distance (there will always be a sense of
                                      distance when there is a sense of a separate self).<br> <br> This view of self transforms when you undertake practice of
                                      self-inquiry. At the moment of self-realization, the view of Self
                                      completely undergoes a life-changing shift. There is this
                                      undoubtable insight of what Consciousness IS, what Existence IS,
                                      what Presence IS. And this Consciousness is undoubtably present,
                                      intimate, YOU, closer than your breathe. This undeniable fact of
                                      BEING is taken to be the true self. It has nothing to do with the
                                      body, nothing to do with the world... so the previous views of a
                                      self being inside the body or having to do with a body is
                                      overthrown. Rather, all experiences (including the body and mind)
                                      are seen to be happening TO a background pure
                                      existence-consciousness... and soon (for me in two months) it
                                      becomes the ultimate impersonal container of everything - the
                                      trees, the door, the floor, the birds, the mountains, everything is
                                      not happening outside of me, but is all happening in one universal
                                      space - Consciousness doesn't belong to me any more than it belongs
                                      to the door or the cat's, it is all just One Existence, One Life
                                      expressing itself in every form and being.<br> <br> At this point the view of Self becomes more impersonal - you see
                                      that this entire universe is simply an expression of this
                                      impersonal, universal space, and that this universal source is what
                                      you truly are. So again, the view of Self shifts accordingly to
                                      your progression in insight and experience. Still, the view of Self
                                      is tightly held - coarse in fact, because now you have a very solid
                                      (rather than vague) sense of what You are, in contrast to the
                                      uncertainty of what Self is before Self-Realization.<br> <br> This view can potentially be a hindrance to progress because if you
                                      cling too tightly to the view that this I AM or Beingness (which
                                      actually simply is a manifestation pertaining to the non-conceptual
                                      thought realm) is your truest identity, something most special and
                                      ultimate, you will crave or cling very tightly to it. This will
                                      prevent non-dual from being experienced in other sense doors and
                                      experiences.<br> <br> But if you are able to let go of this clinging, focus on advancing
                                      the I AM in terms of the four aspects and with the right pointers
                                      and contemplation, your practice progresses and you will come to a
                                      point of realization that Awareness/Consciousness/Existence has
                                      never been separated in terms of a subject and an object. This is
                                      the point where dualistic view is removed (as mentioned earlier)
                                      but not the inherent self view yet. All perceptions, experiences,
                                      manifestations, sights and sounds are completely non-dual with
                                      Consciousness. In other words, they are not happening TO or IN
                                      Consciousness, but AS Consciousness. Consciousness is itself taking
                                      shape and experiencing itself as the mountains, the rivers,
                                      everything IS Consciousness in expression, everything is
                                      Consciousness, All is Mind. At this point, the view of Self shifts
                                      again - now it is no longer a Subjective Witness, the sense of a
                                      subjective Witness completely dissolves... into One Mind, an
                                      indivisible/undivided field of Consciousness expressing itself as
                                      everything. The view of Self at this point takes this One Mind,
                                      this undivided One Naked Awareness to be the Self. Even though it
                                      is indivisible from everything, expresses itself in everything,
                                      nevertheless this One Awareness is unchanging and truly existing.
                                      Non-duality at this point is understood not as no duality (in which
                                      case there is absolutely no Subject, not even an unchanging
                                      Awareness), but as the inseparability of subject and object, a
                                      collapsing of dualities into Oneness. As an analogy, Awareness is
                                      seen to be an unchanging mirror, which nevertheless cannot be
                                      separated or divided from the contents in the mirror - Awareness
                                      and the contents of Awareness are completely One - there is only
                                      One seamless field of experiencing - the One Naked Awareness. Even
                                      though seamless, even though not seen as anything personal or
                                      separate, Awareness is still seen as an unchanging Subjective Self
                                      manifesting itself as the field of experience. So this seamless One
                                      is now deemed as the Self.<br> <br> When we come to the realization of Anatta, the last vestige of
                                      (Subjective) Self-View collapses, resulting in what Buddha calls
                                      Stream-Entry and the eradication of self-view (sakkayaditthi). At
                                      this point, NOTHING at all - not even Consciousness can be deemed
                                      as a Self. And how is this so? By seeing Awareness, deemed as Self,
                                      as also not-self, in the manner of 'in seeing always just the
                                      seen', 'seeing is just the experience of sight' - not I, not me,
                                      not mine, only a selfless process of self-luminous activities
                                      without agency. You know self-view has been overthrown when there
                                      is through experiential knowledge and vision that there is no self
                                      to be found inside or apart from the process of five aggregation.
                                      There is simply no You in reference to what is seen and experienced
                                      in any manner (to, in, etc) - in seeing just the seen. At this
                                      point you see as the suttas state, that the aggregation cannot be
                                      said to be happening TO a self, IN a self, nor can it be deemed a
                                      self exists IN the aggregates (like a soul located inside the
                                      body). As the Buddha explains, "But, lady, how does self-identity
                                      not come about?"<br> <br> "There is the case where a well-instructed disciple of the noble
                                      ones — who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed &amp;
                                      disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for men of integrity,
                                      is well-versed &amp; disciplined in their Dhamma — does not assume
                                      form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in
                                      the self, or the self as in form." in Udana Sutta, and in Bahiya
                                      Sutta he says "When for you there will be only the seen in
                                      reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard,
                                      only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in
                                      reference to the cognized, then, Bahiya, there is no you in terms
                                      of that. When there is no you in terms of that, there is no you
                                      there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder
                                      nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress."<br> <br> Once the Subjective Self-View has been dissolved through anatta
                                      realization, the view of objective existence still occurs. Even
                                      though there is no view or sense that there is a seer seeing the
                                      red flower - only the experience of the red flower, nevertheless
                                      the view of objective existence is that the sensate world we
                                      experience actually references an objectively existing world, such
                                      that if I close my eye, the red flower I previously saw is actually
                                      still truly existing out there in a substantial manner. Perhaps,
                                      for more intellectual people, they can adopt a more agnostic kind
                                      of view with regards to the world - perhaps it is real, perhaps it
                                      is unreal, but whether the world truly exists out there however
                                      cannot be known by me. Or perhaps, they can even adopt the view of
                                      emptiness (through inference and study on emptiness teachings), yet
                                      without true experiential realization, the view of objective
                                      existence cannot be dissolved... just as even if you adopt the view
                                      of anatta through inference (through analogies such as the
                                      Chandrakirti's sevenfold reasoning), nonetheless as I said earlier,
                                      with this inferred understanding you will still experience clinging
                                      to the sense of self, a sense of contraction and alienation despite
                                      the intellectual acceptance of the doctrine, until you have
                                      resolved this matter through direct experiential insight.<br> <br> However, to get a sense of how this view of objective existence is
                                      actually untenable, with the example of the red flower I said
                                      earlier as an example (that whether I close my eyes, the red flower
                                      truly exists out there), consider this: If we were to observe a red
                                      flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front us, the “redness”
                                      only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in actuality not so.
                                      Vision of red does not arise in all animal species (dogs cannot
                                      perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an inherent attribute of the
                                      mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the atomic
                                      structure, there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere
                                      found, only almost complete space/void with no perceivable shapes
                                      and forms. Whatever appearances are dependently arisen, and hence
                                      is empty of any inherent existence or fixed attributes, shapes,
                                      form, or “redness” -- merely luminous yet empty, mere appearances
                                      without inherent/objective existence.<br> <br> When realization is experientially realized, the entire sensate
                                      world, including all thoughts, are seen to be completely empty of
                                      any inherent objective existence. You can no longer believe or view
                                      objects as having an independent core or substance out there. There
                                      is simply no way of clinging at sensate world in terms of 'the
                                      flower exists in this way' - there is no more clinging to objects
                                      and characteristics or objects as possessing certain
                                      characteristics, no longer false views about being able to locate
                                      or pin down an actuality of objects, no more grasping them as truly
                                      existent. Everything appears as completely illusory yet vividly
                                      appearing, having a magical quality (literally 'appearing like
                                      magic') to them.</p>

                  whom, the mind is at play and the meditation that is practised is
                  to most likely reach/attain a goal. Any goal, any craving, any
                  desire does not emanate from one’s being (presence or present) but
                  from dipping into the past aka knwoledge, books, someone, sutras,
                  texts and …. it cannot be from the present or presence of the
                  moment. If one maintains this stance of practising without the (#)
                  one is alreadly futurizing and one may reach/attain to that desired
                  goal or … cos it is herenow; the practice is to get something that
                  is not already here.</p>
              <pre>However, when the (# )  is there, the mind is challenged to find out who is actually meditatiing? When one introspects one would realise that sth is absent and one is striving to attain what is absent - stemming from this one denies the presence of what is already present. Antything that is gained ffrom such a practice is temporal, it wont stay, cos its nature is not of eternity!<br>
                  However, the questioning of who is the meditator and what is the purpose of meditation may elicit ''answers'', which is only possible on introspection.

              <p>Realization is never a discovery but a a recognising and of
                  course, one has to dig the well of one’s being and the removing of
                  all concepts, traditions, isms and the not so palatable
                  emotions,feelings or … is bound to surface. All that is needed is
                  this: earnestness and longing to recognise<br> Expereince that is psycholoigcal and having some social relevance
                  is not a reality, existential experience is reality. Of course, the
                  latter cannot be conceptualized cos one’s perceiving is always
                  relative to one’s conditioning, beleigfs and ….</p>

              <p>As Dungse Rinpoche says ,</p>
              <p><strong>As long as there is attachment, there is experience. All practice has the intention of increasing new experiences in order to release us from former experiences until we are released from all experiences to the natural quality of enlightenment</strong></p>
              <p>We do not know whether our present state is an experience tinged with attachment or not.  Basically, if one is liberated, why is there a need to hold on to a 'present/now'?  If we need to maintain a state, then it is not the primordially liberated Buddha nature which is free from any slightest fabrication / holding.  If we need to maintain something, it means we can lose it. If we can lose it, then it is not realisation.  It is not freedom.</p>

              I m not going to agree or disagree cos to do that is to reduce it into conceptualising. When anything that is ''subjectivity'' is objectified - one has already concluded one should be the end. The moment one makes a  conclusion, as to what should be at the other ''end'' it is reduced to a vested interest,
              If one is truly a seeker of what is true, it wont hide for much too long cos this body and mind happened emanated from what is ''true''.

              <p>truth or untruth is in itself a conceptualisation.</p>
              <p>what if there is no such thing as truth?  And what if what you are considering 'true' now is another subtle conceptualisation by you?</p>

              Yes, certainly, what is rite now can become a wrong the next instant. What is true now may become untrue. Hence I uttered what is true, not truth - what is true - is a continuous tense, eg My being rude can end , my being polite can end. However when I labelled at as stupid, clever or smart - it is already no longer flowing it is a finished product of sorts!
              Hence, this word ''being'' may appear like another concept - on closer srutiny it is akin to a river flowing (rivering). it is existential and always moving and yet not moving (it is a paradoxical phenomenon). The mind is a pond, being is a river (rivering). Hence I say, when one is present to one's ''self''' (fictional) one is absent to one's being!
