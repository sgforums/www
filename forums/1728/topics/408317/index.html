              <h1><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Excerpt from "The Sutra of Making Buddha Images" ä½›èªªé€ åƒ�åº¦é‡�ç¶“</span></span></h1>
              <div>"... People who make Buddha images, will possess bright eyes and elegant looks in their after lives; their physical bodies, arms and feet are well-proportioned. Even if they are born as devas, with radiant eyes and countenance, their immaculateness outshines other gods of any realms. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>Any places in which people who make Buddha images are born will be void of any evilness. Their physiques are flawless. When they pass away, they will be born in the realms of bliss. Their appearance is exceptionally graceful that all devas will honor them. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>People who make Buddha images will be born and reborned to dignified families that excel any other families existent on earth; never will they be born to underprivileged families. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>People who make Buddha images in their after lives will be golden color in their physiques and be peerlessly refined.<br><br>People who make Buddha images will be born in their after lives to affluent families, with wealth, wisdom, and precious jewels in abundance beyond measure. They will also be cherished by their parents, siblings, and other relatives. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>When people who make Buddha images are born in <span id="lw_1281984175_0" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #366388 2px dotted; cursor: hand;">Jambudvipa</span>, they will be born either in the <span id="lw_1281984175_1" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #366388 2px dotted; cursor: hand;">royal families</span> or benevolent families. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>People who make Buddha images will be born in their subsequent lives as the most noted and the most revered emperors among other monarchs. They are also worshipped as the patrons of all the other emperors. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>People who make Buddha images will be born in their after lives as Dharma-turning kings who are able to ascend and travel across deva realms and return at will. There is nothing beyond their capabilities. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>People who make Buddha images will be born in their after lives in the seventh blissful realm with a lifespan of one kalpa. Their wisdom is infinite and after they pass away, they won't be born in any lower realms. While alive, they constantly watch their deeds, think of <span id="lw_1281984175_2" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #366388 2px dotted; cursor: hand;">Buddhas</span> in pursuit of the Enlightenment. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>People who make Buddha images will in their after lives repeatedly venerate Buddhas and revere the wonderful Dharma. They continually make offerings to <span id="lw_1281984175_3" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #366388 2px dotted; cursor: hand;">Buddha</span>'s relics by presenting assorted silk cloths, exquisite incenses, splendid flowers, oil-lit lights, and other precious jewels as well as other rarest treasures of the world. After innumerable kalpas, they will attain Full Nirvana. Those people who aspire to dedicate precious properties to Buddhas are not ordinary beings but were true Buddhist practitioners in previous lives. Indeed such a fortune is attained by those who make Buddha images.<br><br>The virtues gained in the after lives by people who make Buddha images are immeasurable. There is not enough time to delineate its magnitude. If the total volume of all rivers and oceans of the <a class="yiv591666808tooltip" rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #000000;">four great continents</span></a> is gauged, the virtues of making Buddha images outweigh the volume tenfold. Wherever these people are born, in their after lives they will always be respected and protected by others.<br><br>As if during a rainstorm, the people who make Buddha images have reliable lodgings that they need not fear anything. These people never ever fall into the lower realms—be it hell, animals or hungry ghosts realms—after their ensuing deaths. If there are people who hold both of their palms together devotedly in front of Buddha images and take refuge in Buddha stupas or Buddhas' relics, after their time is done, for one hundred kalpas, they will neither enter the lower realms of hells, animals, nor hungry ghosts, but instead will be born in the heavenly realms of the devas. Once their life spans are used up, they will descend to this world as the children of prosperous families. Their possessions of precious jewels and treasures are incalculable. Eventually they are bound to attain the Buddhahood.<br><br><br>With Metta,<br>Goh<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Notes:</strong></span></span> <br>*According to <span id="lw_1281984175_4" class="yshortcuts" style="border-bottom: #366388 2px dotted; cursor: hand;">Buddhist cosmology</span>, Jambudvipa is the southern continent (which is the world we are staying now) of the four continents that surround Mount Meru.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>*One world is composed of one Mount Meru, one sun, one moon, four great continents and the various <span id="lw_1281984175_5" class="yshortcuts">seas and oceans</span> that surround them. One-thousand such worlds form a small thousand-world system. One thousand small thousand-world systems form a medium thousand-world system. One thousand medium thousand-world systems form a great thousand-world system. This set of worlds is usually referred as THREE-THOUSAND GREAT-THOUSAND-WORLD SYSTEMS. The four great continents are ruled by four direction kings who live halfway up Mount Meru.</div>
