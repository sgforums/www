              <div class="post-bodycopy clearfix">
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>Zen: Emptiness, Interdependence, and the True Nature of Skillful Means</strong></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">For a variety of reasons, traditional 
              and scholarly accounts have tended to portray the “skillful means” 
              (upaya) of Zen one-sidedly – that is as mere provisional devices, 
              temporary expedients necessary only for guiding novices to the “real” 
              goal that is <em>more significant than</em> and <em>distinct from</em> the means employed. Meanwhile, the <em>intrinsic</em>, <em>enduring</em> aspect of skillful means has been largely neglected.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Here, then, let us consider this 
              “intrinsic, enduring aspect” of skillful means, beginning with a passage
               from the Zen masterpiece <em>Shobogenzo</em> where this essential 
              nature of skillful means is identified by Dogen as the “fruits of 
              Buddhahood” and “form of the world,” and not “some momentary skill.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A Buddha’s discourse is beyond 
              the sentient and the non-sentient; it is beyond the relative and the 
              absolute. Even so, when He became aware of bodhisattvas, of ordinary 
              humans, of the Real Form of things, and of this discourse, He opened the
               Gate of Skillful Means. The Gate of Skillful Means is the unsurpassed 
              meritorious functioning of the fruits of Buddhahood. It is the Dharma 
              that resides in the place of Dharma and It is the form of the world as 
              it constantly manifests. The Gate of Skillful Means does not refer to 
              some momentary skill.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Shobogenzo, Shoh? Jiss?,</em></strong><strong> Hubert Nearman</strong><strong></strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The nondual, interdependent, essential 
              nature of skillful means illumined here by Dogen has been vastly 
              overshadowed by the partial, instrumentalist, analogical aspect 
              “skillful means” – which is commonly discussed by contemporary teachers 
              in terms of the traditional analogy of using a raft; upon reaching the 
              other shore (the end), the raft (the means) is discarded, or the 
              favorite Zen analogy of a finger pointing to the moon; the finger 
              likened to means, the moon to ends.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This overemphasis of the “analogical” 
              (theoretical) and near total neglect of the “nondual” (true nature) has 
              resulted in the skillful means of Zen to be widely misunderstood as <em>only</em> means, <em>separate from</em> and <em>nonessential to</em> ends, which are alone regarded as possessing intrinsic value. 
              Fortunately, the classic Zen records, as well as some Zen scholars, 
              notably Hee-Jin Kim, have underscored the folly of identifying the Zen 
              view with such a superficial notion.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dogen’s assertion that a Buddha’s discourse is <em>“</em><em>beyond the relative and the absolute”</em> and “real form” (i.e. a dharma) clearly reveals that any attempt to divide Buddhist expressions into means <em>and</em> ends would be violation of the Buddhist principle of nonduality. If a 
              Buddha’s discourse is “beyond relative and absolute” its means and ends 
              must be coessential and coextensive – not “momentary skills” but 
              instance of Buddha-nature eternally abiding in/as dharma-positions – 
              residing “in their place of Dharma” that “is the form of the world as it
               constantly manifests” in/as the here-and-now (existence-time; uji).</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">That “expressions of Buddhas” are the “<em>Dharma that resides in</em> the place of Dharma”, <em>and</em> the “<em>form</em> of the world as it constantly manifests” means the<em> truth</em> or <em>reality</em> of Zen and the <em>form</em> or <em>appearance</em> of Zen are nondual. This not only establishes that the <em>essence</em> of Buddhism and the <em>form</em> of Buddhism reside in/as a common location, it discloses the 
              whereabouts of that location; the “world as it constantly manifests” – 
              thus revealing its immediate <em>accessibility</em>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To truly appreciate the implications of 
              Zen expressions as form/essence unities we need to understand the basic 
              principles of nonduality revealed by the Buddhist teachings on emptiness
               and interdependence. Zen regards emptiness (<em>shunyata</em>) as the “true nature” or “essence” of <em>all</em> dharmas – without exception. The well known formulation of this axiom states, “Form is emptiness, emptiness is form.”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“Form,” here, is short for <em>all</em> five skandhas (constituents of the body-mind, the other four are; 
              feeling, perception, mental formulation, and consciousness) – in fact, 
              “form” here is short for <em>all</em><em> dharmas</em>.  </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The “emptiness” of dharmas means that dharmas are without “selfhood” (i.e. dharmas are empty of an <em>independent self</em>). To put it another way, there are no such things (dharmas) as independent entities – all dharmas are <em>interdependent</em>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The Buddhist teachings on 
              interdependence reveal and account for the truth that the existence 
              (ontology) of each and all particular dharmas is <em>dependent on</em> the existence of all dharmas <em>other than</em> themselves. For example, the existence of a particular flower <em>depends</em> on the existence of the sun, of the earth, of water, time, seeds, 
              oxygen, bacteria, etc. In this sense, then, a flower is not the 
              manifestation of a particular <em>independent entity</em>; a particular flower is an <em>interdependent</em> manifestation <em>of</em> sun-earth-water-time-seeds-oxygen-bacteria-etc.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">A more comprehensive account of 
              interdependence would show that the various dharmas on which a flower is
               dependent go beyond the obvious ones listed (e.g. sun, earth, water, 
              etc.) to be inclusive of the subjective experience of sentient beings, 
              and finally <em>every dharma</em> throughout space and time, except for one – itself (its <em>self</em>).</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Because a flower is “empty” of selfhood (independent existence), all the myriad dharmas of the universe are able to manifest – <em>as that particular flower</em>.
               A particular flower is a particular experience of the sun, earth, time,
               and so on up to all dharmas throughout space and time – except for that
               particular flower – for a particular flower (like every particular 
              dharma) is a manifestation of all the myriad dharmas; all dharmas are 
              its “ingredients,” and a flower does not contain it-self as a an 
              “ingredient” of it-self any more than “chocolate cake” is an ingredient 
              of chocolate cake. In sum, each and all dharmas are interdependent, 
              meaning each dharma depends on every dharma other than itself, and is 
              depended on by every dharma other than itself.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, the true nature of the nondual 
              existence of all things, beings, and events is accounted for in Buddhism
               by the teachings of emptiness and interdependence. And, in truth the 
              teachings of emptiness and interdependence reveal the same truth, only 
              from two different perspectives. The one significant implication of that
               truth we are concerned with here is that the doctrines of 
              interdependence and emptiness do not <em>deny</em> the reality of the <em>existence</em> of dharmas, as is too often suggested by superficial interpretations, but rather these doctrines <em>affirm</em> (and account for) the <em>real existence</em> or “true nature” of dharmas.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Here then, is a summary of the primary points; “form is emptiness” means the <em>true nature</em> of forms (dharmas) is their <em>emptiness</em> (of an independent self); the <em>reality</em> of a form is its <em>lack of independence</em>. “Emptiness is form” means the <em>true nature</em> of emptiness is its <em>appearance as form</em>. The significance of this is that the “outward form” of a thing (<em>dharma</em>) and the “essential nature” of that thing (i.e. its “ingredients”; the myriad dharmas) are a <em>unity</em>. Thus, a “form” and its “emptiness” are <em>coessential</em>; neither exists in the absence of the other – both exist in the presence of either.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The true nature of Zen expressions (sutras, koans, teachings, etc.)?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Nowhere else but in their phenomenal forms (sutras, koans, teachings, etc.).</p>
