              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt; line-height: 107%;">D. T. Suzuki &amp; the Dawn of Zen in the West</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">October 18, 2017 James Ford Patheos</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Teitaro Suzuki was born on this day, the 18th of October, in
              1870 in Kanazawa, in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. He was born into a Samurai
              family, his father, like his father, and then his father before, was a
              physician. Suzuki’s father’s death when he was a child plunged the family into
              poverty. The questions that rise out of seeing the vagaries of life drove him
              into a deep spiritual quest. While he was raised in the Jodo Shinshu tradition
              he began to look beyond that tradition, reading and speaking with people,
              particularly drawn to Christianity and eventually to Zen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Young Teitaro was not able to afford to enter university, so
              after High School he became a school teacher. A few years later with the help
              of an older brother, he entered the University of Tokyo studying classical
              Buddhist languages while at the same time beginning to sit at Engakuji Rinzai
              Zen temple. He became the student of the master there, Imakita Kosen, under
              whom he had his first experiences of kensho. He also received his Buddhist
              name, Daisetsu, which means “great humility.” Although in later years he would
              say it actually meant “great clumsy.” When Kosen Roshi died Suzuki continued
              with the rosh’s principal heir, Soen Shaku.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Later, when Soyen Shaku, Kosen Roshi’s successor as the
              master of Engakuji was in America for the World Parliament of Religions he
              became friends with the publisher and scholar Paul Carus. Carus asked the roshi
              if he would stay and help him with translating and publishing Zen Buddhist
              texts into English. Soen Roshi declined, but recommended his lay student Daisetsu
              Teitaro Suzuki.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With that Suzuki moved to Illinois and into the Carus
              household. There he assisted in translating the Tao Te Ching, not a Buddhist
              text, but important. And then began work on what would become Outlines of
              Mahayana Buddhism. There Suzuki also met, fell in love with, and married
              Beatrice Erskine Lane.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The couple returned to Japan where Suzuki took up a
              professorship at Otani University. At that time he also met Shinichi Hisamatsu
              and became connected, although never formally with the Kyoto School of Buddhist
              philosophers. Suzuki would teach in Japan and the united States for the rest of
              his life, and for a number of years later in his career as a visiting professor
              at Columbia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">D. T. Suzuki, as he was best known, would travel widely,
              lecturing across North America and Europe. And most importantly, perhaps, he
              wrote. Eventually, over a hundred books. Much of these efforts focused on Zen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">His circle of influence included the Catholic monk, peace
              activist and mystic, Thomas Merton, psychologists like Eric Fromm, Karen
              Horney, and most notably Carl Jung, musicians like John Cage, poets like Gary
              Snyder and Alan Ginsberg, and, perhaps most importantly Alan Watts. Watts own
              books on Zen were essentially popularizations of Suzuki’s work. And they were
              very popular. Through them if washed through</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Watts’ idiosyncratic, Suzuki’s Zen perspectives reached the
              general educated English speaking readership like an atomic bomb.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">There are many reasons to criticize D. T. Suzuki, some of
              them even deserved. In the run up to the Second World War and through it,
              Suzuki clearly supported Japanese imperialism and more troubling he seemed to
              endorse anti-semetism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And, even as Watts’ Zen was idiosyncratic, less so, but also
              so was Suzuki’s. As far as Zen is concerned he presented a not fully
              historical, but rather a romanticized version of the Zen dharma that subsequent
              scholars and teachers have had to work with, against, and around. On the other
              hand his resonances with Idealism, German and English Romanticism and particularly
              American Transcendentalism probably made Zen accessible in ways that would
              otherwise not be so. Suzuki can probably best be categorized as a modernist
              Buddhist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">These criticisms noted, his scholarship was impeccable, and
              his contributions remain solid.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And, to put it baldly, if there were no D. T. Suzuki, Zen in
              the West even vaguely as we experience it, would not exist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">It is said that D. T. Suzuki’s last words were “Don’t worry.
              Thank you! Thank you!”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Yes. Thank you! Endless bows.</span></p>
