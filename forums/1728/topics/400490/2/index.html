              <p>Many people argue against the existence of Creator
                                                  because many tend to think of Earth as the most
                                                  important planet in the Universe and humans as the all-supreme

                                                  of Earth's existence.</p>
              <p>Anyway, for folks wanting to know more, just know that while
                                                  Earth was created by Creator, humans were not created by Him, but
                                                  by very highly evolved beings. For folks who don't believe this,
                                                  just treat what I said as a story. :)</p>

              <p>For anything to be separated from another thing, there must be a medium for the separation to occur. From the perception of senses, that medium will be space, giving rise to distance and location. So, is the Creator a Being in space? If it is, then space will be the source of this Creator for the latter will not be able to exist without space. This is not a question with an absolute answer but is to allow for the perception of the 
                  world to be deeply inquired.</p>
              <p>Buddhism's approach is in circumventing the pitfalls associated with conceptual/mental understanding. This is extremely ingenius because it takes into account the effect of referential concept/mental thinking on the direct experience of Truth.</p>

              <p>Though I often talk about existence of Creator/Source, I've also often highlighted that we're all One, and not totally separate from Creator/Source, which is not a physical being, but the 'ultimate consciousness of All That Is'. The word "God" is just a man-made term for the 'ultimate-consciousness' that the Universe is part of. So effectively, there's no separation of any being or thing, even though physically, we appear to be distinct entities.</p>
              <p>But the biggest problem for our world is that people get too attached to their respective groups of faith and religion, and see themselves as totally separate (and worst still, superior to everyone else) from other beings.</p>
              <p>The only reason why I posted in this thread is that the feeling/behaviour of 'my faith, supreme; all other faiths, rubbish' seems to be growing. I'm very sure Buddha never intended it to be so.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Buddhism distinguishes two different aspects as it relates to dependant origination and independent origination. We can discuss these ideas by perhaps examining the difference between relative/conventional truth and ultimate/absolute truth, and the very mechanisms of cause and effect and that of interdependency (dependant origination).</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a certain point of view, that of relative/conventional truth, the laws of cause and effect are inescapable. But if one were to look at things from the point of view of ultimate/absolute truth or even discursive logic, the laws of cause and effect couldn’t operate with entities that had any permanent and solid existence (independently originating/existing). There are no cause and effect relationships between truly existing entities, but there are such relationships between transitory phenomena. Some call them structural relationships, such as Einstein and Kant, however in Buddhism the term is often referred to as relationships of interdependence (dependant origination) – ‘This exists because that is so and so on, and this is produced on the basis of that and so on.’ Again nothing exists by itself, independent of other phenomena. As such, each of the elements of the chain of cause and effect is itself an aggregate of fleeting elements in perpetual flux.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When one dissects the process of cause and effect from the point of view of ultimate/absolute truth, you can only conclude that it is a process that cannot link entities that have any sort of true, independent existence. Either the cause disappears before the effect appears, in which case the cause, as something which no longer exists, couldn’t possibly have any relationship with the effect; or the cause is still present at the moment the effect appears, in which case it cannot be the cause of the effect, because there cannot be a cause and effect relationship between two things that exist simultaneously.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The phenomenal world, as we perceive it, belongs to relative/conventional truth, which is governed entirely by the laws of cause and effect and thusly interdependence. The ultimate nature of things, transcending any concept of being or non-being, appearance or cessation, movement or non-movement, one or many, belongs to ultimate/absolute truth. Ultimate/absolute truth is therefore the realization of emptiness (not to be confused with nothingness), of enlightenment, of non-duality, which can only be understood by contemplative experience and not by analytical thought…</span></span></p>

It doesn’t deny the reality of phenomena in the relative world of perception, but it does deny that there are any permanent, autonomous entities existing behind phenomena. That is why we speak of a ‘middle path’ that falls neither into nihilism, for which nothing exists outside our perception and everything is nothingness, nor into ‘eternalism’ for which there is a unique reality that exists independently of any perception and is composed of entities that exist by themselves.</span></span></p>

              <p>so long as we are still 'unenlightened', the trappings of dualistic views will continue to have a strong grip.</p>
              <p>groupthink can manifest in all organizations, very salient in religious groups.</p>
              <p>as Buddhists, i feel it is important to remember that the teachings are a raft to cross the stream. faith is important, so is a discerning mind.</p>
              <p>whatever practices one adopt, there can only be one truth, and this truth is non religious.</p>
