Debates on this subject actually took place with the holders of the main Hindu philosophies, of which there were many, several centuries before and after Christ. The debates centered, in general terms, on the Hindu premise (and relatively common religious postulation) of a permanent Creator entity, all-powerful and sufficient in itself, without any cause preceding it, creating as a voluntary act.

Can a Creator be a permanent entity? No, because after creating he is different from how he was before he created. He has become ‘he who created’. Furthermore if he creates the whole universe that necessarily implies that all the causes of the universe must be present within him. Now, one of the principles of the law of cause and effect, or karma, is that an event cannot take place as long as all the causes and conditions for its arising are not assembled, and that it cannot not take place once they are.

              <p>Many people argue against the existence of Creator because many tend to think of Earth as the most important planet in the Universe and humans as the all-supreme species of beings, and don't fully understand the real purpose of Earth's existence.</p>
              <p>Anyway, for folks wanting to know more, just know that while Earth was created by Creator, humans were not created by Him, but by very highly evolved beings. For folks who don't believe this, just treat what I said as a story. :)</p>

              <p><br>Just for curious people out there: you may like to find out more about why it was recorded by man that Buddha said that at that time. Same thing I would say to more curious Christians: they may like to find out more about why it was recorded by man that Jesus' last words were that God abandoned him at the cross. :)</p>
