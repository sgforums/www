            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by marcteng:</div><div class="quote_body">Is there anyway to prevent ghost from possessing you?<br><br>how come ghost can possess a human body and not vice versa?</div></blockquote>Ghost is a formless consciousness yet taking a non physical shape according to their desires and attachment and manifesting according to their karma, that is invisible to our naked eyes. It's impossible for our consciousness to 'possess' these non physical shapes, whereas it is relatively easier for a consciousness to take up the shape of physical things. Therefore we have Tree Spirits, and other kind of spirits that inhabit physical things. It is not that the tree have consciousness, the tree originally have no consciousness in itself but consciousness takes up the shape of the form, become attached to the form. When my master stayed at my dharma teacher's house for lodging, he told my dharma teacher to immediately take down.. I think it was some kind of animal head hanging on the wall or something. Something taken from an animal. It was only years later that she realised that a spirit had inhabited in that form.<br><br>Is there any way to prevent possession? There are many ways.. usually a person is possessed because there is little 'brightness' in him. In such cases as I mentioned before, chanting buddha and bodhisattva names will be advisable as this will increase one's mental 'brightness'. Spirits will not harm such a person.<br><br>The most assured and important way is to practise the dharma. Through correct practise, we can completely block off the possibility of spirit possession.<br><br>I have posted before, based on Thusness's advise to a forummer who had met with a problem regarding forced mediumship (he has solved the problem) in which he could be under threat of possession at any time.<br><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=198043" rel="nofollow">Need help !!! Urgent !!! True case !!!</a><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Have you practised concentration without proper guidance especially in focusing between the eyebrow? Cos this can open up the channel for medium.<br><br>I am told by a friend.. thusness, that <span style="font-style: italic;">There are several reasons, it can arise due to karmic affinity, it can arise due to karmic debt, it can arise due to wrong practices.  If he practice concentration without proper guide especially focusing in between the eyebrown, it might open up the channel for medium.  Without proper guidance, this could happen.</span><br><br>If it is due to karmic affinity and karmic debt, then i think it is easier to solve as the experience negotiator can do something about it.  But if one practices wrongly, that level stays and is open...this can be quite troublesome.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes thats right. Often this needs to be done.. if you want to overcome yourself without such help with negotiators, then you must be prepared to suffer many years, it can take years and depending on your practice... no doctors can help. We must start practising the dharma diligently ourselves to overcome such situations. If you practice no-self and is able to experience presence in the correct way, it does not affect you. Because there will be no entry point. When we are constantly authenticated by Presence and there is no entry for that trance level to take place.  That level of consciousness does not exist.  No external forces can forcefully create that communication unless it is open due to some reason.  Due to lack of proper practices.<br><br>Thats wat i learnt from thusness.</div></blockquote></div>
