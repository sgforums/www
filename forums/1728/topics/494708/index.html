              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">MICHAEL JERRYSON| AUGUST
              23, 2015 Lion’s Roar</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Michael
              Jerryson reports on the growing tension between Buddhists and Muslims in South
              and Southeast Asia, where senior Buddhist monks are actively inciting violence
              and intolerance despite outcries from the international community.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Recent
              developments in Burma have brought the world’s attention to the ongoing
              conflicts between Buddhists and Muslims in South and Southeast Asia. But while
              the media may present the Buddhist–Muslim conflicts in Sri Lanka, southern
              Thailand, and Burma as fundamentally the same at their core, they are not. Far
              from this, these three conflicts stem from specific regional issues and
              politics. Furthermore, each conflict emerges out of an important historical
              context. However, through globalization, these conflicts are beginning to
              overlap.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sri Lanka: Emerging from Civil War</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sri
              Lanka is currently recovering from a twenty-six-year civil war (1983–2009)
              between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
              (LTTE). While the civil war was principally over the LTTE’s desire for
              independence, it came to be infused with religious symbolism and importance
              since the vast majority of LTTE members were Tamil Hindus, and the Sri Lankan
              government and its military were—and still are—predominantly composed of
              Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Throughout
              the civil war, Buddhists and Buddhist monks pressed the state to take a stronger
              and more aggressive stance. One of the earliest examples of this came from the
              Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People’s Liberation Front), which in the 1980s
              counted Buddhist monks among its ranks. In addition to applying political
              pressure, their members were known to threaten political figures and engage in
              assassination attempts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              militant views on the civil war were quite pervasive. The well-known Sri Lankan
              monk–scholar Walpola Rahula, who taught for many years at Northwestern
              University, exemplified the Buddhist nationalist perspective on the war when he
              declared, “the sangha is ready to lay down their lives” to prevent the
              government from negotiating with the Tamil insurgents. For these Sri Lankans,
              their country supports the oldest surviving Theravada Buddhist tradition. A
              division of its land is a division of its Buddhist foundation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              1997, Venerable Piyadassi Maha Thera explained to the Buddhist scholar Tessa
              Bartholomeusz, “You have to defend yourself. These are difficult questions. If
              someone goes to kill my mother, I’m going to stop him. So this could be a
              condition in which I am forced to kill.” For Piyadassi, “mother” clearly points
              to the motherland of Theravada Buddhism: Sri Lanka. His choice of hypothetical
              was designed to persuade people to side with his Buddhist nationalist vision.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During
              the civil war, another Buddhist nationalist group developed that was even more
              conservative than the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna. In 2004, Buddhist monks formed
              the Jathika Hela Urumaya (National Heritage Party) and called on the government
              to eliminate the LTTE. Whether the government listened to the Jathika Hela
              Urumaya or not is unclear, but their brutal military actions indicate that they
              were not adverse to this suggestion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Shortly
              after the civil war, two Buddhist monks broke off from the Jathika Hela Urumaya
              and formed a new organization called the Bodu Bala Sena (Buddhist Power Force).
              Within a year, the Bodu Bala Sena had focused on a new nationalist threat:
              Muslims. When I interviewed the founders of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) in the
              summer of 2014, it had been only two weeks since cofounder Gnanasara Thero had
              delivered an emotional speech that triggered Buddhist riots and attacks on
              Muslims in the coastal town of Aluthgama. Gnanasara Thero’s colleague, Dilanthe
              Withanage, explained the BBS’s view of the Buddhist–Muslim tensions:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              [Sinhala Buddhists] have two major political parties and [thus the] Sinhalese
              are divided. As a result, Muslims always join with one party and then [get to]
              join in governing the country. Muslims always do that—they get the advantage of
              being a minority…. We want the Sinhalese united and a Sinhalese government. We
              want protection; we [have protected] Theravada Buddhism for the last 2,300
              years. Today, Theravada Buddhism is in the West and in Sri Lanka. But this will
              not last.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              Withanage and other members of the BBS, although the Sinhala Buddhists may
              enjoy a 69 percent majority compared to the 8 percent Muslim minority, Sri
              Lankan Buddhism is a global minority. They see Islamic countries as helping out
              Muslims worldwide, and Western countries as coming to the aid of Christians.
              Who, they ask, is helping Sri Lankan Buddhists? For this reason, the BBS
              considers its efforts to defend the buddhadharma necessary to its very
              survival.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thailand: The Legacy of Warring Kingdoms</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              Sri Lanka’s Buddhist–Muslim tensions emerged out of an extended nationalist
              agenda and a civil war, Buddhist–Muslim relations in Thailand have a much
              longer and more focused history. The region of the three southernmost provinces
              was once part of a Buddhist kingdom called Langkasuka, during an historical
              period many southern Buddhists reflect on with pride. However, it later became
              the Islamic kingdom of Patani. Southern Thailand’s current demographic reflects
              this diverse past; while the country is over 90 percent Thai Buddhist, the
              three southernmost provinces are more than 85 percent Malay Muslim. Over the
              centuries, Malay Muslims have struggled to regain their political autonomy from
              Thailand. Whenever the central government was weak, southern Thai resistance
              flared. Since January 2004, the region has been under martial law. Violence is
              pervasive in the region; people live in constant fear.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Thai government has militarized Buddhist temples, authorized clandestine
              military monks, and enforced brutal counterinsurgent directives and
              interrogation techniques, oftentimes on Buddhist temple grounds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is within this context that the current conflict resides. Over the last eleven
              years, the central Thai government has undergone several military coups.
              Concurrent with this weakened central government, Thai Malay Muslims have waged
              a grassroots resistance. As early as the 1960s, groups such as the Pattani
              United Liberation Organization (PULO) and Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN)
              engaged in armed resistance and then attempted to negotiate with the Thai
              government. These organizations opposed the policy of requiring Muslims to bow
              to Buddhist statues, take Thai surnames, and abandon their Malay heritage and
              language of Bahasa Melayu. The Malay Muslim organizations called for changes to
              these regional policies and for limited autonomy. While the Thai government
              capitulated with some of their requests, the changes did not last long. Malay
              Muslim ambassadors who sought to negotiate with the Thai government, such as
              the religious leader and scholar Hajji Sulong, went missing and later were
              found dead. It is through these experiences that the Malay Muslim community
              developed a deep distrust of the Thai government and its promise of
              negotiations, a perspective shared by Thailand’s southern neighboring country
              Malaysia, which had tried to broker peace negotiations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              violence broke out in 2004, no attempts were made to negotiate with the Thai
              government. Thousands have died in sporadic bombings, random shootings, and
              public beheadings by insurgents, yet during the last eleven years, no group has
              claimed responsibility for the violence or issued political requests. In
              response, the Thai government has militarized Buddhist temples, authorized
              clandestine military monks, and enforced brutal counterinsurgent directives and
              interrogation techniques (oftentimes on Buddhist temple grounds). These actions
              have only worsened Buddhist–Muslim relations.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhist
              military monks (tahanphra) are soldiers who are selected during training to
              covertly operate as both monks and soldiers. After they undergo a full
              ordination ceremony, military monks perform the typical duties of a monk but
              are armed and receive a monthly salary from the military. Military monks see
              their work as imperative to the survival of Buddhism in southern Thailand and
              the legacy of the Buddhist kingdom of Langkasuka.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              one Buddhist temple in the conflict zone, I met a military monk who pulled back
              his saffron robes to show me his Smith &amp; Wesson. When I asked him why
              military monks exist, he replied:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Military
              monks in the three southern provinces of Thailand are like guardians that
              protect Buddhism from deterioration. If there are no soldiers to help take care
              of the wat [temple], the wat will become deserted and untended. We are here to
              protect the religion, encourage the people, and raise the morale of local
              Thais. This nation can survive because there is religion… If there is no
              Buddhism to teach and guide the people, we will become a nation of chaos filled
              with selfish people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">He
              and many other Buddhists in the region believe that military monks are
              essential to protecting Buddhism in southern Thailand, and that if Muslims
              drive the Buddhists out of southern Thailand, order and morality will be pushed
              out as well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Burma: Pushing the Rohingya Muslims Out</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              recent violence in Burma began in 2012, when the western Burmese state called
              Rakhine saw widespread Buddhist riots and violence against the Rohingya Muslims.
              Tensions in the state had risen prior to this, largely due to the rising
              population of the Rohingya and the decline in the Rakhine Buddhists, the
              majority population.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              violence rippled across the country and brought global exposure to the Burmese
              Buddhist nationalist organization called the 969 Movement. The name of the
              organization is numerical shorthand for the nine supreme qualities of the
              Buddha, six traits of the dharma, and nine traits of the sangha. Buddhist
              traditions are inundated with numbers and categories that stretch back for
              hundreds of years; however, the significance of 969 in Burma is quite recent.
              In the 1990s, the Burmese monk U Kyaw Lwin used 969 as a numerological counter
              to the South Asian Muslim use of 786. While not a global phenomenon, South and
              Southeast Asian Muslim business owners have displayed 786 to indicate that
              their establishments are owned by Muslims. The term acts as a surrogate for
              writing out sacred words such as Basmala (“In the name of Allah”) or bismillah-ir-rahman-ir-rahim
              (In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate and Merciful), which is a phrase that
              begins most surahs in the Qur’an.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Burma, Buddhists from the 969 Movement and the Association of Protection of
              Race and Religion (MaBaTha) argue that Muslims pose a danger to their country.
              To protect the nation, these Buddhists have lobbied for four laws on race and
              religion to control and limit the Muslim population and, in their view, protect
              the buddhadharma. The first of these is a birth control law, which passed in
              late May. The Burmese Parliament continues to await the President’s enactment
              of the three remaining bills, which pertain to monogamy, conversion, and
              interfaith marriage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Update
              – Friday, August 28: In early July, Burma passed the law restricting the
              Buddhist women and non-Buddhist men from marrying, and earlier this month, the
              government passed the final two laws, criminalizing extra-marital affairs, and
              making it more difficult for people to change religions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">While
              these Buddhist nationalists see Muslims as a threat, human rights groups
              consider the actions of Buddhist nationalists and the Burmese government
              harmful to the Muslim population. Since 2011, Muslims of Bengali descent (who
              call themselves Rohingya) have been forced to live in concentration camps where
              they are deprived of jobs, school, and access to medical attention; their food
              supply is also limited. Since the 1980s, they have been without citizenship,
              and in the last few years many have fled the country in refugee boats, some dying
              in the attempt. Responding to these human rights attacks, the Burmese Buddhist
              monk Pamaukkha explained to a member of the Agence France-Presse (AFP), “We do
              not want anyone here posing as refugees or Bengalis, trying to swallow the
              nation or its people. They need to be sent back now.” The nation is Burmese and
              Buddhist, he and others argue. It does not have room for Rohingya.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">For
              conservative Burmese Buddhist monks and nuns (who are often more conservative
              than their monastic brothers), Muslims pose a threat to the Buddhist majority,
              financially and demographically. In a dharma talk from February 2013, the
              Burmese 969 Movement’s prominent monk U Wirathu explained, “[The money that you
              spend at a Muslim-owned shop] will be used to get a Buddhist–Burmese woman and
              she will very soon be coerced or even forced to convert to Islam. And the
              children born of her will become Bengali Muslims and the ultimate danger to our
              Buddhist nation, as they will eventually destroy our race and our religion.
              Once they become overly populous, they will overwhelm us and take over our
              country and make it an evil Islamic nation.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">U
              Wirathu does not quote scriptures to support his views; it is unnecessary.
              Burmese Buddhists see him as a religious authority independent of scriptures.
              For U Wirathu, there is no anti-Muslim violence in Burma; rather, there is a
              growing effort to combat a Muslim invasion. The Burmese sangha, the sole
              authority on who is or is not a monk in their tradition, has not defrocked U
              Wirathu nor others in the 969 Movement and MaBaTha organization.</span></p>

              Global Buddhism”</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              this globalized world, conservative Sri Lankans, Thais, and Burmese Buddhists
              have come together under the banner of protecting Buddhism. Buddhists in these
              three countries face changing demographics and declines in their majority
              populations. Conservative Buddhists argue that this is because Muslims have
              larger families than their Buddhist counterparts. They also point to interfaith
              marriages: when a Muslim and Buddhist marry in South and Southeast Asia, more
              often than not the Buddhist converts to Islam. This is largely due to religious
              and social pressures. There are no ramifications for leaving the Buddhist
              faith, but Muslims consider apostasy a blasphemous act that leads to hell. Such
              distinctions do not go unnoticed by members of the 969 Movement and BBS, which
              seek to create laws to curb such tendencies. A change in demographics does not
              justify the violence or Buddhist fears, but it adds an important context to the
              perspectives of Conservative Buddhists.</span></p>

              is not a multireligious country. This is a Sinhalese country.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">U
              Wirathu and other Burmese monks believe Muslims are part of a global financial
              network stretching from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia that seeks to overthrow
              Buddhist control in their country and others. This view is shared by members of
              the Sri Lankan BBS, who now collaborate with the 969 movement. After a visit to
              the 969 headquarters in early 2014, they invited U Wirathu to the Sri Lankan
              capital, Colombo. In September 2014, he addressed thousands of Sinhalese
              Buddhists and formally met with the Bodu Bala Sena. There was international
              outcry over this invitation and U Wirtahu’s anti-Muslim rhetoric. In their
              defense, one of the cofounders of the Bodu Bala Sena, the Buddhist monk Kirama
              Wimalajothi Thera, exclaimed, “This is not a multireligious country. This is a
              Sinhalese country.” Six months later, U Wirathu returned again to Sri Lanka,
              this time to help foster an international Buddhist alliance to protect global
              Buddhism from Islam and other threats.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thai
              Buddhists also have shown support for the 969 Movement and the MaBaTha. Thai
              Buddhists monks have attended MaBaTha meetings in Burma and donated funds to
              help the organization broadcast its messages. Many Thais have argued that their
              country should not take in Rohingya boat refugees; instead, they believe the
              Thai government should push them back out to sea. When pressed on the ethics of
              this position, they explained to Bangkok Post journalist Sanitsuda Ekachai: “We
              are kind, but Muslims are aggressive and have too many kids. They are national
              security threats who will aggravate problems in the deep South.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many
              Asian Buddhist may hold views that clash with Western visions of religious
              pluralism. For many Buddhists in Asia, the buddhadharma is not a “religion.”
              This distinction is exemplified in the reflections of Taiwanese immigrants to
              the United States, who have noted how they “became” Buddhist once they arrived.
              There was no identification for this in Taiwan. What is at stake from the
              perspective of many Asian Buddhists is not their religion but their basic
              identity and way of life. This difference between Western Buddhists’ and Asian
              Buddhists’ perspectives of the buddhadharma has become prominent in the current
              Burmese crisis.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">On
              November 4, 2014, the U.S. Buddhist Teachers Network issued an open letter to
              President Barack Obama more than a week before his participation at the ASEAN
              Summit in Burma. Their letter called upon Obama to speak out against the
              growing anti-Muslim violence in Burma and across Asia and urged him to “express
              concern for Burma’s Muslims and Rohingyas in [his] public speeches.” It was
              signed by 381 Buddhist teachers in the United States.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              approach is strikingly dissonant from the sentiments expressed by many Burmese
              Buddhist monks and, collectively, the Burmese sangha. While there are notable
              Burmese Buddhist monks who work in concert with Western Buddhist visions of a
              pluralistic society, their efforts do not hold sway over the popular Buddhist
              culture or the current Burmese legal reforms.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              in any society, a perceived loss or anticipated loss in majority status is
              often alarming to those in the majority. Such changes can trigger conservative
              reactions and desires to protect the majority’s privileges. For groups such as
              the 969 Movement and the Bodu Bala Sena, the failure of the international
              community to acknowledge their concerns alarms them, only escalating the problem.
              Whether one agrees with the Buddhists involved in these conflicts or not—and
              Western onlookers, especially Western Buddhists, have made their disapproval
              clear—it is important to hear and understand the concerns of all involved. The
              less people feel heard, the more they will act to become heard. In this era of
              increased globalization, the world is only going to get smaller—and the need to
              listen all the greater.</span></p>
