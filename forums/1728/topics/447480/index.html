                   is not because I have said that in this particular context sati refers 
                  to present moment awareness that you can conclude that I have said that 
                  there should be no faculty of memory involved somewhere in the process. <br></div>
              </blockquote><br>Remembrance
                   is quite central to the development of satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na. This pertains to 
                  the common refrain encountered throughout the Satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na Sutta(s), 
                  which demonstrates that the practice of satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na involves more than 
                  present moment awareness. The refrain runs as follows:<br><br> 
              <ul>
              He 
                  abides contemplating the nature of arising in the body, or he abides 
                  contemplating the nature of passing away in the body, or he abides 
                  contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the body.<br> 
              </ul>
              <br>This
                   passage occurs for each of the meditation subjects presented throughout
                   the body contemplation section, as well as the sections dealing with 
                  the contemplation of feelings, mind, and dhammas. And this development 
                  of satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na relies on the remembrance of what has been previously 
                  learned as well the relationship of presently occurring phenomena to 
                  those which have passed away.<br><br>SN 47.42 informs us on how this 
                  arising and disappearance of the body, feelings, mind, and dhammas is to
                   be understood as follows:<br><br> 
              <ul>
              And what, monks, is the arising of
                   the body? With the arising of nutriment there is the arising of the 
                  body. With the cessation of nutriment there is the disappearance of the 
                  body.<br><br>With the arising of contact there is the arising of 
                  feeling. With the cessation of contact there is the disappearance of 
                  feeling.<br><br>With the arising of name-and-form there is the arising 
                  of mind. With the cessation of name-and-form there is the disappearance 
                  of mind.<br><br>With the arising of attention there is the arising of 
                  phenomena. With the cessation of attention there is the disappearance of
                   phenomena.<br> 
              </ul>
              <br>The commentary on the Satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na Sutta adds 
                  that this contemplation can be extended to include further examinations 
                  of conditionality as detailed in the Paá¹­isambhidÄ�magga. Without 
                  remembering and bringing to mind these modes of analysis there is no way
                   of developing satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na.<br><br><blockquote>
              <div><cite>Dukkhanirodha wrote:</cite>in this particular context sati refers to present moment awareness<br></div>
              </blockquote><br>Again,
                   the noun sati is related to the verb sarati, which means "to remember."
                   This meaning is retained in all of the PÄ�li texts which define sati and
                   give instructions of the development of satipaá¹­á¹­hÄ�na.</div>

In meditation, you put your attention on one item. When your mind wanders from this focus, it is Mindfulness that reminds you that your mind is wandering and what you are supposed to be doing. It is Mindfulness that brings your mind back to the object of meditation. All of this occurs instantaneously and without internal dialogue. Mindfulness is not thinking. Repeated practice in meditation establishes this function as a mental habit which then carries over into the rest of your life. A serious meditator pays bare attention to occurrences all the time, day in, day out, whether formally sitting in meditation or not. This is a very lofty ideal towards which those who meditate may be working for a period of years or even decades. Our habit of getting stuck in thought is years old, and that habit will hang on in the most tenacious manner. The only way out is to be equally persistent in the cultivation of constant Mindfulness. When Mindfulness is present, you will notice when you become stuck in your thought patterns. It<br>(8:34 PM) AEN:     It is that very noticing which allows you to back out of the thought process and free yourself from it. Mindfulness then returns your attention to its proper focus. If you are meditating at that moment, then your focus will be the formal object of meditation. If your are not in formal meditation, it will be just a pure application of bare attention itself, just a pure noticing of whatever comes up without getting involved--"Ah, this comes up...and now this, and now this... and now this".<br><br>Mindfulness is at one and the same time both bare attention itself and the function of reminding us to pay bare attention if we have ceased to do so. Bare attention is noticing. It re- establishes itself simply by noticing that it has not been present. As soon as you are noticing that you have not been noticing, then by definition you are noticing and then you are back again to paying bare attention.<br><br>Mindfulness creates its own distinct feeling in consciousness. It has a flavor--a light, clear, energetic flavor. Conscious thought is heavy by comparison, ponderous and picky.

              What does the Buddha say about sati (mindfulness)?
              
              
              "One remembers to abandon wrong view &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right view: This is one's right remembrance.
              
              One remembers to abandon wrong resolve &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right resolve: This is one's right remembrance.
              
              One remembers to abandon wrong speech &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right speech: This is one's right remembrance.
              
              One remembers to abandon wrong action &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right action: This is one's right
