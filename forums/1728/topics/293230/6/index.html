Since time immemorial people have speculated about this question. Most religions will teach that the world was created by a Creator. For many people, this seems to be satisfactory.<strong> However, if one seriously thinks about it, this answer is merely a placebo - something that does not have any real value other than to satisfy the incessant queries of a questioner. </strong>To say that the world started with a Creator is no better than to say that the origin of yoghurt is milk, or the origin of a plant is the seed. <strong>Simplistic minds do not seem to have a need to see further back beyond that. </strong><br><br>Everything has a cause, that there must be a first cause, and that God is the first cause. This old argument contains its own refutation, for if everything has a first cause then the first cause must also have a cause.These are the basic ingredients of all religions even today..<span style="text-decoration: underline;">A theistic or superstitious explanation puts an end to all free inquiry.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Does Buddhism share this viewpoint?</span>No,Buddha did not recognise such concept but teaches the principle of <strong>Dependent Origination</strong> The purpose of this topic is just to share the ideas and views from Buddhism. <span style="color: red;">(The principle of Dependent Origination is one of Buddhism's most important and unique teachings.Due to the profundity of the principle of Dependent Origination only the very basic rather than the advanced concepts will be discussed)</span><br><br><strong>Please click to read</strong><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=204975" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part I)-Dependent Origination  vs First Cause</a><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=205683" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part II)-Where Is The Cracker?</a><br><a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=205686" rel="nofollow">Dependent Origination(Part III)-Who Am I ?</a><br><br>------------------------------<br><br><strong>What are the consequences of the concept of interdependence on cosmological ideas in Buddhism?</strong> The concept of interdependence implies that the elements of the conventional reality we are all familiar with do not possess an existence that is permanent and autonomous. This thing exists because something else exists, that happens because this has occurred. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nothing can exist by itself and be its own cause.</span><br><br>Everything depends on everything else. Suppose that there is an entity that exists independently of all the others. This implies that it is not produced by a cause, that is, either it has always existed or it does not exist at all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Such an entity will be unchanging since it cannot act on others and others cannot act on it. The world of phenomena could not function.</span> <strong>Thus interdependence is essential for phenomena to manifest themselves</strong>.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Because the concept of interdependence implies that nothing can exist by itself and be its own cause, it goes against the idea of a creative principle, a First Cause or a Creator that is permanent, all-powerful, that has no other cause than itself, and which created the universe.</span> In the same vein, Buddhism rejects the idea that the universe can be born out of nothing - a creation ex-nihilo - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because the universe has to depend on something else to emerge.</span> If the universe was created, it is because there was a potentiality already present. The coming into being of the universe is merely the realization of that potentiality. One can thus interpret the Big Bang as the manifestation of the phenomenal world emerging from an infinite potentiality already in existence. In a poetic language, Buddhism speaks about of <strong>Â“particles of spaceÂ”</strong> which carry in them the potentiality of matter. This is strongly reminiscent of the vacuum filled with energy that is thought to have given birth the material content of the universe in the modern Big Bang theory. Material phenomenon and things are not Â“createdÂ” in the sense that they go from a state of non-existence to one of existence. <strong>Rather they go from an unrealized state to a realized state</strong>. Once it has come into existence, the universe goes through a series of cycles, each composed of 4 stages: birth, evolution, death and a state where the universe is pure potentiality but has not manifested yet itself. <strong>This cyclic universe has no beginning nor an end. </strong><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=192663&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">Origin of the world vs No beginning No end</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=189927&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">Recycled Universe: Theory Could Solve Cosmic </a><br><br>---------------------<br><br>Please also see the 12 Links of Interdependent Origination: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/depend.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/depend.htm</a><br><br>Â• 1st link:  	Ignorance  	Â• 7th link:  	Feeling<br>Â• 2nd link: 	Volitional Formations 	Â• 8th link: 	Craving<br>Â• 3rd link: 	Consciousness 	Â• 9th link: 	Grasping<br>Â• 4th link: 	Mind - Body 	Â• 10th link: 	Becoming<br>Â• 5th link: 	Six Sense Spheres 	Â• 11th link: 	Birth<br>Â• 6th link: 	Contact 	Â• 12th link: 	Ageing &amp; Death<br><br>etc........

            <div class='col-md body'>from previous BWB thread<br><blockquote>It is said that buddha has 32 signs of a great man, they are:<br><br>1. supati.t.thapaado: feet with a level sole (the Buddha would have an even pace -- not like those who wear down their shoes unevenly -- such a sole would spread the weight of His body evenly)<br>2. he.t.thapaadatalesuu cakkani jaataani: 1,000 spoked wheel marks on soles (such marks would make the Buddha's hands and feet infinitely flexible -- unlike our hands and feet which can flex only in one or two directions because there are only two or three lines on our palms)<br>3. aayatapa.nhi: projecting heels-- the heels were not round in shape but more oval (spreads weight and gives extra leverage for strength to the foot)<br>4. diigha"ngulii: literally this means big fingers, but in fact it refers to the fingers &amp; toes of the Buddha being of even length (makes the hands and feet very strong by comparison to our own for whom all our fingers and toes are of different lengths)<br>5. mudutalahatthapaado: hands &amp; feet soft skinned (this is not to say that the Buddha was not strong. Normally we associate hunks of taut muscle with strength -- but also soft flesh can be full of muscles)<br>6. jaalahatthapaado: netlike lines on palms and soles (this is similar to no.2 -- it allows the feet and hands to be infinitely flexible -- it is not people of ancient times who had such a feature -- even Kuhn Yay Thongsuk Samdaengpan had such a feature on her hands which perhaps explains why she was so resiliant, even at a senior age when travelling to give teachings around the country)<br>7. ussa"nkhapaado: high raised ankles (this feature is similar to the way the legs of a horse are built -- it gives exceptional strength, leverage and agility to the leg)<br>8. e.nimigasadisaja"ngho: taught calf muscles like antelope (again this explains why the Buddha could be so strong -- because his legs were strong like those of an antelope -- rather than being flacid like those of a buffalo)<br>9. .thitako va anonamanto: even standing without bending down, the Buddha could touch his knees (such proportions for a person are in fact the ideal -- not like Asians who have a long body but short legs or at the other extreme negros and caucasians who have a long body and long legs)<br>10. kosohitavatthguyho: sexual organs concealed by sheath (the advantage of this is not to risk bringing offence to anyone even when naked)<br>11. suva.n.nava.n.n.o: bright golden-coloured complexion (such golden skin has the advantage of being sensitive to the touch)<br>12. sukhumacchavii: skin so fine no dust can attach (this is unlike the rough skin of a reptile to which all manner of dirt attaches. In fact the Buddha managed to achieve what women and sportsmen still try to achieve, but without all the effort!)<br>13. ekekalomo: body hair separate with one hair per pore (not like some people who have whole tufts of hair coming from each pore).<br>14. uddhaggalomo: bluish body hair curls clockwise<br>15. brahmujugatto: upright stance like a god (such a stance gives an exceptional sense of balance and a firm stance)<br>16. sattussado: flesh undinted and convex in seven places (these seven places comprise: the back of the hands [2], the upper side of the feet [2], the shoulders [2] and the neck [1])<br>17. siihapubba.d.dhakaayo: lion-like chest (such a chest allows strong breathing and better metabolism than a normal person)<br>18. piitantara.mso: flesh on back undinted (not like some people whose back looks like fishbones)<br>19. nigrodhaparima.n.dalo: equal distance hand-to-hand &amp; head-to-toe (such a proportion allows one to sit comfortably for meditation, without one's legs sticking out)<br>20. samva.d.dakkhandho: neck rounded and smooth (the shape of the Buddha's neck was perfect like a tube or organ pipe and is the reason for the melodious voice he had)<br>21. rasaggasaggii: sensative taste-buds (allows one to pick up the nutrients from even the poorest of foods and is why the Buddha could survive for 49 days on seven lumps of rice after his enlightenment or during the time when he had to spend his rainy-season in a place where there was famine)<br>22. siihahanu: lion-like jaw (such a jaw is necessary to accommodate the 40 teeth of mark 23.)<br>23. cattaa.liisadanto: 40 teeth (most people have only 32 teeth and normally some are missing too. Such a set of forty teeth is permanent throughout life -- not like ours which change from milk teeth &gt; adult teeth &gt; false teeth!)<br>24. samadanto: evenly-spaced teeth<br>25. avira.ladanto: gapless teeth<br>26. sukkadanto: crystal canine teeth. Some people ask how when, as we sometimes find in the scriptures, the Buddha and Ananda are walking along, how Ananda could know that the Buddha has noticed something and is smiling about it. Normally, Ananda would walk directly behind the Buddha, but the reason he could know that the Buddha was smiling is because even just the parting of his lips, light would eminate from his canine teeth)<br><span style="color: red;">27. pahutajivho: large, long tongue (large enough to cover his whole face and long enough to lick ears -- contributes to melodious sound of the Buddha and accommodates exceptional tastebuds) </span>28. brahmassaro hiravikabhaa.nii: god-like voice (this is a particularly melodious sort of voice -- collective fruit of the shape of his neck, teeth and tongue -- not like a person who is having problems with their teeth)<br>29. abhiniilanetto: bluish-black eyes<br>30. gopamukho: eyes innocent like a calf<br>31. u.n.naa loma bhamukantare jaataa: white cotton-wool soft wisp of hair in centre of brow (Indians respect this very highly and if they don't have one will draw one in as a 'caste mark')<br>32. u.nahiissiiso: brow &amp; face, especially the join between the two, are excellently smooth<br><br>These signs is because of achievement in cultivation.<br><br>For example, if one uphold the precepts of no falsehood in his many past lifes, he will have sign of long tongue.<br>Sign of long arms because of compassion.<br>Sign of evenly-spaced teeth because of no provocation and instigation.<br>Sign of long ear represents accumulated merits.<br><br>Knowing this, I observed the people around me, and find out that I actually can sort of deduce a person's habit or luck base on how close their look to these signs.<br>It is not that I am a visual person or what, but everything happens in ourselves must have a cause including these 32 signs of buddha. I think a lot of fortuneteller also judge a person with reference to the look.<br><br>that's all, just my little observation.</blockquote>it is said that there are 32 signs of the buddha such as chaka on his legs and hands. how true is that? It was said that one of the sign was the Buddha had a tongue that could reach the back of his head. doesn't that makes him look queer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
