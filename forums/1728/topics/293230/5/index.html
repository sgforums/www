            <div class='col-md body'>hhmm... interesting. i remembered there was another time, shortly after i fell asleep, i sort of got up from bed and i felt like i was drifting about. i felt invisible because i could also literally glide or walk through a table near the bed. i don't remember having seen or felt i had legs to walk though haha... i even saw my hubby whom was still awake watching tv then but unable to have a glimpse of "me" as i normally sleep covered under the quilt. i heard some people could drift and travel as far as away from their home but however i remember i never had such fortunate opportunity to experience. the most i would just be lingering around the room or the scene would just change to some sort of setting which i feel need not travel. though from such tiny insignificant experience it was enough to leave a message of lesson for me that it is all a state of mind. it was like lucid dream and the skill is to be able to be awake in dreams and steer the wheel.<br><br></div>

Hinduism started much earlier than Buddhism and the had the idea of rebirth which is also found in Buddhism. Did Buddha copy the idea from Hindus?</blockquote>Nope. Whatever he taught is based solely on his own experience -- i.e. remembering 96 aeons of his pastlives after his enlightenment.<br><br>This is not at all a theory derived from other sects, but his own insights and experience. Furthermore, unlike other Hindu schools which teaches an eternalistic concept of an Atman/Soul that is eternal and unchanging, Buddha never teaches such an idea -- rather, all individual mindstreams are momentary/impermanent, empty of a 'self', and are Dependently Originated.<br><br>All these teachings are unique and cannot be found apart from Buddhism and are derived from Buddha's experiential insight into the Ultimate Reality upon his Enlightenment.<br><br>Secondly since Hinduism teaches an eternal, unchanging atman, 'rebirth' is at odds because 'rebirth' implies the re-becoming of our mental and karmic factors, without recoursing to an unchanging persisting soul. Rather, the Hindu doctrine teaches the 'reincarnation' of an ultimately existing soul.<br><blockquote>2. What is the difference between the 2 on the rebirth theory?</blockquote>See above.<br><blockquote>3. Vajarana's have a strong idea reincanation. what's is the difference between this idea and rebirth theory. How can you tell if it is true that this is a reincanation of that?</blockquote>Vajrayana's understanding of rebirth is basically the same as Theravada and Mahayana in the sense that Consciousness is seen as a stream, a Process, Dependently Originated, empty of Self. There is a tendency to use 'reincarnation' and 'rebirth' synonymously among some Buddhists (including in Vajrayana) and that is OK, as long as the real meaning is understood.<br><br>When Vajrayana talks about 'incarnation' they are using it in a strictly relative terminology -- they never meant to say that there is ultimately an unchanging atman/soul unlike Hinduism. But there certainly is past lives, and there certainly is 'continuity' of the stream of consciousness over lifetimes.<br><br>No orthodox schools of Buddhism teaches an ultimate 'Atman' or 'Soul'.<br><br>At the same time, all orthodox schools of Buddhism teaches Rebirth.<br><br>Means first of all, we are momentarily reborn as long as Ignorance continues to drive samsaric becoming in the chain of 12 interdependent links of origination.<br><br>The second meaning is that, all orthodox Buddhist schools teaches Afterlife. Which means that we do not recourse to the nihilistic or materialist concept that consciousness is reduced merely to the material realm and will be 'destroyed' upon physical death. In Buddhism, consciousness/mind is not restricted and cannot be reduced to materiality. They are mutually conditioned but NOT mutually 'dependent' and we do not accept the materialist's reductionist doctrine.<br><br>BUT, like mentioned previously, we also do not recourse to the eternalistic idea of an unchanging eternal Soul/Atman that survives death.<br><br>But while ignorance is there, rebirth to an 'afterlife' will certainly take place.<br><br>How do we know (relatively speaking) what you were in your past life? Through the practice of meditation you can remember your past life -- and NOT only that, you can also gain access to others' past lives. I know of people who have developed such abilities and it is not uncommon.<br><br>Like Thusness said, even if you were able to practice 2~3 hours of meditation everyday, even for only 1 year, you will be able to develope some meditative experiences such as out-of-body experiences, recalling past lives, and so on. BUT it is also emphasized that these are <strong>merely side effects</strong> of practice and are NOT to be emphasized as it will only confuse people. Buddhism is a teaching of wisdom/insight, bliss, awakening, liberation, compassion, it does not teach cultivation as merely for the purpose of seeking 'side effects' and 'powers'.<br><br>Now, regarding Rebirth and the No-Self teaching,<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Life (Self) is nothing other than the continuous flow of the Now Moment.<br>The Now Moment ceases as it arises. This moment must completely ceased<br>and serves as the CAUSE for the next moment to arise.<br>Therefore Self is a process of series Self1, Self2, Self3, Self4, Self5, Self6...etc<br>A fixed entity 'Self' does not exist, what really exists is a momentary Self.<br>Under deep meditation, one is able to observe and sense the karmic and mental factors from moment to moment,<br>it is these factors that are succeeded from moment to moment and life and life but not a fixed entity.<br>When the karmic and mental factors subsides, it is known as "The True and Only (and Inherently egoless) Conscious Light (Itself)".<br><br>- Thusness</strong></span></div>
