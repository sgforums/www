How so?</div></blockquote>Emptiness means dependent origination, dependent arising, conditioned arising. And the nature of dependent arising, conditioned arising, dependent origination, is Emptiness.<br><br>This means that nothing has its own independent nature, independent of conditions. Every arising is relative to every condition, and without condition, it cannot be.<br><br>Therefore everything is empty of inherent existence.<br><br>This is a bad analogy that I just came up with with a moment's thought, just my simple attempt to explain it... You may think that the action and figures of the movie in the cinema is very real, you are obsessed in the development of the story, as if the actions and people in it are really existing. Then suddenly there is a power failure, immediately everything turns black.<br><br>Why? Because the appearances of the movie on the screen has no inherent existence. It is merely an appearance -- and when there is no condition, say this time the condition is Electricity, then the appearance subsides.<br><br>So there is no independent nature within appearances separate from conditions. The entire world is just that -- dream-like appearances, dependent arising, inseparable from Conditions. Yet it is a complete luminous expression of our Buddha Nature, an expression of our Pristine Awareness.<br><br>Our Buddha Nature (luminosity-emptiness inseparable) cannot be separated from Conditions, even though its essence is Unconditioned. Just like Emptiness cannot be seen apart from Dependent Arising -- Dependent Arising means Emptiness, vice versa. They are not-two.</div>

With a hypnotist to guide you, it will be faster than trying to master meditation by oneself. However, as I said, not everyone has a past life.<br><br>But having a past life can prove to oneself the accuracy of Buddhist concepts. So if you ever get to the point knowing your own past, you know certain Buddhist concepts are true beyond doubt.</div>
