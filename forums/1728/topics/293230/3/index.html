            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">how do they prove that past life memories are true? it has been stated that in the article what is called full blown false memory</div></blockquote>Those memories mentioned above are probably vague and easily changed. So no comments on them. In deep meditation you can enter deeper levels of your consciousness in such depths that you when penetrate deeply into the subconscious, it is even possible to 're-<strong>live</strong>' the entire scene in the past life, as if you are totally present there with your body, conscious, not like a dream.. it is clearer than our usual recalling of past events and leaves no doubts in one's mind. In some cases it can be even traumatic because you 'relive' a traumatic part of past life.. such as fighting in the war. Then you are really physically there - fighting the war, not vague like in dreams but as if you are watching a movie with your entire body present there... as real as it can be. One of my highly enlightened friends (longchen.. he talked to you in my forum before) had such a recalling of fighting war in WW1 in France.<br><br>As for how to prove they are true.. simple.. like I said there are many cases which are proven to be true, by tracing what you recalled about the past life to the source.. like for example, you remember worked in a company called "X" in Germany, your name was Rainald von Dassel, you lived in a terrace house at Z Street. Then, you do a search and found out there really was a company in Germany called "X", there really was a worker there called "Rainald von Dassel" who died in 1970, he lived in a terrace house at Z Street, your ex family members etc, etc etc, that leaves no doubt.<br><br>There are many many such accounts. One guy who researched into such accounts was Ian Stevensons, who died a few months ago. But he was not the only one and more and more people in many countries even in the Western countries like United States where the concept of rebirth and reincarnation is not part of their judeo christian traditions, are starting to believe in rebirth and reincarnation because of what they've seen... and these guys aren't Buddhists or Hindus or what. (Also see <a href="http://www.ial.goldthread.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ial.goldthread.com/</a>) Another thing is sometimes you recall your past life and realise many things you never knew before, and when you check it out, it turns out all that you remembered is true. Anyway I posted this news article before about a boy who fought in world war.. which I will post subsequently.<br><br>Anyway here's some more to read...<br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/qanda05.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/qanda05.htm</a><br><blockquote>Question:<br>You have talked a lot about rebirth but is there any proof that we are reborn when we die?<br><br>Answer:<br>Not only is there scientific evidence to support the Buddhist belief in rebirth, it is the only after-life theory that has any evidence to support it. There is not a scrap of evidence to prove the existence of heaven and of course evidence of annihilation at death must be lacking. But during the last 30 years parapsychologists have been studying reports that some people have vivid memories of their former lives. For example, in England, a 5 year-old girl said she could remember her "other mother and father" and she talked vividly about what sounded like the events in the life of another person. Parapsychologists were called in and they asked her hundreds of questions to which she gave answers. She spoke of living in a particular village in what appeared to be Spain, she gave the name of the village, the name of the street she lived in, her neighbors' names and details about her everyday life there. She also fearfully spoke of how she had been struck by a car and died of her injuries two days later. When these details were checked, they were found to be accurate. There was a village in Spain with the name the five-year-old girl had given. There was a house of the type she had described in the street she had named. What is more, it was found that a 23-year-old woman living in the house had been killed in a car accident five years before. Now how is it possible for a five year- old girl living in England and who had never been to Spain to know all these details? And of course, this is not the only case of this type. Professor Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia's Department of Psychology has described dozens of cases of this type in his books. He is an accredited scientist whose 25 year study of people who remember former lives is very strong evidence for the Buddhist teaching of rebirth. </blockquote><blockquote>Question:<br>Well, have there been any scientists who believe in rebirth?<br><br>Answer:<br>Yes. Thomas Huxley, who was responsible for having science introduced into the 19th century British school system and who was the first scientist to defend Darwin's theories, believed that reincarnation was a very plausible idea. In his famous book 'Evolution and Ethics and other Essays', he says:<br><br>In the doctrine of transmigration, whatever its origin, Brahmanical and Buddhist speculation found, ready to hand, the means of constructing a plausible vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to man... Yet this plea of justification is not less plausible than others; and none but very hasty thinkers will reject it on the ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the world of reality; and it may claim such support as the great argument from analogy is capable of supplying.<br><br>Then, Professor Gustaf Stromberg, the famous Swedish astronomer, physicist and friend of Einstein also found the idea of rebirth appealing. Opinions differ whether human souls can be reincarnated on the earth or not. In 1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly investigated and reported by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti Devi from Delhi) could accurately describe her previous life (at Muttra, five hundred miles from Delhi) which ended about a year before her "second birth." She gave the name of her husband and child and described her home and life history. The investigating commission brought her to her former relatives, who verified all her statements. Among the people of India reincarnations are regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in this case was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and similar cases can be regarded as additional evidence for the theory of the indestructibility of memory. Professor Julian Huxley, the distinguished British scientist who was Director General of UNESCO believed that rebirth was quite in harmony with scientific thinking. There is nothing against a permanently surviving spirit-individuality being in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless message is given off by a sending apparatus working in a particular way. But it must be remembered that the wireless message only becomes a message again when it comes in contact with a new, material structure - the receiver. So with our possible spirit-emanation. It... would never think or feel unless again 'embodied' in some way. Our per venalities are so based on body that it is really impossible to think of survival which would be in any true sense personal without a body of sorts... I can think of something being given off which would bear the same relation to men and women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus; but in that case 'the dead' would, so far as one can see, be nothing but disturbances of different patterns wandering through the universe until... they... came back to actuality of consciousness by making contact with something which could work as a receiving apparatus for mind. Even very practical and down-to-earth people like the American industrialist Henry Ford found the idea or rebirth acceptable. Ford was attracted to the idea of rebirth because, unlike the theistic idea or the materialistic idea, rebirth gives you a second chance to develop yourself. Henry Ford says: I adopted the theory of Reincarnation when I was twenty-six. Religion offered nothing to the point.. Even work could not give me complete satisfaction. Work is fume if we cannot utilize the experience we collect in one life in the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had found a universal plan. I realized that there was a chance to work out my ideas. Time was no longer limited. I was no longer a slave to the hands of the clock...(continued in next post)</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>(continued from previous post) Genius is experience. Some seem to think that it is a gift or talent, but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are older souls than others, and so they know more... The discovery of Reincarnation put my mind at ease... If you preserve a record of this conversation, write it so that it puts men's minds at ease. I would like to communicate to others the calmness that the long view of life gives to us.<br><br>So the Buddhist teachings of rebirth does have some scientific evidence to support it. It is logically consistent and it goes a long way to answering questions that theistic and the materialistic theories fail to do. But it is also very comforting. What can be worse than a theory of life that gives you no second chance, no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have made in this life and no time to further develop the skills and abilities you have nurtured in this life. But according to the Buddha, if you fail to attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to try again next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will be able to correct yourself in the next life. You will truly be able to learn from your mistakes. Things you were unable to do or achieve in this life may well become possible in the next life. What a wonderful teaching!</blockquote>Anyway here's the boy's story.. <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=139719" rel="nofollow">Boy remembers Past Life Being Shot in WWII</a><br><br><strong>About past lives ... Uniontown WW II flyer's memories in Louisiana boy</strong><br>By Judy Kroeger<br>DAILY COURIER<br>Thursday, April 15, 2004<br><br>James Leininger, 6, of Lafayette, La., loves airplanes.<br><br>"He has always been extraordinarily interested in airplanes," said James' mother, Andrea Leininger, by telephone from their Louisiana home.<br><br>Lots of kids love airplanes, but James' story is unique. He has memories of being a World War II fighter pilot from Uniontown -- Lt. James McCready Huston, shot down near Iwo Jima in 1945.<br><br>At 18 months old, his father, Bruce Leininger, took James to the Kavanaugh Flight Museum in Dallas, Texas, where the toddler remained transfixed by World War II aircraft.<br><br>A few months later, the nightmares began.<br><br>"They were terrible, terrible," Andrea said. "He would scream, 'airplane crash, on fire, little man can't get out!' He'd be kicking, with his hands pointing up at the ceiling."<br><br>When James was 2 1/2 years old, he and Andrea were shopping and he wanted a toy airplane. "I said to him, 'Look, it has a bomb on the bottom' and he told me, 'That's not a bomb, it's a drop tank.' I had no idea what a drop tank was."<br><br>Neither of the Leiningers have ever served in the military, nor are they involved with aviation. Until James began showing an interest in planes, they had nothing aviation-related in their home.<br><br>Andrea's mother sent her a book by Pennsylvania author Carol Bowman, called "Children's Past Lives." The Leiningers started using Bowman's techniques of affirming James' nightmares and assuring him that the experiences happened to a different person, not the person he was now. "It helped. The nightmares stopped almost immediately,"; Andrea said.<br><br>However, the memories did not stop, but they do not come up all the time.<br><br>"I was reading him a story and he got a faraway look," she recalled. "I asked what happened to your plane? 'Got shot,' he said. Where? 'Engine.' Where did it crash? 'Water.' When I asked him who shot the plane, he gave me a look like a teenager, rolling his eyes, 'the Japanese,' like who else could it have been?<br><br>"What little kid knows about the Japanese," she asked. "He said he knew it was a Japanese plane because of the red sun. My husband and I were shell-shocked."<br><br>James provided other information. He said his earlier name was James, he flew a Corsair and took off on a boat called the Natoma, and he remembered a fellow flyer named Jack Larson.<br><br>Foods can set James' memories off, too.<br><br>"I hadn't made meatloaf in 10 years, so James had never had it," Andrea said. "When he sat down, he said, 'Meatloaf! I haven't had that since I was on the Natoma.' When we were getting ice cream one day, he told me that they could have ice cream every day on the Natoma."<br><br>Bruce began researching his son's memories and discovered a small escort carrier called the Natoma Bay, which was present at the Battle of Iwo Jima. Twenty-one of its crew perished. Bruce also discovered that only one of the Natoma's crew was named James, James Huston.<br><br>James Huston's plane was hit in the engine by Japanese fire on March 3, 1945, went down in flames and sank immediately. Flyer Jack Larson witnessed the crash.</div>
