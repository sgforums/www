              <p>I noticed a trend that some Buddhist go to Forum E to bash the other religion people</p>
              <p>Its still goes back to the "My Religion shouldnt be ridiculed " mentality .That is still a form of attachment which must be eliminated to have inner peace</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We knows everyone have affinity , the higher affinity will be Buddhist in this lifetime ,while others is other religion .We should learn to restraint from bashing other people religion because that isnt our business .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as Shantideva in &lt;&lt;Entering the Bodhisattva way of life &gt;&gt; says ,"we cant carpeted the whole ground in the world with carpet but we can cushion the pain with our two piece of cut-out portion for food</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shantideva also raised that no hatred must be beared even when Buddhist establishment is destroyed in the crowd of unruly mob and anti-Buddhist ,for no words of hatred should be established.<br>His words truly exemplified in H H .Dalai Lama atitude towards the Communist China</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So , forummer ,spend more wholesome time in discussion of Buddhism then fighting in narrow alleys of views and be a realised person who influenced alot then a few .</p>

              <p>Well, I am there partly is to correct the wrong views on Buddhism and partly to get some answers from them. Reasons because I am a non Christian in a Christian family. However, there is an unwritten rule in my family, meaning little or no discussion of religion to avoid conflicts. So, the only way is to get answers from them in order for me to speak the same frequency with my family members.</p>
              <p>For example, some ignorant people at EH claimed that disasters will only hit Buddhist countries. So, I have to point out to them, The Black Death in 1349 and Spanish Flu in 1918 killed millions of Americans and European. If no one there to clarify, others will think that is true.</p>
              <p>The world did not start from the day we were born, they have to look beyond the period we are living, the history of man-kind.</p>
              <p>Many unblievers are taken in by signs of the end of the world (floods, war in the middle east, diseases etc). If one were to look at the history of man-kind, one will know that these signs are happening throughout the history of man-kind and won't be taken in by them.</p>

              <p>I think defending one's religion and bashing other people's religion are two different things.</p>
              <p>If you see a person making a statement such as 'I'm a Buddhist therefore I cannot eat beef or else GuanYinMa will be angry', will you leave it at that for non-Buddhist to see/hear and therefore gain misconception? Such misconception will only serve to weaken other's afinity with Buddhism.</p>

              <p>So yah....I concur with the TS, that as practitioner of your own faith, do be more courteous to other religion and stop going in to bash whatever you think you understand when actually you are making your ownself looks like a barking mad dog.</p>

              <p>Note to all Buddhist to practice Universal Restraint</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I noticed a trend that some Buddhist go to Forum E to bash the other religion people</p>
              <p>Its still goes back to the "My Religion shouldnt be ridiculed " mentality .That is still a form of attachment which must be eliminated to have inner peace</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We knows everyone have affinity , the higher affinity will be Buddhist in this lifetime ,while others is other religion .We should learn to restraint from bashing other people religion because that isnt our business .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just as Shantideva in &lt;&lt;Entering the Bodhisattva way of life &gt;&gt; says ,"we cant carpeted the whole ground in the world with carpet but we can cushion the pain with our two piece of cut-out portion for food</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Shantideva also raised that no hatred must be beared even when Buddhist establishment is destroyed in the crowd of unruly mob and anti-Buddhist ,for no words of hatred should be established.<br>His words truly exemplified in H H .Dalai Lama atitude towards the Communist China</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So , forummer ,spend more wholesome time in discussion of Buddhism then fighting in narrow alleys of views and be a realised person who influenced alot then a few .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> and those joker who comes to our forum to be "monkey"</p>
              <p>we must emulate the spirit of Mahatma Gandhi when he start passive disobedience with the British in South Africa against the Rule of allowing Police to enter Indian house without a warrant</p>
              <p>"we must have the courage to contain their anger "</p>

              <p>Well, I am there partly is to correct the wrong views on
                      Buddhism and partly to get some answers from them. Reasons because
                      I am a non Christian in a Christian family. However, there is an
                      unwritten rule in my family, meaning little or no discussion of
                      religion to avoid conflicts. So, the only way is to get answers
                      from them in order for me to speak the same frequency with my
                      family members.</p>
              <p>For example, some ignorant people at EH claimed that
                      disasters will only hit Buddhist countries. So, I have to point out
                      to them, The Black Death in 1349 and Spanish Flu in 1918 killed
                      millions of Americans and European. If no one there to clarify,
                      others will think that is true.</p>
              <p>The world did not start from the day we were born, they have to
                      look beyond the period we are living, the history of man-kind.</p>
              <p>Many unblievers are taken in by signs of the end of
                      the world (floods, war in the middle east, diseases etc). If one
                      were to look at the history of man-kind, one will know that these
                      signs are happening throughout the history of man-kind and won't be
                      taken in by them.</p>

              <p><br> I understand you feel anguished when people use a natural phenomena to attack your beliefs. However, as long as your mind is clouded, it is sometimes difficult to put forward your views in balanced manner, also the group"feel" that is at the forum.

                      Practice loving kindness and compassion first, start with people you like and with people you have neutral feelings to. When magnanimity widens, your wisdom will arise!</p>

              <p>Well, I invite you to go there to have a look at my posts, no personal attack at all. I am not angry at all and I do not feel that it is an attack when he questioned the natural pheonomena. It seems that I have no problem with anybody at EH except googoomuck who has problems with everybody, not just me. Sometimes, facts hurt.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I chatted at other forums, usually the topics are open for discussions regardless of religion. So, newcomers will also think that all the topics here are open to everybody because when you click TOPICS, all the topics appear.</p>
              <p>What "your people, my people"? I guess it will be best if EH states strictly for Christians so one will know others are not allowed.</p>
