            <div class='col-md body'>In the Buddha's time many people were superstitious. They believed in various kinds of superstitious signs. No one could agree on which signs were the most auspicious. Even the deities were debating about it among themselves. Since they were unable to decide they sent one deity to ask the Buddha about auspicious signs for prosperity.<br><br>In response, the Buddha taught the <span style="color: red;">Mangala Sutta</span>. This important discourse explains that the <strong>most auspcious signs are good moral conduct and mental development</strong>. Nothing else is of any real value.<br><br>If you think that something will bring you good luck, then it probably will. If you think that something will bring you bad luck, then it probably will. However, <strong>that is just delusion</strong>. It is just the placebo effect, and everyone knows that placebos really do work. Whatever happens that is good you attribute to the "lucky charm." Whatever happens that is bad you attribute to an "unlucky charm." It is nothing but delusion. <strong>Do not be deceived by the well-meaning simpletons, nor the greedy crooks who make easy money from fools. </strong><br><br><img src="http://www.aimwell.org/AIMLogo.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At that time in India, people held many superstitious beliefs regarding portents and omens that foretold success or failure. People could not agree with one another, and the deities were also debating this matter without any satisfactory resolution. Therefore, the deity approached the Blessed One for a definitive answer.

Is not the object of our respect and worship. When we bow before Buddha images, we are recalling the qualities of the enlightened beings. It is their impartial love and compassion, generosity, morality, patience, joyous effort, concentration and wisdom that we are showing respect to.The statue  serves to remind us of the qualities of the Buddha, and it is the qualities, not the clay, that we are bowing to.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="large">When u are looking at the Buddha status u are oso looking at yourself.

One should respect those who provide material and spiritual benefits: parents, teachers, employers, monks, public servants, etc. One should also respect those with more refined morality, greater learning, or greater age. Respect is shown by doing service, paying homage, etc.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Living in a Suitable Locality</span><br><br>To fulfil the preceding three blessings, one should live in the right place. In some places it is difficult to meet wise and good teachers who can point out the meaning of Dhamma. If one meets many fools, one must suffer for a long time, even if one is wise and good.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Good Deeds Done in the Past</span><br><br>To have the power to choose where we live, and who we associate with, we must have accumulated merits in the past. It is very difficult to meet the Buddha and his teaching. Even if we are born in a Buddhist country, a truly wise teacher is hard to come across, and his time is always in great demand. One who has done many meritorious deeds is born in a devout Buddhist family and gets many opportunities to learn and practice the Dhamma.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">Setting Oneself in the Right Course</span><br><br>It is not easy to build good character. If one fulfils all of the preceding blessings, one will naturally be inclined to cultivate virtue, but most people will have to make special efforts to avoid wrong doing and correct their defects. Knowing oneÂ’s faults is a good start, but we need great humility, honesty, and patience to correct ourselves.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“Whoever was heedless before, but afterwards is not,<br>he illumines this world like the full moon freed from clouds.Â” </span></span> (Dhp v 172)<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Great Learning</span><br><br>The BuddhaÂ’s teaching is profound and difficult to understand properly, let alone to put into practice and to realise for oneself. We are very fortunate to have excellent translations of the BuddhaÂ’s teachings in English, and many other books by eminent meditation masters. We should study the Dhamma whenever possible to deepen and broaden our knowledge. Study, practice, and realisation are all necessary unless we live with an enlightened teacher. In that case, if we practice hard, realisation will follow without study.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Skill in Work </span><br><br>Intellectual knowledge is not the same as practical skill. One can read and write cookery books without being a good cook. Another person may be able to cook very well indeed, without reading any books. Meditation also needs many hours of practical training under the guidance of a skilled meditation teacher. We should try to acquire all kinds of practical skills to develop our knowledge and wisdom.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">A Highly Trained Discipline</span><br><br>The Dhamma cannot be realised by an unmindful, lazy, or shameless person. We need to train ourselves to eat little, sleep little, talk little, and indulge in pleasures only a little. A devout Buddhist should strive for wisdom, whether they are a householder or one gone forth. Those who have gone forth should have much higher standards of discipline and sense-restraint than householders. Bhikkhus should follow all 227 training precepts, restrain their senses, reflect well on the requisites provided by the faithful, and purify their livelihood. The Buddha said (in the Upakkilesa Sutta, A.ii.53) that a recluse does not shine if he indulges in sexual relations, uses money, drinks intoxicants, or earns a wrong livelihood.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Well-spoken Speech</span><br><br>Our speech is the manifestation of our thoughts. If our mind is impure, it is better not to speak too much. The tongue is the strongest muscle in the body it can work all day long without getting tired. So a person who can control the tongue is the strongest person in the world. Our speech should be pleasing to others as far as possible, if not, at least it should be aimed at benefit.<br></div>
