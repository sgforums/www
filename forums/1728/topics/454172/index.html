              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>The article is a great summary of the view and thanks for sharing.  I have gone through several of your conversations in DHO as well as those facebook conversations you emailed to me and somehow I find that you have missed that piece of link that allows a practitioner to progress from 5 to 6 insights. It also give rise to this opportunity to emphasize once again what exactly lead to the transition of the journey and the importance of having a balance emphasis on realization, experience and view.</p>
              <p>The youtube video -<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFIyhseYTWg&amp;feature=player_embedded#!"> Is There A Real You?</a> by Julian Baggini presents very well the view of anatta and emptiness.   However you should not mixed a practitioner progressing from direct non-dual realization and experience to anatta (your case in particular) and one that jumps start from having the right view.  It will be apt at this point in time to ask yourself the following questions:</p>
              <p>1.	Will a practitioner that clearly experienced and realized “in the seen, just the seen” or “no thinker, just thoughts” also sees and understands “no self” as presented by Julian Baggini?</p>
              <p>2.	How will the experience of a practitioner be like without the direct experience of non-dual?</p>
              <p>3.	How is 1 and 2 related?</p>
              <p>This is not a textbook Q&amp;A, go through these questions with a sincere heart.  We will talk about them next time we meet. :-)</p>

                            all suffering and difficulty.</p>
              <p>Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness; emptiness does 
                            not differ from form. Form itself is emptiness; emptiness itself 
                            is form. So too are feeling, cognition, formation, and consciousness.</p>
              <p>Shariputra, all Dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are 
                            not produced, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure; and they neither 
                            increase nor diminish. Therefore, in emptiness there is no form, 
                            feeling, cognition, formation, or consciousness; no eyes, ears, 
                            nose, tongue, body, or mind; no sights, sounds, smells, tastes, 
                            objects of touch, or Dharmas; no field of the eyes up to and including 
                            no field of mind consciousness; and no ignorance or ending of ignorance, 
                            up to and including no old age and death or ending of old age and 
                            death. There is no suffering, no accumulating, no extinction, and 
                            no Way, and no understanding and no attaining.</p>
              <p>Because nothing is attained, the Bodhisattva through reliance on 
                            Prajna Paramita is unimpeded in his mind. Because there is no impediment, 
                            he is not afraid, and he leaves distorted dream-thinking far behind. 
                            Ultimately Nirvana! All Buddhas of the three periods of time attain 
                            Anuttara-samyak-sambodhi through reliance on Prajna Paramita. Therefore 
                            know that Prajna Paramita is a Great Spiritual Mantra, a Great Bright 
                            Mantra, a Supreme Mantra, an Unequalled Mantra. It can remove all 
                            suffering; it is genuine and not false. That is why the Mantra of 
                            Prajna Paramita was spoken. Recite it like this:</p>
              <p>Gaté Gaté Paragaté Parasamgaté</p>
              <p>Bodhi Svaha!</p>

              <p>Consciousness is <strong>imputed, reckoned, </strong>based on the manifestation and causes and conditions. <strong>As such, the view of consciousness as being a Self, a soul, an entity, a core, a noumenon, a substance, a substratum, a source... etc, is deconstructed to a coreless flow, a process, of dependently-arisen activities.</strong></p>
              <p>The Buddha said:</p>
              <p>"No, venerable sir. In various ways we have been taught that 
                          consciousness arises dependently. Without a cause there is no arising of
                           consciousness."</p>
              <p>"Good, bhikkhus! Good that you know the Dhamma taught by me. In various 
                          ways I have taught that consciousness arises dependently. Without a 
                          cause, there is no arising of consciousness. Yet, this bhikkhu Sati, son
                           of a fisherman, by holding to this wrong view, misrepresents us and 
                          destroys himself and accumulates much demerit, and it will be for his 
                          suffering for a long time.</p>
              <p>"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the condition dependent upon 
                          which it arises. If consciousness arises on account of eye and forms, it
                           is reckoned as eye consciousness. If on account of ear and sounds it 
                          arises, it is reckoned as ear consciousness. If on account of nose and 
                          smells it arises, it is reckoned as nose consciousness. If on account of
                           tongue and tastes it arises, it is reckoned as tongue consciousness. If
                           on account of body and touch it arises, it is reckoned as body 
                          consciousness. If on account of mind and mind-objects it arises, it is 
                          reckoned as mind consciousness. Bhikkhus, just as a fire is reckoned 
                          based on whatever that fire burns - fire ablaze on sticks is a stick 
                          fire, fire ablaze on twigs is a twig fire, fire ablaze on grass is a 
                          grass fire, fire ablaze on cowdung is a cowdung fire, fire ablaze on 
                          grain thrash is a grain thrash fire, fire ablaze on rubbish is a rubbish
                           fire - so too is consciousness reckoned by the condition dependent upon
                           which it arises. In the same manner consciousness arisen on account is 
                          eye and forms is eye consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of 
                          ear and sounds is ear consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account of 
                          nose and smells is nose consciousness. Consciousness arisen on account 
                          of tongue and tastes is taste consciousness. Consciousness arisen on 
                          account of body and touch is body consciousness. Consciousness arisen on
                           account of mind and mind-objects is mind consciousness.</p>

              Hi, someone asked me what path should he practice and he is interested in realizing anatta. I wrote the following:
                                                  
              Hi,
                                                  
              Do you have a practice background? Also are you practicing any particular tradition, I.e. Theravada, zen, tibetan, advaita, etc?
                                                  
              There are a few paths but it all depends on oneâ€™s own inclination, one must guage for himself.
                                                  
              Personally I went through the path of self-inquiry first because I am more inclined to realizing that luminous essence in the beginning and the advaita teachings were really appealing to me at that time, so seeing my inclinations and directions, Thusness asked me to practice self-inquiry which was also what he practiced in the beginning. (My path of practice is documented in my ebook: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html )
                                                  
              For others they may be more inclined to contemplate on anatta directly. Still for others they may be more inclined to a more gradual path. Therefore Thusness did not give the same advise to everyone but advises accordingly. Sometimes he ask people to do vipassana for example (this is important and should be complimented with anatta contemplation so that realization can arise).
                                
              For such a person that is inclined to realizing anatta, I generally recommend them to do some form of direct contemplation on anatta: link removed due to error in displaying
                                ...
                                
              "As with any insight practice, one must look nakedly at the nature of your experience. Because the conceptual layer is always unknowingly reinforcing a sense of self arising from latent bonds and uninvestigated views and constructs, in order to investigate, we have to drop our conceptual thoughts with its whole layer of presumptions/conceptions and investigate our own direct experience. This non-conceptual insight practice is often misunderstood however. It does not mean staring blankly at one spot waiting for some magical insight to arrive. It is not just a kind of concentration practice. Rather, it means to really investigate and challenge this core sense or position that "I am", "I exist" to see if there is any validity or truth in our direct (unmediated, bare, prior-to-concepts) experience.
                                
              An advise I often give is to strip yourself of concepts and just observe nakedly and experience our sensate reality as clearly as possible. It means to see the sights, colours, shapes, forms as clearly and intensely as can be, to hear the sound as clearly and vividly as can be, to experience everything in crystal clarity. Our senses are brimming with clarity. Then, investigate for yourself, is there ever a real self/subject/agent/etc, is this the way things are - that a self truly exists? Or is there always already simply the experience without an observer. In seeing, is there a self? Or is seeing simply the seen (shapes, colours and forms) without seer. Same goes for hearing, smelling, etc... Thinking...
                                
              We are investigating and challenging every uninvestigated notion, view, position, of a self/Self by checking out if they stand up to reality itself. For non-dual insight, you start asking yourself, does reality exist in terms of an "inside" or an "outside" - Where does the subjective pole ends and objective pole begins, or where does awareness/observing ends and manifestation begin? As for anatta, we question our assumption of a "self" as an inherent essence (like the weird notion of a "water" molecule linking up 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atoms - http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html ) by seeing if it stands up to reality: isn't self/awareness/etc simply always (just a convention for) just the sights, sounds, tastes, i.e. in the seen just the seen, hearing is just sounds, etc (without a seer seeing the seen or a hearer hearing the heard)? Or is there truly an awareness/self/perceiver/observing/agent that contains, expresses, or observes things? Is there a core self that is the agent which controls, observes, the aggregates or is "self", "awareness", etc simply an imputation for hearing/sounds, seeing/sights, etc? Then we may begin to see that there is no "water" molecule at the center linking the 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atoms: rather, it is the co-dependently arising conglomerate of 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atoms that is *conventionally* imputed as a "water" molecule! There is no "water molecule" as a truly existing entity at all, it is mere imputations! Likewise, there is no "an awareness", "a self", any kind of subjective essence behind seeing, hearing, smelling, and so on. "Self" is thus a mere imputation for the five changing aggregates of form, feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness (consciousness itself is divided into six kinds), all of which are everchanging, arising and subsiding, without any linking core whatsoever!
                                
              In effect, what we felt as some solid entity at the center, or a being inside a solid entity called a body (another falsely constructed image of some solid entity with shapes and forms out of a bunch of disconnected and spontaneous sensations) gets deconstructed through insight by this kind of contemplation which investigates and challenges our baseless constructs like self, body, inside and outside, subject and object, etc etc... When we directly realize the falsity of our constructs through this kind of deconstructive investigation, we realize and discover, oh this is how it always is and has been! And what's seen through is simply seen through, no longer an experience that is entered and left (like those peak experiences where suddenly sense of self drops off but returns in a few moments)."
                                
                                ...
                                
              But this should also be balanced with regular meditation practice if possible, see the first two posts in this thread: http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/440368?page=1
                                
              That means if possible sit at least 30-45 mins. Then throughout the day, not just in sitting, we practice vipassana as best as we can according to our ability.

              A great way to contemplate anatta is by contemplating the two stanzas of anatta: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html
                                
              Along with Bahiya Sutta, which is what led to my realization of anatta: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/10/my-commentary-on-bahiya-sutta.html

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, someone asked me what path should he practice and he is
              interested in realizing anatta. I wrote the following:</p>
              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Do you have a practice background? Also are you practicing any
              particular tradition, I.e. Theravada, zen, tibetan, advaita,
              etc?</p>
              <p>There are a few paths but it all depends on one’s own
              inclination, one must guage for himself.</p>
              <p>Personally I went through the path of self-inquiry first because
              I am more inclined to realizing that luminous essence in the
              beginning and the advaita teachings were really appealing to me at
              that time, so seeing my inclinations and directions, Thusness asked
              me to practice self-inquiry which was also what he practiced in the
              beginning. (My path of practice is documented in my ebook: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/my-e-booke-journal.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2010/12/...</a> )</p>
              <p>For others they may be more inclined to contemplate on anatta
              directly. Still for others they may be more inclined to a more
              gradual path. Therefore Thusness did not give the same advise to
              everyone but advises accordingly. Sometimes he ask people to do
              vipassana for example (this is important and should be complimented
              with anatta contemplation so that realization can arise).</p>
              <p>For such a person that is inclined to realizing anatta, I
              generally recommend them to do some form of direct contemplation on
              anatta: link removed due to error in displaying ...</p>
              <p>“As with any insight practice, one must look nakedly at the
              nature of your experience. Because the conceptual layer is always
              unknowingly reinforcing a sense of self arising from latent bonds
              and uninvestigated views and constructs, in order to investigate,
              we have to drop our conceptual thoughts with its whole layer of
              presumptions/conceptions and investigate our own direct experience.
              This non-conceptual insight practice is often misunderstood
              however. It does not mean staring blankly at one spot waiting for
              some magical insight to arrive. It is not just a kind of
              concentration practice. Rather, it means to really investigate and
              challenge this core sense or position that “I am”, “I exist” to see
              if there is any validity or truth in our direct (unmediated, bare,
              prior-to-concepts) experience.</p>
              <p>An advise I often give is to strip yourself of concepts and just
              observe nakedly and experience our sensate reality as clearly as
              possible. It means to see the sights, colours, shapes, forms as
              clearly and intensely as can be, to hear the sound as clearly and
              vividly as can be, to experience everything in crystal clarity. Our
              senses are brimming with clarity. Then, investigate for yourself,
              is there ever a real self/subject/agent/etc, is this the way things
              are – that a self truly exists? Or is there always already simply
              the experience without an observer. In seeing, is there a self? Or
              is seeing simply the seen (shapes, colours and forms) without seer.
              Same goes for hearing, smelling, etc… Thinking…</p>
              <p>We are investigating and challenging every uninvestigated
              notion, view, position, of a self/Self by checking out if they
              stand up to reality itself. For non-dual insight, you start asking
              yourself, does reality exist in terms of an “inside” or an
              “outside” – Where does the subjective pole ends and objective pole
              begins, or where does awareness/observing ends and manifestation
              begin? As for anatta, we question our assumption of a “self” as an
              inherent essence (like the weird notion of a “water” molecule
              linking up 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen atoms – <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/is-there-you.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2012/05/i…</a> ) by seeing if it stands up to reality: isn’t self/awareness/etc
              simply always (just a convention for) just the sights, sounds,
              tastes, i.e. in the seen just the seen, hearing is just sounds, etc
              (without a seer seeing the seen or a hearer hearing the heard)? Or
              is there truly an awareness/self/perceiver/observing/agent that
              contains, expresses, or observes things? Is there a core self that
              is the agent which controls, observes, the aggregates or is “self”,
              “awareness”, etc simply an imputation for hearing/sounds,
              seeing/sights, etc? Then we may begin to see that there is no
              “water” molecule at the center linking the 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen
              atoms: rather, it is the co-dependently arising conglomerate of 2
              hydrogen and 1 oxygen atoms that is <strong>conventionally</strong> imputed as a “water” molecule! There is no “water molecule” as a
              truly existing entity at all, it is mere imputations! Likewise,
              there is no “an awareness”, “a self”, any kind of subjective
              essence behind seeing, hearing, smelling, and so on. “Self” is thus
              a mere imputation for the five changing aggregates of form,
              feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness (consciousness
              itself is divided into six kinds), all of which are everchanging,
              arising and subsiding, without any linking core whatsoever!</p>
              <p>In effect, what we felt as some solid entity at the center, or a
              being inside a solid entity called a body (another falsely
              constructed image of some solid entity with shapes and forms out of
              a bunch of disconnected and spontaneous sensations) gets
              deconstructed through insight by this kind of contemplation which
              investigates and challenges our baseless constructs like self,
              body, inside and outside, subject and object, etc etc… When we
              directly realize the falsity of our constructs through this kind of
              deconstructive investigation, we realize and discover, oh this is
              how it always is and has been! And what’s seen through is simply
              seen through, no longer an experience that is entered and left
              (like those peak experiences where suddenly sense of self drops off
              but returns in a few moments).”</p>

                      object) a polarity, that of existence &amp; non-existence. But when one 
                      sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right 
                      discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur 
                      to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with 
                      right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not 
                      occur to one.</p>
