              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 16.0pt;">Ireland's Buddhists: Why
              more of us are opting for a gentler brand of faith with a focus on
              contemplation</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Graham Clifford May 7 2017
              Irish Independent</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              is growing rapidly in Ireland, with ­interest fuelled by the popularity of
              mindfulness as a stress-reliever.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              the last decade the practice of mindfulness has been thriving in Ireland as
              people seek inner respite from an increasingly hectic world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              has now become a vital tool in the maintenance of mental health. Its
              recommended by the medical profession, seen as hugely important for young
              people and local mindfulness classes have cropped up nationwide.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              many attending the classes are unaware that mindfulness has its origins in
              Buddhism - unless, of course, they attend the classes run by the varied and
              plentiful Buddhist centres across Ireland today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">More
              of us than ever are turning to Buddhism. The latest census revealed that there
              are now 9,358 Buddhists in Ireland. That's an 11pc increase on the 2011 census
              findings. And a 43pc hike from a decade ago when the 2006 census recorded 6,516
              Buddhists here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              many believe the 2016 figure is, if anything, conservative.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jnanadhara
              from New Zealand who runs the Dublin Buddhist Centre, and has lived in Ireland
              since 2004, says: "I think perhaps because of the way the census question
              was posed many who practise Buddhist teachings, but who were brought up as perhaps
              Catholic or Protestant, were confused. If the question was 'what religion do
              you practise?' then you'd find a far greater number of people who use some form
              of Buddhism in their lives."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">MORE THAN MEDITATION</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              with other faiths there are different branches of the religion operating in
              Ireland today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Dublin Buddhist Centre is part of the Triratna Buddhist Community, which has
              mainly Indian roots, and each week it caters for Dubliners who visit the centre
              on James Joyce Street to slow down, meditate and learn more about Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"We
              have people coming to us from all walks of life," says Jnanadhara.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Perhaps
              Buddhism was once seen as some kind of hippie fringe religion but that's
              completely changed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"The
              growth of mindfulness has certainly brought more people to Buddhist teachings
              but I've noticed in recent years that people are coming to the centre wanting
              to find out more about Buddhism itself rather than just meditation."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Jnanadhara
              tells me that roughly half of those attending retreats and meditation courses
              through the Dublin Buddhist Centre are non-Irish by birth. Across the city in
              Kilmainham the Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Centre for World Peace and Health
              offers silent meditation, chanting practices, seminars, readings, talks and
              yoga in its impressive and calming shrine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              year the centre celebrates its 40th anniversary.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">AN ABSENCE OF JUDGMENT</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Munster too some new, and not so new, Buddhist retreat centres are seeing an
              increase in visitor numbers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At
              the Palpung Ireland Buddhist Centre in the Cork town of Banteer, a Kerry woman
              is the resident teacher.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Anita
              Treacy found Buddhism while visiting India many years ago. She became a
              Buddhist nun and took on the name Ani Choedrun Lhamo. Now she teaches
              meditation and Buddhist philosophy to those looking for something different in
              their lives.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"We,
              as a country, became very rich, very quickly and then everything
              collapsed," she says. "People now are really starting to look more
              inwardly and Buddhism gives us that freedom. Nobody has to sign up, nobody has
              to actually become a Buddhist to avail of what we have to offer and I think
              that really appeals to people in Ireland today."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Indeed,
              the absence of 'judgment' is an aspect of Buddhism which is particularly
              appealing, according to Jnanadhara in the Dublin Buddhist Centre.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"In
              many ways traditional religions offer a 'take it or leave it' approach and
              people aren't always satisfied with that," he says. "Buddhists do not
              believe in a god that will punish those who commit sins and for many that's refreshing.
              It's not an authoritarian religion but rather one which encourages debate,
              conversation and contemplation."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">IRELAND'S FIRST TIBETAN TEMPLE</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              diggers at the Dzogchen Beara Retreat Centre in Allihies, West Cork signal a
              facility and religion in expansion mode.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Already
              three floors of Ireland's first Tibetan Buddhist Temple have been built
              overlooking Bantry Bay. East meets West by Atlantic waters.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It's
              an ambitious project with €1.2m already spent on the temple.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"We
              need to fund raise another half a million by July so we can stay on
              schedule," explains the centre's director Malcolm MacClancy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Our
              hope is that by St Patrick's Day 2018 we will have a fully functional building.
              We'll need another €200,000 for sacred decoration at the end and then at some
              stage in the summer of 2019 his Holiness Sakya Trizin will come to officially
              consecrate the temple which will be seen as something of a jewel in the crown
              of Tibetan Buddhism in the world," he adds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              ask Malcolm, who became a Buddhist in 1995 at the age of 25, why he believes
              more Irish people are turning to the religion today.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Buddhism
              encourages us to have confidence in our fundamental goodness and to nurture
              that; we're all 'Buddhas to be'. Buddha realised his full enlightened potential
              and we're on that path; to unveil the innate wisdom and compassion that all
              beings share. This focus on our positive attributes, personal responsibility
              and interdependence seems increasingly relevant to people in Ireland
              today."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Last
              year, 7,500 people engaged with meditation, either in daily sessions or on
              retreats at Dzogchen Beara and that figure is expected to rise this year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">MacClancy
              says it's the open-door policy of Buddhism which allows people to come and see
              if it works for them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"People
              don't feel threatened by Buddhism; the teachings and practices are open to
              everybody. We're not about conversion but about communicating the teachings of
              Buddha to women and men so it is relevant in their modern lives."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I
              feel happier and more content with my life</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Daniel
              Canning will sit the first of his law exams at Maynooth ­university next
              Saturday but while his classmates may be ­fretting, the 20-year-old Dubliner
              will take to his chair feeling relaxed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"I've
              always been fairly laid-back but since I started Buddhist meditation and
              implemented the practical Buddhist teachings in my everyday life I'm certainly
              even more chilled out," he tells me. Though Daniel, the eldest of three,
              was raised in a Catholic family in Clondalkin, he says his parents aren't
              overly religious.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              so in his mid-teens he started to explore the content of other religions.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"I
              never felt Catholicism was for me. The whole judgment and blind faith element
              just didn't tally. I went into the library in Maynooth and found a section on
              Buddhism and before long, with the help of videos on YouTube, I was meditating.
              Buddhist practices and teachings are quite logical and that really appealed to
              me."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Keen
              to learn more, he attended the Dublin Buddhist Centre on James Joyce Street a
              year ago and in February had his mitra ceremony where he confirmed his
              commitment to following the Triratna Buddhist teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"I
              think a lot of my friends initially thought this was just a fad I was going
              through. But it's so much more than that and I feel happier and more content with
              my life. Even my parents can see the improvement in my personal relationships
              with them, I'm better at communicating and listening."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Daniel
              doesn't envisage a legal career for himself into the future per se but may
              consider something in international relations or the area of human rights.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              one unplanned benefit of his conversion is the discovery of vegan food.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Obviously
              one pillar of the faith is the respect of all living things so we don't eat
              meat. I was brought up in a big meat-eating house so at first on our retreats,
              I wasn't sure about the vegan food. But I've developed a taste for it now and
              along with daily meditation, the healthy eating aspect really makes you feel so
              much better physically."</span></p>
