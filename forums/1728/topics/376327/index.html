                      is one of the two female founders of the Shangpa lineage of Tibetan
                      Buddhism. Her teachings are still practiced the world over by Tibetan
                      Buddhists in a number of lineages. Unlike so many other previous
                      Buddhist masters, Sukha--who lived in Kashmir-- did not begin her
                      training as a young woman--she did not even begin practicing the
                      spiritual path until she was 59, and she attained enlightenment at 62
                      years old. Age is not an issue when it comes to waking up. </span><span style="color: #333333;">In
                      the instructions above, she offers a profound pith instruction that is
                      also a simple three-step meditation instruction. How does Sukkha
                      recommend we meditate?</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></span></span></h3>
              <h3 style="margin: 1em 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px 0px 8px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',Trebuchet,sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; color: #827c5c; background-image: url(http://pages.google.com:80/-/includes/style/victoria/underbrush/h3.gif); background-repeat: repeat-x; background-position: 0% 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="color: #333333;">First,
                      we need to become acquainted with the space-like nature of mind, which
                      is non-conceptual emptiness. While the expressions of mind--thoughts,
                      sense perceptions, emotions--are deeply tied to conceptual mind, the
                      nature of mind is naturally empty, luminous and non-conceptual. This
                      nature of mind permeates all experience, but is altered by none. This
                      nature is the "space of non-conceptual emptiness".</span><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Second,
                      we need to cut the root of conceptual mind. Does this mean we should
                      stop thinking? The point is not to stop thinking...it would be a real
                      challenge to stop thoughts. But we can cut our attachment and
                      involvement with thoughts. That is what is meant by "cut the root". If
                      we cut the root of attachment, the tree of conceptual distractions,
                      negative emotions and obscurations cannot grow.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></span></span></h3>
              <h3 style="margin: 1em 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px 0px 8px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',Trebuchet,sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; color: #827c5c; background-image: url(http://pages.google.com:80/-/includes/style/victoria/underbrush/h3.gif); background-repeat: repeat-x; background-position: 0% 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="color: #333333;">Another
                      way to understand this instruction is that we should continually cut
                      off--again and again--our involvement with chains of thinking. Instead
                      of following after our conceptual stories, what would happen if we just
                      cut the cord on the story and let it disappear into space? This is
                      sometimes called "the practice of the self-liberation of thoughts". If
                      we loosen our attachment to concepts, they are naturally self-pacifying.</span><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">The
                      third instruction is to relax. After you cut the cord of attachment to
                      and involvement with conceptuality, the only thing left to do is relax
                      into the spacious, luminous nature of mind. It is a great relief that
                      meditaiton is--ultimately-- a process of relaxing, not the just the
                      superficial relaxation of "taking it easy" but a deep "taking it easy"
                      that allows the mind to find its own nature, its place of deepest rest.
                      The relaxation of meditation means that you have nothing to do other
                      than simply be. Simple presence is enough.</span><br style="color: #333333;"><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">In
                      these instructions, Sukkhasiddhi offers the key to a profoundly
                      meaningful and effective meditation, which can become--over time--the
                      cause for enlightenment. Let’s try this meditation: It can take as
                      little as three minutes.</span><br style="color: #333333;"><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Sit, breathe, relax.</span></span></span></h3>
              <h3 style="margin: 1em 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px 0px 8px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',Trebuchet,sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; color: #827c5c; background-image: url(http://pages.google.com:80/-/includes/style/victoria/underbrush/h3.gif); background-repeat: repeat-x; background-position: 0% 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="color: #333333;">Rest
                      in the space-like nature of mind. This is the inner space in which all
                      thoughts arise. You do not have to create this space—it has always been
                      there. Without it, there would be no room for the unfolding of myriad
                      experiences. </span></span></span></h3>
              <h3 style="margin: 1em 0px 0.5em; padding: 0px 0px 8px; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS',Trebuchet,sans-serif; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; color: #827c5c; background-image: url(http://pages.google.com:80/-/includes/style/victoria/underbrush/h3.gif); background-repeat: repeat-x; background-position: 0% 100%;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: normal;"><span style="color: #333333;">Relax into it. Breathe. Be cradled by your inner space-like, open, non-conceptual nature.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></span></span></h3>

                      the root: Release your attachment to and involvement with the trains of
                      thought that present themselves. Be open to all sound, without blocking
                      or following sounds. Be open to all thought, without blocking some
                      thoughts and following after others. Be like a shepherd (your
                      awareness), observing the play of her flock (your thoughts).</span><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">Finally,
                      relax. Let yourself sink into this very present moment without needing
                      to plan, to create, to remember, to do. Be effortless and deeply
                      relaxed.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></span></span></h3>

                      key to meditation is deeply letting go. Through learning to deeply let
                      go, we begin to experience the magic of the present moment, and open
                      the space to know the nature of mind. For beginners, this simple
                      meditation, done a little every day, offers a taste of the real meaning
                      of meditation. For more advanced students, this meditation reinforces
                      the essence of all dharma practice. </span></span></span></h3>

              <p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #663300; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; font-size: 18px; line-height: normal;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #36341a; font-family: Georgia; line-height: 28px;">Answer:</span></span></p>
              <p>That is a great question. Awareness is mind, in a way. But awareness
                      is not superficial mind. It is not mind’s conceptualizing. It is not
                      mental contrivance. The term “awareness” [and “organic awareness”]
                      means something specific. It does not mean “awareness of”, in the sense
                      of “I am aware of a sound”. It is not dualistic. It refers—not to
                      mind’s form or content—but to the nature of mind. Awareness is the
                      nature, the pervasive essence, of mind’s appearances, mind’s
                      conceptualizing and mind’s activities. It is not thought, but it
                      pervades thought. It’s not emotion, but it pervades emotion. It’s not
                      sense experience, but it pervades sense experience. That pervasive
                      quality is what is meant by “organic”. Think of milk mixed into water</p>
              <p>What is this thing—this awareness—that pervades our mental
                      experience? Awareness is the very simple dimension of mind that knows
                      it’s own nature. It is the dimension of mind that is wise, in and of
                      itself. It is the aspect of mind that is barely, nakedly, purely and
                      reflexively aware and awake. It is mind that is untouched by the storm
                      of thoughts and emotions that blow through us every minute of every
                      day. Awareness is Buddha-nature. It is the deep mind behind the veil of
                      changing thoughts and emotions.</p>
              <p>What pure awareness is exactly is not always immediately clear. At
                      least, it was not clear to me when I was first introduced to this idea.
                      But in one way, it’s very accessible to beginners, even more accessible
                      than it is to some seasoned practitioners, because it is so simple and
                      so all-pervasive. While a beginner has access to this simplicity,
                      seasoned meditators sometimes make awareness into something
                      complicated, or something mystical. Seasoned meditators might sometimes
                      need to focus more than beginners on de-mystifying and un-complicating
                      their approach to awareness.</p>
              <p>How can we touch it, how can we know it? It is easier than we might
                      think. You are hearing me talk right now. And you’re thinking: putting
                      things together and figuring out. You are processing, and following
                      your train of though about “awareness”. Or else you might not be
                      listeinging and are thinking about something else entirely. So for a
                      moment now, just look inwards and say: “Who is asking this thinking,
                      who is listening? Who is feeling?” Just the bare “who”, the naked
                      “who”, the one who is perceiving, feeling, knowing--in the very
                      beginning, before there’s figuring out.—that’s awareness. Before
                      there’s figuring out, before there’s putting things together, there’s a
                      simple, pure moment of experience. This simple pure moment of
                      experience, before conceptual overlay, is the moment of bare awareness.
                      It is a moment of freshness. It is a moment of sudden spaciousness,
                      even infiniteness. Catching that moment is like catching the first wave
                      of knowing awareness.</p>
              <p>Do you see this as I talk about it? Do you experience it? If not,
                      give it time. Practice looking into this moment, glancing back at the
                      watcher, and see if you can slip into a fresh state.</p>
              <p>The practice of knowing awareness is a practice of tuning into that
                      pure moment of experience. It is a non-dual, non-conceptual moment
                      before there’s a conceptual overlay or figuring out. But saying
                      “before” is also a little misleading, because—even with all the
                      conceptual overlay—you are experiencing awareness right now. It is not
                      something you will unearth in the future, but rather something that you
                      realize you have had all along. It sounds simple, and it is. But it
                      takes some time to recognize, because we’re so caught up in the trails
                      and trains of thought and conceptuality that follow on the heels of
                      that pure awareness. So, the moment of awareness is always happening,
                      and conceptuality—all your thoughts, feelings, sense experience-- is
                      flowing out from that. Therefore, to get in touch with just that
                      luminous, non-conceptual source of everything, is also to get in touch
                      with this pure moment, the pureness of the moment that is always
                      happening. In other words, to know awareness involves being in this
                      very present moment. The more in the “now” you get, the more you will
                      experience and become familiar with awareness.</p>
              <p> Most of the time, we are involved in “other times”: in the past or
                      in the future. We are caught up in being anxious about what might come,
                      or planning for the future. Or we are ruminating on what we did, or how
                      we could have done it better. We rarely fully and purely experience
                      what is in front of us in this very moment: the sacred present. This is
                      generally how we live. But, even so, I think everyone has had an
                      experience with the sacred present. Children are more susceptible to
                      slipping into a true moment of being fully present, as are people
                      trained in meditation. But I’m sure each of you can recall times in
                      your life when you felt completely at one with your present experience.
                      Activities and mindstates that pull you past yourself, such as yoga, exercise, 
                      the mindstate of joy, are noted—even within the Buddhist tradition—to be activities that help
                      stimulate that moment of pure awareness. At those moments when you’re
                      totally in the moment, something happens: you lose the sense of self.
                      There is no “you” experiencing the “now”! And yet, there is an
                      experience, right? There’s a kind of experience without an experiencer.
                      You are not longer “aware of”: You are simply, nakedly, purely aware.
                      That’s what I’m gesturing at. Finding that timeless quality of the
                      moment moves us into touch with pure awareness.</p>
              <p>So yes, awareness is mind. But I hesitate to say mind, because we
                      have such a particular idea of what mind is: brain, concepts, the whole
                      package… But here, I’m gesturing to something simpler than that, and
                      more basic.</p>

Should I
                      strive to cultivate a state of mindful awareness at all times, or is it
                      only valuable when it arises on its own?</span><br style="color: #333333;"><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Answer:</strong> It is important to learn to integrate what you learn ‘on the cushion’
                      with daily activities ‘off the cushion’, but striving is too effortful.
                      It is more effective to occasionally remind yourself to settle into
                      simple, unadorned awareness, and let go of being pulled along by the
                      conceptual mind. For most people, this is easier to do with activities
                      that don’t involve a lot of thinking. Like doing dishes, or jogging.
                      But, some of us just happen to have a line of work that involves a lot
                      of thinking! What about that? Should we quit our jobs? </span><br style="color: #333333;"><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">I
                      don’t think that is necessary. It is fine to 'do what needs to be done'
                      in your work. When doing conceptual work, there is a practice of
                      'absorption'--of getting completely immersed in it. This has parallels
                      with the absorption experienced in meditation, so your work can
                      potentially complement your meditation practice instead of being a
                      distraction. In that case, it is not necessary to fight your thoughts.
                      Instead, see what happens if you let yourself become completely
                      absorbed in your conceptual process to the extent that you lose a sense
                      of self. I think what makes ‘getting lost in thought’ unproductive
                      [spiritually] is when we do not get completely lost, when we are still
                      dualistic.</span><br style="color: #333333;"><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">You
                      can also try a practice of pausing in your thought process and turning
                      inwards suddenly to see if your awareness, your simple, unadorned mind,
                      has gone anywhere. For a moment, let yourself slip into the simple,
                      uncontrived mind. </span><br style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #333333;">This
                      is not so much a 'state' as it is the backdrop of your experience all
                      the time. We just do not pay attention to the backdrop much of the
                      time. The practice in this case is not trying to cultivate the
                      experience of unadorned awareness, but rather recognizing it as already
                      present.</span><br></h3>

              journey to greater awareness began in 1966 when I began studying and
              practicing Soto Zen meditation under Matsuoka Roshi for three years
              along with the opportunity to practice with Suzuki Roshi and Katagiri
              Roshi in 1968.  In 1978 I went to China and received teachings from
              Chan Master, Yen Why Shih, a direct disciple of Hsu Yun.  He gave me
              permission to teach other of his students Chan.  Later that year I was
              in Nepal where I entered the Kagyu lineage tradition of Tibetan
              Buddhism under Sachyu Tulku.  Later that year I received teachings from
              Trungpa Rinpoche and Kalu Rinpoche in 1980.  In 1985 I met my root
              guru, Namkhai Norbu from whom I received the practice transmissions for
              the Semde, Longde and Mengagde sections of Dzogchen. In 1986 I received
              the Dzogchen thogal practice teachings from one of Dudjum Rinpoche's
              Lamas for the thogal methods of the Yeshe Lama. I have also received
              Mahamudra teachings from the lineage of the Dalai Lama and the gTumo
              teachings from the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions. This last September
              2008, I received transmissions from the head teaching Lama for the Bon
              Dzogchen tradition covering the practices of trekchod and thogal. 
              Since 1985 I have been an active practitioner and student of Dzogchen. 
              It has been my goal to be able to present these teachings in a
              non-sectarian, non-religious manner that would be more effective and
              appealing to a Western audience.  </div>

              <div> </div>
              <div>Dzogchen is Tibetan meaning the Great Perfection.  Dzog means perfection or completion.  Chen means great. <br> <br> This system of non-dual teaching goes back historically to around the
              700's A.D. per several documents found in the cave library of texts
              discovered in Tun Huang, China on the Tibetan frontier this century. 
              Several key texts were discovered there that are clearly source
              materials of what was later to become known as Dzogchen.<br>  <br> One of the earliest texts known to actually describe the complete
              Dzogchen View, in a profoundly terse and pithy text, is known as the
              Six Vajra Verses.  All of the Dzogchen teachings are contained in just
              these six verses.  I recommend you read and contemplate the profundity
              of these verses.  Let the meaning reach out and speak to you personally
              from the enlightening intent of the earliest Dzogchen masters.  These
              verses are a Direct Introduction to the Natural State, our Primordial
              Beingness. </div>
              <div><br> Chogyel Namkhai Norbu and Adriano Clemente rendered the <br> Six Vajra Verses like this: in The Supreme Source:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><em>The nature of the variety of phenomena is non-dual<br> Yet each phenomena is beyond the limits of the mind<br> The authentic condition as it is does not become a concept<br> Yet it manifests totally in form, always good<br> All being already perfect, overcome the sickness of effort <br> And remain naturally in self-perfection: this is contemplation.</em></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Chogyel Namkhai Norbu's commentary divides the six verses <br> into three verses of two lines.  The first couplet describes <br> the ground of being and the view, relating to the Mind Series <br> of instruction and to Garab Dorje's first Incisive Precept <br> which is introduction to the nature of mind.  The second <br> couplet describes the path, the nature of meditation, <br> relating to the Space Series of instruction and Garab Dorje's <br> second incisive precept which is conviction of the reflexive <br> function of liberation.  The third couplet describes the <br> product, which does not differ from the ground and relates <br> to the Secret Precept Series and to Garab Dorje's third <br> incisive precept which is confidence in the process. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Based on Chogyel Namkhai Norbu's commentary, John Reynolds <br> (Vajranath), Nyingma scholar and yogi, made this discursive <br> translation:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><em>Even though the nature of the diversity (of all phenomena) <br>     is without any duality,<br> In the terms of the individuality of the things themselves, <br>     they are free of any conceptual elaborations.<br> Even though there exists no thought or conception of what <br>     is called the state of being just as it is,<br> These various appearances which are created are but <br>     manifestations of Samantabhadra.<br> Since everything is complete in itself, one comes to abandon <br>     the illness of efforts<br> And thus one continues spontaneously in the calm <br>     state of contemplation.</em></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Professor Samten Karmay found a version of the text <br> amongst the cache of material that Sir Aurel Stein found <br> in Tun Huang and which was concealed in the tenth century, <br> thus validating its age and form  His rendering is this: </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><em>   <br>     All the varieties of phenomenal existence as a whole <br>     do not in reality differ one from another.<br> Individually also they are beyond conceptualization.<br> Although as "suchness" there is no mental <br>     discursiveness (with regard to them)<br> Kun-tu bzang po (The All Good) shines forth in (and as) all forms.<br> Abandon all the malady of striving, for one has <br>     already acquired it all.<br> One leaves it as it is with spontaneity.<br> <br> <br> </em>The first Tibetan Dzogchen master, Pagor Vairotsana, received <br> the Six Vajra Verses in the eighth century from Shri Singha, <br> his Indian Guru, in the land of Uddiyana.  This text was amongst <br> the first translations he made at King Trisong Detsen's court at <br> Samye in Tibet.  It is considered the root transmission text of the <br> Mind Series of Dzogchen instruction and is the first in the list of <br> the eighteen transmission texts of the Mind Series tantras.  The <br> copy of it found amongst the stash of Tun Huang manuscripts <br> hidden in the tenth century and recovered earlier this century, <br> authenticates its age and form.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Here is the Tibetan text:</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><em>sNa tshogs rang bzhin mi gnyis kyang<br> Cha shas nyid du spros dang bral.<br> Ji bzhin pa zhes mi rtog kyang<br> rNam bar snang mdzad kun tu bzang<br> Zin bas rtsol ba'i nad spangs te<br> Lhun gyis gnas pas bzhag pa yin.</em></div>
              <div><em>OM SWASTI!</em></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><strong><br> <span class="TextSubTitle"><a name="DP2">Dzogchen Primer Issue #2</a></span></strong></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Dzogchen is a non-dual path that points to what simply is
              already.  It's theory and methods are not grounded in mentally
              conceived notions of attainment and one who could attain some higher
              state called enlightenment.  It is not a system of gradual attainment
              nor is it a system of sudden attainment.  Dzogchen points to something
              else, a non-alternative View of the way things are already.  In
              Dzogchen all of reality is considered to be primordially perfect from
              the beginning-less beginning.  This essential innate perfection is
              called "primordial purity" or "kadag" in Tibetan. This "kadag" nature
              is the same as Emptiness as described in the Mahayana texts, such as
              the Prajnaparamita teachings.  This is also the fundamental nature of
              the Ground of Being, known as the Dharmakaya.  The Dharmakaya is devoid
              of form and waves of energy in its essential nature, like unchanging
              space.  But this space happens to be aware, not insentient voidness. 
              It is this aware space-like Emptiness that is our true Self or
              Beingness.  It is the unchanging Awareness present in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all </span>energy
              events, whether of an internal or external nature.  This further means
              that in any psychological or emotional condition, that which
              experiences the feelings or thoughts is always this perfect and
              unchanging Awareness as who we are.  This unchanging Awareness cannot
              be improved through study nor by methods of practice.  It is never
              distracted nor affected by karma.  When the body dies, it is completely
              unaffected... just as when all  the clouds disappear in the sky, the sky is still the sky.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The first procedure of Dzogchen is to introduce one to this
              'kadag" nature of one's own being.  The section of Dzogchen teaching,
              that relates to this "Direct Introduction" and the gaining of
              familiarity in its nature, is called "cutting through" or trekchod in
              Tibetan.  This cutting through is explained to be like suddenly cutting
              the rope or twine that binds a bundle of twigs or branches tightly
              bound together.  When the twine is cut the branches spread-out in a
              sort of relaxed manner.   This relates to our tensions and stress being
              cut through and our being left in a totally relaxed state, called in
              Tibetan "lhugpa".  Our sense of being a separate and constricted self
              is the result of solidifying our ego-self concepts resulting in our
              mental energy fixations appearing as a body/mind identity fixed in
              space and time.  The entire structure is held in place by and as
              self-reinforcing tension.  We literally "hold-tight" to who we think we
              are and what we have... always in fear of our possible not-being, death
              or loss.  In the Dzogchen Direct Introduction we see our true face in
              the mirror of Awareness.  We see non-conceptually that we are not our
              mind nor are we our body.  All provisional and false identities are cut
              through and are seen to be lies and illusion.  At that moment a total
              relaxation of body and mind occurs.  That is the path of Trekchod, the
              first phase of Dzogchen.  We then simply continue in that totally
              relaxed State of Being/Awareness.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The central pillar of the Dzogchen teachings is contained in the
              term "Rigpa".  Rigpa means Knowingness or Gnosis.  In Sanskrit the
              equivalent is Vidya.  The terms are opposed to "marigpa" or "avidya"
              both meaning "ignorance".  Ignorance of what?  Ignorance of one's true
              identity or Self-Nature.  In Rigpa awareness we know who and what we
              are non-conceptually.  In marigpa, we don't know who we are.. we think
              we are what we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">think </span>we are.  That mentally conceived identity
              is called "I" or "me"... meaning one's ego.  This imagined
              self-identity, is not different from the self projected that we
              experience in our dreams when asleep.  In Rigpa, that mentally
              conceived identity or ego-sense, is absent.  Rigpa has the sense of
              being everything non-dually.  Rigpa is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not </span>like being an
              impartially detached witness to what is experienced.  There is no
              subject/object dichotomy in Rigpa.  Rigpa is the great Oneness or
              Unified Field, cognizant of Itself as Itself.  You are the universe and
              all possible realities without any partiality or separate
              subjective selfhood observing. There is no one "observing" of
              experience in Rigpa.  In Rigpa you are all experience seemlessly.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The purpose of the Direct Introduction is to bring you to this
              Self-Experience of Rigpa directly.  Often this is just a taste or flash
              that needs to be developed through further methods associated with
              Trekchod.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There are three streams of Dzogchen transmissions.  Semde or the
              Mind-Series deals with a more conceptual understanding and
              offers practices that bring one to the experience of Rigpa.  We will
              explain this approach soon in detail.  Sem-de is all but extinct in
              terms of being an actively promoted practice vehicle.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Next is the approach of Long-de or the Space Series.  This series
              of teachings sees everything as manifestations of primordial Wisdom or
              "yeshe".  The methods of Long-de involve many yogic postures that guide
              the psychic energy into specific channels that bring about an actual
              experience of Rigpa as a self-introduction through one's own practice
              experiences.  Mastering this methodology can bring about the
              realization of the Rainbow Body of Light without practicing thogal.  I
              will explain this section of theory and practices later in this
              series.  Very few practice this series today.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The most common approach used today is the Mengag-de or "whispered
              oral" tradition.  Many have claimed that this is the most direct and
              powerful means to total realization.  The Trekchod series of teachings
              is part of this section.  The second phase of Mengag-de is Thogal which
              deals with revealing and  developing the luminous nature of our
              Awareness.</div>
              <div>We will initially be focusing on the Trekchod phase.  It is taught
              today that by mastering Trekchod, one will attain perfect enlightenment...but
              not achieve Rainbow Body while alive.  However, one still can have
              their physical body completely dissolve into the essential atoms, and
              disappear.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The second phase of Mengag-de deals with the luminous aspect of
              "Kadag".  Emptiness it seems is not empty.  It is luminous.  This
              luminosity arises spontaneously.  Awareness is luminous and manifests
              essentially as Clear Light Awareness yet radiating a five-fold
              interpenetrating color matrix of Light Energy which we call the
              Universe.  More on this section later when we explain Thogal.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The basic focus of our lists here is to offer many styles
              of Direct Introduction to Rigpa, so all may be able to "taste" this
              non-dual State of Awareness for themselves... without need nor recourse to a belief system nor allegiance to some cultural tradition.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Next we will explain several of the skillful means employed in
              Trekchod in order to either directly introduce the State of Rigpa
              or through secondary practices to foster greater familiarity with Rigpa
              once realized.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><a class="TextSubTitle" name="DP3">Dzogchen Primer Issue #3</a></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>The entirety of Dzogchen teachings revolve around the transmission
              of Rigpa.  In understanding what this transmission really is, we have
              to give up previous paradigms of "cause and effect" approaches.  In all
              other Buddhist vehicles that promise to lead to enlightenment, there is
              always the model of practice and understanding that leads one to
              becoming more aware of ones true condition.  Various obstacles to
              realization are removed through various skillful means.  Finally, one
              comes to realize their true nature after the negative elements are
              purified that prevented enlightenment.  One usually had to become a
              more compassionate  and open person... someone free of ego.  That is
              the common theme.  But for Dzogchen the model is completely different,
              radically different.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In Dzogchen there is no one to realize something.  In Dzogchen
              nothing needs to be changed in one's thoughts, feelings or actions. 
              One does not need to become more ethical nor does one need to
              become more</div>
              <div>devotional or compassionate.  Nor does one need faith.  Also there
              is nothing to become certain of.  Doubts don't need to be removed. 
              There are no obstacles preventing realization that need to be
              addressed.  There is absolutely nothing to do.  There are no rules to
              follow.  That being the case, what happens when true transmission
              occurs?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Rigpa is your unchanging state of Being.  It has always been
              perfect and requires no liberation.  This is who you are and have
              always been.  This doesn't change.  You don't suddenly wake up to this
              truth.  You are always this truth.  You haven't become lost in
              suffering and samsara.  Since that is the case, there is then nothing
              the matter.  But it doesn't feel perfect and blissful in this moment,
              how could that be?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Let me try to explain:  Your current awareness is Rigpa already. 
              Thoughts, feelings and perceptions arise in Rigpa continuously. 
              As such, we can say the mind arises in Rigpa.  Rigpa is the context or
              space that everything arises within.  The cognizant quality is always
              uniquely 100% belonging to Rigpa.  Rigpa is the only "knower" of
              experience.  Everything else is what is known. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Imagine a large crystal ball in which bubbles appear and
              disappear within.  Your Awareness as Rigpa is the crystal ball.  The
              thoughts, feelings and sensations are the bubbles arising and
              disappearing within the sphere spontaneously.  Your sense of Being is
              you being the crystal sphere.  The crystal ball is unchanging
              at all times but these various appearances just arise as experiences. 
              This is your energy appearing as those variously appearing bubbles
              within.  There is a particular bubble that arises known as the sense of
              self or me.  It has a complete story of identity made up of many
              thoughts and feelings all associated with it, like a cluster of
              bubbles.  This "me" complex can become quite strong and dominant as the
              central experience.  It is the energy of mind manifesting as the sense
              of being a defined person.  This is the experience of limited ego
              existence in the world of samsara.  This who we think we are.  This
              dream-like self entity occupies our entire field of consciousness.  
              But at no time is this a "real" person or being.  It is just a strong
              experience of subjectivity or self, a projection of mind, a dreamed
              self. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If we approach practice from the view of improving this self (as
              me), to become more aware... we are just becoming more enmeshed in the
              story of me.  Any effort, mental or physical only reinforces the
              illusion that this self can become enlightened, but it can't.  It is a
              thought-complex floating in this sphere or crystal ball of Clear Light
              Awareness.  You, your true and only Self-Being is the unchanging Clear
              Light Sphere of Awareness not its contents.  So, you are still you
              whether all of those internal arisings are powerfully present or not. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The ego-self does not come to realize something or have an insight
              through practice or study that leads to Rigpa.  Nothing leads to
              Rigpa.  Since you are already Rigpa, you cannot become more of Rigpa. 
              Nothing needs to be changed or improved in your current state of
              unchanging Rigpa, you are already perfect.  What does occur is a sudden
              flash of Self-Recognition that has nothing to with thinking mind
              or me-conscioiusness.  The sphere of Awareness, the space of Being
              inwhich all these thoughts, ego and feelings arise, suddenly
              notices Itself.  This is what is called Yeshe or Wisdom/Gnosis.  The
              "me" does not have a realization.  This flash of true identity is
              completely beyond the mind and ego-consciousness.  That which becomes a
              follower of Dzogchen or Buddhism is this ego-self.  That which reads,
              studies and practices a path is the ego-self in an effort to find
              liberation and enlightenment.  But in Self-Recognition, all of the
              practices and study are completely meaningless as that entity never
              attains its goal... but is actually annihiliated in that flash of
              Self-Recognition.  A person who has no training and has been extremely
              evil has the same chance of this flash or Self-Recognition occuring as
              one who has studied and practiced with great accumulation of virtue for
              many years!  The evil and ignorant qualities only pertain to the
              ego-self.  Just as the virtuous qualities and Dharma experienced
              practitioner is also just the ego-self.  Self Recognition is beyond the
              condition of the ego-self and has nothing to do with the spirtual
              development story of "me".  To Rigpa virtue and vice are identical...just equal reflections in the mirror.  The self you think you are is also just a reflection in the mirror of Rigpa.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Perhaps you now have gained a glimpse why Dzogchen is not
              dependent on study or practice.  That is because the one who does the
              studying and practice is not the one who Self-Recognizes!  Only Rigpa
              flashes on Rigpa!  The Realization does not occur to the subjective
              self... the identity who you think you are!  You don't realize Rigpa. 
              You never become enlightened!  Only Rigpa is in the Enlightened state
              and you can never become Rigpa!  That's because you are already <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rigpa, experiencing the sensation of being the ego-self looking for Rigpa! </span> That is completely the reverse of your current viewpoint within the
              dream of being this "me".  That's the shift that occurs suddenly in
              perception.  Instead of being the me looking for Rigpa, you suddenly
              are in the perspective of Rigpa noticing the sense of me as just an
              experience...not an identity.  That's transmission.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The "Direct Introduction" to Rigpa is this transmission.  Rigpa is
              recognizing Itself.  In this case the master is like a mirror and the
              student's Rigpa notices Itself in the mirror of the Rigpa of the Guru. 
              This is real meaning of Guru yoga. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A shift occurs from there being an identity of relative self, our
              ordinary me with its history and story, to a Recognition of true
              Identity as Rigpa.  But the recognition is Rigpa's alone!  It does not
              occur to or in the mind.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>So even such a nice practice as "resting in Awareness", when done as a "practice" is just more ego maneuvering... because there is the ego who is trying to rest in Awareness...just
              more dualism.  Now Rigpa just being Rigpa... is more to the point.  But
              at no time can there be someone who rests in Rigpa!  Who could this one
              resting in Rigpa be, if the Being is already Rigpa? </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>For those who are following this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">closely</span> you may have
              been led down an inescapable path of Direct Introduction. 
              This discussion was not intended to be "about" a Direct
              Introduction" but to actually be a "Direct Introduction".</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>If you intellectualize this ... the opportunity for the flash to
              occur fades.  Just recognize your current awareness to be the
              cognizant Space of your experience, unchanged by all arisings, yet not
              separate from them:  Rigpa.  </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><a class="TextSubTitle" name="DP3A">Dzogchen Primer Issue #3A</a></div>
              <div>In conveying the essential meaning in Dzogchen transmission or
              Direct Introduction, various methods are used.  Most often explanations
              are offered using examples like a mirror and its reflections or a
              crystal prism.  But I would like to use another analogy... let's call
              it the "The Room of Furniture".
              <div> </div>
              <div>Imagine if you will a room filled with various items of
              furniture.  Some of the furniture is in need of repair and the
              furniture is itself strewn about in a disorganized fashion.  In this
              case the furniture represents our body, our thoughts, ego, our
              energies, our perceptions, our actions and our karmic seeds.  All the
              lower vehicles of Buddhism believe one needs to clean (purify) and
              organize the furniture.  So through various practices and meditation,
              we clean and organize our furniture.  When we get the feng shui just
              right... perfectly in accord and in harmony, we realize the
              highest attainment:  the perfectly decorated room that brings eternal
              delight!  So we work hard at getting the job done.  Clean, clean...
              polish... shift this piece here or there... throw away the most
              disliked pieces of furniture and make sure we don't lose the best
              pieces, always keeping an attentive eye on those most special pieces. 
              Then once we have things just right, we then need to maintain the
              stable condition of things so they don't get disorganized again... and
              we need to constantly remain vigilent that things don't get dirty
              again... so much to do!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>All the great furniture feng shui masters inspect and approve of
              the great job...  and point out areas that still need cleaning and
              organizing to accord with the tenents of proper and traditional feng
              shui teachings.  So you do your best to follow the rules and the
              advices offered.  It seems though, you never really ever complete the
              job.  But you keep at it... you are a real trouper!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Now the Dzogchen Master of Room Space drops in for a visit one
              day.  He is all about feeling the space of the room.  He ignores the
              careful placement of the furniture and its polished luster.  But he
              does notice how diligent you appear to be, but also notices
              how fatigued you appear to be.  He explains that the perfectly
              decorated room that brings eternal delight, is not accomplished through
              the correct placement nor in the cleaning of the furniture.  He says
              the aspect that brings eternal delight is actually contained within the
              space of the room not in the furniture.  Because of his depth
              of obvious joyous delight and relaxed demeanor, you are inspired to
              pursue this conversation further. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Master explains that the condition of the furniture has no
              bearing on true eternal delight at all.  He further says that you can
              just leave the furniture exactly as it is.  Dirty or clean it makes no
              difference.  He emphasizes that one needs to understand the unchanging
              space of the room and that no matter what furniture is in or not in the
              room, the space of the room is always unaffected.  You explain that you
              have been told that there is another means where one could get rid of
              all the furniture in the room and one would then have only space in the
              room, and could achieve the eternal delight that way.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Master, explains that the space of the room is not affected
              whether the room is full or empty.  You can experience the eternal
              delight of the space in either a full or empty room equally well.  Not
              sure about this, you still ponder his advice but continue polishing and
              tidying things up while he watches on.  Then you take a break and sit
              down in one of the chairs and begin to notice the space.  But you can't
              really feel and see the space, this special space that could yield
              eternal delight.  You try to "rest in the space" but somehow you still
              feel separate from the space.  You try to think about the space but
              find you can't really picture space quite completely.  In frustration
              you ask the Master to kindly assist you to really be able to get "into"
              the eternally delightful space of the room and he agrees to help.  But
              he says there is nothing that he could say in words that could help ,
              and that you had to just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be</span> the space of the room as it is. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Not getting it, you just slumped down in the chair and peered into
              the dark space of the room intently.  The Master made a motion of his
              hand towards the wall and told you that your looking into the space of
              the room was the space of room looking out through your eyes and asked
              if you could see it now.  In that exact moment, the Master flipped on
              the light switch and instantly the room became filled with light.  In
              total amazement and with a feeling of eternal delight you told the
              Master that yes, you now could see the space of the room and that your
              seeing the space and the space of the room were one and the same, as
              now seen clearly in the flash of unexpected light. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As the Master left the room, you noticed yourself to indeed be the
              space of eternal delight... and most amazing of all was the fact that
              this moment had absolutely nothing to do with the furniture, their
              state of cleanliness nor its proper arrangement!  How amazing that all
              this time that you focused on the furniture, that thereby you missed
              the obvious presence of the unchanging and most delightful space! </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>An interesting story to be sure.  But I am pointing to the fact
              that not unlike space, our Awareness is always right in front of our
              eyes, but it is also that which is seeing out of our eyes.  It has no
              relation to thoughts, ego, feelings, conduct, compassionate activities
              or non-virtuous, perceptions, practices or study.  In this way you may
              now see how ridiculous the notion of cleaning the furniture is or
              arranging the furniture as having some impact on the space of the
              room!  Likewise, ego, mental events, worldy events... nothing has any
              connection with Awareness being already what it is.  You are not a
              piece of furniture...you are only Awareness, and Awareness has never changed identities.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As you peer into the Space of Awareness, if  the Seeing is like
              looking into darkness, just turn on the Light.  In Dzogchen the
              "flipping the switch" to turn on the Light is the
              Direct Introduction as the Light of Transmission.  This path has
              nothing to do with the condition of mind, ego or body and hence no need
              for practice and study.  They are just the furniture.</div>

              <div> </div>
              <div>We conceive that Rigpa or awakened Awareness is some magnificent
              and unbelievable state of consciousness.  In fact it is absolutely
              simple and ordinary.  It is simply aware of what is happening.  It has
              no thoughts about anything nor any opinions nor preferences.  In a
              certain fashion it is like a video camera that records the sights and
              sounds exactly as they are experienced.  The video camera does not have
              the capacity to analyze what it is recording... everything is just left
              as it is.  Rigpa is just like this.  It is not a way of being or some
              special way of relating to one's world of experience.  It is just
              noticing and observing what is manifesting exactly as it manifests.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>What then is the Natural State, which is another name for Rigpa or
              primordial Awareness? In the chair that you are actually sitting in,
              notice the room.  If there is a window, look out the window...notice
              what you see.  Just notice it.  Look at your hands... just notice
              them.  Look at the computer monitor... just notice without assessment
              or evaluation.  Again now, look out the window...just look without
              labelling what is perceived.  Move your head and slowly just look
              around the room that you are in.  Without thinking about anything,
              totally topic free... just be in that moment of simply observing the
              room.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That simple observingness is the Natural State of primordial
              Awareness.  It is not more elaborate or more profound.  It just the
              observing of what is there.  This observing, aware quality of
              consciousness is Rigpa.  How easy!  When we just stay with that
              effortless watching without agenda, that is Rigpa in its Natural
              State.  When engaged in our thinking and evaluating what is perceived,
              that is the functioning of mind... the arising of the the make-believe
              world of labels and opinions.  That is an unnecessary activity added to
              the basic condition of just being...just observing.  This thinking
              "about" what is observed is samsara.  When we just are in naked
              observing we are in Nirvana.  Since our observational awareness is
              functioning in this moment... how can you say you can't grasp Rigpa or
              the Natural State?  This simpe observingness is not the result of
              practice, intellectualizing or study.  You are already observing
              whatever you are observing.  That is Rigpa or the Buddha Mind in its
              most Natural State.  When we say relax into Rigpa or Awareness, that is
              what is relaxed into...just simple noticing-ness or perceivingness. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In this there is nothing to maintian as you are always <span style="text-decoration: underline;">observing, you can't help but observing.</span> 
              This observing quality of consciousness is there by default... isn't
              it?  You are either observing thoughts, feelings, sensations or
              external perceptions.  But the observingness never changes, only the
              experience.  There is absolutely nothing to understand or grasp in this
              perceivingness.  It never knows itself and has no understanding of
              anything... it just is observing like a big eyeball.  That is what you
              are:  just a big eye ball observing, seeing, looking...so to speak. 
              This observing doesn't think or evaluate ...it just is pure being and
              pure being is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> observing.  If you really don't get this
              please let me know... we are so close!  We have covered all the
              angles... nothing is left!</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Abandon the "thinking mind" and just be the observing... it is the
              Absolute as it is.  The "thinkiing mind" is just an unnecessary add-on,
              the genus and dimension of imaginary existence, which is what samsara
              is created from.  No thought... no samsara.  The space of room is just
              there without any need to improve it nor need to try to maintain it. 
              The same with Awareness, our everyday, ordinary awareness...</div>

              <p>So now it is the time to see that it needn’t be seen in this<br>way. No matter how complicated it is, the practice is very<br>simple. This is where we need a lot of patience, because<br>when we’re very complicated, we often times lack<br>patience with ourselves. We’ve got clever minds, we think<br>very quickly and we have strong passions and it’s easy<br>to get lost in all of this. It’s very confusing for us because<br>we don’t know how, we don’t have any way out of it, we<br>don’t know a way to transcend or to see it in perspective.<br>So in pointing to this centre point, to this still point, to<br>the here-and-now, I’m pointing to the way of<br>transcendence or the escape from it. Not escape by<br>running away out of fear, but the escape hatch that allows<br>us to get perspective on the mess, on the confusion, on</p>
              <p>the complicated self that we have created and identify<br>with.<br>It’s very simple and it’s not complicated, but if you<br>start thinking about it, then you can make it very<br>complicated, with such thoughts as, “Oh, I don’t know<br>if I can do that...” But that’s where this trust comes in:<br>if you’re aware that “Oh, I don’t know...” is a perception<br>in the present; “I don’t think I could ever realise<br>Nibbàna (freedom from attachments),” is a perception<br>in the present — trust in that awareness. That’s all<br>you need to know. It is what it is. We’re not even judging<br>that perception. We’re not saying, “What a stupid<br>perception.” We’re not adding anything. And that<br>awareness of it, that’s what I’m pointing to, the<br>awareness. Learn to trust in that awareness rather than<br>in what the perception is saying. The perception might<br>even be common sense in a way, but the attachment<br>to it is where you get lost in it. “We should practise<br>meditation. We should not be selfish and we should<br>learn to be more disciplined and more responsible<br>for our lives.“ That’s very good advice, but if I attach to<br>that, what happens? I go back to thinking: “I’m not<br>responsible enough, I’ve got to become more<br>responsible and I shouldn’t be selfish. I’m too selfish<br>and I shouldn’t be,” and I’m back onto the turning<br>wheel again. One gets intimidated even by the best<br>advice. What to do? Trust in the awareness of it. “I<br>should be responsible” — it is seen and one’s<br>relationship to it is no longer that of grasping it. Maybe<br>if that resonates as something to do, then be more<br>responsible. It’s not a matter of denying, blotting out,<br>condemning or believing but of trusting in the attitude</p>
              <p>of attention and awareness rather than endlessly<br>trying to sort it out on the turning wheel with all its<br>complicated thoughts and habits, where you just get<br>dizzy and totally confused.<br>The still point gives you perspective on the conditions,<br>on the turning wheel, on the confusion, on the mess.<br>It puts you into a relationship to it, that is knowing it<br>for what it is, rather than some kind of personal identity<br>with it. Then you can see that your true nature is this<br>knowing, this pure state, pure consciousness, pure<br>awareness. You are learning to remember that, to be<br>that — your real home — what you really are rather<br>than what you think you are according to the<br>conditioning of your mind.</p>

              <p><em><span id="textNode_24856926" class="threadText">Hey guys!<br><br>Inspired
              by Dave's amazingly interesting thread - the phenomenological fruits of
              practice - and a convo with another member of this forum on tips on
              daily practice - I thought we could each post tips that we have
              personally found valuable in generating real-world phenomenological
              fruits of the path. Perhaps tips our future selves would give our
              present self.<br><br>Some basic cursory tips and context is as follows:<br><br>Over-thinking
              is just a habit whose tyranny may be broken as so many others; habits
              are subtle, common and promoted by our culture. The essential point is,
              being lost in mind is merely a habit of mind, as such, can be ‘cut
              through’ like all habitual preoccupations of mind with the below tips.<br><br>When
              I notice any mental habit pattern, I just notice ‘it’ (with it being a
              place marker for whatever IT is – name your ‘apparent’ problem) and
              upon noticing it, let it rest of its own accord - no big deal - nothing
              is a big deal in this context. It is we who make something a 'big'
              deal, and WE who let it go - all habits of mind - reactions to some
              'It'! <br><br>Practice is ongoing and has its ups and downs, as I fall
              back into distraction - out of relaxed, 'uncontrived', natural present
              moment awareness - I simply notice it, and back into present moment
              awareness - so simple; no big deal!<br><br>The practice is this: just
              do the above. Be natural at all times; mindful of the present –
              naturally aware. Mindful of habitually trying to ‘do’, or ‘not to do’,
              which is by definition, contrived, and not natural present moment
              awareness. Rest in that natural open spaciousness. Thing is, we ARE it
              naturally; so DOING or TRYING is ego. Notice the doing of ego, and
              relax that - let ego dissolve, which by definition, leaves natural
              pristine cognizance which sees and knows all phenomena as it is.
              Simple! :-) This is heart advice for on the cushion and off.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span id="textNode_24856967" class="threadText">Augment the above
              non-dual practice with practicing Jhana meditation. Jhana has two
              benifets: it relaxes the mind and ego, making it easier to be
              spontaneously happy and natural, which sets up conditions which make it
              easier to let go of the habit of ego ‘doership’ and practice natural,
              uncontrived, present moment awareness – perhaps going to 4th Jhana
              (through Shamatha) and then moving to natural, uncontrived, present
              moment awareness (non-shamatha vipassana - clear seeing of what is);
              and (2), Jhana has a transformative effect on said body/mind and
              consciousness through awakening and transforming chi and kundalini
              energy; leading in a circular fashion back to (1). <br><br>Processing of unconscious material will likely result.  Refer to previous tips on habits of mind.<br><br>The
              thing is, Rigpa is none other than natural present moment awareness -
              the intrinsic pristine clarity of reality itself - however, being
              trapped in ego - as a habit patern - which is both a view and an
              energetic state of body/mind/consciousness, we fail to experientially
              notice our natural state here and now - natural present moment
              awareness. :-)<br><br>Simple.  Both easy and very difficult to do. ;-P<br><br>Oh,
              a final tip. The more time spent on the cushion in practice that you
              do, the easier it will be. At least half hour per sitting, twice a day.
              Optimally, three, one hour sittings will be noticed to have a profound
              effect on your well-being, happiness and ability to let the ego ‘habit’
              dissolve and directly notice Rigpa. I mean this literally. Practice
              does bring results!</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span id="textNode_24857869" class="threadText">Notice that habit
              patterns needn't necessarily cease in and of themselves, and yet they
              spontaneously come go - naturally self-liberate - so thinking, emoting
              and any other display may be ongoing, and we are just mindful of this
              in an uncontrived manner, in present moment awareness; however, falling
              into distraction - getting lost in the display, and thus, lost in the
              elaboration - no longer naturally aware in the pristine clarity of
              present moment awareness is the source of our suffering - hence,
              non-dual practice in the natural state.</span></em></p>

              <h2><a href="http://innerrave.org/meditation.html">http://innerrave.org/meditation.html</a><br></h2>
              <h2>Meditation</h2>
              <p>Here is a more formal introduction to meditation,
                  including a variety of exercises.  Try them for
                  yourself and see which ones work for you.</p>
              <p>The definition of meditation is "to be undistracted".
                  The question then becomes "undistracted from what?"</p>
              <p>We possess six senses.  The traditional five are
                  sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell.  In addition
                  we have the mental faculty of awareness which perceives
                  objects of the five sense fields as well as mental
                  objects such as thoughts, memories and emotions.</p>
              <p>The following exercises are all "non blocking awareness"
                  exercises.  Non blocking means that we are not blocking
                  any of the sense fields and we are not blocking our
                  thoughts.  This is very important to understand.
                  We keep our eyes open and we stay open to all sensations
                  and our environment.  We will never experience freshness
                  by avoiding what is.</p>
              <p>Fresh awareness is the result of being undistracted and open
                  to what is.  These exercises are training in freshness.</p>
              <h3>Visual Awareness</h3>
              <p>Visual awareness of an object has two parts.  First, our
                  eyes have to be looking at it.  Second, our mind
                  needs to be aware of it.  If our mind is wandering and
                  thinking about something else then we are not aware of
                  the visual object even if our eyes are focused on it.
                  That is called being distracted.</p>
              <p>Pick a visual object in your field of view and look
                  at it with your eyes and at the same time be aware of it
                  with your mind.  Do not overfocus on it, concentrate, or
                  try to block out any of the other senses or suppress
                  your thoughts.  If your eyes play tricks on you
                  such as seeing double pay no attention to that and
                  continue looking at the object while being aware
                  of the object.</p>
              <p>Do not label, judge or think about what you are seeing.
                  Just the bare awareness of the visual object itself.
                  Keep your eyes on the object.  Keep your mind
                  merely aware of the object.  If your attention
                  wanders off simply bring it back.</p>
              <p>That is meditation!  Nothing more to it.  You are being
                  undistractedly aware of a visual object, and that is training
                  your mind to be in the present moment, to be undistracted.</p>
              <p>The essence of sight is luminosity-emptiness, always
                  fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake in that recognition.</p>
              <h3>Awareness of Sound</h3>
              <p>If there is a continuous sound in your environment
                  you can pay attention to that, or simply be aware
                  aware of all sounds as they arise.  No need to focus
                  your ear organs since they are always on.  If you find
                  that your mind is no longer aware of the sound
                  bring yourself back to bare awareness of the sound
                  or sounds.</p>
              <p>Do not think about what is making the sound
                  or judge the sound as good or bad.  Just
                  hear the actual sound itself without any
                  conceptual filter.</p>
              <p>The essence of sound is communication-emptiness,
                  always fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake
                  in that recognition.</p>
              <h3>Awareness of Sensation</h3>
              <p>Sit upright with your eyes open.  Place you mind in
                  awareness of the sensations of your breathing in
                  and out.  Your feel your chest and stomach move.
                  You can feel the air moving in and out of your nose.
                  If your mind wanders off, bring it back to undistracted
                  awareness of the breathing process.</p>
              <p>Do not overfocus in the breathing.  As an antidote
                  for that, pay attention to the sensation of the outbreath
                  and just relax during the inbreath.  Pay attention and relax,
                  pay attention and relax.</p>
              <p>Do not attempt to suppress your thoughts or block out the other
                  sense fields.  Simple bare awareness of the breath.</p>
              <p>The essence of sensation is presence-emptiness,
                  always fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake
                  in that recognition.</p>
              <p>Thats it!  Very easy and excellent awareness training
                  using your sense fields.  You can make up your own exercises
                  for taste and smell if you like.  I use chocolate and
                  freshly roasted coffee beans :-)</p>
              <p>While dancing leave the sense fields wide open.
                  Dance keenly aware and relaxed within the flow of
                  sensation.</p>
              <h3>Awareness of Thoughts</h3>
              <p>Just about every meditator, myself included, gets confused
                  about what meditation is really about.  For example we
                  might think "Since I regularly get distracted from nowness
                  by getting lost in thoughts, therefore the solution is to stop
                  thinking."  <strong>Not!</strong> We will never stop thinking.
                  Attempting to suppress our thoughts is like a futile
                  attempt to stop the wind itself from blowing.</p>
              <p>Why is attempting to stop thoughts futile?  Because
                  the thought "I must stop thinking" is a thought.
                  The more we think that thought the more thoughts
                  arise.  By fighting with them we are actually
                  feeding them.  We end up with hundreds of thoughts
                  and we feel defeated, like we are bad failed meditators.</p>
              <p>Whenever we have thoughts in meditation we should
                  welcome them with open arms!  We say to ourselves:
                  "I will notice every single thought the instant
                  that it arises and I will recognize every single
                  thought as being just a thought, nothing more,
                  nothing less."</p>
              <p>The moment that we recognize that "this thought is just
                  a thought" we are instantly liberated from this
                  thought!  Since this is just a thought there is no need
                  to follow it.  Since this is just a thought there is
                  no need to get rid of it!  This thought becomes
                  the expression of present awareness.  This thought
                  loses its power to absorb us and fades by itself.</p>
              <p>The very next moment another thought may arise
                  and we can recognize that this new thought is just a thought.
                  One by one we are liberated from every single
                  thought that arises.  Pretty soon all thoughts
                  lose their power to entrap us.  They are all
                  expressions of lucid wakefulness and no longer
                  distract us from awareness.</p>
              <p>There is a famous saying "Seen by merely looking,
                  freed by merely seeing."  It really is just that
                  easy.</p>
              <p>The essence of thought is awareness-emptiness,
                  always fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake
                  in that recognition.</p>
              <p>People often try to escape from their obsessive
                  thinking by way of alcohol and drugs.  That
                  kind of relief is temporary and incomplete.
                  While dancing liberate thoughts by recognizing
                  them as simply thoughts.</p>
              <h3>Awareness Without Focus</h3>
              <p>Once we have mastered undistracted awareness of the
                  senses and learned to liberate all thoughts it is time
                  to meditate without any focus at all.</p>
              <p>The act of focusing on nowness is a subtle manipulation,
                  a kind of holding on to something.  We can let go of that
                  effort and rest in wakeful awareness without any focus
                  at all.  Nothing to meditate on, yet not distracted
                  from open awareness.</p>
              <p>This is called "undistracted nonmeditation".  Start your
                  session by saying "I will not be distracted. 
                  I will not meditate."  By nonmeditation we mean
                  no focus, no effort, no manipulation, no modification
                  of anything.  Really, seriously, don't meditate at all.
                  Leave things just as they are!</p>
              <p>When thoughts arise welcome them with open arms
                  as explained above.  When thoughts do not arise
                  simply rest wide awake without doing anything at all.</p>
              <p>Do not modify your state of mind in the slightest.
                  Accept it just as it is right now without any alteration.
                  It is impossible to improve on nonconceptual awareness
                  wisdom so don't bother trying!</p>
              <p>Just rest completely relaxed and vividly awake without
                  holding any thought or concept in your mind.  Be undistracted
                  from holding nothing whatsoever in mind.  This is the wisdom
                  of unfixated open awareness which is always with us
                  whether we recognize it or not.</p>
              <p>Rest easily, keenly aware, without any focus or effort.
                  This is the awakened state.  Nothing more, nothing less.
                  Anyone who composes themselves in the awakened state
                  on a regular basis is quickly becoming enlightened.</p>
              <p>The essence of awareness is wisdom-emptiness, always
                  fresh, never fixated.  Rest wide awake in that recognition.</p>
              <p>Dance in the awakened state, spontaneous, joyful
                  and free.  Dance and meditation are one.</p>

              <p>Tsoknyi Rinpoche:</p>
              <p>For a beginner in this practice, in the first moment we notice
                  that we are carried away, that we are distracted.  The second moment
                  is to remind oneself to recognize the essence.  In the third moment
                  one arrives back in the innate state.  That is the moment of recognizing.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is possible to arrive in the state of rigpa while walking,
                  sometimes while eating.  All of a sudden we are wide awake, in the state
                  of rigpa.  Nowhere is it written that you can only recognize the nature
                  of your mind while sitting on your meditation cushion!  For some people
                  it may be easier to recognize mind essence while walking.  Rigpa is
                  something which is possible to acknowledge at any moment, in any
                  situation.  How can it happen at any time, in any situation?  When
                  there's a gap between two thoughts, the intrinsic nature is revealed as
                  self-existing awareness.  When the past thought has ceased and the future
                  thought hasn't occurred yet there's a gap, and in that gap you can discover
                  your intrinsic nature.  But this gap is not necessarily very long.</p>
              <p>That's why it is said "short moments, many times."  From this angle,
                  then, within one meditation session it's fine to repeat the recognition of
                  mind essence many times - twenty times, thirty times, whatever.  First
                  you recognize mind essence.  You let be.  You allow it to last a while.
                  Then you lose track, you get distracted.  Then again at some point you
                  remind yourself.  Again, let the meditation state last for a while.  In this
                  way you alternate between meditating and being distracted.  You meditate,
                  the meditation gets destroyed, you try again, it gets destroyed, you
                  try again.  Like that.</p>
              <p>Getting really good at this meditation involves growing used to,
                  getting accustomed to, rather than <em>doing</em>, because its not a meditation
                  on some "thing".  As a matter of fact, recognizing self-existing awareness
                  totally destroys the act of meditating.  Just let it be.  Immediately.
                  Be sharp.  Direct.  Let be.</p>

              Meditation<br><br>When I dissolve into that vast expanse— empty and 
              clear—without end, without limits— There is no diffèrence between mind 
              and sky.<br><br>—LAMA SHABKAR<br><br><br>SkyGazing is the core practical
               application of Dzogchen meditation. It is how we learn to relax, let 
              go, and let be in the natural state of things, just as they are. It is 
              my favorite form of trekchod practice and natural meditation.<br><br>Through
               this practice of natural meditative awareness, our innate wakefulness 
              completely unfurls and reveals itself. We gradually release our small, 
              narrow, egotistical, dualistic minds into the nondual, skylike, infinite
               buddha mind, while meditating on the expansive, inclusive nature of 
              rigpa: our natural wisdom-mind and innate wakefulness. In this practice,
               we merge the finite, thinking heart-mind with the absolute, 
              unconditional infinity of essential buddha-like being.<br><br>The 
              sky—which represents the element of expansive space in this meditation 
              practice—is without shape or color. No one can say exactly where it 
              begins or where it ends. It just is. This makes it an ideal subject or 
              metaphor for Dzogchen meditation. SkyGazing meditation leads us into a 
              way of being that is in perfect harmony, attunement, and oneness with 
              nature, including everything and everyone around us—and with our own 
              true nature, too. In SkyGazing meditation, we dissolve into the infinite
               by becoming one with the open sky.<br><br>There are three stages to 
              SkyGazing meditation:<br><br><br>•	Arriving<br><br>•	Intensifying<br><br>•
              	Allowing<br><br>ARRIVING<br><br>Sit on the floor, on a cushion, or in a
               chair. Your back should be erect, but not rigid. Rest your arms on your
               thighs, wherever they naturally fall. Your eyes remain open for this 
              meditation.<br><br>INTENSIFYING<br><br>Bring your awareness to the 
              out-breath. Do not change the rhythm or depth of your breathing—just 
              notice how the air feels as it leaves your body. Your out-breath takes 
              you outside of your small self and connects you with everything that is.
               Let the in-breath occur naturally, but without placing any special 
              attention on it. Rest your gaze softly on your surroundings. About half 
              of your attention should be on your breath, while the other half is 
              aware of the sky.<br><br>ALLOWING<br><br>Lean back slightly and raise 
              your gaze until the sky fills your field of vision. Open your senses to 
              the elements. As thoughts, feelings, and perceptions arise—as they 
              inevitably will—release them gently, without judgment. Neither follow 
              nor suppress them. Just be a flow of pure energy in the infinite 
              vastness of space.<br><br>It is important to keep in mind that there is 
              no way to do this meditation “wrong.” Whatever you feel, whatever you 
              are aware of, is simply what is. Your practice is to keep letting go of 
              the speedy, judgmental, reactive everyday mind and return to this 
              restful, innate awareness. If you find your mind wandering or your body 
              tensing, stop and relax. Take a break, take a deep breath, chant “AH,” 
              and start again—refreshed, vivid, wakeful. How long you manage to remain
               aware is not important: it is the quality of awareness not the quantity
               that counts. There need not be a struggle involved. You can start again
               every moment, every second. What is important is the quality of your 
              experience. It might take a while to get used to this, but try to relax 
              into it and let go of ordinary ideas about meditation and habitual 
              reference points.<br><br>There is a guided session of SkyGazing 
              meditation included as Track 5 on the enclosed CD. After you have 
              learned the basic practice, I encourage you to practice on your own, 
              gradually extending the periods of silent awareness, yet without forcing
               anything. Let the buddha within—your internal buddha nature—be your 
              guide.<br><br>LISTEN TO TRACK 5 SkyGazing Meditation<br><br>INFORMAL 
              SKYGAZING<br><br>SkyGazing means opening up and decontracting, 
              space-mingling, dissolving in the infinite. You can practice it at any 
              time: while resting at home, taking a break at work, or during 
              transitions in your day. At these times, simply gaze into the sky or any
               undifferentiated expanse of space—such as a ceiling (if you are lying 
              in bed), a blank wall, or a green lawn. Use this infinite panorama of 
              emptiness as a metaphor for openness and awareness, release your 
              fixations and preoccupations, breathe out—and simply let go into it.<br><br>PRACTICING
               SKYGAZING ON YOUR OWN<br><br>SkyGazing meditation can be done indoors 
              or outdoors. You begin by taking your meditation seat. Close your eyes, 
              rest your hands wherever comfortable, take a deep breath, and then let 
              it out. Then take another breath and relax. Let go. Drop everything, 
              settle naturally, and rest at ease. Let any thoughts, emotions, or 
              physical sensations pass by like waves in the sea or like clouds in the 
              sky, while simply observing their transparent, rainbow like nature. Be 
              still and rest in the present moment, in nowness. When you find your 
              thoughts drifting off, gently return to open awareness. For just this 
              moment, relax into a feeling that there is nothing to do right now, 
              nothing to figure out, understand, or achieve. Simply be present, 
              attentive, aware.<br><br>Breathe in and out, deeply and slowly, letting 
              go a little bit more with each out-breath. Let everything quiet down 
              naturally, by itself. Let the body settle naturally in its own place, in
               its own time. Let the mind also settle naturally, in its own way, in 
              its own time. Let everything go; let be. The three essential components 
              of this first part of the SkyGazing meditation are to breathe, smile, 
              and relax.<br><br>When you have settled down and feel a sense of 
              alertness, calmness, and present awareness, open your eyes and raise 
              your gaze to the sky. Gaze evenly into space with a soft focus. Do not 
              force a stare; just rest your eyes on and in the vast and 
              undifferentiated spacious expanse before you. Space, like mind, has no 
              beginning or end, no inside or outside, no actual form, no color, no 
              size, no shape. Mingle your gaze with this space; merge yourself and 
              your mind with infinite, empty space. Dissolve into space until you 
              become spacious awareness itself. As you exhale, exhale into space, 
              following your out-breath into external space. Allow all of your 
              thoughts, feelings, sensations, and emotions to come and go freely, 
              letting everything that enters your awareness dissolve into vast space, 
              and experience the radiant transparency of free-flowing present 
              awareness.<br><br>Continue gazing freely into vast space, into the open 
              sky, with the crystal clarity of naked awareness, and let everything go.
               Breathe the sky in and Out, and breathe and dissolve into the sky with 
              your out-breath. Follow the out-breath all the way out into space. 
              Mingle with the sky, and slowly dissolve totally into the spacious ,joy 
              of meditation. When a thought arises, watch it come, and watch it go. 
              ‘When a feeling presents itself, watch as it passes away by itself, 
              without interference or manipulation. ‘When you become aware that the 
              quality of your attention is fading, see if you can bring it back by 
              returning your attention to the natural in-and-out motion of the breath,
               focusing your attention on following your out-breath and letting 
              everything dissolve with it. Continue this process until you are resting
               evenly in luminous centerless emptiness.</td>

              <h1>NEW-A Windy Metaphor</h1>
              <p>There is a prevailing belief in spiritual talk that we have to 
              get rid of thoughts or that thought is bad.  Thoughts appear to create 
              suffering, seeking, and conflict only when they are mistakenly taken to 
              be appearing to a "me."  But in the recognition that your real identity 
              is like space, this belief is seen to be unnecessary.  What you are is 
              like space, emptiness, or awareness.  Pick any of those words.  The word
               is pointing to a thought-free, non-conceptual being that sits there 
              looking at THESE WORDS.  Let the word and all words fall away gently 
              right now and simply recognize that which sees everything in the room.  
              It sees objects appearing "externally" like "clock," "wall," and 
              "door."  And it sees objects appearing "internally" like "thoughts," 
              "emotions," and "sensations."  But the seeing itself is not any of those
               objects.  So it isn't an "it."  It isn't a thing.  And the objects 
              seen are not separately existing "objects."  They are concepts appearing
               within the objectless awareness.  By emphasizing concepts rather than 
              recognizing the awareness that sees all concepts, you believe that life 
              is made of separately existing things and that you are one of those 
              things. </p>
              <p>But don't trust what is being said here.  See for yourself.  Take one
               moment and let all thought drop away gently until you recognize a pure,
               non-conceptual seeing (or being) as what you are.  In that moment, 
              there is no name, no word for what you are.  And there is no name or 
              word for anything else either.  Yet what you are, whatever that is, is 
              still here even when no word or name comes to it.  In that moment of 
              looking as non-conceptual awareness, there is no way to know that 
              something exists separately from something else.  It is only conceptual 
              thinking that makes separation appear.  Your real identity cannot be 
              found in any concept because you are the aware space that sees all 
              concepts come and go.  Only an idea like "I'm Joe" or "I'm a person" 
              would give the appearance that you exist separately from the rest of 
              life.  </p>
              <p>This aware space is what you are and  all appearances come and go 
              inseparably within it.  All appearances, no matter what they are, come 
              and go.  That includes every thought, emotion, state, experience, and 
              event.  These are all registered by the cognizing space that is 
              experienced directly when you drop all thought.  That cognizing space 
              does not leave when thought is dropped.  And it does not leave when 
              thought is happening.  Therefore, ultimately, it doesn't matter whether 
              there is thinking or not.  What you are never leaves.  That space has 
              never gone anywhere.  It doesn’t move through time.  The story of you 
              (and every thought you have about yourself) is a set of thoughts 
              appearing and disappearing in the timeless space that sees these words 
              right now.  Time itself does not arise until thought arises.  Because 
              the "me" is a story in time, the "me" story does not appear until 
              thought appears.  Others don't exist in the way you think they do 
              either.  Others are also thoughts.  See for yourself.  You can only know
               that there is a person existing separately from life when you think 
              their name into existence or imagine them with a thought.  When those 
              thoughts are not appearing, life doesn't go away.  It's still here.  
              This is revealing that life is not conceptual.  And it's revealing that 
              separation is not ultimately real.  It is a product of 
              conceptualization. </p>
              <p>But this doesn't mean we have to get rid of thought.  Only another 
              thought would say that anyway. </p>
              <p>The analogy of space and wind is helpful.  These words, and all words
               and thoughts, are like movements of wind.  They appear and disappear in
               what you are—space.  No movement of wind can harm space or define it.  
              Space is simply present and formless.  It is not any object.  It is not 
              any appearance.  It is what sees all objects and appearances.  And 
              without the space, no object or appearance can be seen.  This is why it 
              is said that awareness (or space) is inseparable from what appears 
              within space (i.e., appearances, words, objects, thoughts, emotions).  
              Without this cognizing space, nothing can be thought, felt, known, or 
              experienced.  But the space itself is not a thing.  It is never 
              experienced as an object.  It is the cognizing, timeless awareness that 
              has always been right here in the present moment regardless of the many,
               many thoughts and other obejcts that seem to have moved through the 
              space in what you call “your life," which is just a story. </p>
              <p>In this recognition, thought is seen to not be the enemy.  It is not 
              anything to get rid of.  Does a movement of wind harm space?  The 
              movement of wind is not separate from the space.  The movement never 
              happens outside of space.  In other words, no thought has ever appeared 
              outside of the awareness that is looking right now.  So the awareness is
               what you are and the thoughts come and go within what you are.  But 
              when this is really seen, fully, nothing that comes through awareness is
               held onto.  It is all seen as totally fleeting.  So in one moment, you 
              may be having an argument with your spouse because, in that moment, a 
              thought comes through and you mistake your identity as space for this 
              movement of thought coming through (this opinion).  But in simply 
              recognizing yourself as the space in which the thought is coming 
              through, there is a recognition of awareness.  Then you see that the 
              thoughts that are coming through are appearances in what you are.  They 
              are not what you are.  You are the space.  And so the argument with your
               spouse is not made into a problem.  And neither are the emotions that 
              came through during the arguments.  They were just movements of wind 
              appearing and disappearing in the unmovable space that you are.  It's 
              not about getting rid of any of those movements.  It's just about seeing
               your real identity as awareness and noticing that awareness doesn't 
              have an agenda to be rid of anything.  This is total acceptance. </p>
              <p>You may continue arguing with your spouse or you may apologize.  Who 
              knows?  These pointers are not about doing or not doing something.  They
               are pointing to seeing that everything, even an apology, is a movement 
              of wind appearing and disappearing within space. This is perfect freedom
               and total forgiveness of each moment, and each conversation.  
              Everything appears, disappears, and leaves no trace. The "me" could be 
              said to be a collection of breezes.  It's the energy that tries to own 
              or identify with whatever breeze is coming through.  In recognizing that
               you are the space in which every breeze comes through and that you 
              could not and are not any breeze (because what you are does not come and
               go), then breeze "collecting" stops.  That doesn't mean that thought 
              stops necessarily.  It means that there is seen to be no center, no 
              "you" there that needs to cling to or identify with any breeze coming 
              through.  And there is no center, no "you," trying to keep breezes from 
              coming through.  No "you" trying to control anything because there is NO
               YOU.   Everything is seen to be appearing just as it is, exactly as it 
              is. </p>
              <p>In spiritual teachings, you often hear that, in recognizing that you 
              are this space (or being, or awareness), your mind will go quiet.  It is
               said that thought will stop appearing.  Maybe and maybe not.  That's 
              not really the point, is it?  Space has never been at war with the 
              breezes that pass through it.  Space has no agenda to get rid of the 
              movements of wind.  Only a "me" that likes to cling to a particular 
              experience (like a quiet mind or a busy mind) will have a preference for
               whether there is thinking or no thinking.  Do you see the freedom in 
              this?  It means there is no state (including a quiet mind) that you have
               to achieve.  All states are just more breezes.  This means that, in 
              recognizing you are this timeless space, right here, right now, nothing 
              can harm you.  Nothing can define you.  Nothing can touch you.  You 
              remain perfectly stable no matter whether there is thinking or no 
              thinking, feeling or no feeling, this state or that state, this argument
               or no argument, this belief or no belief.  In this seeing, knowledge, 
              opinions, views, and everything else within the so-called conceptual 
              realm are allowed to be totally.  There is no war with thought in this 
              seeing. Like a transparent hologram in which space is seen to permeate 
              every form, thought is seen to be none other than space itself.   Just 
              as a breeze is inseparable from space, thought is seen to be inseparable
               from awareness.  The two are inseparable.  They are "not two."  This 
              ends the idea that thought is bad or that non-dual realization or 
              spiritual awakening is about some dualistic notion of thinking v. not 
              thinking.  Only a person clings to either view.   Only a "me."  In the 
              recognition of awareness, all ideas are allowed to be but none of them 
              are held onto.  Space does not collect breezes.</p>
