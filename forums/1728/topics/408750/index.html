              offer surprisingly divergent views on the meaning of nirvana. Where does your
              path lead?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;">By Gil Fronsdal,
              Tulku Thubten Rinpoche, and Roko Sherry Chayat<span style="font-family: Helvetica; color: #888888;"></span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">In the centuries following the Buddha’s death,
              dharma teachings spread from India into the rest of Asia, evolving eventually
              into the three<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">yanas,</span></em><span> </span>or vehicles for the
              teachings—Theravada, Vajrayana, and Mahayana, the predominant traditions of
              Southeast Asia, Tibet, and East Asia, respectively. The doctrinal distinctions
              that arose have caused fundamental aspects of what the Buddha taught to be
              disputed. Even the teachings on such essential matters as karma, enlightenment,
              and rebirth vary in the three yanas, and from school to school within the yanas—now
              more so than ever with Western epistemologies stirred into the doctrinal
              diaspora.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><em><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Tricycle</span></em><span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">editors—and likely lots of other dharma students—are
              frequently asked for the “Buddhist” take on everything from premarital sex to
              cloning to cosmetic surgery. The problem is, no single answer emerges from all
              the branches of Buddhism that have sprouted around the world. A Soto Zen
              response to the question “Does heaven exist?” diverges drastically from a Pure
              Land view or a Theravada teaching; even practical questions about how dharma
              practitioners celebrate the Buddha’s birthday, get married, or care for the
              dead elicit distinct responses pointing to distinct anniversaries, histories,
              and rituals, depending on who you ask and where you look.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt; background: white;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">In an effort to point to the profound
              variance between “Buddhisms” and teachings,<em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Tricycle</span></em><span> </span>takes a look at three basic views of
              nirvana, its aspects and attainment, from a Theravada, Vajrayana, and a Rinzai
              Zen (Mahayana) teacher. While Tulku Thubten, a Vajrayana teacher, sees the
              possibility of sudden, unexpected, and even repeated enlightenment, Gil
              Fronsdal, a Theravada teacher, has described the process of reaching the
              “deathless” as akin to desalinating a glass of seawater: the fresh water is
              there, but getting out the salt—our delusion—is a task of dedication,
              meticulously applied, over time. And in Zen master Sherry Roko Chayat’s essay,
              we have enlightenment in “this very moment, this very place; we are 'all done'
              just as we are.” The differences, perhaps, will speak for themselves.<span> </span><strong><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">—Mary

              news of Theravada Buddhism: it means complete liberation. Naturally, people
              want to know about the nature of nibbana, but from the Theravada standpoint,
              knowing<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">how</span></em><span> </span>a
              person is transformed in attaining nibbana is more important than understanding<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">what</span></em><span> </span>it is.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">When a person is thirsty, what’s important about water is not its
              chemical properties, but that it quenches thirst. Similarly, for someone who is
              suffering, what’s important about nibbana is not so much its nature but that
              its attainment extinguishes suffering.<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Nirvana</span></em><span> </span>(Sanskrit) and<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Nibbana</span></em><span> </span>(Pali, the language of the earliest
              Buddhist texts) literally mean “to go out”—like a fire—and “to cool.” Applied
              to the mind, it refers to extinguishing the fevers of greed, hate, and
              delusion, the three roots of suffering. The Buddha’s choice of this term was
              intimately tied to the imagery of his famous Fire Sermon. Here he said:
              “Everything is on fire; the eyes are on fire; sights are on fire; visual
              perception is on fire. . . ; the ears are on fire. . . ; the nose is on fire. .
              . ; the tongue is on fire. . . ; the body is on fire. . . ; the mind is on
              fire. . . . They are on fire with greed, hate, and delusion” (from the<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Mahavagga</span></em>of
              the Theravada Vinaya).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">In the language of the Buddha, the word for fuel and for clinging
              is the same:<em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">upadana.</span></em><span> </span>The Buddha understood that suffering
              arises from and is fueled by clinging. When the fuel is removed, suffering is
              extinguished. By understanding how deep-rooted and subtle clinging is in our
              own unliberated minds, we come to appreciate the mind of nibbana as
              refreshingly cool and peaceful.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Nibbana is the end of<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">samsara.</span></em><span> </span>Contrary to a popular
              misunderstanding, neither nibbana nor samsara is a place. In attaining nibbana
              we don’t escape from one location to another. For the Buddha, samsara is the
              process by which clinging gives rise to suffering which, in turn, gives rise to
              further clinging. He understood that this self-perpetuating process continues
              over lifetimes as the “fuel” for rebirth, just as the fire from one burning
              house is carried to a neighboring house by the wind. Nibbana is what is
              realized when the clinging of greed, hate, and delusion is brought to an end.
              Some later Buddhist traditions equate nirvana and samsara. However, they likely
              attribute very different meanings to these words than those understood by the
              earliest Buddhist tradition. In Theravada teachings, samsara cannot be nibbana
              any more than a clenched fist can be an open hand, any more than burning ember
              in your fist can be the same as letting it go. For the Buddha,<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">nibbana</span></em><span> </span>had quite positive associations—after
              all, it is a simile for ultimate freedom and awakening. At times he used other
              similes to describe this state: “the blissful, the secure, the pure, the
              island, the shelter, the harbor, the refuge, the ultimate.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Other, more perplexing, synonyms include “the unconstructed, the
              ageless, the deathless, the featureless.” These refer to the idea that<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">nibbana</span></em><span> </span>does not exist as something that can
              be made, shaped, or willed. It is not a “ground of being” from which anything
              subject to death can arise. Although there is a consciousness, “featureless,
              infinite, and luminous all around,” that is associated with nibbana, it is not
              dependent on the conditioned world. Nor does it produce the conditioned world.
              Rather, it is a dimension of consciousness totally independent of circumstances
              in the world or in one’s personal life. Because nibbana is independent, people
              who fully realize it are said to be “unestablished”—in other words, free from
              any clinging that would confine their consciousness to any point in space or
              time.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Experiencing nibbana is like taking a dip in a refreshing pond. A
              quick dip and we are slightly refreshed. With a long soak we are thoroughly
              refreshed. Even the first, brief dip into nibbana is a powerful lesson in the
              possibility of a great happiness, freedom, and peace not dependent on the
              conditions of the world. As long as someone believes happiness can only be
              found through the right conditions, it makes sense to cling to those
              conditions—even when knowing full well that all conditioned phenomena are
              subject to change. But when there is a direct, visceral experience of an
              alternative, the enchantment that fuels this clinging lessens dramatically. The
              function of attaining nibbana is to reduce and finally end all clinging. In
              Theravada Buddhism, the desire to walk the path to nibbana has an honored
              place. Once that desire is fulfilled, it naturally subsides and the mind clings
              to nothing, not even to nibbana itself.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Walking the path toward the complete ending of clinging and
              suffering is the noblest thing a person can do. It opens the fist of the mind,
              and allows a person to walk in the world with gift-bestowing hands.</span></p>

              manufacture concepts and beliefs in relationship to things that are inherently
              transcendental. This often leads us to suffer the old curse of “mistaking the
              finger pointing to the moon for the moon itself.” The cause of this mistaken
              perception is the ego, since the ego’s only occupation is to sustain its flimsy
              existence or world of illusion. It always tries its best to create hindrances
              to the realization of truth.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Every thought about nirvana can be credited to the ego’s attempt
              to jeopardize one’s entry into nirvana itself. Yet this situation should not
              cause us to lose hope of discovering nirvana. Many men and women have already
              realized it. One may know about nectar very well from reading and listening to
              others’ experiences of tasting it. This is still simply intellectual
              understanding. One honestly doesn’t know how nectar tastes until it is touched
              by one’s own tongue. In the same way, you have to directly experience nirvana
              in order to know its true flavor. This realization requires the dropping of
              everything that one is shamelessly trying to hold onto. It means a spiritual
              death—dying to the illusion of self. This is different from physical death.We
              come across various terminologies and symbols created by spiritual traditions
              to describe this inner liberation. We even find slightly different ways of
              understanding nirvana within Buddhism. The point of view within the Vajrayana
              is that it is an awakened state endowed with wisdom and love. It is ecstatic.
              It is regarded as<em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">mahasukha,</span></em><span> </span>which literally means great bliss.
              This word alone can immediately create a misconception of the true state of
              liberation. It has nothing to do with ordinary bliss that we experience through
              our senses, like taking drugs or having sex. It is not necessarily some
              titillating or altered state of mind that inspires you to frolic in the
              meadows. Otherwise, hedonism and self-indulgence would be a short cut to
              enlightenment, which is not the case. The Vajrayana position is to counter the
              dry notion that nirvana is a dead end: the terminus of every experience from
              sorrow to bliss. The Vajrayana doctrine regards this as a pseudo-nirvana, which
              is nothing more than a pain-free vegetative state. It defines awakening as a
              state that is not only free from sorrow, but also the embodiment of
              transcendent love, wisdom, and ecstasy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">All schools of thought in Buddhism seem to agree that great
              cessation is true nirvana. Buddha himself taught that nirvana is the realm of
              inner peace in which all gross and subtle turbulence of mind has subsided. This
              comes into being by awakening to the sacred nature of all things. Vajrayana
              postulates that nirvana is an awakening in which one sees all things as divine,
              the universe itself as Buddha paradise, living beings as deities. Its unique
              outlook is that ultimate truth is not just<em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">shunyata,</span></em><span> </span>or emptiness, but all-pervading
              sacredness, which is called<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">dakpa rabjam</span></em>in Tibetan. One of the
              main features in the Vajrayana practices is to visualize beings as deities in
              accordance with traditional iconography as a means to gaining realization. Such
              practice may not be found in other traditions.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Vajrayana starts from the premise that nirvana cannot only
              manifest in one lifetime, but also at any time—mostly when one is not expecting
              it. This holds true for both women and men. It’s said that even sinners can be
              enlightened in one lifetime without incurring the ultimate punishment of being
              born in hell. The Tibetan saint Milarepa supposedly took the lives of many in
              his early years through the use of black magic, and then later embraced the
              spiritual path and became one of the most revered masters in Tibetan Buddhism.
              There are many people who doubt the existence of nirvana in the first place.
              This doubt is the product of not finding many examples of those who are
              enlightened or by the experience of encountering those who are regarded as
              enlightened by their followers but turn out to be just a big divine joke.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Of course, nirvana is not a myth. It’s a possibility for everyone,
              but an individual must believe in its existence in order to have any motivation
              to be on the path to the everlasting freedom. The essence of our consciousness
              is already love and wisdom. Karma, concepts, and emotional patterns are only
              temporarily preventing our consciousness from unfolding its enlightened nature.
              Nirvana is nothing more than being awakened to the enlightened nature of our
              consciousness. That awakened nature is who we truly are from the very
              beginning. In accordance with this reasoning, we are destined to be
              enlightened. If not in this lifetime, then definitely at some point in the
              distant future.</span></p>

              the truth of this experience, an experience that is not limited to some past
              event, does not belong to some great historical figure, but is ours to
              discover. Enlightenment is not a thing, not a condition, not an event, not a
              goal, not an accomplishment. That which is without limits cannot be defined.
              Yet the question is a burning one for Buddhists. Even though we may be too hip
              to ask it, deep down, we want to know what it is that we are practicing. But in
              truth, we are practicing enlightenment! It is always and already here! There is
              not a hair’s breadth of separation between what we perceive as our separate,
              burdensome selves and Buddha-nature. But until this truth has been experienced,
              a little voice is always asking, “Why?” “What for?” “How come?” We want an
              answer, we want access to someone else’s understanding, we want some
              reassurance that what we are doing makes sense. And a good teacher’s response
              is guaranteed to pull the rug out from under us, to frustrate our acquisitive
              seeking after the attainment of something outside. Someone asked the great
              T’ang dynasty teacher Unmon Bunen, “What is Buddha?” Unmon answered,
              “Shit-wiping stick.” A more modern answer was given by my dharma grandfather,
              Soen Nakagawa Roshi: “A piece of toilet paper.” This may seem blasphemous: How
              can one compare Buddha to something that is used to wipe away shit? Indeed, if
              we think Buddha-nature is that which is sacred, as opposed to everything else
              that is profane, then of course it sounds blasphemous. But from the vista of
              realization, what’s blasphemous is making this separation between sacred and
              profane. This is the same dualistic mindset that creates the fiction of a
              separate self and condemns us to suffering.</span></p>

              beings are Buddha-nature,” or, as Zen master Dogen phrased it, “All that there
              is without anything missing, there-is [is] the Buddha nature.” Shit-wiping
              stick, toilet paper, birds singing, cars passing by, ants crawling on the
              ground, itchiness around your ear, sleepiness, everything, all that there is<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">is</span></em><span> </span>nothing but Buddha-nature. What is
              lacking?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">The Zen master Rinzai said, “Followers of the Way, it is urgently
              necessary for you to attain true insight.” And then he continued, “Just don’t
              strive!” Then what about that urgent necessity for attainment? How do we
              experience true insight without striving? How do we come to see that this very
              moment, this very place, just as it is, has nothing lacking, nothing
              superfluous—that we are “all done” just as we are?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">In the fascicle “The Buddha-nature” in his<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Shobogenzo,</span></em><span> </span>Dogen wrote, “The principle of the
              Buddha-nature is that one’s Buddha-nature remains incomplete as long as one is
              not awakened, and that it is completed only from the moment one is awakened;
              the Buddha-nature and awakening can only be simultaneous. You must deeply
              penetrate this principle in your practice of concentration. Twenty or thirty
              years of grinding effort are necessary.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">That doesn’t appeal to us. We don’t like the idea of long years of
              grinding effort. Despite what the Buddha says in the<span> </span><em><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Diamond
              Sutra</span></em>—“There is no formula for supreme enlightenment”—we long for
              some guidelines, some diagram, yes, a formula for quick success. We want what
              our teachers have, and we want them to give it to us without delay. And therein
              lies the problem in at least two of its guises: we think there is something to
              have; and we think it’s good to get something for nothing—when, in fact, this
              practice of ours requires giving everything for nothing! One of my favorite
              sayings of Rinzai’s teacher, Obaku, is “Those who seek the Way must enter it
              with the suddenness of a knife-thrust. Full understanding of this must come
              before they can enter.” Every koan requires this from us: entering with the
              suddenness of a knife-thrust, giving everything for nothing, having no
              preconceived ideas of attainment or accomplishment, just sitting down and
              emptying the room so that the koan can reveal itself in ourselves, through
              ourselves, as ourselves. This is effortless effort: difficult, for it flies in
              the face of all our conditioning; easy, for it requires nothing but an utter
              giving up and entering into this unlimited, unbounded moment. The more we sit
              in this dumbfounded way, the more our heart-minds are purified. What we think
              is the obstacle is the very encouragement we need to open, to give
              unconditionally, to enter with the swiftness of a knife-thrust into what has
              never been hidden. This is koan practice. We empty the room, and the Way is
              everywhere apparent.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">When there’s nowhere to turn, nowhere to run, we discover an inner
              motivation, a strong determination: “I’m going to sit down and shut up. I’m
              sick and tired of this endless round of confusion and fear. I resolve to enter
              into the clear, awakened mind of my innate Buddha-nature, so that true
              compassion can flower, can bloom in my very being.”</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; line-height: 17.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: Helvetica; color: black;">Motivation is so important. If we don’t have motivation, of course
              we’re going to sit there feeling bored, irritated, and in pain. With
              motivation, we can dedicate our lives: “I am here, fully present, and I vow to
              wake up fully so that all beings may be released from suffering.” It’s that
              simple. Vow, and bow, wholeheartedly, and sit down. Then, having entered with
              “the suddenness of a knife-thrust,” we can drink of the refreshing spring
              called “the readiness of time.”</span></p>

              <p>In the absence of a separate self, what is there to judge what is sacred and what is profane? Sacred and profane are illusions - there is no such thing as sacred or profane in the actual world, it is simply an empty conceptual notion - no actuality to it. What's actual is the brilliance of shit-wiping stick!</p>
