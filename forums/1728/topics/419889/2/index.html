              <p>Hi zenist, I am in support of you that we buddhists should not rely on taoist and non buddhist texts as the foundation or gates of entry to Buddhism. As Buddhists, we do not deny the humanistic nature and values in another religion but that does not equate to us Buddhists embracing them as "part of Buddhism", this is seriously erronous view. <br>As for those whom are saying that Jesus, Laozi so and so are manifestations of so and so Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, this is pure assumption with no scriptural references. <br><br>As Buddhists, always rem the refuge vows we once took before the Buddha as below:<br><br>å¼Ÿå­�å°½å½¢å¯¿</p>
              <p>ã€€<span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0">çšˆä¾�ä½›ï¼Œç”Ÿç”Ÿä¸–ä¸–ä¸�çšˆä¾�å¤–é�“å¤©é­”ï¼›</span><br>ã€€<span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0">çšˆä¾�æ³•ï¼Œç”Ÿç”Ÿä¸–ä¸–ä¸�ä¿¡å¥‰å¤–é�“å…¸ç±�</span>ï¼›<br>ã€€çšˆä¾�åƒ§ï¼Œç”Ÿç”Ÿä¸–ä¸–ä¸�è·Ÿéš�å¤–é�“é—¨å¾’ã€‚</p>
              <p><br>This is the perfect reason why I only print Buddhist sutras for free distribution all over the world and not taoist classics, holy bible, quran etc. Call me narrow minded for only printing Buddhist sutras and not other non-buddhists texts, because I live in this saha world which I can only rely on the Buddha's teachings as a true way of foundation and to liberation which other religious cannot share. <br><br>Start on the right path today, the Buddha's path not Jesus's, Laozi's path. <br><br>Namo amituofo</p>

              <p>ã€Šå��å–„æ¥­é�“ç»�ã€‹ is also inherent emptiness nature and is found in all the sutras of all the Buddhas, according to Buddha Sakyamuni. Is an emptiness nature whether do you realize or not. In fact, all doctrines of officials religions relate to inherent emptiness nature<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"> Problem arises because they did not realize emptiness bliss, but idolises statue, image, attached over religious texts, worldly material and desire.

              <p>Then at that time the Blessed One recited this couplet of verses:<br><br>I always preach emptiness which is beyond eternalism and nihilism; Samsara <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> is like a dream and a vision, and karma vanishes not.<br><br>Space, Nirvana, and the two forms of cessation— thus the ignorant discriminate the things which are not effect-producing, but the wise stand above being and non-being.<br><br>At that time again, the Blessed One said this to MahÄ�mati the Bodhisattva-MahÄ�sattva; This [teaching of] emptiness, no-birth, non-duality, and no-self-nature is found in all the sutras of all the Buddhas, and this doctrine is recognised in every one of them. o with the teachings disclosed in all the sutras, they are for all beings for the gratification of their own discriminating minds. They are not the truth-preserving statements meant for noble wisdom to grasp.

              <p>hmm, having listen to so many years until now, i had never got all this ideas/meaning, except the first one in believing in Karma. i won't want to ä¾�æ–‡è§£ä¹‰. words are words, idea is idea. regarding "end of the world", yea, sometime he say thing like that, but at heart, his idea is Buddhism do not have the "end of the world" saying from the west, pls listen to the recent talks, i just did this morning, and they are not his idea.</p>
              <p>a way to understand the real meaning, is through wholehearted respect, not just to Buddha, but to all sentient beings. the more respectæ•¬, the more can understand, å¦‚æ�¥çœŸå®žä¹‰.</p>

              <p>6. Sixth Major Precept</p>
              <p>On Broadcasting the Faults of the Assembly<br>A disciple of the Buddha must not himself broadcast the misdeeds or infractions of Bodhisattva-clerics or Bodhisattva-laypersons, or of [ordinary] monks and nuns -- nor encourage others to do so. He must not create the causes, conditions, methods, or karma of discussing the offenses of the assembly.</p>
              <p>As a Buddha's disciple, whenever he hears evil persons, externalists or followers of the Two Vehicles speak of practices contrary to the Dharma or contrary to the precepts within the Buddhist community, he should instruct them with a compassionate mind and lead them to develop wholesome faith in the Mahayana.</p>
              <p>If instead, he discusses the faults and misdeeds that occur within the assembly, he commits a Parajika offense.</p>
