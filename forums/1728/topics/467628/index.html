              <p><span style="font-family: 'Book Antiqua';">The Two Truths<br> by Denma Lochoe Rinpoche <br> </span><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The following teaching was given by Ven. 
              Denma Lochoe Rinpoche on the morning of December 3rd 1995, before a large assembly 
              of ordained and lay people, at Root Institute in the holy place of Bodhgaya. The 
              translation into English was by Ven. Gareth Sparham.
              </span></p><p><br> I was asked to give a talk on the two truths, the conventional or surface level 
                of truth and the ultimate truth. And looked at it one way, you could say that 
                I have already finished my teaching, as it were, because there are just these 
                two words; the surface level and the ultimate level of truth, and that is all.</p>
              <p>But looked at it in another way, these two truths subsume within them all of 
                Buddhism that there is, and in that sense, there is more to talk about under 
                these two headings than could fill a huge book.</p>
              <p>I will ask you all, therefore, in this special place of Bodhgaya, to bring 
                up within yourselves a very deep motivation. Every living creature, whoever 
                they are, are simply creatures wanting happiness. They seek happiness, but are 
                unaware of what the causes of happiness are. Thus, thinking of all those living 
                creatures and the difficulties that they find themselves in, call up this motivation. 
                In order to relieve them from their unwanted sufferings, I must first achieve 
                all the wonderful qualities, all of the excellences which are in an Enlightened 
                state. I must therefore Enlighten myself in order to teach them how to be free 
                from their misery.</p>
              <p>Living creatures like ourselves are defined in general by seeking to avoid 
                unpleasant, suffering situations and seeking to place themselves in happy situations. 
                The animals, from the bugs on up, have a knowledge of how to remove immediate 
                suffering, an intelligence which allows them to get out of immediate difficult 
                situations. The human being differs from the animal, in that the human being 
                has an intelligence which allows them to take into consideration a much greater 
                time span. They can begin to do things to relieve states which they will otherwise 
                experience a long time in the future. for example educating our young with the 
                thought that the good education will allow them to get a job, which will allow 
                them to earn money and live well in the future. These long term methods to remove 
                states which would be otherwise unpleasant, are coming from the intelligence 
                of the human being. At this point we are speaking generally, and spirituality 
                hasn't even entered into the discussion at all.</p>
              <p>If one has done wholesome deeds, then ones future will be in a happy state. 
                If one involves in unwholesome deeds, then one has set down the causes to find 
                oneself in a state of woe. Spirituality, then, enters into the intelligence 
                or thought processes of a human being contemplating a future which goes beyond 
                simple death.</p>
              <p>It is the two truths that I will take as my point of departure for my lecture 
                here. Everything the Enlightened one spoke of leads back to an understanding 
                of the two levels of truth. Everything is included in the two truths. This does 
                not mean that there is no third truth, for example in the four noble truths 
                and so on. You have therefore a subdivision. Since you have two levels of reality 
                you have something which can be subdivided, and put into two categories.</p>
              <p>Therefore, one asks oneself what one is categorizing, what you are dividing 
                into the surface level and the ultimate level of reality. The answer to that 
                question is 'she ja', or 'knowables'. Here, a knowable and something that exists 
                have exactly the same meaning. To exist means to be knowable and to be knowable 
                means to exist.</p>
              <p>But wait a minute, there is a difficulty here. To exist and to be knowable 
                does not necessarily mean the same thing because, for example, I could have 
                an idea in my mind of a rabbit with antlers growing out of its head. I could 
                fabricate that awareness in my mind and in that sense it is something known, 
                but a rabbit with antlers is something which certainly does not exist.</p>
              <p>What is meant here when one equates things which exist with things which are 
                known, that they are known by awareness, but not specific awareness. In other 
                words, to get out of this difficulty, I would say that it's true that a rabbit 
                with antlers is known by a specific awareness of a rabbit with antlers, but 
                being known by that specific awareness does not necessarily mean being known 
                by awareness.</p>
              <p>'Ultimate truth' comes from the Sanskrit as 'Paramarthasatya', and if this 
                is dissected, the 'artha' refers to that which is known, and 'parama' refers 
                to what knows it, in other words the mind of a high spiritual being. 'Satya' 
                means 'truth', because that 'artha' or 'meaning' is true for that 'parama', 
                that mind of the spiritual being. Therefore 'Ultimate Truth'; an ultimate thing 
                which is true.</p>
              <p>What about the other truth 'samvrtisatya', which is translated into English 
                as surface level, or covering level of truth. 'Samvriti' is a total covering 
                up, meaning an ordinary awareness covering up what is real. 'Satya' is then 
                'truth' for an ordinary covering up awareness. Things are taken as true or real 
                by ordinary minds like ours.</p>
              <p>Spirituality, then, enters into the intelligence<br> or thought processes of a human being contemplating a future<br> which goes beyond simple death.<br> In the scholarly tradition we say that 'anything which is known will always 
                be included within one of these two levels of reality, and anything that is 
                not within these two levels of reality, or two truths, is totally beyond the 
                sphere of knowable'. There is a deep logic here, in that the two levels of reality 
                gives an inexhaustible description of all that there is.</p>
              <p>Here is how it works. truth and lie go together don't they. If a person makes 
                a statement that mirrors reality, then that statement is true. A statement, 
                however, not mirroring reality is a lie.</p>
              <p>The ultimate level of reality is mirrored in the mind of awareness that knows 
                it, in a way that is not lying. This necessarily brings about the situation 
                that all conventional truths are lying to the awareness that knows them, about 
                the way they appear. Similarly, ordinary things appearing to ordinary awareness 
                must be said to be lying to that ordinary awareness. You are, by removing this 
                truth, positively showing the truth of the awareness of the ultimate. That ultimate, 
                appearing to an awareness that knows it is not lying to that awareness, is the 
                suchness of things, the ultimate reality of things.</p>
              <p>So you have one which is necessitated by another in a sea-saw like fashion, 
                and from that account, you can extrapolate out to show that it is a statement 
                that is exhaustive of all knowables, all that exists.</p>
              <p>In Buddhist systems of ideas, there are many interpretations of what exactly 
                these two levels of truth are. They are set fourth as the four Buddhist schools 
                of philosophy.</p>
              <p>In the most profound school, the middle way consequentialist school, just what 
                is emptiness or the ultimate? It is this: That in fact nobody or nothing, anywhere, 
                has anything that inherently makes it what it is. Nothing has it's own personal 
                mark, Everything exists simply through language, through ideas.</p>
              <p>The absence of something, the total absence, the total non-being, non-existence 
                of anything that is not there through the power of language and thought is shunyata, 
                emptiness, the ultimate truth.</p>
              <p>When one talks of an ultimate truth, of emptiness, one has a focus; one is 
                looking at objects and finding them to be totally empty. What one is looking 
                at and finding to be empty is very important. The identification of things first 
                becomes an important thing to do because the ultimate truth is not something 
                immediately apprehensible by our senses, we just cannot see it. We have to arrive 
                at it through our thought processes, and in order to do this we have to use 
                reasoning. This reasoning takes as its point of departure certain things or 
                bases, so we must identify these in the first instance.</p>
              <p>Lets start by trying to identify what are classically the most important of 
                these bases, the five aggregates (Skt. Skandas). In the Heart Sutra it says, 
                ' he looked and saw that the five aggregates were empty of inherent existence'. 
                so, if you do not know what these five are, how can you look into the ultimate 
                truth of them?</p>
              <p>The five aggregates are - a great heap of physical things - a great heap of 
                feelings - a great heap of discriminations - a great heap of created things 
                (Skt. Samskara) - a great heap of awareness.</p>
              <p>So then, one has heaps or aggregates and these locate living creatures. Let 
                us take the aggregate of physical things, which can be further broken down into 
                the external objective physical things, and the internal subjective physical 
                things. Sights sounds, smells, tastes and sensations are the external or objective 
                phisical things in this great heap of phisical things, while the five senses 
                are the subjective of internal physical things.</p>
              <p>The second heap is that of feelings. What are feelings? They are the experiences 
                one gets out of things, either pleasant, neutral or unpleasant.</p>
              <p>The next heap is discrimination, which is defined as that part of the mind 
                which functions to identify particular things as what they are.</p>
              <p>The forth aggregate of created things has most of the non-associated created 
                things. It is a catch bag for everything not included in the other four heaps.</p>
              <p>And what of the fifth heap? This is all our awarenesses or consciousness or 
                thoughts. This is generally looked at as sense based awareness coming from a 
                thinking mind.</p>
              <p>One can only focus on the reality of emptiness, when one has seen the size, 
                the dimensions, of what one is refuting or denying.</p>
              <p>The Tibetan saint Tsong Khapa said 'anything that is produced from conditions 
                is never produced'. You can unpack this apparent paradox in this way. What you 
                are saying is that nothing is produced as something that is independent. Nothing 
                is produced as something that is there under it's own power. That is what you 
                are trying to demonstrate.</p>
              <p>For example, a seedling is not produced as something there under its own power, 
                as something that is inherently what it is. Why? Because it is produced from 
                causes and conditions. That is how you break down the meaning of the statement 
                to formulate it as a reason for the hidden meaning, which is emptiness, to come 
                clear to the mind.</p>
              <p>This necessarily brings about the situation<br> that all conventional truths are lying<br> to the awareness that knows them<br> Lama Tsong Khapa writes in his famous 'Praise to Dependent arising' - 'what 
                is more amazing, what better way of expressing a reality has ever been found, 
                namely, that anything which depends on causes and conditions is empty'.</p>
              <p>There are many different reasons that a person can use to come to understand 
                emptiness. Here we meet with the king of all reasonings, Dependent Arising, 
                because being produced, or arising dependently is the reason for everything's 
                emptiness. Using this reason, one avoids the extreme of nihilism, because dependent 
                arising shows that something is there. Never the less because it is a reason 
                that also shows emptiness, it also removes eternalism.</p>
              <p>As the great Aryadeva said, 'anyone who gets a view into one reality gets a 
                view into all realities'. What he is saying is that if one plumbs the depths 
                of reality of anything, one does not need to go through the whole process again 
                with another object. Just bringing to the mind the reality you have seen in 
                one object or person, and turning the mind to another, you will look at its 
                reality as well.</p>
              <p>That is why every one of our sadhanas without exception starts with the mantra 
                which means 'Om, this is purity, all Dharmas are pure, I am that purity'. Before 
                doing any sadhana, one brings to mind this fact of the ultimate reality, of 
                emptiness.</p>
              <p>Transcribed and edited in Bodhgaya by Patrick Moss of Montana. All mistakes 
                are his alone.</p>
              <p><br> The great saint, Chandrakirti said, 'we are just as the leader of the swans, 
                who, by relying on two broad wings, can fly across the ocean to its destination. 
                So too should the great Bodhisattva, the heroic being, by relying on the two 
                wings of method and wisdom, cross over to the great city of freedom'.</p>
              <p>If one of the wings is damaged, the swan can never fly, similarly, the Bodhisattva, 
                striving in the practices for the state of Enlightenment, must have undamaged 
                both the conventional level of the thought of Enlightenment and the ultimate 
                level of the thought of Enlightenment. That is, both the conventional and ultimate 
                Bodhicittas.</p>
              <p>The conventional thought of Bodhicitta is looking towards Enlightenment as 
                the thing one is trying to obtain. Ultimate Bodhicitta, however, is the understanding 
                in the mindstream of a Noble Being, of the Mahayana wisdom sort, in which the 
                duality between what is looked at, Enlightenment, and the one who is looking 
                has disappeared. A Noble Being is someone on the path of seeing, the path of 
                meditation or the state of no more learning.</p>
              <p>"Every single creature has within them<br> a fully perfected Enlightened One" <br> So what do you mean when you say it is a sort of non dual awareness? It is a 
                wisdom awareness of Mahayana awarenesses. One sort of awareness is called method 
                and the other, wisdom. A Mahayana method would be, for example, great compassion. 
                It is an awareness called a method. A Mahayana wisdom would be the understanding 
                of emptiness.</p>
              <p>You can have Mahayana wisdom in non Mahayana practitioners. For example a Hinnayana 
                thinking of liberation can have in their mindstreams a Mahayana wisdom, yet 
                they are not Mahayana. Similarly a Mahayana can have in their mindstreams a 
                non Mahayana wisdom, such as the understanding of impermanence.</p>
              <p>So what then is ultimate Bodhicitta? It is the ultimate thought of Enlightenment 
                that is looking at the ultimate nature of Enlightenment, which is the same as 
                the ultimate nature of everything else, totally empty. So this is looking at 
                the emptiness of Enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Think like this, the ultimate is the thing being seen, the thing known, which 
                is Enlightenment. The thought of Enlightenment is the thing knowing that Enlightenment. 
                You should not think that the thing known, or the thing knowing are inherently 
                there. Both are simply co-dependent. You cannot have a thing known without a 
                knowing consciousness, and visa-versa.</p>
              <p>When we say ultimate, we mean the way it is. That is, when you go looking for 
                anything, anywhere, in the very deepest way it exists, you will find the same 
                thing. Total emptiness of inherent existence. You will find only an idea, a 
                name. This is the ultimate truth of all things, this is the nature of the mind.</p>
              <p>When you say this, you are not saying that at one time the mind inherently 
                existed and then, slowly through practices lost its inherent existence. There 
                was never any time when it existed inherently. On the other hand, the mind has 
                always had obscurations and these obscurations also lack inherent existence.</p>
              <p>What all this means is that the ultimate nature of the mind lacks inherent 
                existence. You do not have to meditate to get rid of it, it has never been there. 
                You do however have to free your mind from obscurations. They have to be removed 
                by meditation, by using the antidote.</p>
              <p>"You cannot have a thing known<br> without a knowing consciousness<br> and visa-versa" <br> In the old Nyingmapa tradition, it is explained as follows. Every single creature 
                has within them a fully perfected Enlightened One, and thus the explanation 
                of meditation that you find in the old texts is lie this; 'Our minds from the 
                very beginning were never created. That total lack of inherent existence within 
                our minds is a fully formed Buddha which has always existed'. Then how does 
                one get to be Enlightened? By becoming increasingly aware of the reality that 
                was always there.</p>
              <p>So you see, the actual emptiness cannot go anywhere. It can neither improve 
                nor not improve, but when talking about emptiness, you are talking about a thing 
                which is empty. Here, it is that sort of clarity or light of the mind that can 
                somehow increase or acquire new qualities.</p>
              <p>You can see then how a mind like ours, which right now has obscurations, and 
                that mind when it is free of obscurations in the future, are exactly the same 
                from the angle of being free of inherent existence. This is why it is said that 
                there is not one atom of difference in terms of excellence between the emptiness 
                of an ordinary beings mind and the emptiness of an Enlightened Beings mind. 
                They are equally free from the very beginning of ever having anything inherent 
                in them.</p>
              <p>In newer texts it says that one cannot say that beings have within them a fully 
                perfected Enlightened One. The Enlightened One which beings will become is something 
                which must be developed anew. There is no real contradiction between the two. 
                It is just that the words which are trying to get the meaning across are different.</p>
              <p>You find in the new texts statements like this; 'The nature body of an Enlightened 
                one, from the point of view of its natural purity is to be found in meaning 
                in the mindstreams of ordinary beings'. This is referring to the same thing, 
                the emptiness of the Enlightened Mind, however you simply say the natural purity 
                of any type of inherent existence of the Omniscient or ordinary mind.</p>
              <p>One should be aware that even in the old texts, there is never any talk of 
                an ordinary being having the physical form of an Enlightened One, the marks 
                and signs. So you see there is no contradiction and the ultimate nature of our 
                minds, its suchness is the main thing that we should meditate on.</p>
              <p>It is based on this fact that every one of our minds is in ultimate nature 
                totally empty. It is based upon this that you can demonstrate that every living 
                creature has the capacity to transform into an Enlightened Being.</p>
