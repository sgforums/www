              rebuttal to Reza Aslan’s critics from someone who’s lived with Aghoris</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Vikram Zutshi Scroll.in</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              the remaining episodes of Aslan’s mini-series ‘Believer’ are as provocative as
              the first one, they should not be missed. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Several
              years ago, wandering through Varanasi late at night, I came across a group of
              ash-smeared sadhus sitting around a bonfire near the banks of the River Ganga
              which runs through the ancient city. I had gone there after spending several
              months in a Buddhist monastery in Pokhara, Nepal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              of the sadhus beckoned me to join them, patting the spot beside him. They were
              passing around a chillum, a clay pipe, packed with a potent mixture of charas
              (hand rubbed hashish) and tobacco. They sang a folk tune, accompanied by
              percussive tapping on a tabla. The smoking, singing and drumming under the
              stars made for a heady brew. I pulled out a bottle of whiskey from my backpack
              and offered it to my companions. Each took a swig and passed it on – it was out
              after one round of the circle. Soon I was singing and jumping animatedly around
              the fire along with a couple of clapping sadhus.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Over
              the next few weeks I attended a number of similar gatherings at locations
              around Varanasi. It was a radical and refreshing departure from the austere and
              sedate environs of the Buddhist monastery and most of the ashrams I had stayed
              at over the course of my extended pilgrimage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              evening, a group of tourists from Delhi passing by, stopped and walked toward
              us. On seeing the intoxicated revelry, one of them, in a fit of moral outrage,
              ordered us to put our chillums away or he would call the police. The threat did
              not go down well with the holy men. Tolaram, a tall sadhu clad in black with
              red-rimmed eyes and a mop of wild dreadlocks, rose up and let loose a stream of
              invectives in Hindi which effectively meant this: Get lost or I’ll stuff a
              chillum up a very painful place. The other sadhus scooped handfuls of red-hot
              coal and flung them at the tourists. The bunch scurried away – never to be seen
              again. All of us laughed uproariously at the spectacle.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">My
              friends were members of Aghor, a sect of renegades who proudly reject the
              trappings of social propriety, sectarian labels and the world of appearances.
              Their secretive lifestyle, which includes ritual consecration and consumption
              of human flesh, and even sexual rites amidst burning pyres, is designed to shock
              the perceptual framework so as to break the barriers between what is considered
              sacred and profane, the holy and unholy – all rigid dichotomies that dominate
              the bourgeois middle class.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Tolaram’s view, most Hindus worshipped Shiva and Kali as a cultivated social
              requirement, but what the deities actually demand from their followers is not
              acceptable to the vast majority. Aghors are the only ones willing to please
              Kali, by “ripping the veil off reality and jumping straight into the abyss”,
              with no thought to self-preservation or the laws that govern polite society.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Aghors I fell in with emphatically rejected Vedic notions of ritual purity,
              scriptural dogma and priestly mediation between the world of the mundane, the
              so-called impure and the divine. They seek to cultivate a state of
              consciousness, known as Aghor, in which one transmutes and ultimately
              transcends base sensations like fear, hatred, disgust or discrimination. On
              attaining this state one does not view the world in dualistic terms of good and
              evil, sacred and profane, pure and impure – instead relating to all of
              manifested reality as attributes of the Great Mother, MA.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Given
              all this, I was not surprised at the outrage from sections of the
              Hindu-American community (and their self-appointed representatives) following
              the debut of Believer, a CNN mini-series on the fringe and fascinating
              religious sects around the world. The show’s inaugural episode was filmed in
              Varanasi, and half of it is devoted to Iranian-American religious scholar Reza
              Aslan being immersed with a group of Aghors engaging in various shocking acts,
              including eating cooked human brains and ingesting faeces.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is clear quite quickly that the show’s producers are out to find sensational,
              or at the very least dramatic, footage and the sadhus are only too happy to
              oblige, prone as they are to playing to the gallery. One of them can be heard
              yelling at Aslan to “shut the f**k up or he would cut his head off”. During my
              stay with Aghors, I had heard them say much worse things to middle class Indian
              and western tourists, often in jest and feigned anger, embellished with
              flailing arms and a fiery gaze for greater effect.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since
              the first snatches of the episode came out, Aslan has been accused of
              everything from Hinduphobia and bigotry to being an agent of “Abrahamic
              crusaders” attempting to undermine Hinduism. His critics feel that by depicting
              the Aghors, Aslan has somehow emasculated Hinduism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Hindus most offended by the CNN segment are exemplars of the class who like to
              portray a homogenous, sanitised and sparkly version of their faith. They either
              forget or paper over the fact that the Aghors, Naths and other heterodox
              Tantric sects pay scant regard to the institutionalised hierarchies and
              lifestyles propagated by bourgeois Hindus, the ones most offended by
              unconventional approaches to the divine.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              I asked Tolaram about his opinion on Hindu canonical texts, he related the
              story of a priest from the hallowed Kashi Vishwanath temple who had once gifted
              him a copy of the Bhagwad Gita. Not knowing Sanskrit, and not being remotely
              interested, he used the dry pages to kindle his bonfire. When I remarked that
              he may have been incarcerated as a blasphemer for his actions in some Islamic
              states (and possibly in the prevailing climate in India), he turned his eyes
              skywards saying, “1-2-3-All-India-Free” and guffawed loudly, presumably at the
              rank idiocy of the world of men.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              Professor Debashish Banerji, a scholar of Religion at the California Institute
              of Integral Studies, observes, “With the expansion of the middle class in India
              and its mass mobilization, along with the upper classes by the right-wing
              ruling party, modern Hinduism has developed into an identity construct, a
              national orthodoxy of social and religious norms. This threatens to erase the
              unauthorized culture of spiritual seeking, with innumerable variant and hybrid
              methods, customs, practices and social attitudes, that forms the millennia old
              history of religion in India.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Aslan
              is no stranger to controversy. His last book, the bestseller Zealot: The Life
              and Times of Jesus, miffed a whole bunch of conservative Christians who took to
              attacking him on Fox News.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              NRI Hindus I spoke to were especially offended by Aslan’s stated revulsion at
              the thought of taking a ritual dip in the Ganga. “This is one of the most
              polluted water bodies in the world,” he said. “There are millions of litres of
              untreated human waste. Yesterday I saw a guy take a shit directly into the
              water. It’s basically a giant toilet.” This may sound harsh and politically
              incorrect, but it is also the unvarnished and sad truth. Similar thoughts had
              crossed my mind during my maiden visit to Varanasi.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Admittedly,
              the inaugural episode of Believer is a mediocre example of documentary
              filmmaking and Aslan makes serious blunders, like calling Varanasi the “City of
              the Dead” (It is in fact the “City of Light”). Also, a television promo
              screaming “Cannibalism” was a cringe-worthy editorial decision by CNN.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Still,
              to this writer, reactions to the show were far more illuminating than the show
              itself. The rumpus revealed a lot about the diaspora and nationalist
              insecurities. Aslan’s observations on the caste system are fairly accurate and
              clearly too close to the bone for some people. There’s no denying that tasks
              like cremating the dead and manual scavenging are reserved for members of the
              Dalit community, those at the very lowest rung of the entrenched hierarchy, and
              have been so for millennia.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Indeed,
              caste is a social construct, but one which cannot be separated from religious
              or political beliefs of a billion-plus Hindus. In Aslan’s own words, “I define
              religion as an identity, not a set of beliefs and practices. That’s probably
              postulate number one for me. People tend to think that, ‘Oh religion is just
              something you believe in, right?’ Well, not for most people, actually. The vast
              majority of people who raise their hand and say, ‘I’m Jewish,’ ‘I’m Christian,’
              or ‘I’m Muslim’ are making identity statements much more so than belief
              statements.” He added, “So, if religion is a matter of identity, then it
              encompasses every aspect of your life. It can’t be divorced from your politics
              or your social views or your economic views. It’s all wrapped up together as
              one.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Reform
              and resistance against the rigidities of caste and gender are as old as
              Hinduism itself. Basava (1106–1167), a progenitor of the Lingayat or Virashaiva
              sect, was a prominent member of the Bhakti movement along with iconic social
              and spiritual reformers like Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu. The Bhakti Movement
              called for a profound shift in the socio-cultural ethos of Karnataka with its
              vociferous opposition to the caste system, rejection of Brahminical supremacy,
              abhorrence to ritual sacrifice, and unmediated access to the divine through
              devotional worship to the One God Shiva. Social reform has continued into the
              19th and 20th centuries with giants like Jyotirao Phule and Bhimrao Ambedkar
              leading the way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Aslan
              seems to acknowledge this: “In almost every interview I did about the show I
              talked at length about the issue underlying the episode, including the fluidity
              of the caste system, the problems inherent amongst the untouchable class, and
              how devout Hindus of all stripes are working tirelessly to overcome both.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Discussions
              on politically explosive issues, be it caste or nationalism, can turn violent
              quickly. In late February, a seminar on nationalism at Delhi University was set
              upon by a mob – members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the student
              wing of the Hindu nationalist group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, to which Prime
              Minister Narendra Modi belongs. Scores of professors and students were trapped
              as the mob rained bricks and stones and as the police stood by as mute
              spectators.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              NRIs with their knickers in a twist about Aslan’s show somehow never speak out
              as vociferously against the egregious violations of free speech and human
              rights in their home country.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              allegation that Aslan’s Varanasi episode perpetuated negative stereotypes,
              potentially leading to hate crimes in the xenophobic climate in the US, has an
              ironic twist. The assailant who shot at two Indians recently, killing one, was
              under the impression that they were Muslims – he was emboldened by the Muslim
              travel ban enacted by Donald Trump, a ban endorsed by a number of Right-wing Hindus,
              including Shalabh Kumar and the Republican Hindu Coalition, who berated CNN for
              airing the show.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              Sigal Samuel writes in the Atlantic:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Reza
              Aslan’s new show has come at the best possible time and the worst possible
              time. Some say the show makes various religions seem less foreign, a corrective
              that Americans desperately need under Donald Trump. Others say the show
              exoticizes religious minorities, a danger we can ill afford under, well, Donald
              Trump… Both views are right, to some degree. Oddly, the two contradictory
              effects spring from Aslan’s single stated goal: to show that all religions are,
              at their core, expressions of the same faith and the same existential
              questions. That makes Believer an interesting object lesson in the risks of
              trying to make religion relatable.”  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              the second half of the segment, we see followers of Aghoreshwar Bhagwan Ramji
              tending to the vulnerable and disenfranchised, including lepers and orphans. In
              the Aghor tradition, a sadhaka who has gone through all the stages of Aghor and
              then returned to society for the benefit of others is called an Aghoreshwar – a
              concept similar to that of the Bodhisattva in Buddhism. Even though an
              Aghoreshwar remains above and beyond all social and material illusions,
              distinctions and categories, they can still bring social reforms into effect.
              They work for the benefit of all sentient beings, especially those on the
              margins like underprivileged women and Dalits.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              outrage over Aslan’s was basically a tempest in a teapot which shed light on
              the chasm between the anodyne Hinduism propagated by sections of the Indian
              diaspora and the infinitely more complex and gritty reality on the ground. It’s
              time for myopic NRIs and votaries of Hindutva to embrace the teeming cauldron
              of contradictions that is India and engage with it on a visceral level, or risk
              being frozen in permanent stasis. I for one look forward to seeing the
              mini-series in its entirety. If the remaining episodes are as provocative as
