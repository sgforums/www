              <p>In Theravada, since arhat has obtained cessation, there is no way an arhat can be a Buddha after he passes away.</p>

              <p>But in Mahayana, an arhat can be a Buddha, as it was mentioned that the Buddha has predicted the Buddhahood for some of his disciples, such as Sariputra. when a Buddha has passed away, he also attained cessation and how is it possible he exists to exhort arhats, who likewise attained cessation to strive for Buddhahood?</p>

              In Mahayana POV those top disciples are really great bodhisattvas actually, just manifesting in the form of a Sravaka (hearer)
              
              An arhat means someone who is liberated from the uncontrolled cycle of birth and death. Buddha was liberated, so he can be known as an arhat. Bodhisattva of the 6th or 8th bhumi level who has realised the equivalent with an arhat can also be considered likewise.
              
              Having been liberated from uncontrolled rebirth, a bodhisattva or buddha however chooses to continue saving beings in samsara.

              As to your PM about 'when a buddha has passed away, he neither exists nor non exists isnt it'
              
              In actuality, this can be applied to non-enlightened beings like us as well.
              
              We cannot be said to exist, not exist, both, or neither, after death. Why? Because even right now, there is no inherent self to begin with.

              <p>According to Milindapanha, it is said that citta (mind) is not 'functioning (appavattam)' in one of the two circumstances: 'when it has become drowsy and entered bhavanga; and ... when it has attained cessation' (Miln.300). As this sees citta as not 'functioning' when bhavanga occurs, such a 'non-functioning' citta could also occur in cessation.</p>
              <p>In other words, when we enter into deep dreamless sleep every night, the mind enters into the state of bhavanga, also known as the 8th consciousness where there is no content of mind or citta, in other words the citta lies in a dormant and non functioning state. Similarly in Nirvana, citta becomes non functioning. However it does not mean that the functioning of does not have a potential to arise again as a continuum of wisdom persists. An arhat will not however be reborn due to the force of karma. If someone liberated does return it is due to the power of vows and compassion, not clinging, desire and karma. Theravada texts however generally does not discuss about this and the main emphasis is on personal liberation.</p>
              <p>For example several passages like M.I.175 and A.IV.454 describe a monk who 'enters on and abides in the cessation of cognition and feeling; and having seen by wisdom, his cankers are utterly destroyed'. This describes the attainment of Arahatship either in or immediately after the state of cessation. If the former is meant, then wisdom (panna) can be present in cessation; if this is so, then so can discernment, for whatever is the object of wisdom is also known discernment (M.I.292).</p>

              no need 
                for two words to describe the same state. So NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also 
              distinguishes 
                them: "That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of 
              being 
                born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence,

                -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways. Saá¹�sÄ�ra is
               the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically
               
                perceive "it" as a collection of objects which interact causally in 
                space and time. NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic 
              in that 
                it incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika
               insists, 
                cannot be characterized (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is that 
              which 
                is absolved of all thought-construction"), but which YogÄ�cÄ�ra

              saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the slightest difference between the two."
              <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B1%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#1">[1]</a> And yet there must be some difference between
              them, for otherwise no distinction would have been made and there
              would be no need for two words to describe the same state. So
              NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also distinguishes them: "That which, taken as causal or
              dependent, is the process of being born and passing on, is, taken
              noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a."
              <a rel="nofollow" name="%5B2%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#2">[2]</a> There is only one reality -- this world, right
              here -- but this world may be experienced in two different ways.
              Saá¹�sÄ�ra is the "relative" world as usually experienced, in which
              "I" dualistically perceive "it" as a collection of objects which
              interact causally in space and time. NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is
              in itself, nondualistic in that it incorporates both subject and
              object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika insists, cannot be
              characterized (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is that which is
              absolved of all thought-construction"), but which YogÄ�cÄ�ra
              nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and so
              forth.</span></p>
