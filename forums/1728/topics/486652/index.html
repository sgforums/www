We are to endure what others    cannot and practice what others cannot achieve. We should do all we can on behalf    of others and help them to be good. When sitting quietly, we would do well to reflect    on our own faults. When talking with friends do not discuss the rights and wrongs    of others. </span></span></p>

When chanting, whether aloud or silently, do not give rise to wandering thoughts.    If wandering thoughts arise, immediately dismiss them. Constantly maintain a modest    and regretful heart. Even if we have upheld true cultivation, we still need to feel    that our practice is shallow and never boast. We should mind our own business and    not the business of others. We should see only the good examples of others instead    of their shortcomings. We would do well to see ourselves as ordinary and everyone    else as bodhisattvas. </span></span></p>

To reap benefits, you    should make allowances for your health or habits and skillfully select the practice    that fits your circumstances.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Traditionally, Pure Land practitioners circumambulate the altar at the beginning    of a Buddha Recitation session. then sit down, and, finally, kneel. However, if you    feel tired when circumambulation or kneeling, you should sit down and recite. If    you become drowsy while seated, you can circumambulate the altar or recite standing    up, waiting for the drowsiness to go away before sitting down again. When reciting,    it is better to determine the length of the session with a clock, rather than fingering    a rosary, as doing so may make it difficult to focus the mind and keep it empty and    pure.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Greed, anger, and delusion are afflictions common to everyone. However, if you are    aware that they are diseases, their power should not be overwhelming. They are like    thieves who have broken into the house. If the owner mistakes them for members of    the household, all the valuables in the house will be stolen. If, on the other hand,    he recognizes the thieves as such and immediately chases them away, his valuables    will be safeguarded and he will be at peace. In this connection, the ancients have    said:</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-_Web_-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Fear not the early arising of thoughts [greed, anger, delusion, etc.]; fear only    the late awareness of them as such.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-_Web_-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When greed, anger, and delusion arise, as long as you recognize them for what they    are, these thoughts will immediately be destroyed. However, if you take them for    the true master of your household, it is no different from mistaking a thief for    your son. How can your riches not be squandered and lost.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When ordinary beings meet with disaster, if they do not resent the heavens, they    blame their fellow beings. Very few think of repaying their karma and developing    a mind of repentance and reform. You should know that “if you plant melons, you reap    melons; if you plant beans, you reap beans.” This is the natural course of events.    Having sown thorns, do not expect, when the harvest comes, to have wheat and rice.    If those who create evil still enjoy blessings, it is because in previous lifetimes    they amassed great blessings; if not for their transgressions, their blessings would    have been much greater.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">It is as if a scion of a wealthy family were to lead a dissipated life, lusting and    gambling, squandering money like so much dirt without suffering hunger and cold immediately    because of his great fortune. Yet, if he were to continue in this manner day in and    day out, even with a family estate in the millions, one day he would surely lose    all his property and suffer a premature death. </span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">If those who perform wholesome deeds customarily meet with misfortune, it is because    they planted the seeds of transgression deeply in past lifetimes. If not for their    good deeds, their misfortunes would have been much worse.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When one feels it is difficult to concentrate while chanting, one should first collect    one’s wandering thoughts and chant sincerely with serious effort. Then one’s mind    will be unified. To unify one’s mind, one must first be sincere and serious. If sincerity    and seriousness are lacking, it is not possible for one to collect one’s wandering    thoughts. If one is sincere and serious, but the wandering thoughts persist, one    should attentively listen to one’s own chanting.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Whether the chants are silent or voiced, every chant must arise from one’s mind.    The voice exits one’s mouth and enters one’s ears.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Giving rise to the Buddha-name clearly with one’s mind, chanting it clearly with    one’s mouth, and hearing it clearly with one’s ears will help unify one’s mind and    the wandering thoughts will naturally stop. If one’s mind is still flooded with wandering    thoughts, then one should use the ten-chant-and-count method, and devote all one’s    energy to chanting the Buddha-name. Even if the wandering thoughts still exist, they    will not be able to function.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">This is the ultimate method to unify one’s mind and one’s chant.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">Those who expounded the Pure Land school in the past did not mention this method    because their faculties were considered sharp enough and they were able to unify    their minds without it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">I had problems collecting and controlling my wandering thoughts and then realized    the effectiveness of this method. I have used it many times and never failed. I am    not sharing this information lightly or by imagination. I want to share this method    with everyone as well as those in future generations so that anyone who practices    this method can successfully attain rebirth in the Pure Land.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">What is the ten-chant-and-count method?</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When chanting, one chants ten times in a single breath. Every chant must be clear,    and one must count and remember where one is and stop at the tenth chant. One then    repeats the process, but never counts to the twentieth or the thirtieth chant. One    must count and remember while chanting, and not rely on moving the chanting beads.    Counting and remembering must be in one’s mind.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">If it is difficult to complete ten chants in one breath, one can chant for two breaths.    The first breath is for the first five chants, the second breath for the remaining    five chants. If two-breath chanting is still difficult, one can break the ten chants    into three breaths. The first through the third, the fourth through the sixth, and    the seventh through the tenth chants complete in three breaths.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">If one can chant clearly, count and remember the chants clearly, and hear one’s own    chants clearly, wandering thoughts will have no place to step in. Over time, the    state of one-mind undisturbed can be attained naturally.</span></span></p>

At all times, one feels aversion to the suffering of the cycle of birth    and death in the Saha world and believes and yearns for the Bodhi bliss in the Western    Pure Land.</span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When one does a deed, if it is a good one, then one dedicates the merit to rebirth    in the Western Pure Land; if it is a bad one, then one repents and vows to be reborn    in the Western Pure Land. One has no other aspirations. This is vow.</span></span></p>

              <p class="Normal-P"><span class="Normal-C"><span style="color: #565e56; font-family: Verdana; font-size: x-small;">When one has both belief and vow, mindfully chanting the Buddha-name to attain rebirth    [in the Western Pure Land] is the main practice, and correcting wrongdoings and cultivating    good deeds is the auxiliary practice.</span></span></p>
