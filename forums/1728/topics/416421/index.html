              <p>His Eminence Gongkar Dorje Dhenpa Rinpoche (Tenzin Jampel Lungtok Namgyal), the current throne-holder of the Dzongpa tradition of Sakya was born in 1977 in India. Recognized as the reincarnation of Dorje Dhenpa Kunga Namgya in 1988 and graduated from Sakya College in 1999, he holds the Kachupa degree (equivalent of B.A.) and Acharya degree (equivalent of M.A.). He had undergone yearly retreats after graduation.<br>He was enthroned in 2003 by His Holiness the Sakya Trizin at the newly build Gongkar Choede Monastery which is the seat for Dzongpa in India.<br>Since then, His Eminence Dorje Dhenpa Rinpoche has taken full responsibility for the running of the monastery and the revival of his lineage, supported by the monastery’s abbot, Khenpo Jampal Chodzin, and the sixty-one resident monks. All the monks have personally taken part in building the monastery, which sits deep in a forest in the district of Dehradun. The winding forest road that leads to the monastery and the small Tibetan community of Khera Goan was also made by them, and they cultivate their own organic fruits and vegetables, as well as put out the occasional unfortunate forest fire!<br>The main focus of the Monastery is the study and practice of the rituals, philosophy and meditation that form the backbone of Buddhist monastic life. Now the time has come to fully revive the actual practice by senior qualified monks at the new temple to consolidate the Dzongpa as a flourishing facet of the jewel that is Tibetan Buddhism. The main monastery will then be able to focus wholeheartedly on the education and training of younger monks, and His Eminence’s long term vision is to extend the capacity of Gongkar Choede, both physically, in terms of infrastructural as well as academically, to have a school for the higher study of Tibetan Buddhism.<br>The Head of the Ngorpa Branch of the Glorious Sakya Tradition, His Eminence Luding Khenchen Rinpoche, once commented, “Like a small candle that burns very brightly, so this small monastery has developed so well”. In that same spirit, His Eminence has slowly begun to accept invitations to bring the blessings of the lineage abroad. In recent years His Eminence had travelled widely to these regions visiting Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau Malaysia and Singapore. This will be His Eminence second Visit to Singapore.</p>
