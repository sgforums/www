              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Practicing with the four traditional lovingkindness slogans</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Walking along the Rhine River during my lunch break from
              teaching yoga in Basel, Switzerland, I felt mellow and full of gratitude to
              have such a wonderful job opportunity. Then my phone started to vibrate. Instantly
              my mood shifted, and a powerful sense of urgency took hold of me. It was like a
              Rube Goldberg chain reaction—I was balancing a cappuccino in one hand, fighting
              an uncooperative purse zipper with the other, trying to keep my glasses on my
              nose, and worrying that someone was calling from my mother’s nursing home.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As my phone rang a thought flashed through my mind: “Since
              everybody who knows me knows I am in Europe and there is a five-hour time
              difference, this must be important and I’d better answer!” My life was built on
              the idea that taking care of my mom and my students and my business and my
              friends and my dog must come before my own needs, including the needs for
              space, peacefulness, and quiet appreciation of life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">I realized I was working myself into a dither by letting my
              phone be the boss of me. And why? Out of sheer habit. My need to answer the
              phone was part of an automatic-pilot way of thinking that told me it was wrong
              and selfish to put myself first.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">After the incident in Basel I got to a place where I felt
              stuck. I had been badly hurt by a dear friend who told me that since I hadn’t
              been there for her when she needed me, she was turning her back on our
              friendship. It was the last straw for me. How could she abandon me when my life
              was so hard already? I was stuck in a puddle of anger, pain, and betrayal. I
              told myself that I wanted to forgive and forget, and I knew that my resentment
              was hurting me, but I couldn’t seem to let go of it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Then I went to hear Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo, a nun in the Tibetan
              Buddhist tradition, give a talk. During the talk, Jetsunma paused and said in a
              soft voice, “Let go. Let go. Let go.” It was then that I knew I was ready to
              let go.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jetsunma granted my request for a meeting and greeted me at
              the door with a big hug. She offered me a cup of tea and a seat on her couch.
              We sat facing each other with our legs crossed, and I told her how I felt hurt
              by my friend’s accusations that I had not been a good friend, that I had not
              given her the attention she needed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">When I had finished speaking Jetsunma held my hand and simply
              said, “You must take this onto your path.” She told me that I had to let go and
              forgive everyone. “And that includes yourself,” she said. Aha! How had I
              forgotten that so completely?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Jetsunma suggested that I begin practicing maitri for myself.
              Like many Buddhist practitioners, I’ve always loved the practice of maitri, or
              lovingkindness. I learned to use this practice as a method for cultivating
              genuine caring and good will for others. Practicing maitri toward others fits
              nicely with my bodhisattva vow, a commitment to living one’s life in a way that
              is helpful to all living beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The practice of maitri is deceptively simple. You repeat
              these four lines:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">May you be happy </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">May you be healthy </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">May you be safe </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">May you live with ease</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Each time you recite the sequence of lines, you visualize a
              different category of sentient being:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Those you love </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Those you don’t love </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Those you have never met</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">These three categories cover the entire spectrum of how we
              relate to other beings: attachment, aversion, and ignorance.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Practicing maitri helps to soften the boundaries of these
              categories. It opens our hearts and reminds us of our commonality with
              everyone. When we really see, in our mind’s eye, a person we think we don’t like,
              and instead of solidifying our reasons for hatred we honestly wish them
              happiness, good health, safety, and an easeful life, we start to forget what we
              thought we hated and why we felt that way in the first place. A sense of
              equanimity toward everyone arises as we do this practice—we feel compassion for
              those who were once invisible to us, and our disregard and apathy morph into
              concern for their well-being and safety.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">And just as we sometimes feel love or hatred toward others,
              sometimes we feel love toward ourselves, sometimes we hate ourselves, and
              sometimes, now and then, we don’t even notice ourselves. As a Buddhist, if my
              focus is truly to help others, I need to work with these emotions toward
              myself. Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo reminded me that walking the bodhisattva
              path—dedicating one’s life to the benefit of all beings—includes doing whatever
              we can to help ourselves be happy and free.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The little cell phone drama in Basel was not such a big deal,
              but if you add up all the moments when you become exhausted or stressed out
              because of the mistaken sense that you are doing something for someone else,
              those moments become a pile of resentment, isolation, and feelings of
              depletion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Many of us have people who need and depend on us. How can we
              really be helpful to others when we are depleted? What good are we to others
              when our generosity has shriveled and our patience has run out? I’d like to be
              more loving, but I also know it is my responsibility to give myself time,
              space, sleep, exercise, fun, and healthy meals. When I take the time to provide
              myself with those things, I find that I have more goodness to give to others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Thinking of yourself first, when your goal is to help others,
              might seem counterintuitive, but in fact it is the only way it can work. In the
              end, the notion of putting oneself last is really an inside-out form of
              self-cherishing. That’s why during pre-flight instructions the flight attendant
              says to put on your own oxygen mask first, and then put on your child’s mask.
              When we are happy, healthy, safe, and at ease, we can model those qualities for
              others as well as make choices and take action from a place of sanity and
              lovingkindness. The following maitri practice will help you to open your heart
              and connect to the sentient beings around you.</span></p>
