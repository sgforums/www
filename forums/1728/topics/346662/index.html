              <div class="title"><strong> - Nondual Emptiness Teachings - </strong></div>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>Why Emptiness?</strong></div>
              <p>Emptiness
              is another kind of nondual teaching. Emptiness teachings demonstrate
              that the "I," as well as everthing else, lacks inherent existence. The
              notion of lacking inherent existence has several senses. In one sense,
              empty things <em><strong>lack essence</strong></em>, which means that there is no intrinsic quality that makes a thing what it is.  In another sense, empty things <em><strong>lack independence</strong></em>,
              which means that a thing does not exist on its own, apart from
              conditions or relations. A great deal of what one studies in the
              emptiness teachings demonstrates that these two senses amount to the
              same thing. Emptiness teachings are found mainly in Buddhism, but there
              are some surprising parallels in the work of Western philosophers such
              as Sextus Empiricus, David Hume, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Jacques Derrida,
              Richard Rorty and many others.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>How Is Emptiness Nondual?</strong></div>
              <p>The
              most common connotation of "nonduality" is "oneness" or "singularity."
              Many teachings state that everything is actually awareness; those
              teachings are nondual in the "oneness" sense in which there are no two
              things. But there is another sense of "nonduality." Instead of
              nonduality as "oneness," it's nonduality as "free from dualistic
              extremes." This entails freedom from the pairs of metaphysical dualisms
              such as essentialism/nihilism, existence/non-existence,
              reification/annihilation, presence/absence, or intrinsicality/voidness,
              etc. These pairs are dualisms in this sense: if you experience things
              in the world in terms of <em><strong>one side </strong></em>of the pair, you will experience things in the world in terms of <em><strong>the other side</strong></em> as well. If some things seem like they truly exist, then other things
              will seem like they truly don't exist. You will experience your own
              self to truly exist, and fear that one day you will truly not exist.
              Emptiness teachings show how none of these pairs make sense, and free
              you from experiencing yourself and the world in terms of these
              opposites. Emptiness teachings are nondual in this sense.</p>
              <p>For
              those who encounter emptiness teachings after they've become familiar
              with awareness teachings, it's very tempting to misread the emptiness
              teachings by substituting terms. That is, it's very easy to misread the
              emptiness teachings by seeing "emptiness" on the page and thinking to
              yourself, "awareness, consciousness, I know what they're talking
              about." Early in my own investigations I began with this substitution
              in mind. With this misreading, I found a lot in the emptiness teachings
              to be quite <strong><em>IN</em></strong>comprehensible! So I started
              again, laying aside the notion that "emptiness" and "awareness" were
              equivalent. I tried to let the emptiness teachings speak for
              themselves. I came to find that they have a subtle beauty and power, a
              flavor quite different from the awareness teachings. Emptiness
              teachings do not speak of emptiness as a true nature that underlies or
              supports things. Rather, it speaks of selves and things as essenceless
              and free.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>Emptiness in Buddhism</strong></div>
              <p>According
              to Buddhist teachings, freedom from suffering dawns when we realize
              that we ourselves, as well as all things, are empty.</p>
              <p>In
              Buddhism, suffering is said to come from conceiving that we and the
              world have fixed, independent and unchangeable natures that exist on
              their own without help from anything else. We expect that there is a
              true way that self and world truly are and ought to be. These
              expectations are unrealistic and prevent us from granting things the
              freedom to come and go and change. We like pleasant things to abide
              permanently, and unpleasant things to never occur. We experience
              suffering when we actually encounter comings, goings and change.
              Suffering often takes the form of anger, indignation, existential
              anxiety, and even a sense that, as they say in TV sitcoms, "something
              is wrong with this picture."</p>
              <p>But when we deeply realize that
              we and the world are empty, we no longer have unrealistic expectations.
              We find peace and freedom in the midst of flux.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>What Does Emptiness Mean?</strong></div>
              <p>What are things empty of?  According to the Buddhist teachings, things are empty of inherent existence.</p>
              <p>Being
              empty of inherent existence means that there is no essential, fixed or
              independent way in which things exist. Things have no essential nature.
              There is no way things truly are, in and of themselves. We will
              investigate the notion of inherent existence in more detail below.</p>
              <p>Different
              Buddhist schools or tenet systems have different ways of characterizing
              emptiness; they have different ways of helping students reduce
              suffering. My characterization of emptiness adheres somewhat to the
              Tibetan Gelug-ba school of Prasangika or "Consequentialist" Madhyamika.
              The term "prasangika" is Sanskrit for "consequence." The "consequence"
              designation comes from this school's method of debate and refutation,
              which follows Nagarjuna's style in his <strong>Treatise</strong>.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>The Consequentialists' Dialectical Approach</strong></div>
              <p>The
              Consequentialists do not argue for substantive positions, but proceed
              dialectically. They argue by drawing out the unwanted and unexpected
              logical consequences entailed by their interlocutors' positions. The
              Consequentialist style of refutation is as follows: while in debate
              over metaphysical issues with an interlocutor, the Consequentialist
              refutes the interlocutor <strong>not</strong> by negating the
              interlocutor's statement with a counter-statement (e.g., that matter
              exists, not Mind), but by finding an inconsistency or a <em><strong>reductio ad absurdum </strong></em> among the interlocutor's statements. This allows Consequentialism to be
              positionless with respect to issues, most notably on questions of
              existence and non-existence.</p>
              <p>Imagine a philosopher coming up
              to a man who is sitting quietly against a tree, and telling the man
              that the tree truly exists because it is of the nature of Mind, and
              only Mind really exists. The sitting man is a consequentialist. He
              doesn't have an opinion on the existence or non-existence of Mind or
              the tree, and doesn't wish to convince the philosopher of a contrary
              position; he's just sitting there. So he <strong>won't </strong>offer a counter-claim or argue that the tree <strong>really doesn't</strong> exist as Mind. Instead, he will draw out more statements from the
              philosopher until the philosopher is involved in a contradiction. Or he
              might show that the philosopher's assumptions entail an absurd,
              unwanted conclusion. Then he'll go back to sitting against the tree.</p>
              <p>The
              Consequentialist school is the most thoroughgoing of the Mahayana
              schools in its rejection of any kind of intrinsic nature. Even though
              it is the school of His Holiness the current Dalai Lama, most of the
              Dalai Lama's public teachings are about other topics of wider interest.
              Emptiness teachings can get abstract and subtle, and not everyone is
              interested in them. But if you do find books in English on emptiness,
              most of them are likely to be written from the Consequentialist
              standpoint. You will find a list of these books in the <a class="linksinline" href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html#references">References below.</a></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">(Click to show in full)</span></p>
              <p>According
              to the Buddhist emptiness teachings, the world is made up only of
              things that are "selfless" or empty. Even non-existents are empty.
              Non-existents would include round squares, the hairs of a turtle, etc.,
              and <em><strong>inherent existence</strong></em>.  Existents are divided into two classes, compounded things and non-compunded things.</p>
              <p>Compounded
              things are said to disintegrate moment-to-moment, in a way analogous to
              aging. They are impermanent in this sense. Compounded things have
              pieces or parts and are produced from combinations of other factors.
              Compunded things include physical objects, colors, shapes, powers,
              sensations, thoughts, intentions, feelings, persons, collections, and
              states of being. These various things fall under the categories of Form
              (colors, shapes and powers), Consciousness (the sensory modalities and
              thinking processes), and Compositional Factors (collections and states
              of being).</p>
              <p>Non-compounded things include do not distintegrate
              moment-to-moment. In this sense, they are said to be "permanent." There
              are two kinds of "permanent" existent. There are "occasional
              permanents," which come into existence and go out of existence. These
              include, for example, the space inside the cup and the emptiness of the
              cup. Even though the cup is compounded and consists of parts (such as
              the rim, the handle, the walls, etc.), the space inside the cup and the
              emptiness of the cup are not compounded and do not consist of parts.
              Also, the emptiness of the cup and the space inside the cup stop
              existing when the cup stops existing. There are also "Non-occasional
              permanents," such as emptiness in general and space in general. These
              are the referents of general concepts, and exist as long as any objects
              or relations exist.</p>
              <p>For the student of emptiness, it is not
              important to remember or utilize this scheme or employ these categories
              in one's day-to-day use. What is important is to learn the lessons
              taught by this scheme:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>According to the Buddhist world-view, everything that exists is said to be empty </li>
              <li>For each thing, there is also the corresponding emptiness of that thing, because to exist is to be empty </li>
              <li><em><strong>Inherent existence falls under the category of non-existent things</strong></em> </li>
              </ul>
              <p>This
              last point is especially important when it comes to meditating on
              emptiness. When you meditate on emptiness, what you actually look for
              is inherent existence. Instead of finding inherent existence, you will
              find the <em><strong>lack</strong></em> of inherent existence.  This lack itself is emptiness.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>Emptiness and Dependent Arising</strong></div>
              <p>According
              to the Mahayana paths of Buddhism that emphasize the notion, emptiness
              is what the early Buddhist sutras were pointing to when they presented
              the notion of <em>pratÄ«tyasamutpÄ�da</em> (Sanskrit) or <em>paticcasamuppÄ�da</em> (Pali), namely "dependent arising":</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices:<br>When this is, that is.<br>From the arising of this comes the arising of that.<br>When this isn't, that isn't.<br>From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.<br> (<strong>Anguttara Nikaya</strong> X.92; <strong>Vera Sutta</strong>)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Centuries later, Nagarjuna (2nd century C.E.) became the preeminent expositor of emptiness teachings.  His <strong>MÅ«lamadhyamakakÄ�rikÄ�</strong> (<strong>Treatise on the Middle Way</strong>)
              is today considered the most profound and sophisticated exposition of
              emptiness in Buddhism. The text provides scores of arguments for the
              conclusion that to propose any kind of inherent existence or
              metaphysical essence involves the proponent in logical contradictions
              and incoherence. Chapter 24 actually contains two specific verses that
              characterize the notion of emptiness itself:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Whatever is dependently co-arisen,<br>That is explained to be emptiness.<br>That, being a dependent designation,<br>Is itself the middle way.  (<strong>Treatise</strong>, 24.18)<br><br>Something that is not dependently arisen,<br>Such a thing does not exist.<br>Therefore a nonempty thing<br>Does not exist.  (<strong>Treatise</strong>, 24.19)</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>In verse 18, Nagarjuna sets up a three-way equivalence:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>emptiness : dependent arising : verbal convention</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>and
              identifies this equivalence with the Middle Way. The Middle Way is a
              form of nonduality that is free from the dualistic opposites of
              essentialism and nihilism. Even emptiness itself is characterized as
              being empty. It is empty because, instead of having the inherent nature
              of being dependent arising, it is merely "explained to be" dependent
              arising.</p>
              <p>In verse 19, Nagarjuna states that whatever exists,
              is in some sense dependently arisen, that is, empty. If something is
              not dependently arisen, then it is not empty. If it is not empty, then
              it does not exist. And of course even things we would normally consider
              as non-existent, such as unicorns and round squares, are also empty.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>Conventional Existence</strong></div>
              <p>So
              how do things exist if they don’t exist inherently? According to the
              Buddhist teachings, things exist in an everyday, non-inherent,
              dependent way. Our mode of existence is dependent on many things, such
              as the causes and conditions that give rise to us, the components that
              make us up, and the ways we are cognized and categorized. According to
              the teachings, we are not separate and independent entities, but rather
              we exist in dependence on webworks of relations and transactions.</p>
              <p>For
              example, we can say that a bottle of milk exists in a dependent,
              conventional way because you can go to the store, lift the bottle of
              milk off the shelf, pay for it, and bring it home. It exists in
              dependence on its surroundings, its having been manufactured, and in
              relation to the actions of the store employees and yourself. The bottle
              of milk is not found to exist independently of these things.</p>
              <p>It
              is taught that all things are empty and dependent like this. That
              includes people and all other living beings, as well as consciousness
              and unconsciousness; pleasure and pain; time and space; cause and
              effect; good and bad; logic and math; language, meaning and reference;
              art, commerce and science; planets, boulders and bridges; unicorns and
              Sherlock Holmes; energy, thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations.
              Whatever exists is said to exist conventionally, but not inherently.</p>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>Emptiness Itself is Empty</strong></div>
              <p>Even
              emptiness is empty. For example, the emptiness of the bottle of milk
              does not exist inherently. Rather, it exists in a dependent way. The
              emptiness of the bottle of milk is dependent upon its basis (the bottle
              of milk). It is also dependent upon having been designated as
              emptiness. As we saw above, this is alluded to in Nagarjuna’s <strong>Treatise</strong>, verse 24.18.</p>
              <p>Understood
              this way, emptiness is not a substitute term for awareness. Emptiness
              is not an essense. It is not a substratum or background condition.
              Things do not arise out of emptiness and subside back into emptiness.
              Emptiness is not a quality that things have, which makes them empty.
              Rather, to be a thing in the first place, is to be empty.</p>
              <p>It
              is easy to misunderstand emptiness by idealizing or reifying it by
              thinking that it is an absolute, an essence, or a special realm of
              being or experience. It is not any of those things. It is actually the
              opposite. It is merely the way things exist, which is without essence
              or self-standing nature or a substratum of any kind. Here is a list
              characteristics of emptiness, to help avoid some of the frequent
              misunderstandings about emptiness, according to the Buddhist
              Consequentialists:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>Emptiness is not a substance </li>
              <li>Emptiness is not a substratum or background </li>
              <li>Emptiness is not light </li>
              <li>Emptiness is not consciousness or awareness </li>
              <li>Emptiness is not the Absolute </li>
              <li>Emptiness does not exist on its own </li>
              <li>Objects do not consist of emptiness </li>
              <li>Objects do not arise from emptiness </li>
              <li>Emptiness of the "I" does not negate the "I" </li>
              <li>Emptiness is not the feeling that results when no objects are appearing to the mind </li>
              <li>Meditating on emptiness does not consist of quieting the mind </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>More on Inherent Existence</strong></div>
              <p>Inherent
              existence is the kind of existence we uncritically think things have,
              existing under their own power, without help from anything else. Our
              sense that things exist in this way is the root of our suffering,
              according to the Buddhist teachings. We have a sense of this inherency
              partly due to how we think of language. We think that words are labels
              pointing straight to pre-formatted, already-individuated things in the
              world outside of language or cognition. This tendency to feel inherency
              can even be intensified if we follow essentialist philosophies such as
              Platonism or materialist realism, which hold that things exist
              according to their own essential nature, independent of anything else.
              Our natural tendency to feel this inherency is the root of suffering,
              according to the emptiness teachings. Actually, being able to locate
              and isolate this sense of inherent existence in yourself is good news.
              The more clearly you can grasp the sense of inherent existence, the
              more powerfully you will be able to realize emptiness when you do your
              meditations.</p>
              <p>What does the sense of inherent existence feel
              like? We will say much more about this later, but briefly, it feels
              like something <em><strong>is really there, just like that, being what it really is</strong></em>.
              You've had a very definite sense of inherent existence if you've ever
              wondered whether something or someone has been given the "correct"
              name! Or could it perhaps have been given the wrong name??</p>
              <p>According to the emptiness teachings, inherent existence is the kind of existence that things do <em><strong>not</strong></em> have.  Things actually <em><strong>lack</strong></em> inherent existence, because they exist as dependent arisings. This
              dependency is the lack of inherent existence, which in turn, is their
              emptiness.</p>
              <p>The relation between inherent existence, emptiness
              and dependent arising can be seen through the translation of the
              Sanskrit or Pali terms for depending arising: <em><strong>pratÄ«tyasamutpÄ�da</strong></em> (Sanskrit) or <em><strong>paticcasamuppÄ�da</strong></em> (Pali).  The Sanskrit components are individually translated as follows:<br><br> <em><strong>PratÄ«tya</strong></em> = Meeting, Relying or Depending   <strong>+</strong> <em><strong>Samut</strong></em> = Out of   <strong>+</strong> <strong><em>Pad</em></strong> = To go, to fall</p>
              <p>Notice the three English terms for <em><strong>PratÄ«tya</strong></em>, <strong>Meeting</strong>, <strong>Arising</strong>, and <strong>Depending</strong>.
              These have been given three different kinds of meanings by the
              consequentialist writers (see H.H. the Dalai Lama, 2000, pp. 35ff in <a class="linksinline" href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html#references">References</a>), so as to cover all the variations of dependent arising.  These kinds of dependence are explained as follows:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>
              <p><strong>MEETING -</strong> The coming together of causes and conditions in time. The cessation of
              cause comes into contact with the onset of effect within a network of
              supporting conditions. Examples would include one billiard ball
              striking another, or the sperm and ovum coming into contact at human
              conception. Because of uncritically thinking that things and people
              exist inherently, we can sometimes be surprised by the effects of the
              "Meeting"-style dependent arising. An example would be the surprise at
              the aging process if we see someone for the first time after a long
              absence. This is the least subtle of the three types of dependent
              arising.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><strong>RELYING -</strong> The way a
              thing depends on its pieces and parts. The pieces and parts of an
              object are sometimes called its "basis of designation." According to
              the emptiness teachings, we would see roots, a stalk, branches and
              leaves, and based on this, designate the object as a "tree." These
              various parts are the tree's basis of designation. Being a tree is
              dependent upon the basis of designation. The tree cannot be said to
              exist if its basis of designation did not exist. For example, if you
              have a car in the parking lot over a long period of time, and vandals
              come and steal pieces here and there over several months, there will
              come a certain point at which there won't be enough parts for you to
              call it a car. This is how the car depends upon its pieces and parts,
              or its basis of designation. Even though this seems reasonable if we
              think about it like this, it's never theless easy to think that the
              true car exists in a way <em><strong>apart from</strong></em> the
              basis of designation, as though there were a "true car" that existed in
              an ideal realm of some sort. This sense that the car exists without
              depending on its basis of desgination is the sense of the inherent
              existence of the car. This is more subtle than "Meeting"-style
              dependence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><strong>DEPENDING -</strong> The way
              a thing depends on being designated by convention, language, or
              cognition. Did Mount Everest exist before it was named? Did sub-atomic
              particles exist as such before they were ever thought of? Would a "rose
              by any other name" still be a rose? We look at the shape, size and
              structure of a natural formation of the earth, and call it a
              "mountain." According to the Consequentialist emptiness teachings, we
              would say that the basis of designation (formations of earth) existed,
              but the "mountain" as such did not exist until it was designated by the
              process of convention and cognition. According to emptiness teachings,
              it makes no sense to say that something exists if it was never
              designated or cognized. Nevertheless, it seems to us that things are
              always there regardless of cognition, and that cognition is a process
              of mere neutral <em><strong>discovery</strong></em> of what was
              pre-formed and present all along. This feeling of independence from
              designation or pre-formed existence is not only an easy feeling to get
              hold of, it might even seem like common sense to most people. This is
              another kind of sense of the inherent existence of things. But the
              emptiness teachings question this. This critique, this
              "Depending"-style of dependency (as opposed to the "Meeting" and
              "Relying" types of dependency) will be familar to those who have
              studied Advaita-Vedanta, Mind-Only Buddhist teachings, or the
              philosophy of Idealism. The emptiness teachings are not themselves a
              form of Vedanta or idealism (because emptiness teachings posit that
              physical objects do exist externally and physically), but they agree
              with the views which hold that uncognized objects do not exist. This is
              the most subtle of the three types of dependent arising.</p>
              </li>
              </ul>
              <p>According to Buddhism, anything that exists exists conventionally,
              through the network of dependent arisings, that is through Meeting,
              Relying or Depending. Even emptiness exists in this way. But we think
              and feel that things exist without these dependencies. <em><strong>For
              something to inherently exist, it would have to exist without any
              dependencies at all. It would exist without Meeting, Relying or
              Depending.</strong></em> It is the job of emptiness meditation to find inherent existence, to ascertain whether it exists as we feel it does.</p>
              <p>Other terms for inherent existence, gathered from Buddhist and Western sources, would include the following:</p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li>the reality of the thing irrespective of culture or language or human consciousness </li>
              <li>objective existence </li>
              <li>independent existence </li>
              <li>true essence </li>
              <li>Platonic essence </li>
              <li>real existence </li>
              <li>ontological existence </li>
              <li>the thing as it really is </li>
              <li>the thing in-itself </li>
              <li>the is-ness of the thing </li>
              <li>beingness </li>
              <li>actuality </li>
              <li>thinghood </li>
              <li>perseity </li>
              <li>self-sufficient being </li>
              <li>self-inclusive being </li>
              <li>essential being </li>
              <li>instantiation in reality </li>
              <li>subject of ontological commitment </li>
              <li>the thing’s entitification </li>
              <li>the way it really is, regardless of what anyone thinks </li>
              <li>the reality of the thing as opposed to its appearance </li>
              <li>what science will eventually discover the thing to be </li>
              <li>the way God intends the thing to be </li>
              <li>"it is what it is" </li>
              <li>"it’s like that, 'cause that’s the way it is" (as the rappers Run DMC used to say) </li>
              </ul>
              <div class="lfthead"><strong>Realizing Emptiness</strong></div>
              <p>So
              how does one actually realize that all things, self and world, are
              empty? In a nutshell, the realization of emptiness of an object is
              accomplished through trying to find and validate that object's inherent
              existence. One narrows down the options and looks everywhere where the
              object's inherent existence might be found. What happens is that one
              fails to find inherent existence. What one finds is the simple lack of
              inherent existence. This lack is the thing's emptiness.</p>
              <p>According
              to the Buddhist path, one trains to stabilize the attention, abandon
              harmful actions, take up helpful actions, generate patience and
              compassion, and meditate on the nature of self and other. These various
              activities are integrated together to assist the practitioner in
              generating the insight that things are empty. Emptiness can be realized
              much more quickly this way than if the person began from scratch with
              emptiness studies themselves. Realizing emptiness is holistic and not
              merely an intellectual event. Therefore, a compassionate heart is said
              to enable the patience, spirit of generosity and flexibility of mind
              and that are required by the very subtle and tricky emptiness
              meditations.</p>
              <p>The form of Buddhism that places the most
              emphasis on emptiness meditation is probably the Prasangikga
              Madhyamika. Once the practitioner has the spontaneous desire for
              compassion and a yearning to hear the emptiness teachings, then the
              traditional teacher will begin.</p>
              <p>There are several stages in the study of emptiness, which are integrated into much of the Buddhist path itself:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p><strong>Learn valid establishment</strong> – You learn the conventional ways that phenomena are established, i.e.,
              how belief in things is justified. In Buddhism, this can be by learning
              the Buddhist teachings themselves. They can include teachings on cause
              and effect, psychology, epistemology, karma, interpersonal relations,
              compassion, the development of attention and analytical skills.
              Learning valid establishment prevents the investigator from falling
              into nihilism, which is the denial of conventional existence along with
              the denial of inherent existence. Emptiness meditation saves
              conventional existence, and refutes only inherent existence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><strong>Ascertain the object of refutation</strong> – You concentrate to get a strong sense of inherent existence. In this
              preparatory stage, you familiarize yourself with the difference between
              conventional existence (which exists, and which is demonstrated by
              valid establishment) and inherent existence (which we feel exists, but
              which the meditations prove does not exist). According to the Buddhist
              teachings, this is the issue in a nutshell, and this is the most
              challenging stage. Ascertaining the object of entailment can actually
              require months go get clear about. But the clearer you are on what
              inherent existence must be, the more able you will be to recognize it
              should you actually find it in the meditations later, and the more
              thorough your realization will be.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p><strong>Determine the entailment</strong> – You familiarize yourself with the overall logic of emptiness
              meditation. The logic is as follows: "Either things exist inherently or
              they don’t. If things have inherent existence, I should be able to find
              inherent existence by looking everywhere. But I can’t find inherent
              existence; I find only its absence, its non-existence. Therefore it
              doesn’t exist."</p>
              <p>In the case of the inherent existence of my self, the logic would go as follows:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p>My self either has inherent existence or it is empty.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>If my self has inherent existence, I should be able to find it by looking everywhere it could possibly be.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>I have looked everywhere the inherent existence of my self could possibly be, and cannot find it anywhere.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Therefore, my self is empty.</p>
              </li>
              </ol> </li>
              <li>
              <p><strong>Conduct the emptiness reasonings</strong> – These are the meditations themselves. They are called "reasonings"
              because they involve inference and entailment. They involve a form of
              logic, and are often thought of as a form of “analytic meditation.” You
              go through the steps of the emptiness reasonings in a full-fledged,
              holistic way, trying to put yourself fully into each stage. There are
              many kinds of emptiness reasoning. One of the simplest to understand is
              Chandrakirti’s Sevenfold Reasoning. It is easier to learn the stages of
              the reasoning by applying it to something neutral, such as a car. When
              the steps are familiar, you apply them to your self, where they are
              likely to have a greater effect, and the realization will prove to be
              more intense. The following is an overview of Chandrakirti’s Sevenfold
              Reasoning, as applied to a chariot:</p>
              <p><strong>Introduction: </strong>If the chariot exists inherently, I will be able to find it somewhere in or around its parts.</p>
              <ol>
              <li>
              <p>Is the inherently existent chariot exactly <strong>the same </strong>as
              its parts? No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot as equal to
              its parts. Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is it totally <strong>different from</strong> its parts? No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot apart from
              its parts. Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is it <strong>dependent upon its parts</strong>?  No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot as dependent upon its parts.  Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is it such that the <strong>parts are dependent upon it</strong>?
              No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot such that its parts
              are dependent upon it. Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is it the <strong>possessor of</strong> its parts? No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot as the
              possessor of its parts. Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is it the mere <strong>collection of </strong>its
              parts? No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot as the
              collection of its parts. Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
              <p>Is it the mere <strong>shape of</strong> its parts? No, I don't find the inherently existent chariot as the
              shape of its parts. Instead, I find its absence, its nonexistence.</p>
              </li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Therefore the chariot doesn’t exist inherently.  It is empty, existing not inherently, but conventionally only.</p>

              <p><strong>Review the relation between emptiness and valid establishment</strong> – You reflect on how the emptiness of your self and the emptiness of
              other beings and things in the world allows all of these existents to
              move, change, and interact with each other. If things had fixed and
              independent nature, as we often feel they do, then they would not be
              able to change. For example, if a tree had an essential nature as
              something containing 106 branches and 2,196 leaves, then if it lost
              even one leaf, it would be definition not be that particular tree any
              more. If we, for example, had a fixed nature as a person with just
              these physical and psychological characteristics, then we could never
              become happier more mature, or more slender without violating these
              characteristics and becoming by definition another person.</p>

              <p>There is more to the article regarding "Emptiness" from Dr. Greg
                  Goode. His insights will be invaluable as he already matures his
                  experience of non-duality similar to that of anatta. This non-dual
                  experience if can be purified by the insight of Emptiness is most
                  precious.</p>

              <p><a name="top"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">You are not a separate being. You are
                          Being, and never separate. This is the Enlightenment, the
                          happiness, in which all apparent things consist. It is
                          the very Being of you.</span></a></p>

              <p><a name="top"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">It's a
                          secret not because there's anyone hiding anything. It's
                          been proclaimed by sages around the world for millennia.
                          Rather, it's a secret because enlightenment is often
                          misunderstood to be a matter of personal achievement,
                          like scoring the ultimate goal. But there's no person
                          there! There's not even a "there" or a spatial
                          location where a person can reside. There is no
                          individualized or separate "you" or
                          "me"; no goal, no task and no achievement. </span></a></p>

                          "see" this? Experience confirms this at every

              <p><a name="top"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: #0000a0; font-size: normal;">The
                          world, body, and mind appear as sensations, feelings and
                          thoughts. These appearances are all arisings in
                          awareness. The person does not see these arisings.
                          Rather, the person is made up out of these arisings,
                          including the supposed act of seeing. If these arisings
                          are investigated, it can be seen that they do not reach
                          outside themselves. They cannot point to each other,
                          touch each other or contain each other. It is only memory
                          that suggests that there has ever been another arising.
                          But memory itself is nothing more than an arising. It
                          cannot truly point backwards or forwards to anything, for
                          during this apparent pointing, there are no objects to be
                          pointed to. There is truly nothing in experience that
                          establishes that there has ever been anything other than
                          THIS. There is no evidence that there were ever even two
                          arisings. If there cannot be two arisings, how can there
                          be even one? What is left? Awareness, our true nature.</span></a></p>

              <h4><a name="grandcentral"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">No
                          Separation</span></a></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Years ago, there was
                          lots and lots of vigilance in my life. Before and during
                          spiritual seeking, I wasn't badly suffering or in pain or
                          unhappy with circumstances in life or stuck in
                          dysfunctional patterns. Instead, I felt a deep sense of
                          loneliness, alienation, lack of fulfillment, and a strong
                          yearning from the heart and mind to know "What is it
                          all about? What is the purpose of life? What happens
                          after? What are all these mystical truths that are spoken
                          of? Where is fulfillment to be found?" I was very
                          vigilant about it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Going back 30+ years, I
                          tried many, many different paths, from Ayn Rand's icy
                          "Rational Selfishness" to the strictness and
                          ecstasy of Born-Again Pentacostal Christianity. Years
                          later, this all settled down to an intense inquiry.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">For about 5 years, one
                          question kept itself rooted in front of me. "What is
                          the core of me?" I couldn't help it - I'd ponder
                          this in every spare moment the mind wasn't engaged in
                          something else. It was a sweet and relentless yearning. I
                          really wanted to burrow into the deepest secrets of this.
                          After a few years, the question refined itself.
                          "What or where is this choosing, willing entity that
                          seems to be in evidence?" "Is that the
                          me?" "But where is it?"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The answer came one day
                          while I was reading a book about consciousness. I was
                          standing on the Grand Central subway platform during the
                          evening rush hour, and the answer came. It didn't come as
                          a conceptual statement like "It is ABC."
                          Rather, it came by way of the world and the body
                          imploding into a brilliant light, and the willing,
                          phenomenal self thinning out, disappearing in a blaze of
                          the same light. No separation was experienced; no time or
                          space was experienced, yet I knew myself as the seeing
                          itself. All "willings," "desirings,"
                          "thoughts" and other mentations were deeply
                          experienced as spontaneous arisings in awareness,
                          happening around no fixed point or location. And it
                          wasn't personal. Not only the entity "Greg,"
                          but all apparent personal entities dissolved.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Out of nowhere,
                          lightness, sweetness, brightness, and a fluidity of the
                          world became qualities of everything, and became one with
                          all experiences. My long-standing question had vanished
                          along with what I had believed was "me." There
                          arose resiliency, joy, and an untouchable happiness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">This experience
                          uncovered the realization that without the conceptual
                          structures that make things seem real, there is no
                          presumption of a separate center. There is no suffering
                          and no basis for suffering. There is no feeling that
                          things should be different than they are. This is a sense
                          of peace far beyond what happens when we get what we
                          dream about. </span></p>

                          of Enlightenment?</span></a></h4>

              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;"><strong>Q:</strong> What is it
                              about an experience that makes it an experience of
                              enlightenment? <br> <br> <strong>A:</strong> Any experience will do. All experience is
                              the same, all experience is light.</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">A strong belief in true
                          enlightenment experiences might be helpful in the
                          beginning as one searches for direction, pointers and
                          confirmation. Certain experiences are very encouraging
                          and inspiring. An out-of-body experience, where we look
                          down at the physical body on the bed while hovering and
                          moving about the room and perhaps about the country, can
                          convince us that we are not the body. An experience of
                          clearly witnessing the mind's activities can convince us
                          that we are not the mind. An experience of stillness can
                          be a pointer to the stillness beyond experience. But
                          ultimately, assuming that enlightenment is an experience
                          leads to putting enlightenment ever at arm's reach. There
                          are two problems involved, the problem of the criterion
                          and the problem of arm's reach.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">If there were such a
                          thing as a separate and distinct experience
                          "of" enlightenment, several things would be
                          necessary. You would have to have (i) a separate
                          experience, which stands in some relation to (ii)
                          enlightenment. That is, we'd say that (i) refers to (ii)
                          by being "of" (ii). But the "of-ness"
                          is a myth and doesn't exist. To rely on this of-ness and
                          "take it to the bank" involves two insoluble
                          problems: </span></p>

                          Problem of the Criterion</strong></span></a><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">What makes this
                              experience one of enlightenment? If there is an
                              experience of enlightenment, then this divides the
                              world of experience into halves, where some
                              experiences are of enlightenment and some are not.
                              Next arises the need for some kind of criterion. What
                              is it that makes this an experience of enlightenment?
                              A feeling of oneness, lack of limitations, bliss or
                              expansion? Such a criterion is usually in terms of
                              some subjectively experienced state, complete with a
                              "me" that experiences it. What makes any
                              one criterion better than another? Definitions differ
                              widely. And in the case of any criterion, it can only
                              point to some state, however lofty and heavenly, that
                              comes and goes. But THIS, NOW, is not a
                              coming-and-going thing and is never removed from the
                              present. </span></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">This is a thornier
                              problem, where enlightenment will be forever out of
                              reach. If there is an experience of enlightenment, it
                              is like a picture of dinner, not dinner itself. With
                              such an experience and its referring relationship to
                              enlightenment, enlightenment must always stand
                              outside the experience. This puts enlightenment out
                              of at arm's reach. You can never get there from here.
                              <br> <br> But worse, if enlightenment is a psychological state
                              or other object standing remote from me or standing
                              outside of experience, it makes no sense to talk
                              about enlightenment at all. In general, we have no
                              knowledge or no evidence or no experience to talk
                              about ANYTHING outside experience. The notion of
                              something existing outside of experience cannot be
                              validated by experience. In fact, any attempted
                              validation is self- defeating. Why? Because even a
                              logical or verbal proof attempting to show that some
                              object exists outside of experience actually proves
                              its own contrary, by putting that object at least in
                              some sense, like a unicorn, WITHIN our experience.
                              Experience doesn't confirm objects; it self-confirms
                              in the present. It is ever now, here. </span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">In this way, all
                          experience is the same. It is light that is the nature of
                          us. Apparent objects seem to come and go in this light,
                          but when they are searched for, they cannot be found.
                          There is no experience of enlightenment, for nothing is
                          separate from experience. Rather, experience itself is
                          light.</span></p>

                          Objects Disappear!</span></a></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">George Berkeley's THREE
                          DIALOGUES BETWEEN HYLAS AND PHILONOUS is a remarkable
                          book. It is a short, well written set of dialogues,
                          arguing in exemplary style that there can be no external
                          physical objects which are somehow perceived by our
                          sensory apparatus. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">And over 20 years ago,
                          it had the most amazing effect on the globality of my
                          experience.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Who is Berkeley? You
                          know that old philosophical question about the tree in
                          the forest, would it make a sound if no one were there to
                          hear it? He's the guy in the 18th century who answered
                          "No." Berkeley argued tirelessly that there is
                          no external physical substance. Our thoughts do not point
                          to external objects like rocks and automobiles. Rocks and
                          automobiles do not cause our thoughts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">When I was in grad
                          school going for a philosophy doctorate, my teacher Colin
                          Murray Turbayne was acknowledged as one of the world's
                          great Berkeley scholars. But to get a good grade in his
                          class, you could never write anything against Berkeley.
                          So we had to study Berkeley really carefully, because his
                          ideas sounded so utterly unintuitive, crazy really. But
                          after several months, they began to make sense.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">One day after a lot of
                          reading, Berkeley's arguments crystalized, and it felt
                          like a fog cleared from my mind. The feelings and
                          convictions about supposed external objects vanished! The
                          concepts of material substance and the attandant
                          inside/outside distinction vanished. Nor were they
                          necessary to explain our experiences. I was shaking with
                          excitement, and not just because I thought I'd now get an
                          "A" in Professor Turbayne's class.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">I went to Professor
                          Turbayne's office. He instantly saw that something was
                          different. He looked questioningly at me, and I could
                          only nod. He smiled and said, "Aha! Now go write
                          about it!" </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Since that time, over
                          two decades years ago, the inside/outside disctinction
                          has been useless to me. The notion of "material
                          substance" has been just like the notion of
                          "Santa Claus." And amazingly enough, the
                          dissolution of these notions has made it easier for me to
                          interact in what is often called the physical world.
                          Because I haven't seen anything as physical for decades,
                          there has been no fear factor. I learned to rollerblade
                          and ride a bicycle with no brakes in the traffic-filled
                          streets of New York City.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Perceptions that are
                          usually called "physical" occur as a kind of
                          language that has no inside or outside, where each
                          concept refers to other concepts in a growing and
                          consistent way. But there's nothing Out There to which
                          any of these ideas refer.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">In my case, it was an
                          excellent shake-up, like a mental Vege-matic blender,
                          preparing me for non-dualist teachings.</span></p>

              <h4><a name="free_will"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Free
                          Will and Freedom</span></a></h4>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The question of free
                          will is from the perspective of the person. Does the
                          person have free will? Many of the person's actions are
                          forced or determined by factors over which it has no
                          control. Some of these actions are accompanied by the
                          feeling of being lived, of being in the flow, in the
                          "zone." People often count these as the best
                          times. But are at least some of the person's decisions
                          and actions freely chosen? To establish free will, as is
                          discussed in Philosophy 101 classes everywhere, it is not
                          necessary to show that every action is free. Even one
                          free action would be sufficient.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;"><strong>Case 1:</strong> <br> "Will that be coffee or tea?" <br> "Hmmm, let me think.... I'll have tea,
                              thanks."<br> <br> <strong>Case 2:</strong><br> (Thought bubble rising:) "I'd love to take a
                              walk in the beautiful woods. I'd like to surround
                              myself with peace and serenity and inquire into my
                              true nature." (Putting on hiking boots, opening
                              the camper door and stepping out), "Here I
                              go."</span></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">From the perspective of
                          the person, if the decision process is not analyzed, the
                          actions and decisions in both cases above seem to be
                          perfect examples of free will. Upon analysis however, a
                          free action and a free chooser cannot be found. A thought
                          comes, followed by a desire, followed by a decision,
                          followed by an action. Tracing backwards, the action is
                          controlled by the decision, the decision is controlled by
                          the desire, the desire is prompted by the thought. The
                          thought arises spontaneously, itself unbidden,
                          un-asked-for, unchosen. First the thought is not there,
                          then it is. Nowhere in this process can a free will be
                          found. Nowhere can a freely-acting chooser be found.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">It is even too much to
                          say that the actions, decisions, desires and thoughts can
                          control or prompt each other. These cause-and-effect
                          dynamics are not even observed. Rather, they arise as
                          inferences and conclusions about what happened, that is,
                          they arise as thoughts that rise and fall.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">In something like Case
                          1, the decision might even be accompanied by a small
                          feeling of freedom, lightness, and spaciousness. And
                          maybe also accompanied by a thought, "I'm choosing
                          tea but I could freely choose coffee instead." But
                          the feeling of freedom and the thought "I
                          could" also arise unbidden. That is, the feeling of
                          freedom is not freely chosen.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The person is not the
                          locus of freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The person and the rest
                          of the world cannot be found apart from the awareness in
                          which all things appear. The person, the mind, body and
                          world arise as thoughts, feelings, and sensations. These
                          are nothing other than objects in awareness, and are
                          nothing other than awareness itself. The person does not
                          experience; the person is experienced. As awareness, we
                          are That to which these objects appear. Thoughts,
                          feelings, sensations - these objects arise from the
                          background of silent awareness, they subsist in
                          awareness, and they slip back into awareness. The
                          awareness in which they appear is not itself an object
                          but the background of all objects. It is our true nature.
                          But the objects come and go unbidden, without autonomy.
                          They are powerless and cannot do anything on their own.
                          Objects cannot possess or contain freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Is there freedom?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The silent awareness in
                          which all objects appear is the true nature of all
                          things. Awareness says YES to everything. Even if a NO
                          arises, awareness says YES to the NO. Awareness is
                          without resistance, without limits or edges, without
                          refusal and without obstruction. Awareness is not free,
                          it is freedom itself. What we truly are is not the person
                          but this awareness, this freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The person wants to
                          co-opt this freedom, to own it, to behold it, to be
                          present to use and enjoy it. But in spite of this desire
                          from the perspective of the person, the person can never
                          own That in which the person appears.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">What about teachings
                          that emphasize free will?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Entire religions and
                          ethical systems are based on this idea. Ramana Maharshi
                          told a questioner that all actions are determined except
                          the ability to inquire into one's true nature. Isn't Case
                          2 above different from Case 1?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">Sometimes teachings and
                          exhortations about personal freedom are a beautiful,
                          effective and necessary step for freedom from the idea of
                          being a person. A person who prematurely adopts a
                          "no-free-will" teaching can lapse into
                          depression and antinomian behavior. "You have to be
                          someone before you can be no one." The teachings on
                          free will borrow from the freedom that we are. Among the
                          many objects that arise in the mirror of awareness, some
                          objects arise as images of mirrors. These images are
                          taken as representations of their source. Like a mirror
                          appearing in a mirror, Ramana's teaching serves as a
                          pointer to freedom. Case 2 is not different in this
                          respect from Case 1. As objects, all cases and their
                          characters, and all teachings and all discourse (even
                          this one!) are not themselves free or self-powered, but
                          they arise from freedom and consist in freedom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">The person is never
                          free.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: normal;">As awareness, we are
                          never bound.</span></p>
