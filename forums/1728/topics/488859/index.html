              Different from Other Religions</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">While </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">moral sense is an inborn quality in
              each of us, this faculty varies from person to person. Good and bad are
              inherent in our nature though we would consciously consider certain moral
              qualities to be good and others to be bad.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Why then are there so many varying patterns of moral
              behavior existing in this world? Why are there so many conflicting moral
              standards contradicting each other offered by different religions? One can
              conclude that the differences in the moral systems lies with each religion
              issuing different standards for judging what is considered to be good and what
              is bad. Some also prescribe specific limits and roles for the various moral
              virtues and values that do not give a balanced and coherent plan on social
              conduct.</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">It is also because of
              the way they place man and their purpose on earth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Some religions think
              that what is declared in their Holy books should be universally accepted as
              they are the Words of a Supreme unfathomable being. It should never be
              questioned but obeyed by all. It is moral laws that emphasize on the purity and
              sanctity on what their God commands even if the commands are contradictory. We
              see in these God-centred religions preaching of love and forgiveness on the one
              hand and in the same breath handing out death sentences and tortures of the
              most brutal manners</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> on wrong
              doers. They sanction or command murder, rape, torture, slavery, ethnic
              cleansing, and genocide</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> on unbelievers. They condemn homosexual behavior as immoral because it is God
              command rather than whether such acts is causing harm to anyone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">These religions besides
              having a God-centred moral system, is also human-centred. It is where all
              things created by their God are considered to be resources for the human race’s
              use, consumption and pleasure. It is not an eco friendly system and is
              exploitative of other living beings and also nature as a whole.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">     </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The morality here is
              based on complete subservient, obedience and fear of punishments and also a
              promise of reward in the afterlife. Subservient and total obedience would be
              fine if there are no contradictory exceptions present in their commandments.
              But there are plenty of these where one is license or command to act upon. What
              can happen is, with total surrender and submission to a higher Supreme Being,
              an individual can be merciless, ruthless or unfeeling in carrying out such
              exceptions. There is no compassion shown, no quarter given to the victims even
              if such acts are completely bad or evil. The most visible form of these evils
              can be seen in the act of suicide bombers indiscriminately taking away innocent
              lives because of a promise of paradise in the afterlife. The more recent
              example is the trading of human lives into slavery for just a pack of
              cigarettes as is reported in the way the IS treats their captives.</span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">  </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">In the Hindu faith,
              morality is largely determined by the social environment. It is descriptive
              relativism in nature, with ethical practices hand down from ancestors. It is castes
              based and also depend on one’s stage in life with each caste having their own sets
              of duties to follow. </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">How fast one reach
              the final goal of moksha depends on how much good works one have perform within
              the caste they are born into.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">The Buddhist moral
              and ethical system can best be label as Life-centred. It is a system that
              believes in radiating ‘unconditional love’ to all living beings and nature. One
              can see this Life-centred system in the verses of the Karaniya Metta Sutta (SN
              1.8). It is the Buddha's Words on the subject of Loving-Kindness. Together with
              SN 55.7, the Veludyvareyya Sutta, a good guideline is available for the
              practice of Buddhist morality.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Also in the Cunda
              Kammaraputta Sutta (AN 10.176), the Buddha speaks of what is Unskillful Bodily
              Action as follows:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">"And how is one
              made impure in three ways by bodily action? There is the case where a certain
              person takes life, is a hunter, bloody-handed, devoted to killing &amp;
              slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. He takes what is not given. He
              takes, in the manner of a thief, things in a village or a wilderness that
              belong to others and have not been given by them. He engages in sensual
              misconduct. He gets sexually involved with those who are protected by their
              mothers, their fathers, their brothers, their sisters, their relatives, or
              their Dhamma; those with husbands, those who entail punishments, or even those
              crowned with flowers by another man. This is how one is made impure in three
              ways by bodily action”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The<span class="st1"> Blessed One, the Buddha, expounded

              follows:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 1.231;">Here, householders, a noble disciple
              reflects thus: 'I am one who wishes to live, who does not wish to die; I desire
              happiness and am averse to suffering. Since I am one who wishes to live, who
              does not wish to die; who desires happiness and is averse to suffering; if
              someone were to take my life that would not be pleasing and agreeable to me.
              Now if I were to take the life of another -- of one who wishes to live, who
              does not wish to die, who desires happiness and is averse to suffering--that
              would not be pleasing and agreeable to the other either. What is displeasing
              and disagreeable to me is displeasing and disagreeable to the other too. How
              can I inflict upon another what is displeasing and disagreeable to me?' Having
              reflected thus, he himself abstains from the destruction of life, exhorts others
              to abstain from the destruction of life, and speaks in praise of abstinence
              from the destruction of life. Thus this bodily conduct of his is purified in
              three respects.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="line-height: 13.2pt; font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The
              Veludyvareyya Sutta speaks on the subject of the 4 precepts. Besides the above
              discourse on why one should not take any form of lives, it also goes on to
              speak of the act of not stealing, not committing wrongful Sex and not using
              False Speech. This Sutta is about the ethics of </span><strong style="line-height: 13.2pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #332200;'>Reciprocity</span></strong><span style="line-height: 13.2pt; font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #332200;"> i.e., <strong>‘Do
              not do unto others what we do not want others to do unto us’</strong>. It teaches us
              to train our body and speech in the threefold purity of - Not breaking the
              precepts ourselves. Not causing another to break the precepts and not approving
              any breach of these precepts. These rules of training will provide us with the basic
              foundation for our mental cultivation with the final goal of spiritual
              liberation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.2pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #332200;'>The beauty of the ethic of Reciprocity is that, it is not
              dependent on stories, superstitions, beliefs, commandments or speculative
              views. </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  '>And even if
              one ceases to believe in the faith, </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: #332200;'>one is in no danger of our
              ethics collapsing. It is a teaching that is </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  color: #332200; '>universal and applicable to anyone in
              any age, place, or culture. It is true in the beginning, the middle and the

              to be used in the cultivation on loving-kindness. A practitioner will eventually
              cultivate a mind that is peaceful, calm and fill with gentleness. This state of
              mind will help us to generate goodwill towards all sentient beings. The
              understanding and acceptance that our actions, our kamma too will have consequences
              to ourselves will also give us the necessary mental and physical impetus to
              develop and help in keeping the 5 precepts. The intrinsic quality of loving-kindness
              would reduce and quench anyone urge</span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; '> to kill, to steal, to
              commit sexual misconduct, to lie, or to indulge in drinks or drugs. And when we
              are morally virtuous, it is easier for us to go deeper into our meditation as
              we tend to become a calmer person. </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'></span></p>

              truths of suffering, to the impermanent of all things, so too will our tendency
              to cling and to crave. Our ‘Wants’ too, will weakened resulting in us not
              desiring to compete for these things. It is a natural self-progression from
              there that as our awakening deepens, so too would our intrinsic wholesome
              qualities of love, compassion, generosity, contentment, wholesome
              communication, mental calmness and clarity become a part of our habits and natural
