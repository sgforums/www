              Comes Down the Mountain," claiming the director is demonizing their
              religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">An anonymous Taoist has published a series of questions for Chen,
              asking the director whether he knows anything about real Taoism. According to
              cnwnews.com, which published the questions, the letter’s writer is a widely
              respected figure in Taoist circles.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Taoist said he has not seen the film but has seen comments and
              plot synopses on his friends' social network and microblog accounts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"Nowadays, art needs to express the creator's thoughts while
              also entertaining, and I want to ask director Chen if this film is in accord
              with President Xi Jinping's directions for the arts? Does it promote positive
              energy?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The Taoist also asked Chen if he knew about the beliefs and
              philosophical implications of Taoism. The writer was also curious as to why in
              the film the Taoist played by Wang Baoqiang, has to seek answers from a
              Buddhist monk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"In your mind, are Chinese martial artists just concerned
              with hatred and revenge? When you used 'Taoist' in your film title, did you
              understand that you were demonizing and making fun of Taoism? How dare you!"
              the writer continued. Though the official English title of the film is
              "Monk Comes Down the Mountain," the film’s Chinese title literally as
              translates to "Taoist Comes Down the Mountain."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Finally, the Taoist questioned film censors about why they allowed
              this film to exploit Taoism for entertainment. "If it was another
              religion, would you do the same? We know the policies don't allow propaganda
              about extreme religious thoughts, but do they allow [artists] the right to make
              fun of and hurt religion? "</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The anonymous Taoist letter-writer is not the only one who has
              spoken out. Taoist master Li Zhichen also published an essay, criticizing the
              film on July 8 on a platform of Souhu.com. Li wrote that Chen used inaccurate
              Taoist costumes, mocked Taoist traditions, and twisted the image of Taoism. He
              also didn't understand why a Taoist had to consult with a Buddhist monk to
              resolve his problems in the film. Furthermore, Li pointed out that the film's
              theme song is a Buddhist song, which he thought is very strange given the fact
              that the film is supposed to be about a Taoist.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Chen Kaige and the film's producers have not responded to the controversy.
              China's film and religious departments also have not yet responded to
              questionings regarding the issue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">In 2001, Hong Kong comedian and director Stephen Chow clashed with
              the film bureau of the State Administration of Radio, Film and TV over similar
              problems during its examination of "Shaolin Soccer." SARFT refused to
              allow "Shaolin Soccer" to be released in theaters or on DVD and HS
              because of complaints from the Shaolin Temple that putting "soccer"
              alongside "Shaolin" would insult Buddhists. Chow refused to change
              the title to "Kungfu Soccer," and the film's producer was banned from
              shooting on the mainland for one year as a result, Xinhua reported.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Chen seemed not to have encountered such religious censorship
              problems.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">"Monk Comes Down the Mountain" is a Chinese
              comedy-fantasy-adventure film directed by Chen Kaige and featuring a
              star-studded cast that includes Wang Baoqiang, Aaron Kwok, Chang Chen, Lin
              Chi-ling, Fan Wei, Yuen Wah, Vanness Wu, Wang Xueqi, Danny Chan Kwok-kwan, Lam
              Suet and Dong Qi. The film also features Jackie Chan's son Jaycee Chan, who
              eventually appeared in the film despite being subject to a ban issued by
              China's government film watchdog due to the younger Chan's drug conviction
              earlier this year.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">The film tells the story of a young Taoist who finds his way and
              life philosophy through a series of strange adventures in the big, colorful and
              temptation-ridden world after leaving a monastery on a mountain. The film is a
              visual feast full of action, sex and, revenge. It has grossed 383 million yuan
              (US$61.7 million) in the Chinese film market so far, making it the
              highest-earning film of Chen's career.</span></p>
