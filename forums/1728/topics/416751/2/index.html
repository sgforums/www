              Building temples, hospitals and other charitable acts are good deeds that can be performed by anyone with the financial means and compassion.  Members of the Sangha have a higher calling, that is to strive for enlightenment in order to guide all sentient beings out of samsara.
              
              It is very distressing to know that an abbot of a temple with a large following feels it is all right to break certain monastic rules and precepts because times are different!   While it is true that we live in modern times, the amount of diligence, dedication and perserverance needed to attain enlightment remains the same, be it in the past, present or future.   Modern times are fraught with temptations, much more than in the past.  And that makes the adherence to monastic rules and precepts more important than ever. 
              
              Rev Ming Yi should do the right thing, i.e., voluntarily resign from the abbotship of Fuhai Monastery and study Buddhaâ€™s teachings all over again.  That is the least he can do to redeem himself for having twisted Buddhaâ€™s teachings during court hearings in order to justify his actions.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> I know 2 of them who are long time devotees from Foo Hai Monastery.
              One is my neighbour and another is my close friend. They are
              fiercely defensive. Reasons for being so supportive are as follows
              :</p>
              <p>1) They witnessed what Ven. Ming Yi had gone through when he
              built Foo Hai Monastery from a run down temple. According to them,
              today's Foo Hai does not come easy. Ven. Ming Yi had gone through a
              lot of hardship (in terms of raising funds and hard work monitoring
              when rebuilding).</p>
              <p>2) They witnessed what Ven. Ming Yi had gone through when Ren Ci
              was a poor hospital. Again, the hard work Ven. Ming Yi put in to
              raise funds (he contributed from his own pockets) and building it
              to today's Ren Ci.</p>
              <p>3) They had seen the other side of Ming Yi which we have not
              seen. There was a couple approached Ven. Ming Yi many years ago to
              adopt their son as they could not afford to raise their child. Ven.
              Ming Yi brings the child up personally and did not send the child
              to orphange.The child is still in the temple. He is a teenager
              now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I bear witness that what they said is true. In fact, i remember playing with the boy in example (3) when he was really still a small boy, this was in 1995. Ven Ming Yi had  taken over a really run-down temple, but started to build up the temple as well setting up Ren Ci Hospital. Not only that, in 1993 Foo Hai held one of the first Buddhist Youth Camps held in Singapore. He's done a lot of good service for the Buddhist community in Singapore and i don't think we should forget that. Yes, money corrupts but religious figures are not saints either.</p>

              <p><br>Isn't SBF responsible for all the Buddhist matters in Singapore ? SBF is doing for the sake of the Buddhist community and Buddhism in Singapore. Buddhists will lose faith in Buddhism if some Buddhist community continue to splurge on the gala dinners. This is the first time and if this is not stopped, there will be more to come. SBF is right, they ä»¥å¤§å±€ä¸ºé‡�ã€‚Buddhists contributions are for the temples and charitable deeds, not for anybody to splurge on unneccesary things.</p>

              <p>I see the demand for an apology is not that Ven. Ming Yi had made a serious mistake. As the $50,000 was not for his own use. According to my friends, Ven. Ming Yi is the type of person who hardly turns down anybody who approach him for help including long term commitment like bringing up a child. However, I see the apology is more for  ruining the name of Buddhism due to the unfortunate incident.</p>

              <p>I think the important thing is not about putting anyone down or promoting anyone to a higher "in-charge" status. Any action should have solely the intention for the preservation of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Also, there are so many Buddhist cults around teaching externalist practices masquerading in the form of Buddhism - I think that is more dangerous.</p>
              <p>We are in no position to handle the situation too, it's best to let it go and let things take their course. What we can do is work hard in our own cultivation, graduate, and come back to teach and transform beings.</p>

              <p><br> Isn't SBF responsible for all the Buddhist matters in Singapore ?
              SBF is doing for the sake of the Buddhist community and
              Buddhism in Singapore. Buddhists will lose faith in Buddhism
              if some Buddhist community continue to splurge on the
              gala dinners. This is the first time and if this is not stopped,
              there will be more to come. SBF is right, they ä»¥å¤§å±€ä¸ºé‡�ã€‚Buddhists
              contributions are for the temples and charitable deeds, not for
              anybody to splurge on unneccesary things.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Not all Buddhist centers in Singapore are affiliated to SBF, Foo Hai Monastery is though. It's not the first time that gala dinners have been held; maybe it's the first in honour of a monk whose just been released from prison, but gala dinners have been held as fundraising activities for temples and centers. Maybe the media is harping on the issue as Ven Ming Yi was just released from prison, if not, no one would be making a hoo-haa on the issue. The dinner was Foo Hai Monastery's way of commemorating Ven Ming Yi's 20th year as abbot of the temple; it just so happened that it was held after his release from prison.</p>

              <p>Look at my above reply to SevenEleven. If misappropriation of funds (which were not for his own use, he didn't pocket the money) is considered a violation of the precept against stealing, then he can be defrocked.</p>

              <p>If no one teach Monk Ming Yi what is Buddhism all about, he will still continue to do things that are hurtful to Buddhism. Hope that the senior monks will go and see him and tell him what is monkhood all about.</p>

Ming Yi when he still has a large following of devotees to sustain him. But the SBF certainly need to tighten the rules and regulations with regards to wayward monks, especially the less established ones that have to depend on SBF affiliates for their daily needs and sustenance.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-justify: inter-ideograph; text-align: justify; margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Most Buddhists would have at least taken their refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. These are the three pillars of Buddhism. The collapses of any one of these would mean the end of the religion as well. </span></span></p>

Ming Yi case involves the Sangha, and the issue of errant monks will certainly need to be addressed sooner or later. It may fade away after sometimes if nothing is done, but ultimately another errant monk will surface again in future, and the problems will still be there to be resolved. Better to solve it now where possible, and spare the pains for future Buddhists to settle on this issue. <span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p>
