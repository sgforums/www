              <p> </p>
              <p>the problem is some people try to impose secular law onto the religious world .Like asking the religion to submit an extensive report of this so and so Puja earn how much and how much .Suppose if an indonesian rich businessman donate $1million voluntarily ,do we need a lawyer and submit a request of statement to Singapore High Court to determine if HE should give ? ..</p>

              <p>"Let no man without sin cast the first stone ".I think this kind of condemnation and blame game must stop. Its basically a Sick idea of trying to probe and dig religious affairs .</p>
              <p>and i will tell you .Ven Mingyi have taken the Brahma net Bodhisattva Precepts .Only a realised person who have proven Him wrong can reprimand him for the spiritual wrong-doing. If not , i must say sorry ,the Spiritual World is beyond the secular world</p>
              <p>as the misuse of funds is basically a human folly and nothing to do with his practice .</p>
              <p>If anyone who simply want Mingyi to forever not being a Bodhisattva is asking for grave trouble</p>
              <p>there is a sutra that say ,who ever stop a works of a Bodhisattva ,will never be liberated from the cycles of samsara .This is not a curse .Devadatta is an example of that ,as he have not been liberated until distant future He become a Private Buddha</p>

              <p><br>Yes , you are right ,and it Only the Buddha . we are all ordinary human beings , not right to ask people to leave the sangha .What happen if the decision is wrong and maybe 30 years down the road , there is acty fault of someone else which Ven Mingyi is not ..the person who conduct the expulsion  ,in mahayana, is say to jam the workings of karma and will have to bear the consequence(boils appear in body, serious fever, immediate decline in health)</p>

              <p>Have you thought of another scenerio. What if there are many people who lose faith in Buddhism and sangha because of Ven. Ming Yi. Don't you think it is a worse scenerio. Lay Buddhist can also become Bodhisattva, not necessarily need to be a monk.</p>

If what you said is true, it would become a doctrine of ‘free for all’. Put is simply, what the doctrine of Emptiness is trying to tell us, is that all our reasoning is relative and dual in nature. As an example, to arrive at the judgment ‘This is Red’, our intellect would have to go through the process of separating what is ‘Red’ from that, that is ‘not Red’ first, before it can arrive at the conclusion that it is ‘Red’. Another example, to know what is 'beautiful’ we will need to have some idea of what we would consider to be ‘ugly’. The existence of all things, are based on the interdependence of each other. By itself they are nothing. It is our intellect that gives names, and forms to all empirical existence. </span></span></p>

In the Doctrine of Emptiness, it is our Intuition free of all reasoning that will eventually lead us to the answers of what is the true nature of things. It is called Prajna, i.e. Transcendental Wisdom. <span> </span></span></span></p>
