            <div class='col-md body'><p>There in Mysore H.H Penlop Khen Rinpoche reveals that Chene Lhendup Rimpoche was the reincarnation of a great Tibetan Yogi Nubchen Sangye Yeshi, one of the 25 disciples of Guru Rimpoche. H.H Penlop Khen Rimpoche insisted and said, "Do you have all the belongings that you inherit?" Chene Lhendup in turn said "I don’t know all my possession but I have got a White Horse, Dorji and Drilbu (vajara and hand bell), one old small hand drum, carpet and other religious stuff" received from Tibet. H.H Penlop Khen Rimpoche in dimmed mood said, "You haven’t got one important ritual belonging, but with difficulties you will soon have it with you."<br><br>Fortune was with Chene Lhendup Rimpoche. It was during the break time while H.E Geshe Pema Thinley and his follower Chene Lhendup set out for a refreshing walk , they came across a paired of phurbas displayed for sale. To their astonishment, they saw the paired phurbas fighting each other with dreadful sound of thunder and heavy rain from the clear sky. So immediately with the symbol of thunder and rain in the clear sky, Geshe Pema Thinley knew that it has great link and importance in his life. Then without second thought, he bought the paired dagger (phurba) with huge amount of Tibetan coins.<br><br>After wards, Geshe Pema Thinley and Chene Lhendup went to H.H Penlop Khen Rimpoche, explained the symbolic happenings, and even requested to explain them back. H.H Penlop Khen Rimpoche was happy indeed and revealed the dagger (phurba) was the property of Chene Lhendup’s incarnation. Moreover, it belongs to Chene Lhendup. H.H Penlop Khen Rimpoche even passed an order to Geshe Pema Thinley to return, If not it could bring with various misfortunes. H.H Penlop Khen Rimpoche said that it was the good fortune of Chene Lhendup and perhaps the protector deity Mahakala believes that Chene Lhendup could benefit all sentient beings and brought the relics just close too.<br><br>Read more at : http://rigzin.org/post/Dagger<br><br>Chimey Lhundrup Rinpoche, a disciple of the late HH Polo Khen Rinpoche and HE Geshe Pema Thinley Rinpoche, was born in 1932 at Minphel Kheng Tsheldang, Bhutan.<br><br>Chimey Lhundrup RinpocheChimey Lhundrup Rinpoche was a prodigy who became highly accomplished through a series of meditation retreats.
