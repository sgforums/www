People usually say the compassionate heart, and the illumined mind. Before the mind is illumined, it is unlit. The mind can be illumined by the heart, just because the heart has more Light. The mind cannot be illumined just by reading. That kind of reading is only information gathering and nothing more. Some became bloated with ego from readng too much. They think they became greater than others just because they have read more than others and so they are proud. Humility comes from the heart, not from the mind. All the goodness of mankind comes from the heart. The heart of kindness, love, peace, concern, empathy, etc, all comes from the heart, never from the mind. The heart has to guide the mind only then will the mind be safe. The mind is like a knife. You can use this knife to cut someone or use it to cut an apple and share your fruit with others. The mind without guidence from the heart is dangerous. Look around you, all the masterminds of evil are mentally very developed. But their clever minds are all unlit. There is no light in their minds, that is why they can't see what is right from wrong. If you keep thinking about the spiritual heart, its light will someday shines into your mind and guide it from there. But you must always keep on thinking and feeling the heart. There are some great minds who are/were being guided by the kind heart, such as Mother Teresa, President Nelson Mandela and Dr Tan Cheng Bock.

It's like a drop of water entering into the ocean and become one with the ocean. Mother Teresa is a good example. When our mind has learnt the art of surrender to the heart, it is a very great blessing. Higher than the heart is the divine Light within the heart.

              <p> “<span style="font-family: Arial;">An early form of Buddhanusmrti (Buddha Remembrance or Buddha Recitation) can be found in the Nikayas of the Pali Canon: </span>‘<span style="font-family: Arial;">In the Nikayas, the Buddha </span>… <span style="font-family: Arial;">advised his disciples to think of him and his virtues as if they saw his body before his eyes, whereby they would be enabled to accumulate merit and attain Nirvana or be saved from transmigrating in the evil paths.</span>’ ” <span style="font-family: Arial;">D. T. Suzuki, The Eastern Buddhist / Vol. 3, No. 4: 317 #2146 </span></p>
              <p> <span style="font-family: Arial;">When the term and its practical lore were introduced to China, they came as a highly developed meditative system, with ties to a diversity of Buddhist scriptures and deities. Amitabha and the Pure Land sutras represented but one among many such systems. The major Indian sources and early Chinese treatises on Buddhanusmrti treat it as a complex practice involving several different approaches to contemplation. </span></p>
              <p> <span style="font-family: Arial;">At its most basic level, Buddha-mindfulness begins with visual recollection of the thirty-two major marks and eighty minor excellencies of the Buddha’s glorified ‘body of form’ (Skt/rupa-kaya). Progressing to successively deeper levels of practice, one may dispense with recollection of the Buddha</span>’<span style="font-family: Arial;">s physical form and instead contemplate his boundless spiritual powers and omniscience until one ultimately arrives at the Buddha</span>’<span style="font-family: Arial;">s formless essence of enlightenment itself </span>– <span style="font-family: Arial;">a practice known as mindful recollection of the Buddha</span>’<span style="font-family: Arial;">s </span>‘<span style="font-family: Arial;">body of truth or reality</span>’ <span style="font-family: Arial;">(Skt/Dharma-kaya). Thus, although Buddhanusmrti may take a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva (such as Amitabha) as its starting point, it ultimately grounds itself in universal Mahayana truths. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This feature plants Buddhanusmrti firmly within the mainstream of Mahayana Buddhist practice, connecting it with the meditations on emptiness that we more often associate with the Perfection of Wisdom and other less devotional traditions of Buddhist scriptures.</span>”<span style="font-family: Arial;">Lopez / 95: 360-361</span></p>

              <p>There are many books like the one you mentioned. Very complicated and confusing. Books written by realised masters are very easy to understand. Most books were written by unenlightened writers. At most, they try to interpret what they know. It's very much like the blind leading the blind. When someone has been to a place many times, their explainations will be very clear and vivid. Those who never been there could only imagine what its like and when they try to explain, it's very complicating because they are using the complex human mind to explain. When a Master explain something, they dun need too many words. Their minds are very clear and tranquil. Like a calm sea that is so calm that you can see what's at the bottom of the sea. Most minds of ordinary writers are like the choppy sea when it is stormy, so all you end up is confusion.   </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good to learn Dharma concepts but cannot neglect the cultivation of the mind. There is no one-fit-for all answers. Though i think it will be useful to know oneself - like your strength and weakness. For example, i know i have some anger issue, so i try practise metta meditation to help overcome this problem. However, I can't overcome my anger issue solely relying on learning dharma concepts. When i learn how to do metta meditation, teacher also teaches some basic understanding on metta sutta and the meditation techniques. He also provided guided meditation. Then we have to practise daily at home to overcome our bad habits. But if one just solely do the practice without any understanding, then also in danger of practising wrongly. Perhaps one good way to balance is to aware the amount of time you have spent on cultivating the mind and learning Dharma concepts.. then make the adjustment accordingly.</div>

              <p>Thank you all for your replies. I'll keep them in mind as much as possible.</p>
              <p>Amitayus48 thank you also for the history lesson of nien fo. </p>
              <p>AEN: I'm not sure if this constitues "meditative practice", but everyday during lunch time I'll take a walk by myself and watch my footsteps, breathing, surroundings without labelling whatever is felt, seen, heard etc. Basically whenever I'm walking anywhere I'll do this. Lunch itself is eating meditation... as much as possible lah. Eat slowly, observe without labelling as much as possible. Repeat practice on the walk back to office.</p>
              <p>Sitting meditation, not as frequently as I should. When I do it's usually shamatha though. Trying to start doing it everyday from this month, hopefully I'll spare myself lame excuses this time.</p>

              Jui, you should be doing fine. Just keep up your learning and apply what you learn in your life.
              
              Should you be interested in vipassana meditation, or other direct paths like dzogchen, mahamudra, or the path I followed which is a mixture of selfinquiry and other direct contemplations, its good to seek an experienced teacher who can guide you.

              Sakya Pandita addresses this question extensively in his reply to Nyemo Gomchen:
              
              
              There are two kinds of Buddhist panditas and Buddhist kusalis i.e. the panditas and kusalis of the perfection vehicle will become Buddhas, but it takes a long time, three incalculable eons and so on. The pair of panditas and kusalis of the secret mantra vehicle quickly attain Buddhahood because of the arrangement of inner interconnections. In addition, a so called â€œpanditaâ€� is described as â€œA scholar in the foundation of outer and inner objects of knowledge.â€� A so called â€œkusaliâ€� is described as â€œOne who inwardly has the most dedication inwardly after severing all outer distractions.â€�
              
              In terms of actual perfect Buddhahood: first, having become knowledgeable about all objects of knowledge the pandita has severed doubt through hearing, reflection and meditation. Then, because of severing doubt through meditating which makes samadhi essential, gradually attains Buddhahood after actualizing the Dharma of realization is a pandita. A kusali necessarily has the same basis, but when considered alone, a pandita is closer to Buddhahood.
              
              Now then, if it is wondered whether there is a conflict with the statement in The Ratnakuta sÅ«tra:
              
              Compared with someone who listens for ten eons
              and then gives explanations to others,
              when someone who meditates for just a moment,
              the merit of the latter is greater than the former.
              
              The intent of that: the intention is that mediation is when a scholar understands the meaning of the object of meditation, but without understanding what sort of beneficial qualities can there be? Also Vinaya states:
              
              Donâ€™t meditate in mountain retreats without being a master of the canon.
              
              The AbhidharmakoÅ›a states:
              
              Possessing basis of discipline, hearing and reflection,
              is best applied in meditation.
              
              And as the Ä€ryÄ�charya NÄ�gÄ�rjuna states:
              
              Without relying on convention,
              the ultimate will not be realized,
              without realizing the ultimate,
              nirvana will not be attained.
              
              Therefore, since it is said many times â€œâ€¦liberation is attained in this life by listening the categories from all the sutrasâ€�, it is said that â€œâ€¦if one is not liberated by hearing, later on one should meditate.â€�
