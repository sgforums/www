               practice involves three complementary aspects – view, meditation and 
              action. The ‘view’ is what corresponds to the metaphysical perspective, 
              investigation of the ultimate nature of things, of the phenomenal world 
              and of the mind. Once this view has been established, ‘meditation’ 
              consists of familiarizing oneself (distinctively) with that view and 
              integrating it through spiritual practice into the stream of 
              consciousness in such a way that the view becomes second nature 
              (post-meditation). ‘Action’ is the expression in the outer world of the 
              inner knowledge acquired through ‘view’ and ‘meditation’. Afterwards, it
               becomes a matter of applying and maintaining that knowledge in all 
              circumstances.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 13.5pt;'>In
               this way, it seems reasonable that Buddhist ideas can perfectly well 
              impregnate someone’s mind, bringing them many benefits without their 
              necessarily renouncing what they do. In theory, there are said to be 
              eighty-four thousand approaches, or entrance doors, in Buddhism. The 
              large number is to indicate, in fact, anyone can start wherever they 
              are. To climb Mount Everest, you could set out from the traffic jams of a
               Los Angeles suburb or from the lush greenery of Ireland’s countryside. 
              The goal is the same, but the ways you might travel are different. In 
              the same way, on the spiritual path we all have to start at a point 
              where we find ourselves, each with a different character, set of 
              disposition, intellectual and belief structure. Everyone can find the 
              particular means tailored to their needs, allowing them to work on their
               thoughts, gradually setting themselves free from the yoke of the 
              negative emotions, and finally perceive the ultimate nature of the mind.</span></p>

               simple though it might seem at first, the liberation of thought is 
              neither an optimistic view of things nor a collection of recipes without
               any basis or outcome. The techniques it uses are derived from a 
              ‘contemplative science’ thousands of years old, built up at the cost of 
              considerable effort by hermits practicing, quintessentially, for hours a
               day over twenty or thirty years of their lives. It is inevitable that, 
              without taking some steps in the context of their own experiences to see
               what it’s all about, some people will feel doubtful about any knowledge
               obtained using such unfamiliar methods. Every science has its own 
              instruments, as without a telescope one cannot see the moon’s craters, 
              as without contemplative practice one cannot see the nature of the mind…</span><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 11.5pt;'><br><br></span><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 13.5pt;'>Nevertheless,
               Buddhism doesn’t claim to have discovered any new truths. The very 
              notion of ‘newness’ is, of course, foreign to any spiritual knowledge, 
              which aims at recognizing the very nature of things. But what 
              distinguishes Buddhism from a purely intellectual analysis is that it’s 
              derived from direct contemplation of the nature of the mind. It’s 
              acquired by experience, not just conceptual reasoning. Nor is it 
              knowledge that’s left as theory, like a doctor’s prescription left on 
              your bedside table without the medicine having ever been taken. It’s 
              actually put to work to eliminate from the stream of mind everything 
              that veils its underlying nature…</span><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 11.5pt;'><br><br></span><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 13.5pt;'>Perhaps
               most reasonably, to become a Buddhist one’s not obliged to adopt the 
              cultural context in which Buddhism was born and in which it was able to 
              develop in the East. Rather the essence of Buddhism isn’t ‘Buddhist’, 
              its universal because it touches the basic mechanisms of the mind. 
              Buddhism considers each person has to start where they are and use the 
              methods that match their nature and their personal capacities. That 
              specific flexibility and richness of possibilities could be useful to 
              anyone without Buddhism renouncing its fundamental values.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 13.5pt;'>In
               this manner, Buddhism is a search that concerns any human being, 
              Buddhist or not. Perhaps one could say it is not a question of how 
              Buddhism fits into one's life, but rather how one's life fits into 
              Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode","sans-serif"; color: #333333; font-size: 13.5pt;'>As
               such, it becomes neither a matter of adapting the teachings of Buddhism
               nor establishing a balance between knowledge and practice, but of being
               sure to understand its very essence – which doesn’t need any 
              adaptation, for it corresponds to the deepest preoccupations of anyone, 
              whoever and wherever they may be.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The ‘nature of the mind’ is truly ‘the ghost in the black box’ and is perhaps most relative to the first of three complementary aspects of Buddhist practice – ‘view’. Generally, and without delving into an adventure of metaphysical conventions and psychoanalytical debate, the nature of the mind is fundamentally an examination of the mind-body relationship and an examination of the ‘reality’ of matter itself. This ‘relationship’ is a classical problem for many and has been so for literally hundreds, if not thousands, of years. In fact, Descartes’ famous ‘composite human’ postulated man as a hybrid. In other words, are we made up of a mind housed inside a body? Or is a psyche separate from its material envelope in fact just an illusion, as all materialists’ philosophies and much of modern neurophysiology would claim?</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Buddhism, the conflict between materialist and idealist points of view, between mind and matter, is a false problem. In fact, in the mind of most philosophers and scientists, it’s a question of ‘solid’ matter and ‘nonmaterial’ mind being in opposition to each other. But the dominate idea today among scientists is that such dualism infringes the laws of conservation of energy by supposing that a nonmaterial object can influence a material system. Such a view of things does indeed raise a multitude of seemingly insoluble problems! So it might be useful instead to investigate the ‘reality’ of matter itself, for it’s actually in reifying matter that materialism comes up against its failure to understand ‘the nature of the mind’.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Buddhism, atomic particles can neither be ‘solid’ nor even exist intrinsically at all. No collection of such entities, however numerous, is any more real than its constituent parts. Without making too much of the parallels with modern physics, it’s hard not to be reminded of Heisenberg, who wrote, “Neither atoms, nor even sub-atomic particles, are real. They form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than of objects or facts.” For the purpose of the present discussion, suffice to say that according to this view, the opposition of mind and matter is not irreducible because neither one nor the other exists in an autonomous and permanent manner. There’s nothing, therefore, to stop consciousness being able to manifest in the brain through chemical reactions, leading to physiological processes that act on the body; nor anything to prevent such processes exerting an influence in return on consciousness. This interaction lasts as long as the consciousness is associated with the body. But Buddhists add that what guides the workings of the brain and its decisions is the nonmaterial consciousness. To deny that is a metaphysical choice made by neurobiologists, just as asserting it is a metaphysical choice made by Buddhists.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By its very nature, consciousness escapes the methods of investigation used by physical scientists. But not to be able to find something is no proof of its nonexistence. Buddhism’s choice is based on experiences acquired through contemplation, the investigation of any indirect indications that a consciousness separate from the body could exist. In Buddhist terminology, the subtle or nonmaterial consciousness is ‘without form’, but it’s not ‘nonexistent’ because it’s capable of fulfilling a function. Consciousness carries within it the capacity to interact with the body, which itself has no ultimate reality.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Buddhism, there is an interaction between consciousness and a body with which it’s temporarily associated. The stream of consciousness continues after death and experiences different states of existence between each birth and each death. The ‘embodied mind’ is what defines the relationship between the stream of consciousness and the nervous system. That embodied mind could also be called the gross aspect of consciousness, as it’s associated with the physical body. The subtle aspect constitutes the continuum of consciousness, which carries on from one life to another. It’s a continuum without beginning or end, because consciousness could never arise from nothing, nor from inanimate matter – each instant of consciousness can only be born from the preceding instant of consciousness and result in the following instant of consciousness. In physics there’s the principle of the conservation of energy: mass energy can neither be created nor disappear, but only transformed. In just the same way, we could speak here in terms of a principle of the conservation of consciousness.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a certain perspective one could possibly understand it better by considering the nature of the mind as an amalgam of the subtle and gross aspect of consciousness; a continuum, a current of consciousness for each being, which can be changed, just as the water of a river can be either polluted or purified. That’s how, through such transformation, it is possible for the confused state of ordinary beings to become the enlightened state of a Buddha. As such, understanding the nature of the mind renders and leverages partiality to ‘view’, and through view ‘meditation’, and through meditation ‘action’, hence the complementary aspects of Buddhist practice.</span></span></p>

              <p><br>Hi Jui</p>
              <p>Great to see someone asking a sincere question. My 2 cents opinion is always be humble and pick up a practice then suit u. Dharma knowledge is good. It is like Singapore Highway Code which one need to know before going for circuit driving. However, when one put onself behind the wheels, that's where the actual transfer of knowledge into practice take place. In the same manner, a person can read a lot of Dharma related materials if one fail to practice. One is like a man who knows the in and out of highway code. When u enquiry, "have u drove a car?" He might answered know or put a lot excuses for not doing so. Ultimately, he still not a driver.</p>
              <p>All great accomplished practitioner, will study and practice to excel. May it be Theravada or Mahanayana.</p>
              <p>Finally, I would like to quote a phrase from Nichiren writing, <strong>"Exert yourself in the two ways of practice and <span class="marker03">study</span>. Without practice and <span class="marker03">study</span>, there can be no Buddhism. You must not only persevere yourself; you must also teach others. Both practice and <span class="marker03">study</span> arise from faith"</strong></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The ‘nature of the mind’ is truly ‘the ghost in the black box’ and is perhaps most relative to the first of three complementary aspects of Buddhist practice – ‘view’. Generally, and without delving into an adventure of metaphysical conventions and psychoanalytical debate, the nature of the mind is fundamentally an examination of the mind-body relationship and an examination of the ‘reality’ of matter itself. This ‘relationship’ is a classical problem for many and has been so for literally hundreds, if not thousands, of years. In fact, Descartes’ famous ‘composite human’ postulated man as a hybrid. In other words, are we made up of a mind housed inside a body? Or is a psyche separate from its material envelope in fact just an illusion, as all materialists’ philosophies and much of modern neurophysiology would claim?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Buddhism, the conflict between materialist and idealist points of view, between mind and matter, is a false problem. In fact, in the mind of most philosophers and scientists, it’s a question of ‘solid’ matter and ‘nonmaterial’ mind being in opposition to each other. But the dominate idea today among scientists is that such dualism infringes the laws of conservation of energy by supposing that a nonmaterial object can influence a material system. Such a view of things does indeed raise a multitude of seemingly insoluble problems! So it might be useful instead to investigate the ‘reality’ of matter itself, for it’s actually in reifying matter that materialism comes up against its failure to understand ‘the nature of the mind’.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Buddhism, atomic particles can neither be ‘solid’ nor even exist intrinsically at all. No collection of such entities, however numerous, is any more real than its constituent parts. Without making too much of the parallels with modern physics, it’s hard not to be reminded of Heisenberg, who wrote, “Neither atoms, nor even sub-atomic particles, are real. They form a world of potentialities or possibilities rather than of objects or facts.” For the purpose of the present discussion, suffice to say that according to this view, the opposition of mind and matter is not irreducible because neither one nor the other exists in an autonomous and permanent manner. There’s nothing, therefore, to stop consciousness being able to manifest in the brain through chemical reactions, leading to physiological processes that act on the body; nor anything to prevent such processes exerting an influence in return on consciousness. This interaction lasts as long as the consciousness is associated with the body. But Buddhists add that what guides the workings of the brain and its decisions is the nonmaterial consciousness. To deny that is a metaphysical choice made by neurobiologists, just as asserting it is a metaphysical choice made by Buddhists.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">By its very nature, consciousness escapes the methods of investigation used by physical scientists. But not to be able to find something is no proof of its nonexistence. Buddhism’s choice is based on experiences acquired through contemplation, the investigation of any indirect indications that a consciousness separate from the body could exist. In Buddhist terminology, the subtle or nonmaterial consciousness is ‘without form’, but it’s not ‘nonexistent’ because it’s capable of fulfilling a function. Consciousness carries within it the capacity to interact with the body, which itself has no ultimate reality.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">According to Buddhism, there is an interaction between consciousness and a body with which it’s temporarily associated. The stream of consciousness continues after death and experiences different states of existence between each birth and each death. The ‘embodied mind’ is what defines the relationship between the stream of consciousness and the nervous system. That embodied mind could also be called the gross aspect of consciousness, as it’s associated with the physical body. The subtle aspect constitutes the continuum of consciousness, which carries on from one life to another. It’s a continuum without beginning or end, because consciousness could never arise from nothing, nor from inanimate matter – each instant of consciousness can only be born from the preceding instant of consciousness and result in the following instant of consciousness. In physics there’s the principle of the conservation of energy: mass energy can neither be created nor disappear, but only transformed. In just the same way, we could speak here in terms of a principle of the conservation of consciousness.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">From a certain perspective one could possibly understand it better by considering the nature of the mind as an amalgam of the subtle and gross aspect of consciousness; a continuum, a current of consciousness for each being, which can be changed, just as the water of a river can be either polluted or purified. That’s how, through such transformation, it is possible for the confused state of ordinary beings to become the enlightened state of a Buddha. As such, understanding the nature of the mind renders and leverages partiality to ‘view’, and through view ‘meditation’, and through meditation ‘action’, hence the complementary aspects of Buddhist practice.</span></span></p>
