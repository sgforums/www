              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">(Chinese version below)</p>

May all beings avoid all negative deeds, perform all positive deeds and purify their minds.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">1ã€�<br>When I (Achuk Lama Rinpoche) was asked where Chalole's younger brother had taken rebirth, i replied, "Is this person deaf?" Everyone replied, "Yes, Tsewang is deaf." I said, "He seems to have killed a snake." They said, "When he was young, he dug out a snake and killed it while playing." I said, "Behind your house, there is a pile of rocks, in it is the snake. Bring it here." When they went to look, they really found the snake and brought it to Lama Rinpoche. Later the snake was salvaged through confession by recitation of scriptures etc.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">2ã€�<br>Rongta lama asked me about his mother's rebirth. I said, "Use the silver lamp-holders to offer countless butterlamps, recite Akshobhya Buddha's ritual frequently, by this power, she will take rebirth in the eastern pureland of manifest joy."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">3ã€�<br>Someone asked me about his father's rebirth when i was beside Zhala monastery, i said, "He has reborn in the womb of your family's horse." Later when further asked, I said, " The brown/tanned color female horse's group of foals, among them the one with a black lip is the one. All the prayers were performed for him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">4ã€�<br>I went to Shangya to perform 100,000 burnt offerings. There, an old man called Zhaduo who due to having harmed a great master was now boiling in hell, i could not help him.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">5ã€�<br>In Shangya, Genxi's partner when performing rituals for crossing-over the dead soul, asked me to observe. I said, "Reborn as a huge fish, many small fishes are chewing on its body, experiencing unbearable suffering." Due to this, for two days, i did not recite anything but rested in meditation. That old man was a fisherman in Gantse, his trade was well known by everyone.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">6ã€�<br>Quzha Lama of Kangnan monastery asked me to observe when he was performing prayers for the deceased, i said, "As this person always meditated on Guru Rinpoche as a Yidam, he has taken rebirth in the Copper Auspicious Mountain (Guru Rinpoche's pureland).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">7ã€�<br>Yezhu Norbu asked me to observe, I said, "This old man did many negativities. He is experiencing great sufferings in the lower realms. Quickly do many positive merits for him, other that this, nothing can dissipate his sufferings."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">8ã€�<br>I was asked to observe concerning Ah Dan's old mother, i said, "This old lady has some wound on her left foot?" "That was shot by a gun when she was escaping in the past." "Due to her great arrogance, she has been reborn as a snake." "There is a gun, should we sell it to raise funds for creating merits for her, or should we destroy it?" Lama Rinpoche said, "Destroying it is good, she will take rebirth in a positive realm. I dare to guarantee it."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">9ã€�<br>When i was reciting one morning, in a state i observed, at the foot of the western mountain there was a large slab of rock, beside it, a young man was giving rise to great anger. I exerted my mind strongly thinking to benefit him. This man is the son of the official in Lada, he killed someone and was executed by the country.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">10ã€�<br>When i was staying in Palyul, Karma Tsewang asked about the old lady Tsela's rebirth. I said, "She is attached to a golden ear ring." Several days later, they brought that golden ear ring to me. Her family said, "Can we use 1000 yuan to perform prayers and keep this golden ear-ring?" I said, "This ear-ring is worth 10,000 yuan, how can 1,000 yuan do? This is your partner, do as you see fit." They used the ear-ring for her prayers and she took rebirth in a positive realm.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">11ã€�<br>Lawei, an old man, killed storks in the past, but owing to power of the prayers at his death, took rebirth as a heavenly stork in the heaven of the 33rd. The mother and son storks were of the same size.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">12ã€�<br>Raowa Losang Dechen's daughter died of a fierce illness. When asked, i said, "This lady, during her illness, cut off all relationship with everyone, therefore she had no attachment to the place where she got sick. She has taken rebirth as an elephant in India."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">13ã€�<br>Someone from Dalomairema asked me about his father. I said, "Your father has taken rebirth seven times as an animal. These animals have been killed by you." This person did not believe me. I said, "I will tell you in more details, first time, you killed a beast beside a rock, it was trapped by you with an iron hook. It did not die immediately but died after great torment. After a few days, you went to retrieve it home. The second time, you killed a musk deer, in this way you killed 7 times." Thus the man believed me as if he had seen a real Buddha and did the necessary prayers.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">14ã€�<br>Someone from Adaiwa came to see me, he said, "I have not killed any animals in the past and will not kill any in the future. Apart from not accepting this, however when life is long, it becomes troublesome." I said, "You said you have not killed any animals before. But at the turn opposite the mountain slope, there is a small tree, isn't the buzzard there killed by you?"</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">15ã€�<br>An old man from Datama said, "My old partner is dead. Please observe her rebirth whether it is in a good realm. If it is not, i will give all my property to do prayers for her. Do you think this is necessary?" I said, "You bought a horse this year, your partner is attached to this horse. You should give up this horse and create merits for her!" He said, "This horse is a good horse that i have been eyeing for a long time. Without this horse, i have no way..."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">16ã€�<br>When the matter of Sharewa's Gaishe rebirth was posed to me, Norbu Zhede said, "Use another 300 yuan to do merits." I said, "After his death, beside the monastery, at a collapsed wall, he has reborn as a insect. After the death of the insect, he will go to a good realm."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">17ã€�<br>Nada Menje's son died. When arranging for his death, i said, "Once killed a snake, the snake is obstructing his path to liberation." His mother said, "When he was playing with many other kids, they killed a snake together." I said, " You can't say it this way, the crux is who is playing the leading role, this snake was killed with your son leading. Perform the ablution initiation, most probably will take rebirth in good realms."</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">18ã€�<br>A tulku died, someone asked me about his rebirth. I said, "This tulku has no rebirth because he received too much wealth through offerings. He is now in hell suffering." Besides this i did not say much more because i did not want the benefactors to have wrong view and waste their (merits) of giving.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">19ã€�<br>Liaoxi's Zhalo asked me to observe about his mother's death. I said, "Reborn as your family's Yak calf. " His family asked, "There are two new calfs, which is the one?" I replied, "The one with a shorter right hoof. It has already been killed this winter." They did prayers for this.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">20ã€�<br>I was asked to observe about Liaoxi's Agong's death. I said, "He killed numerous animals in the past, maybe more than 2000 animals?" He said, "Yes." I said, "He was born as the guard dog of your family. The one with a grey-blue coat and white back is his rebirth. That dog was killed with a stone after it bit the doctor Zangxia.

I said, "Make a mani banner that is as long as his body as a merit to salvage him. He is now enduring the suffering of being cooked and burnt in the hells. " It was done as i said.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 12.800000190734863px; line-height: 19px;">22ã€�<br>Menjie asked about Sangye Lhamo's death, i said, " She died from a knife, and had great anger.

" Before his death, as the water bags by the window were blown by the wind, he lost his temper at all the people and ordered, "Take it down!"

I asked again, "Did the old man kill frogs and insects?" They said, "When he was young, people called him 'Insect killer'. When we asked another teacher how to help him, the reply was, 'Make a Vajrasattva Hundred Syllables prayer banner, he will not fall in the lower realms.' Now what is your recommendation to help him?" I said, "I can't decide now, use the mani mantra." Later they asked Yangtrul. Yangtrul said, "What Lama (Achuk Lama Rinpoche) said is true, but besides the lower realms, where else is there for him? After three years, that deceased can take a human rebirth again."</p>

Upon sleeping, in a state, i saw that there was someone hung on the ceiling of the tent. In a state of nonduality between appearances and mind, i recited powa. The second day i asked, "Did anyone die in this tent before?" They replied that someone called Tudeng from Xinlong had hung himself in the tent. They asked, "For such evil karma, is there any way to counter?" I said, "Recite the Liberation by Hearing for 100 times would be sufficient." Later, I asked Tulku Rinpoche (Arik Rinpoche), the reply was "You benefitted him somewhat, but there is a need for different kinds of prayer."</p>

I will also perform great austerities for her sake." I said, "There is no need for austerities. Go and circumambulate Zhejie mountain." Kunla's husband and brother Yewa came to ask about her. I said, " Go and circumambulate Zhejie mountain, there is an insect born in a rock slab, need to recite 11 times 100 million mantras." I went to Ache's home to perform prayers and on my way back, met Yewa who was circumambulating Yachen's mani stone heaps. I asked, "Are you returning now? Due to the power of merits, the deceased will take rebirth as the daughter of Huazhong after losing her insect body, she will get happiness." When Yewa returned home, they were using the deceased's ashes to practice and found a slab of stone to grind the bones into powder. There was a insect under the stone which was still alive. It was alive for more than 11 months, and after that, they practised the ablution and blessed sand methods on the insect, it died later on. That insect should be the one.</p>

I said, "Born as a white insect the size of the point of a needle in the bark of a tree." It was winter at that time. I went to ask Tulku Rinpoche, "These appearances, will the insect still be alive in November?" The reply was, "Sentient beings have uncertain karma, there is no way to know." Later, when i asked Sera Yangtrul, the reply was, "It is the tree bark, but whether it is the rock slab is not certain."</p>

I jokingly wrote on the letter, "You should know clearly where this person is born, aren't you the one who salvaged him? Aiya, i saw that he seemed to be in a hell of red bronze being cooked and burnt. The karma is to maliciously break the bronze pot of Jiadu monastery. " In the past, when Jiadu monastery was having a puja, one night, someone drilled a hole in the bronze pot, but no-one knew who did it, but it seems that this is the person. There were many more happenings at that time.</p>

              <p>Interesting.  Please help me clear my confusion.  </p>
              <p>As I know that what the person will be or going through after death all depends on the deeds or karma she created while living and nothing can stop her from facing the effects of all the bad karma she created while living.   How is it that prayers can supersede bad karma created while living and get the person to take rebirth in a positive realm?</p>

              <p>According to a popular Chinese superstition, ghosts are released from hell in the 7th month of the Chinese calendar for a one-month break in the human world. In order to appease them, animals are slaughtered and offered to these 'hungry ghosts', together with other food. Big feasts and other festivities are held during this month and the most 'auspicious day' is the 15th day of the month. It is so widespread that this yearly affair is dubbed the Month or Festival of the Hungry Ghosts. What is this all about?<br><br>Among the chief disciples of the Buddha was one named Maudgalyayana. He had immense supernatural powers: Deva-foot ubiquity which made it possible for him to appear at any place at will, the divine sight of Deva-eye to have unlimited vision of all things, large and small, near and distant; Deva-ear to hear all sounds regardless of the distance. Furthermore, he had the ability to read and understand whatever was in a person's mind. He also had the ability to see clearly the events that occurred in a person's many past lives aeons ago. Thus, Maudgalyayana is considered to be a Maha-Bodhisattva who is foremost in supernatural powers.<br><br>One day, his Deva-eye saw that his deceased mother had transmigrated to the realm of the hungry ghost. Her stomach was enlarged and she had tiny limbs. Her throat was as small as the eye of a needle, and as a result, it was impossible for her to eat any food or even to swallow a drop of water. Maudgalyayana could not bear the sight of his mother in such an extreme state of suffering. He immediately filled his alms bowl with food and with the immense power that he possessed, he sent it to his mother. However, she could not have the food because each time it turned into charcoal before she could put it in her mouth. It hurt Maudgalyayana to see what was happening and because of his strong emotion for his mother, it hindered his ability to see the karma that she had committed in her past lives. He went to Buddha for advice. The Buddha closed his eyes and entered into pure contemplation. With great compassion and gentleness, he said: "Maudgalyayana, your mother did not believe in the retributions arising from the law of cause and effect. She committed many evil deeds. She dishonoured the Buddha and insulted the Sangha [1], had no respect for the Three Treasures (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha), was greedy, filled with hatred, ignorant and arrogant. She was a wicked person who committed many evils, and she teased others giving them no peace. Therefore, she is suffering such a bitter consequence. Even though you are her son and your filial piety touches the heavens, these are still not able to save a person who had committed such serious evil karma." On hearing this, Maudgalyayana wept in pain.<br>Notes<br>1.     Sangha<br>The corporate assembly of at least 3 monks; in general the term has come to mean a monk, or monks.<br>2.     Bodhi<br>From budh; knowledge, understanding; perfect wisdom; the illuminated or enlightened mind.<br><br>The Buddha continued to console him, "It is impossible to rely solely on your own effort to save your mother from the realm of the hungry ghost. The only way is to use the combined merits of the Sangha. The 15th day of the 7th month of each year is designated "Buddha's Joy Day". This is the last day of the Sangha's summer retreat, and because of the purity with which the Sangha observed the precepts and practised cultivation, many attain the Bodhi [2]. The merits that they accumulate are immense beyond imagination, and the Buddha is most delighted. If you make an offering to these Sangha during this time, you can liberate your deceased parents and relatives from the suffering of the three evil realms (realms of animal, hungry ghost and hell) through their immense merits. If the parents are still living, then they shall be blessed with good health, happiness and a life of abundance. This is the truly marvellous method of giving salvation to the deceased." Maudgalyayana was delighted to hear this, and carried out the Buddha's advice accordingly. Thus, on the 15th of the 7th month after the offering to the Sangha, Maudgalyayana's mother was liberated from the suffering of the realm of the hungry ghost.<br><br>To give offering to the Sangha in this way is called the 'Ullambana' method. After Maudgalyayana received the benefits from this Dharma, he was very grateful to the Buddha and praised the merits of the Three Treasures. He advised people to promote the 'Ullambana Dharma'. This day, the 15th of the 7th month, can also be considered an occasion to express our gratitude and filial piety to our parents and ancestors. Unfortunately, the passage of time saw a gradual erosion in its understanding and purpose, so much so that this special occasion is not performed in accordance to the Dharma. Today, this auspicious celebration has become a day of widespread slaughter of animals to be used as offering to the hungry ghosts. The original act of performing offerings to the Sangha has become a day for feasting and making offerings to the hungry ghosts, often referred to as 'to invite the good brothers to a feast'. These practices are not only against the compassion of the Buddha, but also a let down to Maudgalyayana who had advised the world to be filial and to perform good deeds.<br><br>When we refrain from killing and protect all lives, we actually accumulate the merit of longevity and good health. It is meaningless to kill other living beings and offer them to the ghost, because they cannot benefit from these at all. Instead, those who kill shall have to repay for their action by suffering endlessly in hell. Unless we put an end to all forms of killing, the world forever shall not have peace. If the tradition of offering to the ghosts and the deceased on this day cannot be changed, the least we could do is to replace the slaughter and offer of meat with vegetarian food, flowers or fruits. It does not matter if we are not able to make offerings to the Sangha on this day, but at least we could invite them to chant the sutra for the purpose of liberating the deceased. In this way, it benefits both the living and the deceased.</p>

              <p>As I know that what the person will be or going through after
                  death all depends on the deeds or karma she created while living
                  and nothing can stop her from facing the effects of all the bad
                  karma she created while living.   How is it that prayers can
                  supersede bad karma created while living and get the person to take
                  rebirth in a positive realm?</p>

              <p>Hi SJ,</p>
              <p>Pureland / positive realm is a positive manifestation of mind.  Just like a good dream or bad dream are all manifestations of mind.   Due to the prayers, positive intention and Buddha's blessings, the deceased mind is affected positively, and gives rise to positive phenomenon like the higher realms/pureland.  That is a good rebirth.  It is not that the bad karma created is gone totally, but that the positive influence is much stronger and so it manifest first.  </p>
              <p>Very strong positive deeds can also dissolve the severity of negative karma if done with sincerity and altruism.  Just like a salty solution if poured into a large pool full of clean water, the saltiness  (analogy for negative karma) will be so diluted by the clean water (analogy for positive karma) that it can hardly be tasted.  But that is not to say that the negative karma (or salt) is gone.  </p>
              <p>The law of cause-and-effect always operates.  In some cases above , you see that although the prayers are being done but it is still insufficient to help the deceased escape the lower realms.  In some cases above, you see that the prayers can only help the deceased to a better state like human birth in a poor family but not to the Buddha's pureland.  So dharma practice and observing cause-and-effect carefully, whatever you do in this life is very crucial.</p>
              <p>Also another point to note, if the deceased did not have sufficient merits in this or past lives, she would not have had someone to ask the <strong>authentic</strong> Guru and to do all these prayers for her.  It is impossible.</p>
              <p>Using the ear-ring is just to cut the deceased's attachment to the ear-ring.  Attachment is something that binds the mind, so it is not helpful to the deceased, or alive people for that matter.</p>
