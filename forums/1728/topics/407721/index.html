              <p><br> Bankei Yotaku (1622-1693) was a wonderful exponent of our true nature. 
              He called it the Unborn Buddha Mind, and talked of it in the everyday 
              language of ordinary people, rather than in the convoluted language of 
              philosophy and mysticism. For this reason, his teachings are as valuable
               today as they were in Seventeenth Century Japan where he gave them to 
              the world, in the hope of helping suffering beings out of their 
              self-created hells. For this reason, it is felt that the present 
              exploration of the 'Song of the Mind’ will benefit anyone seeking 
              clarification in the search for awakening to our Unborn Buddha Mind.<br></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Unborn and imperishable</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Is the Original Mind”</strong></div>
              <p><br> When Bankei speaks of  “the Original Mind,” he is talking of our true 
              nature, the bottomless ground of our being. Moreover, he is using 
              language common to the Zen masters of old, among whom the famous Huang 
              Bo (died c.850) said that the One Mind is the Buddha, which is unborn in
               its nature. This Original Mind is unborn in that it is not created, 
              that is to say it is not dependent upon anything, and is indeed not a 
              ‘thing’ itself. Bankei says that it is imperishable - it cannot be 
              destroyed. Now, since thoughts, emotions, memories, and 
              sense-consciousness are all conditioned and ephemeral, they cannot be 
              anything to do with the Unborn Original Mind. Therefore, it is not mind 
              in any conventional (or current scientific) understanding of the word. <br></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Earth, water, fire and wind</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>A temporary lodging for the night”</strong></div>
              <p><br> In traditional Buddhist parlance, as in other ancient philosophical 
              systems, “earth, wind, fire and wind” represent the primal four elements
               of the natural world, and as such, also account for the human body. 
              Bankei states that this form is no more than “a temporary lodging for 
              the night.” A temporary lodging for what, however? If the mind is 
              accepted as being temporary as stated above, then this is not the ‘what’
               that is being referred to by the Master. Indeed, when its transient 
              nature is accepted, the mind as much as the body can be considered a 
              temporary lodging, too. Both are impermanent phenomena playing host to 
              what Bankei calls the Unborn. <br></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Attached to this ephemeral burning house</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>You yourselves light the fire,</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Kindle the flames</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>In which you're consumed.”</strong></div>
              <p><br> “This ephemeral burning house” is another term for the body, and by 
              extension the mind that is interwoven with it. And, as the Buddha taught
               in the famous Fire Sermon, the body and mind are “burning with the 
              fires of passion, hatred, and delusion; burning with birth, ageing, and 
              death, with sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair.” Furthermore,
               we cannot blame others for our self-created suffering; nor can nature 
              be blamed, for it is simply the way it is, and it is our own egotistical
               minds that create suffering around it. We “kindle the flames” by 
              attaching to what we like and resisting what we dislike, rather than 
              accepting life as it is. This ego-perpetuated misery ends up consuming 
              the mind, born of our constant thirst for life to be the way we want it 
              to be, and not the way it actually is.<br></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Search back</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>To the time</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>When you were born</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>You can't remember a thing at all!”</strong></div>
              <p><br> Bankei encourages us to think back to when we were born, or as close to 
              that time as we can because as newborns we do not have these cynical 
              minds making tall demands of life, but rather innocent ‘blank sheets’ 
              upon which life writes its poetry, both beautiful and grotesque. Sure 
              enough, as babes we quickly decide on what we like and what we don’t 
              like, crying when we don’t get our own way; but even toddlers still have
               moments when the clear and indiscriminating mind of innocence remains, 
              illuminating their world. Indeed, even adults can sometimes 
              spontaneously experience the Unborn, for it is our natural underlying 
              state, and out of it comes the struggling egos that we mistake ourselves
               to be.<br></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Keep your mind as it was</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>When you came into the world</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>And instantly this very self</strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Is a living ‘thus come’ one”</strong></div>
              <p><br> Here Bankei encourages us to “keep your mind as it was when you came 
              into the world” because he knows that this pure state of innocent 
              knowing is the very Unborn Buddha Mind that is without the sufferings of
               the limited human minds that we normally identify with. On top of this,
               he states that “this very self is a living ‘thus come’ one.” A ‘thus 
              come’ one is a title of a Buddha, and Bankei is saying that if we 
              recognize and retain the pure Mind that precedes and sits behind the 
              conditioned mind, we will rest in the unconditioned and unborn Buddha 
              Mind. This is not, as Bankei makes clear, not something to be believed, 
              but rather an experience to be known. And here, we come to a crucial 
              point in all of this: how do we realize the Unborn? It is not through 
              thinking, for enlightenment precedes all thought; it is not through 
              feeling, for enlightenment precedes emotions. We must regain the vision 
              of an innocent babe. And we can do this by looking at ourselves with the
               pure Eye of an infant. To do this, please conduct the following 
              reflection, remembering that it is not our thoughts or emotions that are
               important, but the essential experience itself.<br></p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><em>Look carefully at whatever is 
              opposite you at this moment. Take notice of its size, shape, colours, 
              and opacity. Now, turn your attention around 180 degrees and focus upon 
              that which is doing the looking. Examine what you see here for any of 
              the same qualities you observed earlier: right now, right here, is there
               any size, shape, or colour to be seen? Moreover, is what is here opaque
               or transparent? Lastly, is what is seen here and what is seen there 
              actually separate, or are they in fact a unity of things and ‘No-thing’?</em></div>
              <p><br> If Bankei is correct in that the Unborn is ever-present amidst the born,
               and that it is in fact our natural state, it shouldn’t be too difficult
               to locate. And, as it turns out, if we turn around and accept what is 
              present instead of what we think or believe should be present, the 
              Unborn is revealed. As it was never born, it can never die, and is 
              always awaiting us if we pay enough attention to the way things are 
              right now. Retaining this vision, we will spontaneously produce all the 
              wisdom and compassion we need, straight out of nowhere. Doing thus, we 
              are each a “living thus come one” awake to our true nature, as well as 
              the relative nature true that appears in it. Why not look and see 
              whether or not Bankei is correct – what have you to lose?</p>

              <p>On the Primordial Unborn Mind:</p>
              <p>In the sutras this evening, Ta Hui is raising the most fundamental questions about<br>meditation.<br><br>A few things need to be understood before we can discuss the sutras. The first is about your thinking process, which Ta Hui calls discriminating consciousness -- in other words, your mind.<br><br>The mind is constantly involved in thinking, in judging, in evaluating. Its whole function<br>seems to be to keep you involved in thoughts, which are nothing but soap bubbles -- or<br>perhaps soap bubbles have more substance to them than your thoughts. Your thoughts are almost like writing on water ... no thought leaves any trace on your mind. Your mind is almost like the sky: the birds fly, but they don't leave any footprints in the sky. The sky remains as it was before the birds came and after the birds are gone. To become aware of this is to enter into another dimension of your consciousness, beyond the discriminating consciousness. The discriminating consciousness consists only of thoughts. Beyond it is a consciousness which consists only of watching -- not thinking but only witnessing, just seeing ... not for, not against, nor appreciating, nor condemning -- simply seeing, just the way the newborn child sees.<br><br>Look for a moment at the newborn child: he has eyes, he has consciousness. He looks all around, he sees all the colors, the flowers, the light, the people, their faces, but do you think the child recognizes the color green as green? Do you think he discriminates between a woman and a man? Or that this is beautiful and that is ugly?<br><br>He has a non-discriminating awareness. He is simply seeing everything that is there, but he has no judgment about it. He cannot have -- he has not yet been introduced to the color called green, the color called red. It will take a little time for him to learn discrimination. In fact, our whole education is nothing but creating discriminating consciousness in every person. Every person is born with a non-discriminating consciousness -- that is a witnessing consciousness. He is born with that which a sage finally achieves. It is a very mysterious phenomenon that what the sage attains ultimately, the child has from the very beginning. It is not coincidental that different sages, different mystics of different ages, have become aware of the fact that the final illumination, enlightenment, is nothing but regaining your childhood. The same consciousness that you had the first moment you were born has to be attained again. It is not something new that you achieve; it is something ancient, eternal, that you rediscover.<br><br>You get lost into the world ... there is every opportunity for you to be lost, because the world needs all kinds of discriminations, judgments, evaluations, the idea of good and bad, the idea of right and wrong -- all kinds of shoulds and should-nots. The world necessarily needs them, and it trains every child for them. The child goes on getting more and more lost into language, into words, into thoughts, and finally comes to a point from where he cannot find the way back home.</p>
              <p>Jesus says, "Unless you are born again you will not understand the kingdom of God." What does he mean when he says, "Unless you are born again ..."? It is obvious, the meaning is clear: unless you look at the world and existence again as a child ... And that is the essential meaning of meditation: to help you to get out of the mind, to help you to get out of the discriminating consciousness and make a path so that you can enter into a witnessing consciousness.<br><br>~ Osho</p>
