              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Haven't been here for a while, thought
              I will just type a little.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As a father, sometimes we really
              encounter dilemmas when we teach our children. We will tell them,
              work hard, study hard, if you do not study hard you will become like
              me. Yet the mother's gentleness, despite her constant bickering with
              the dad, always seem to reveal the same logic. Work hard son, study
              hard, you are all our hopes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sometimes, growing up pains is as such.
              You have to first become a father yourself, or a mother yourself, in
              order to vaguely understand why a few thousand year logic still stays
              relevant, despite all the latest marital systems that are popping out
              like linux distros.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sure, it is complicated sounds like the
              most popular Marital Status ever since Friendster started it and
              trademarked it several years ago.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I guess where I am coming from, is that
              people need options, and when what used to be an ancient Oriental
              no-choice situation of either married or unmarried, and everything
              else is kept as a hush hush, nowadays as a culture embracing the
              West, as long as it works, it is good.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I am still figuring out how to install
              my first software driver after installing OpenSuse linux version
              11.4. 4 years away from the open-source environment, I am amazed that
              linux nowadays look as good as Windows, if not better. And everything
              is free.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Just like Buddhism is, compared to some
              other Creator religions that require you to donate 10% of your
              salary.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Still, back to basics, while I was
              doing my quiet time, aka vipassanna meditation yesterday, I
              questioned in tranquility to the point of the validity of precepts. I
              do not doubt that refuge in the Triple Gems is important, so are the
              five precepts.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">However, I drilled in further to what
              the five precepts entail, and let us flag out sexual misconduct since
              it is where my topic originated off with. Without a guru, without
              staying within a sangha on an extended basis, there is only one
              outcome.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A very basic principle, known as I
              undertake the precept to abstain from sexual misconduct, can become a
              packet of popcorns which you can keep munching on when you watch
              others' relationships acted out in front of you as if a melodrama,
              and me too, I am acting out my life for you to wish that I would just
              shuddup, because what is supposedly a simple 1+1=2 in a primary
              textbook, is now “It is complicated” because I dug it up from
              under the carpet.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Today I was at the Ang Mo Kio
              southbound platform and I watched the Thai girl (I thought was a boy)
              fall head forward onto the platform. He/ She saw the incoming train,
              picked up herself and rushed underneath the platform for shelter.
              Still, the train did not stop in time. I thought she died. With all
              the crowd screaming, even if she did not die, I would.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">How could it be possible that she fell
              forward in such a manner as if she was doing a dive from a swimming
              pool? Looks like she was dizzy or somehow.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It is complicated. Really. Sometimes I
              really cannot bear to watch.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I broke down after I walked out of the train station without taking my train, called my house and asked somebody to bring me home, then as I sat by the pavement with people watching me as if a beggar.. I just thought the loveliest sight happened when two familiar faces appeared to pick me up with the Civil Defence vehicles roaring on the other side of the road.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sorry for the zen-ish rants... to me, this is just like what the meaningless sutras seem to suggest, we cross people over, yet essentially nobody gets crossed over.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Thank Guan yin ma nobody got killed today on the tracks. I hope they did something to fix back the legs. It's hard to believe in a Creator these days who have u made for his fun, but as I learnt from experience, there are good and bad ways of interpreting a religion.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I just hope to say that like the Vilamakirti sutra taught, how should a Kiasee singaporean react when terrified by fear of life? To which there is always a better explanation than me being Your toy. I am sorry, I saw my doctor and ate my tranquilizer, but I want to do something MEANINGFUL before I sleep.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>Manjusri: To what should one resort when terrified by fear of life?</p>
              <p>Vimalakirti: Manjusri, a bodhisattva who is terrified by fear of life should resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Manjusri: Where should he who wishes to resort to the magnanimity of the Buddha take his stand?</p>
              <p>Vimalakirti: He should stand in equanimity toward all living beings.</p>
              <p>Manjusri: Where should he who wishes to stand in equanimity toward all living beings take his stand?</p>
              <p>Vimalakirti: He should live for the liberation of all living beings.</p>
              <p>Manjusri: What should he who wishes to liberate all living beings do?</p>
              <p>Vimalakirti: He should liberate them from their passions.</p>
              <p>Manjusri: How should he who wishes to eliminate passions apply himself?</p>
              <p>Vimalakirti: He should apply himself appropriately.</p>
