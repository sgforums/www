              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Bhutan may be in the
              middle of a power play between regional rivals – long-time protector India and
              China.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">China has begun
              courting the only neighboring country with which it does not yet have
              diplomatic relations – Bhutan. Throughout modern history, the Himalayan kingdom
              has depended heavily on India, which is following events closely.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Bhutan, a 38,394
              square kilometer country with 750,000 inhabitants, is in the unenviable
              position of being squeezed between the two most populous countries on earth
              that are also regional rivals. China is keen to establish diplomatic relations
              with Bhutan, although authorities in Thimphu recognize that such a move could
              not be done without at least tacit approval of India.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">In August, Bhutan’s
              Foreign Minister Damcho Dorji visited Beijing, and the discreet diplomatic
              dance follows years of quiet contact. In the early 1980s, foreign ministers of
              China and Bhutan held talks at the UN headquarters in New York – officially
              about the border issue. China claims a few hundred square kilometers of
              Bhutanese territory. In 2012, then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and his Bhutanese
              counterpart Jigme Thinley met on the sidelines of a UN conference in Brazil and
              expressed willingness to establish formal diplomatic relations. In Beijing,
              Dorji discussed the still unsettled border and met with China’s deputy foreign
              minister, foreign minister and vice-president.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Attempting to gain
              influence in Bhutan, China has deployed its usual “soft diplomacy.” In recent
              years, circus artists, acrobats and footballers have traveled to Bhutan, and a
              limited number of Bhutanese students received scholarships to study in China.
              Tourism has expanded: 19 Chinese tourists traveled to Bhutan a decade ago, and
              last year, the figure was 9,399, or 19 percent of the total.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">The August meeting –
              the 24th in a series of border talks that also covered trade and diplomatic
              recognition – was a step forward for China. According to an August 15 statement
              issued by the Chinese foreign ministry: “Although Bhutan and China have not
              established diplomatic relations yet, it will not hold back the mutually
              beneficial cooperation between the two countries. The Bhutanese side is willing
              to continue to deepen exchanges in such fields as tourism, religion, culture
              and agriculture and further lift the cooperation level with China.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">India watches the
              developments with concern. In July 2014, Bhutan became the first foreign stop
              for Narendra Modi, two months after he became India’s prime minister. Later
              that year, India’s President Pranab Mukherjee visited Bhutan, underscoring the
              value New Delhi’s places on its relations with the small but strategically
              located kingdom in the Himalayas. High on the agenda was China’s attempts to
              gain a permanent presence in Bhutan.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Bhutan would find it
              difficult to act independently when it comes to its foreign relations. Imports
              from India account for 75 percent of the total, and 85 percent of all exports
              goes to India. The largest export consists of hydropower from plants on rivers
              flowing down the Himalayas, and India is the sole importer. The Bhutanese
              currency, the ngultrum, is tied to the Indian rupee, with which it is on par.
              Strategically, Bhutan’s border with China follows the crest of the Himalayas,
              which separates the Indian subcontinent from the Tibetan plateau. Between
              Bhutan and Bangladesh lies a narrow strip of land connecting India’s volatile
              northeastern region with the rest of the country.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Bhutan’s special
              relationship with India goes back to an 1865 friendship treaty between
              Bhutanese rulers and the colonial masters of British India. In 1910, Bhutan and
              British India signed a treaty whereby the British Raj recognized Bhutan’s
              internal sovereignty while maintaining control over its foreign relations.
              Bhutan and independent India signed a similar treaty in 1949. Bhutan’s way out
              of its de facto status as a protectorate of its southern neighbor began in 1963
              with a new constitution that changed the monarch’s title from the Indian
              maharaja to the more indigenous druk gyalpo, underscoring that Bhutan was not
              among the former princely states of pre-colonial India but an independent
              kingdom. In 1971, Bhutan, supported by India, became a member of the United
              Nations.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Nevertheless, under
              the terms of the 1949 treaty, Bhutan agreed “to be guided by the advice of the
              Government of India in regard to its external relations.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">That was the case
              until 2007 when a revised treaty was signed, stating: “the Government of the
              Kingdom of Bhutan and the Government of the Republic of India shall cooperate
              closely with each other on issues relating to their national interests. Neither
              government shall allow the use of its territory for activities harmful to the
              national security and interests of the other.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">That treaty was
              concluded after two major crises in relations between India and Bhutan. The
              first was the flight of more than 100,000 ethnic Nepalese from Bhutan in the
              early 1990s. Claiming discrimination, they crossed the border into India, which
              did not want them. They were compelled to continue to Nepal, a country that
              does not share a common border with Bhutan. India did not want to jeopardize
              relations with Bhutan, especially since some of the ethnic Nepalese had been
              involved in activities deemed hostile to the Bhutanese monarchy. Most of the
              refugees have since then been resettled in third countries including the United
              States.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Second, land left
              behind by the refugees was taken over by militants from the United Liberation
              Front of Assam, ULFA, and allied separatist forces from northeastern India.
              Camps were established in remote jungle areas and raids launched into India
              from these cross-border sanctuaries into Bhutan. In December 2003 the Bhutanese
              army drove the militants out. Indian troops were deployed on their side of the
              border and helicopters assisted the Bhutanese troops, largely Indian-trained.
              Since then, ULFA was also driven out of another Indian neighbor, Bangladesh.
              ULFA military camps are now limited to northwestern Myanmar, while its
              commander, Paresh Barua, resides mostly in China’s Yunnan Province.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Given a long history
              of close relations, Indians only recently saw China as a possible player in
              Bhutanese affairs though Bhutan has long avoided offending the Chinese.
              Following a failed 1959 uprising against the Chinese in Tibet, thousands of
              Tibetan refugees poured into Bhutan. The Bhutanese, who practice a form of
              Buddhism similar to the Tibetan version, allowed the refugees to stay. Unlike
              the Tibetan refugees in India, those in Bhutan were not allowed to engage in
              political activity. In 1981, they were told to accept Bhutanese citizenship, or
              leave the country. Most left for India. Bhutan remains today one of few
              Buddhist nations in the world which the Dalai Lama has not visited.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">China was not slow to
              reciprocate. The first exchange between Bhutan and China occurred as early as
              1974, when a Chinese delegation attended the coronation of the former king,
              Jigme Singye Wangchuk – described by China’s official news agency Xinhua as “a
              new page in the friendly contacts between the two countries.” That “page” now
              includes regular top-level interactions on the top level as well as
              people-to-people contacts.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Cambria, serif;">Tiny Bhutan risks
              being caught in the middle of a regional power play that it might not be able
              to handle. China’s charm offensive with Bhutan may also deepen the mutual
              suspicion with which Asia’s two giants view each other. That does not augur
              well for a part of the world already under siege by a new Cold War, with an
              increasingly assertive China on one side and a host of other countries, among
              them India, on the other.</span></p>
