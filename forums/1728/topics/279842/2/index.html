To my understanding, the comparision is much like the signals in digital electronics, either '0' or '1'. So if your belief is not in God then it will have to be _____ . However, organised religious bodies often evolve with time and environment.<br><br>Anyway if you are interested, you can read the Satanic Bible as well. It is not as evil as people think it is. Of course Satanic Bible was written by a man call Anton LaVey (correct me if I'm wrong) in response to the time he was situated. However he gave satanic a whole new definition and not necessary evil as what the mass has been projecting them to be.</div>

I heard it many years back from random christians who tried to preach me.<br><br>My point here is not about which religion anti which religion but hope all would understand the differences among the similarities.<br><br>Instead of following some so-called great masters in claiming Jesus to be bodhisattva, why not simply respect the christian-faith by seeing Jesus as the Son of God, as believed by the christians.<br><br>However, buddhists neither pray to God nor believe in a creator God (as taught in christianity), so it doesn't make the belief in Jesus important to buddhists, though it is pivotal in the christian-faith.<br><br>Some so-called great masters will quickly recognised some of the good things that Jesus had done in bible and put them on par with our bodhisattva practice.<br><br>There are general two issues here:<br><br>1st, it is that even if some of the things done by Jesus do seems to be part of the bodhisattva practice, that doesn't mean he <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a bodhisattva. If indeed such acts can make Jesus a bodhisattva, then you and I and the other buddhists at large, I would have believed that we too have done bodhisattva practices, whether big or small, whether the act was carried out or merely arise in our thoughts <span style="font-style: italic;">(do you sometimes have the thought of donating something for a good cause without hope for return? That would be the root of dana paramita =))</span>. If it is so, then it doesn't make Jesus any more extraordinary as each and everyone of us <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> bodhisattvas as well.<br><br>2nd, it is the selective reading that I had mentioned in my previous entry, great master trying to sound tolerating and compassionate, quickly glorified or over glorified the good deeds done by Jesus in bible but fail to bring up or simply evade some acts that I would say are bizarre.<br><br>Buddhists are indeed the seekers of Truth and that would only be accomplished by heeding what the Buddha had said that one should thoroughly investigate and not passing fast judgment.</div>

Even in terms of style -- for example, in old testament God is seen as more of a mythic creature, more of a personal God -- someone you can go up and speak to, have a coffee and a chit chat. As time passes there is an evolution of consciousness and what is being taught as God changes accordingly.
