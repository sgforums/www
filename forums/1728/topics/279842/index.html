First of all we must understand that there are three things which all Buddha teaches: 1) Avoid all evil 2) Do all that is good 3) Purify one's mind.<br><br>I wrote previously:<br><br>Most religions only teach "avoid all evil and doing all good", but only Buddhism teaches about liberation and the purification of the mind.<br><br>The problem with just "avoiding all evil and doing all good" is that as a result we accumulate a lot of good karma and avoid creating bad karma, meaning we can be reborn in the higher realms or even the celestial realms like the heavens, however we still cannot attain nirvana, we cannot be liberated from the cycle of samsara.. and our enjoyment in these higher realms are also limited and transient.<br><br>Similarly as described just now even if our lives are very good, there is still bound to be unsatisfactoriness and sufferings.. if we cannot be liberated moment to moment.<br><br>Therefore when we practise Buddhism, also we practise purification of the mind... through mindfulness we become aware of and disidentify from all our sentient thoughts, our habitual tendencies of the mind, the afflictive emotions and so on due to identification with a false sense of self, and the identification is also known as the false 'ego'.<br><br>Our Buddha Nature is like a clear mirror, our pure awareness, which unfortunately is obscured from us because of a layer of dust, or mental defilements.<br><br>Through Buddhism we clean the mirror of its defilements to reveal the clear bright mirror underneath. Therefore through practising Buddhism we gain insights into the nature of reality, the nature of our minds, our Buddha Nature, and through awakening from our delusions we find the nirvanic bliss of clarity and liberation from all sufferings in our lives.<br><br>There are many enlightened and liberated people even today, some of our forummers (not me lah) have also become enlightened to the truths that Buddha taught... so enlightenment is truly attainable. It is not exclusive to special people or the Buddha alone. Remember -- all of us have Buddha Nature.</div>

I am also pretty sure it is authored by a Christian influenced writer... because Nirvana is being described as a 'highest heaven' there. Which is not (i.e Nirvana is not a heaven).<br><br>Also statements like Buddha will only accumulate 'a small amount of merit' is just absurd <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> If you're a Buddhist you know that it is contradictory to the teachings of the Buddha.. In the first place Buddha no longer needs to accumulate merits and is already beyond the realms of birth and death. Anyway a liberated saint attains merits that are vast beyond measures, according to sutras.<br><br>Also, the Buddha never taught us to wait for another person. Maitreya Buddha will appear in the future in millions or billions of time, but he taught that everyone can, and every should practise to attain enlightenment in this lifetime. Thousands of his students attained Arhatship, enlightenment, became liberated saints and achieved Nirvana.<br><br>Many practitioners today continue to achieve Nirvana and enlightenment, including even some in our forums who are already highly enlightened (not me).</div>

If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness.

If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If we say "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in our mind.</span></div></blockquote>I am not cursing the person who made up that story. I am just saying that he slanders dharma , make up story and etc , read that somewhere in sutra will land in hell.
