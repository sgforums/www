              <p><span><span class="UFICommentBody"><span><span>Lisa: "yet the question remains... once everything is known to be 
              empty zilch, and the knowing of that is set aside as also being empty 
              zilch, where to look? And for what? I'd thought it was to look for 
              Ultimate... and am open to other suggest</span></span><span><span><span>ions."</span><br><br><span>The
               idea that there is an ultimate is tied with the idea that there is an 
              absolute Self or Subject that is separated from phenomena. Emptiness 
              deconstructs the notion of a subjective self, and objective phenomena, 
              so that no ultimate can be established as truly existing.</span><br><br><span>There
               must be an experiential realization of anatta for this to be effective.
               No-self can be understood in terms of view but it is a whole different 
              level when experience is experientially seen/experienced as "in seeing 
              always just the seen, no seer". Then everything is naturally direct, 
              immediate and gapless, and it is a very liberating view, everything is 
              very vivid and lucid display of pure clarity but without any trace of a 
              self or a Self. It is important to note that there are varying degrees 
              of seeing through the self, for example seeing through the sense of self
               but not the Self is what I call an experience of "impersonality" but 
              not the "realization of anatta" (which I described in more details in </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/12/experience-realization-view-practice.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2011/12/experience-realization-view-practice.html</a><span>)</span><br><br><span>Then
               further insights into emptiness, particularly the emptiness of 
              phenomena reveal that seeing/hearing/etc are empty, unlocatable, 
              ungraspable, and being empty has all the attributes that you once 
              relegated to some Absolute - i.e. all phenomena are non-arising, 
              unconditioned, non-ceasing, without coming and going, etc. But this is 
              not due to the inherent changeless existence of some 'Absolute' but 
              rather due to the empty nature of all those appearance/manifestation of 
              direct experience. But after seeing emptiness of everything it 
              absolutely makes no sense to speak of an 'ultimate' or 'absolute' apart 
              from the phenomenal world. There is no trace of any kind of 
              Absolute/ultimate existence whatsoever.</span><br><br><span>As Malcolm quoted on Nagarjuna's refutation of gzhan stong [extrinsic emptiness]:</span><br><br><span>"Since arising, abiding and perishing are not established,</span><br><span>the conditioned is not established;</span><br><span>since the conditioned is never established,</span><br><span>how can the unconditioned be established?"</span><br><br><span>And
               on this topic the Vidhyadhara Mahayogi Sridhar Rana Rinpoche (who used 
              to be into Vedanta/Hindu Tantras and was recognized as self-realized by 
              his masters before going into Buddhism) talked about the difference 
              between the Buddhist and Hindu paradigm: </span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.sg/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html</a><br><br><span>"as
               one of its connotations is “existing”, it is hazardous to use the word 
              “ultimate reality” in any Buddhist context and it is always safer to use
               the word “ultimate truth” instead."</span><br><br><span>"To
               sum it up, the Vedantic ultimate truth is the existence of an ultimate 
              existence or ultimate reality called Atman-Brahman. Reality here is used
               as something which exists (satta/sat). Sri Sankaracharya defines Sat or
               real existence in his Tatva Bodha as that which remains the same and 
              unchanged in all the three times (kala trya api tishtatiti). The three 
              times means the past, present and the future. Thus the ultimate reality 
              has to remain unchanged and that reality is the ultimate truth.</span><br><br><span>However,
               the Buddhist ultimate truth is the absence of any such satta, i.e., and
               ultimately existing thing or ultimate reality. The significance of 
              Shunyata is the absence of any real, independent, unchanging existence 
              (svabhava) and that fact is the ultimate truth of Buddhism, which is 
              diametrically opposite of the ultimate truth of the Hindu Atman-Brahman.
               So Shunyata or emptiness can never be via negativa, a negative way of 
              describing the Atman-Brahman of Hinduism as Vinoba Bhave and such 
              scholars would have us believe. The meaning of Shunyata found in Sutra, 
              Tantra, Dzogchen and Mahamudra is the same and officially accepted by 
              all four schools of Tibetan Buddhism (except those who adhere to the 
              Shentong view) and that is the Prasangic emptiness of Chandrakirti, 
              i.e., the unfindability of any true existence or simply unfindability 
              (unupalabdhi)."</span><br><br><span>"Another
               word that has confounded many Hindu swamis, is the “unborn” (ajat or 
              anutpada) or “unproduced”. In the context of the Hindu Vedanta, it means
               that there is this ultimate reality called the Brahman, which is 
              unborn, that was never produced by anything or at any time and which 
              means it always was and will always be the same unchanging substance. A 
              thing, or super-thing, even a non- thing, that always existed and was 
              never ever produced at any period in time, which is separate from this 
              born, illusory Samsara. Whereas, in the Buddhist context, it is the true
               nature of Samsara itself which although relatively appears to be “born”
               ultimately is never born. Advayavajra in his Tatvaratnavali states ‘the
               Samsara is unborn says the Buddha.’ The Buddha Ekaputra Tantra (Tib.: 
              Sangye Tse tsig tantra) mentions that the base of Dzogchen is the 
              Samsara itself stirred from its depth. Since the Samsara stirred from 
              its depth is interdependently originated, i.e., not really originated or
               unborn, and since the Samsara is only relatively an interdependently 
              originated thing, but ultimately neither a thing, nor a non-thing (bhava
               or abhava) that truly exists. The term “unborn” for Brahman (which is 
              definitely not Samsara) and for Samsara in Buddhism are diametrically 
              opposed. The true meaning of unborn (anutpada) is dependently originated
               ( pratityasamutpanna), which as mentioned before is the meaning of 
              nisvabhava (non real existence) or Shunyata. None of these terms are a 
              synonym for Brahman or anything that has this kind of ultimate real 
              existence, even if it were to be called Tathagatagarbha. There is no 
              acceptance of an ultimate existence in any Buddhist Sutra."</span></span></span></span></span></p>
