            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I understand that everything in this world is somewhat to do with Karma.<br>Please correct me if I am wrong as the following is my personal view on Karma in its wide perspectives.<br><br>I believe that everything in our world system is a matter of cause and effect - 'Cause' bring about 'Effect' and this 'Effect' becomes a new 'Cause' and bring about a new 'Effect' and this goes on and on.<br><br>For instance, a guy going for a job interview. He misses the bus (Cause: bus driver caught in a traffic jam... Cause of traffic jam: Many cars using the road... Cause of many cars on the road: Ater office hours ..... indefinite possibilities and causes, let your imagination wanders). As a result (Effect), he arrives late. This lateness becomes the Cause as a first impression to the interviewer. In the room where the interview is being held, the environment might also affect the mood of the interviewer and this leads us to the people who decorate the room as the cause..... It just goes on and on... Eventually one little interview's outcome depends on so many causes.<br><br>Of course, the above is just an example. Many people could think up of different causes... but it is still somehow cause and effect.<br><br>Even the result of rolling of a dice depends on so many causes too:<br>1. Strength of the person who throw the dice (Cause of strength: Health - what he ate ..... Mood....)<br>2. The air particles around the dice (the location in which the place is chosen to throw the dice...)<br>3. The physical and atomical structure of the dice  (Uneven edges.....Person who bought the dice....The place he picks....Manufacturer who made the dice....)<br>4. The direction of the wind (The location chosen to throw the dice.....The reason why the location is chosen.....)<br>5. The mood of the person throwing the dice affects the outcome too. He might throw it with little strength or more (Cause of mood: the people around him, the place, what goes on in his mind....etc).<br>6. Indefinite possibilities.<br><br>As a result everything affects everything in some ways or another and these everything affects every other things..... It could be pyschological, physical, environmental and anything one could think of..... There are just so many causes and effects and so much that we would usually ignore it... What we does now affect our future and others.<br><br>I would call myself "lucky" that things works out well. Not just because I play my part, but because everyone plays a part too.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My interpretation of karma is this...<br><br>At a deep level, beyond the personality and waking consciousness, on a plane/Jhanic level above, there is a 'desire/intention' to understanding itself or 'how things work.'<br><br>Karma is a mirror/cause and effect 'willed' by this higher consciousness. This level (I think is commonly call Soul) is beyond physical death and therefore is not really concerned about the destruction of the extension of itself as physical form.<br><br>It is from here that the karma/intention is stored. Under most circumstances, destiny/fate will be played out to see the 'outcomes of things'.<br><br>If you can read/interprete your dreams, you can actually know what is about to happen soon. This, in my view, is because, some dream states are closely linked to this Soul/higher consciosness.<br><br>However, there is something call self-liberation. If I am correct, self-liberation dissolves the karmic thoughts as they arising. But one, must be in Presence in order for this to occurs. If i am correct, the arising thought must be recognised without identifying 'yourself' in it. That means the thoughts are not judged, but simply allow (because there is no judging) to appear, be recognised and dissolve as it arising. In a way, it is like consciuosness dissolving into consciousness.<br><br>Therefore:<br><br>karma being played out= discovering result after doing/action.<br><br>Self-liberation= recognising karmic pattern as the thought arises (non-action).<br><br>Just my opinion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Longchen, remember I sent you an article last time? <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm</a> (Returning to the Quintessence of the Buddha). According to Buddhism the 'egoic self view' is from the 7th Consciousness [Klista-mano-vijnana]. When we (our body) dies, our 6 senses (eyes, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) dies, without the 6 senses therefore the 6 sense consciousnessness (consciousness of Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch, Mind) dies as well. However our 7th consciousness Klista-mano-vijnana never dies, and according to Mahayana/Vajrayana Buddhism it creates a Â“soulÂ”, an Intermediate state called Antara-bhava, otherwise known as Bardo in Tibetan. Within 49 days the Bardo will seek rebirth in the 6 realms of existence. However, for a liberated person, at the time of death he enters into the Â“Pure Abode of Eternal Light and TranquilityÂ” (ji guang jing tu), otherwise commonly known as Dharmakaya. If he returns to Earth or any samsaric planes, he does not return as a Sentient Being undergoing the samsaric rebirths, but as a Bodhisattva out of Compassion and to attain Buddhahood. Even on Earth, one can experience Dharmakaya. My master spoke of entering the Â“ji guang jing tuÂ” when he was too busy and tired, became sick and was unable to Â“control the bodyÂ”. It was only later on when a thought arise that Â“I am in the midst of teaching the dharma now!Â” that he Â‘came backÂ’. At death with the conditions you will enter into Dharmakaya. The 7th Consciousness is thus Â“transformed into LightÂ”.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When we practise the Great Dharma, we spontaneously transform our seventh mind-consciousness or Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ” into light. That light is the same as the quintessence of Buddha. When we stop breathing, our breath actually diffuses into space and becomes an integral part of space. Thus, if we are skilful in practising the Great Dharma, we do not have the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”. It is transformed into brightness and returned to the quintessence of Buddha of the Dharma World. This brightness is not the sunlight. It is also not the brightness of a lamp, but the quintessence of Buddha (known as ?? [Ji-Guang] in Mandarin).</span><br><br>The 7th Consciousness is very special. Usually when we sleep, our 6 sense organs and therefore the 6 sense consciousness are at rest. The 7th Consciousness however, does not sleep. It is very much alive and continues to dig into our 8th Consciousness [Alaya-vijnana], otherwise known as the Storehouse [of karmic seeds] Consciousness. All our memories, karmic seeds, etc, are stored within this tape-recorder-like Consciousness. The Â“replayingÂ” of this Â“tape-recorderÂ” results in what we call Dreams. And dreams have a lot of types, there are 10 types of dreams: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=136527" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=136527</a> Only bodhisattvas or Buddhas have no dreams. Even bodhisattvas have some dreams, but they are not sentient dreams.<br><br><blockquote> If i am correct, the arising thought must be recognised without identifying 'yourself' in it. That means the thoughts are not judged, but simply allow (because there is no judging) to appear, be recognised and dissolve as it arising.</blockquote>Yes I agree with this. Not judging and therefore unattached, simply be aware of it. A sentient mind is like this: after one thought, another thought arises, and another thought arises and so on. It is continuous and never ending, because sentient beings are not aware/mindful of their thoughts. A practitionerÂ’s mind however, is of wisdom and not sentient thoughts. When there is a job to do he does it, and when the job is done, the mind does not continue never endingly like the sentient mind. He is completely aware throughout the process of doing his job.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>regarding the idea of "Primordial ", here's an Interesting article:<br><br>Dalai Lama's answer Philosophical questions on Creation:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Q: You have said that according to Buddhist philosophy there is no Creator, no God of creation, and this may initially put off many people who believe in a divine principle. Can you explain the difference between the Vajrayana Primordial Buddha and a Creator God?<br>A: I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.<br><br>We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.<br><br>Likewise, when we speak of karma as the cause of the universe we eliminate the notion of a unique entity called karma existing totally independently. Rather, collective karmic impressions, accumulated individually, are at the origin of the creation of a world. When, in the tantric context, we say that all worlds appear out of clear light, we do not visualize this source as a unique entity, but as the ultimate clear light of each being. We can also, on the basis of its pure essence, understand this clear light to be the Primordial Buddha. All the stages which make up the life of each living being--death, the intermediate state, and rebirth--represent nothing more than the various manifestations of the potential of clear light. It is both the most subtle consciousness and energy. The more clear light loses its subtlety, the more your experiences take shape.<br><br>In this way, death and the intermediate state are moments where the gross manifestations emanating from clear light are reabsorbed. At death we return to that original source, and from there a slightly more gross state emerges to form the intermediate state preceding rebirth. At the stage of rebirth, clear light is apparent in a physical incarnation. At death we return to this source. And so on. The ability to recognize subtle clear light, also called the Primordial Buddha, is equivalent to realizing nirvana, whereas ignorance of the nature of clear light leaves us to wander in the different realms of samsaric existence.<br><br>This is how I understand the concept of the Primordial Buddha. It would be a grave error to conceive of it as an independent and autonomous existence from beginningless time. If we had to accept the idea of an independent creator, the explanations given in the Pramanavartika, the "Compendium of Valid Knowledge" written by Dharmakirti, and in the ninth chapter of the text by Shantideva, which completely refutes the existence per se of all phenomena, would be negated. This, in turn, would refute the notion of the Primordial Buddha. The Buddhist point of view does not accept the validity of affirmations which do not stand up to logical examination. If a sutra describes the Primordial Buddha as an autonomous entity, we must be able to interpret this assertion without taking it literally. We call this type of sutra an "interpretable" sutra.</span><br><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Longchen, remember I sent you an article last time? <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm</a> (Returning to the Quintessence of the Buddha). According to Buddhism the 'egoic self view' is from the 7th Consciousness [Klista-mano-vijnana]. When we (our body) dies, our 6 senses (eyes, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) dies, without the 6 senses therefore the 6 sense consciousnessness (consciousness of Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch, Mind) dies as well. However our 7th consciousness Klista-mano-vijnana never dies, and according to Mahayana/Vajrayana Buddhism it creates a Â“soulÂ”, an Intermediate state called Antara-bhava, otherwise known as Bardo in Tibetan. Within 49 days the Bardo will seek rebirth in the 6 realms of existence. However, for a liberated person, at the time of death he enters into the Â“Pure Abode of Eternal Light and TranquilityÂ” (ji guang jing tu), otherwise commonly known as Dharmakaya. If he returns to Earth or any samsaric planes, he does not return as a Sentient Being undergoing the samsaric rebirths, but as a Bodhisattva out of Compassion and to attain Buddhahood. Even on Earth, one can experience Dharmakaya. My master spoke of entering the Â“ji guang jing tuÂ” when he was too busy and tired, became sick and was unable to Â“control the bodyÂ”. It was only later on when a thought arise that Â“I am in the midst of teaching the dharma now!Â” that he Â‘came backÂ’. At death with the conditions you will enter into Dharmakaya. The 7th Consciousness is thus Â“transformed into LightÂ”.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When we practise the Great Dharma, we spontaneously transform our seventh mind-consciousness or Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ” into light. That light is the same as the quintessence of Buddha. When we stop breathing, our breath actually diffuses into space and becomes an integral part of space. Thus, if we are skilful in practising the Great Dharma, we do not have the Â“transient-invisible-bodyÂ”. It is transformed into brightness and returned to the quintessence of Buddha of the Dharma World. This brightness is not the sunlight. It is also not the brightness of a lamp, but the quintessence of Buddha (known as ?? [Ji-Guang] in Mandarin).</span><br><br>The 7th Consciousness is very special. Usually when we sleep, our 6 sense organs and therefore the 6 sense consciousness are at rest. The 7th Consciousness however, does not sleep. It is very much alive and continues to dig into our 8th Consciousness [Alaya-vijnana], otherwise known as the Storehouse [of karmic seeds] Consciousness. All our memories, karmic seeds, etc, are stored within this tape-recorder-like Consciousness. The Â“replayingÂ” of this Â“tape-recorderÂ” results in what we call Dreams. And dreams have a lot of types, there are 10 types of dreams: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=136527" rel="nofollow">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=136527</a> Only bodhisattvas or Buddhas have no dreams. Even bodhisattvas have some dreams, but they are not sentient dreams.<br><br>Yes I agree with this. Not judging and therefore unattached, simply be aware of it. A sentient mind is like this: after one thought, another thought arises, and another thought arises and so on. It is continuous and never ending, because sentient beings are not aware/mindful of their thoughts. A practitionerÂ’s mind however, is of wisdom and not sentient thoughts. When there is a job to do he does it, and when the job is done, the mind does not continue never endingly like the sentient mind. He is completely aware throughout the process of doing his job.<br></div></blockquote>Hi Eternal Now,<br><br>Thanks for the reply... I resonate with what your master wrote.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Vamjok,<br><br>Thanks for the reply...<br><br>I am not a buddhist... I speak from direct expereince... you can say that i have assessed the karmic storehouse (commonly call soul in other religion). If you refer to Eternal Now's post, you will see that there is infact no contradition whatsoever.<br><br>The soul is just a concept... a name ... it just is... People may be speaking of the same thing but having different terminologies. It is in fact a very impersonal state with some 'overall' desires and intentions. Howver, it is not the Absolute... it is a plane of consciousness (that is, it is encased within a reflective layer of consciouesness)<br><br>basically, at least to me, the spiritual path is a purification process. The rebirth/reincarnation is about uncovering latent attributes. Once the attributes are discovered, they loss their power (of action) and is returned back to their essence. From pure awareness, to reflective form, back to pure awareness...<br><br>have you thought about this.... if the aim of all sentient beings is liberation. What is the purpose of liberation?
