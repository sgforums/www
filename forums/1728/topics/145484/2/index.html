Undifferentiated awareness<br>2. Enfoldment creating reflections and forms, which are expressions for understanding self.<br>3. Unfoldment/unwrapping or realisation of what really is. </blockquote>Very true also! And even better if you are writing from your own experience.<br><br>However, both statements failed to explain why and how ignorance or enfoldment was initiated? Once I was told the reason is:<br><br><strong>LOVE!</strong><br><br>ItÂ’s not from my own experience so I canÂ’t detail it. But I get the rough idea that it has something to do with the degradation from unconditioned love to conditioned love. And I think if someone remembers how he got on Earth at the first place, it may help to clarify the problem.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the Beginning:<br><br>In the Wei Shi Consciousness-only School, each of our eight consciousnesses is also classified into Mutual-division (form)Â‘ÂŠÂ•Âª, Observing-division ÂŒÂ©Â•Âª, Self-verifying-division ÂŽÂ©Ã¦ÂšÂ•Âª(aka a confused Buddhanature) and Verifying Self-verifying-divisionÃ¦ÂšÂŽÂ©Ã¦ÂšÂ•Âª (aka True Mind or Enlightened Buddha Nature). Manas Consciousness Â–Â–Â“ÃŸÂŽÂ¯ attach to a self, due to the "observing-division" of the Alaya Consciousness ÂˆÂ¢Ã»Â®Â–Ã«ÂŽÂ¯. The Self-verifying-division and Verifying Self-verifying-division are mutually related. If the Self-verifying-division is an Object of Operation, the Verifying Self-verifying-division becomes the Operative. And vice versa. Existence actually does not hold a 'self', but due to a strong attachment of "self" in the deluded Manas Consciousness, it truly become a self and that of self-possessions/views. Alaya (8th) is the container of the lower 7, as all the karmic seeds of the lower 7 go back to the 8th. If we can realize that the root-self, instrumental world and karmic seeds are just projections of the Thus Come One, Tathagatagarbha, and that all phenomenon are like dream/delusions, and not self can attain, then all will return to Tathagatagarbha.<br><br>----<br><br>i can't paste too much chinese texts. but if one can read, below is the reference:<br><a href="http://www.dharma.com.tw/X1Chinese/D33SProb/P494.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dharma.com.tw/X1Chinese/D33SProb/P494.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://maitreya.sun.net.tw:6666/c07/3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maitreya.sun.net.tw:6666/c07/3.htm</a><br><br><a href="http://www.buddhanet.com.tw/gem/ggz-c2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.com.tw/gem/ggz-c2.htm</a><br><br>there's a Good analogy.

            <div class='col-md body'>See if Shurangama Sutra state about the beginning:<br><br>QUOTE<br>The Buddha said to Ã�nanda, "From beginning less time onward, all living beings and in all kinds of upside down ways, have created seeds of karma which naturally run their course, like the aksha cluster.<br>"The reason that cultivators cannot accomplish unsurpassed Bodhi, but instead reach the level of Hearers or of those enlightened to conditions, or become accomplished in externalist ways as heaven-dwellers or as demon kings or as members of the demonsÂ’ retinues<br>is that they do not know the two fundamental roots and so are mistaken and confused in their cultivation. They are like one who cooks sand in the hope of creating savory delicacies.  They may do so for as many eons as there are motes of dust, but in the end they will not obtain what they want.<br>"What are the two?  Ã�nanda, the first is the root of beginning less birth and death, which is the mind that seizes upon conditions and that you and all living beings now make use of, taking it to be your own nature.<br>"The second is the primal pure substance of beginning less Bodhi Nirvana.  It is the primal bright essence of consciousness that can bring forth all conditions.  Due to these conditions, you consider it to be lost.<br>"Having lost sight of that original brightness, although beings use it to the end of their days, they are unaware of it, and unintentionally enter the various destinies.<br>"Ã�nanda, now you wish to know about the path of shamatha with the hope of quitting birth and death. I will now question you further."......<br>"All of you good people, I have often said that all conditions that bring about forms and the mind as well as dharmas pertaining to the mind and all the conditioned dharmas are manifestations of the mind only. Your bodies and your minds all appear within the wonder of the bright, true, essential, magnificent mind.<br><br><a href="http://www.buddhistinformation.com/shurangama_sutra.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhistinformation.com/shurangama_sutra.htm</a><br>/\<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Originally, sentient beings and the quintessence of Buddha were the same in pureness and brightness. However, when the conditions for the initiation of ignorance begin to fan like the wind, it eventually produces ignorance. The ignorance becomes more serious as it gathers momentum and leads to the transmigration in the Six Realms. Ignorance, just like the wind, is invisible and one may not be able to touch them, yet it packs with power so immense that it can destroy houses and uproot trees.<br><br>In the beginning when sentient beings started to transmigrate in the Six Realms, they were in the realm of Heaven. Then, they descended to the Human realm. Human beings have seven types of emotion and six types of lust and because of these they continually commit negative karma. These led them to descend to the realm of Asura. Why is the realm of Asura considered to be a good realm? It is because even heavenly beings can be inflicted by ignorance, causing them to fight among themselves. The more aggressive fighters eventually descend to the realm of Asura.</span><br><br><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no1a.htm</a><br><br>And yes indeed, not everyone can understand the dharma so consider ourselves lucky that we can. It is the Human Realm that is most suitable to understand dharma.<br><br><blockquote>From <a href="http://www.aimwell.org/Books/Library/Pesala/Milinda/milinda.html" rel="nofollow">The Debate of King Milinda</a><br><br>QUOTE<br>27. Can Everyone Understand the Dhamma?<br><br>Â“Do all those who practise correctly attain insight into the Dhamma or are<br>there some who do not?Â”<br><br>Â“There can be no attaining of insight for those who, though they practise<br>correctly, are animals, hungry ghosts, holders of wrong views, frauds (kuhaka)<br>matricides, patricides, murderers of Arahants, schismatics, shedders of the blood<br>of a Tathāgata, in the robes by theft, gone over to another sect, violators of<br>nuns, concealing an offence entailing a meeting of the Order, sexual deviants<br>(pandaka) and hermaphrodites (ubhatobyaÃ±jaka). Neither is a child under seven<br>years of age able to realise the Dhamma.Â”<br><br>Â“What is the reason that a child under seven years of age is unable to attain<br>insight? For a child is pure in mind and should be ready to realise the Dhamma.Â”<br><br>Â“If a child under seven, O king, could feel desire for things leading to desire,<br>hatred for things arousing hatred, could be fooled by misleading things and could<br>distinguish between wholesomeness and unwholesomeness then insight might<br>be possible for him. However, the mind of a child under seven, O king, is feeble<br>and the unconditioned element of nibbāna is weighty and profound. Therefore,<br>O king, although he practised correctly, a child of under seven could not realise<br>the Dhamma.Â”</blockquote>Interesting to note that the youngest age to attain awakening is 7 years old, and my friend Vamjok mentions that he remembered 2 instances in the scripture which there were 7 year old novice attaining Arhantship.</div>
