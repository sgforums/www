              <p>The Buddha at Ju Shi Ling is very powerful. One of my neighbour's son had bone cancer, used to go there (now is still going) for blessing. His son is cured now but of course not everybody is so lucky like him. It all depends on one's karma. His parents are vegetarian now.</p>
              <p>You know, the person in charge of Ju Shi Ling æ�Žæœ¨åŽŸ, I think that is the correct name. More than 10 years ago, he had cancer, he was told by the doctor that his days were numbered. He prayed and chanted sincerely because he knew his days were numbered (he did not ask for recovery). Miracles happened to him, he was cured. Many people said he took charge of Ju Shi Ling to repay Buddha.</p>

              <p>Buddhism does not kill or get rid of any spirits, even if they are fierce and aggressive. even animals as well, as small as an ant. what you can do is to transfer merits to them, they will appreciate it one. if they do not, that means you must have harmed/cheated him/her in one of your past lives. this one need monks to mediate for you.</p>

              <p>nope, I've no religion, though I've knowledge of various religions and respect/understand their purpose. If we can allow ourselves to see and feel beyond ourselves, and not put ourselves in the centre of the universe, we'll know that there is only One.</p>
              <p>It'll be very enriching to meditate and contemplate on a very fundamental question: what is the most basic reason anyone has a religion?</p>
              <p>Look at the chaotic world we live in: millions have been killing each other, and are still doing so, in the name of their religion. If one does not know the true reason for having a religion or belief, the heart remains closed to the Truth of Life, for many lifetimes, till one finally awakens.</p>
