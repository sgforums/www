              <p>No, this is not hearsay. I see the boy every other day  because he is my next block neighbour. He was bald when he was under treatment but now he is a healthy boy who can swim and run. I used to talk to his parents.</p>
              <p>Regarding the person in charge of Buddhist Lodge, that is hearsay but I heard the same version of the story too many times, each time from different person. Thus, should be true right ?</p>
              <p>I also heard during a Dharma talk when those who were healed spoke of their miracle recoveries when the monk asked about their experiences with Buddha. Of course, it was not just about prayers, they went through treatment.</p>

              <p>Buddha is more powerful. I have seen medium who go on the streets, when they passed by a Buddhist Temple, the medium will bow three times to the Buddha because medium are possessed by only heavenly gods or heavenly spirits.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, i witnessed that when I was in Bugis one day.   I was told that monks and shifu from buddhist temples do invite those wondering spirits to the temple as they chant for them.   Buddhism believes in treating spirits with kindness.</p>
              <p>I heard of my cousin's case.  Possessed and was helped by a taoist shifu to get rid of the spirit successfully.</p>

              <p>thats the Buddha statue, not the Buddha himself lol. anyway the devas will not want to possess a human being, cos human beings are dirty and smelly when compared to them. the food we ate are considered as dungs and excrement. why would they want to go near any humans when our body stinks to the high heavens lol. the ones possessing the medium are ghosts guards of some sorts from the ghost realm.</p>

              <p>no devas would not want to go anywhere near humans cos our body stank and smells, unlike their body, which is subtle and more beautiful and probably emit perfume smell lol, esp the nyhmps. have you ever heard of any devas who possess human beings, besides ghost/spirits? those who say devas possess their bodies are bullshit.</p>
              <p>the food we ate are considered as coarse, tasteless and dirty, unlike the food they consumed. please note that devas in Buddhism are not god. they are just like us, just that they did alot of good deeds and is reborn there. their births and deaths are instantaneous, no need for a mother to give birth through a womb. when devas were to pass away, they do not suffer any diseases like us, but you will see their physical appearances will change and subsequently disappear. when they die, they will take their rebirth according to their karma.</p>
