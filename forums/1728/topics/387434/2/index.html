              <p><br>I'm not too sure about that. I know the person being possessed chanting Amitabha is also only  a temporary measure because the spirit is afraid of the holy light when the person is chanting. It will be back if the person is not chanting.</p>

The best is to get a monk to è¶…åº¦ the spirit, meaning transferring merits or appease the spirit so that it can be reborn in a better realm.

              <p><br>Share with you guys some of the interesting hearsay stories about people being possessed. I did not see them myself :</p>
              <p>1) My colleague's uncle was possessed by 2 spirits who claimed he killed their whole family in his past life. I told her about chanting Amitabha but I don't think she believed what I said because she is a Christian.</p>
              <p>2) My friend's neighbour flat's door is directly facing the lift. So, a lady staying in this house was possessed by an old soul. She would buy English oldies and danced cha cha, rock and roll in her house when she was possessed. 2 taoist mediums went to her house to negotiate with the spirit but the spirit said it would not leave the body. She ended up in mental hospital.</p>
              <p>3) My uncle was possessed. By what I really don't know. He crawled and ate like a dog and asked anybody who visited him to save him. I did not visit him because my family members didn't allow. According to them, it is better to let somebody who knows how to handle the spirit or else it is better that  others not to interfere because the spirit  will look for anybody who gets in their way.</p>

              <p>No, what I know the monks have other ways besides è¶…åº¦.If the spirit is too fierce, they will "catch" the spirit instead of the soft approach.
