              <p>If you have taken the 3 refuge, the real god (medium) or the genuine fortune teller will not entertain you. If the medium or fortune teller entertain you, meaning they are con men.</p>
              <p>One of my friend who had just taken the 3 refuge seek the help from a genuine fortune teller. The fortune teller told my friend that he could not see her future because she had taken the 3 refuge (my friend did not tell the fortune teller she had taken the 3 refuge). He advised my friend to practice well and seek the help from Godess of Mercy if she needs help. He did not receive any "ang pao" from my friend.</p>
              <p>Another one seek the help from the medium, the medium dare not to give advise to her, instead asked her to go back again the next day because the god (medium) needed to seek the advise from Godess of Mercy before advising her what to do. Reason being she is a Buddhist who had taken the 3 refuge, the god dare not to anyhow give her  advise. My friend did not go back to the temple.</p>

              <p>An e-mail based on my dharma teacher's advice to a friend of mine in 2004.</p>
              <p><span>Charles:</span></p>
              <p><em>To: Li Zhu lao shi.<br><br>Sorry for making you wait so long for my 
                  questions.<br><br>There's 2 questions i would like to ask you about.<br>1) My 
                  parents have been to some ki tang ceremony recently to ask some questions, From 
                  what i saw and heard, The ''chosen'' people who were ki tanging was possesed by 
                  Tua ya bei, Ji gong and so on. They were like cutting their own tounge. So, 
                  basically i would just like to ask whether they were really possessed by these 
                  gods or arharts or just some other spirits.<br><br>2)Why do some temples tie 
                  white strings around many golden buddhas statue?<br><br>Sorry if my question 
                  offended anyone.<br>Hope that li zhu lao shi can guide me with my buddhism 
                  questions till i become a monk. Maybe even after i become a monk too. =)</em><br><span><br>&gt;&gt;Hi
                   Charles,<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;I'm Li Zhu lao shi's daughter, &amp; 
                  replying on behalf of her.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;1) Those "chosen" 
                  people were possessed by some other spirits who <br>&gt;&gt;claimed that
                   they were the Tua ya bei, Ji gong and so on, all these <br>&gt;&gt;spirits
                   were those human beings who were very superstitious when 
                  <br>&gt;&gt;they were alive and like going to all these superstitious 
                  places to <br>&gt;&gt;learn these kind of teachings &amp; practice them.
                   All these teachings <br>&gt;&gt;would lead human to the habit of greed,
                   darkness, ignorance, <br>&gt;&gt;dependent &amp; insecurity. These 
                  spirits would always get angry &amp; <br>&gt;&gt;develop hatred easily 
                  when their wishes were not fulfilled. They <br>&gt;&gt;would punish 
                  those "chosen" people, making them sick or worsen <br>&gt;&gt;their 
                  living. Therefore, a wisdom human wouldnot believe &amp; accept <br>&gt;&gt;these
                   stupid &amp; superstitious beliefs. They would rather choose the <br>&gt;&gt;Bliss
                   &amp; Wisdom teaching which would lead them to brightness &amp; <br>&gt;&gt;rightful
                   thinking.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;2) Some temples tie white 
                  strings around many golden buddhas statue <br>&gt;&gt;is because it's a 
                  form of 
                  superstitious tradition which they think <br>&gt;&gt;the white strips 
                  would bring them brightness &amp; luck to them. So <br>&gt;&gt;from 
                  here, we know that all humans like to choose the brighter path <br>&gt;&gt;&amp;
                   not the darker one. Only through Buddha teaching, would you <br>&gt;&gt;achieve
                   it.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;Lastly, if you wish 
                  to become a monk in future, you must start to <br>&gt;&gt;learn the 
                  Buddha teaching now, through reading Buddhist books &amp; <br>&gt;&gt;listening
                   to the CDs or coming to our centre to join our <br>&gt;&gt;activities.<br>&gt;&gt;<br>&gt;&gt;May
                   Buddha Be With You,<br>&gt;&gt;Li Zhu lao shi</span></p>

              <p>if it is medium, its not buddhism. alot of people, both religious and non religious, go to consult mediums to solve their problems. they only want an easy way out of their problems. not only that, they also want prosperity and wealth and blessings from disasters etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that is how religions sprang up and started out, when ancient people started out worshipping sun, moon, river, lake, sea god of sorts when they do not understand them. they thought that natural diasters were acts of gods to punish them, thats why sacrifises of animals and even babies and human beings were done for the good of the tribe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>basically the insecurities and innate fear of human beings have not abated after all these millenniums. some join religion in the hope of going to heaven after death or obtaining prosperity and blessings. the mothers usually go to the temple to pray to the god of study so that their children will aced the exams. some mothers even go to the extent of going to temples obtaining amulets and burn it for their children to drink it so that they will be blessed with intelligence to score well for their exams.</p>

              <p>If one is possesed by a powerful spirit, medium also can't help. I have an uncle who was possessed, his family seek help from a medium, the medium passed to my uncle a buddhist beads, asked him to chant "Amitabha." He recovered fully after chanting "Amitabha." for a long period of time. (my uncle is not a buddhist).</p>
              <p>One of my relative saw my uncle became councious immediately after chanting "Amitabha."</p>
