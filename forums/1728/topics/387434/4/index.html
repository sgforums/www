              <p>We need to understand that all spirits have the right to exist in this world. Earth does not only belong to humans. However, ghosts or lost spirits are stuck in our dimension, often because of trauma during death or unfinished business with certain people still alive. Yes, it'll be very helpful if we can help them move on into the Light, if they're lost. If they have unfinished business, they'll often need to complete them before they can feel free to move on.</p>
              <p>Kuan Yin is a very appropriate Master to work with to help the spirits move on. There are various ways to do this, of which I shall not comment here, due to sensitivities. But my advice is: if you truly have a good heart to help them move on, speak quietly in your heart to Kuan Yin, and request her help to guide the lost spirits move on.</p>

              <p><br>Anyway, that was I was still a christian.   To christianity they believe it is the work of Satan.    One of the spirits real fierce, wanting to get into my body.    At that time, i was a christian there was holy spirit in me so when i pray pray, it went away like a gust of eerie wind (like those wind as seen on haunted movies).   Very scary.</p>
