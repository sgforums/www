              a monk in the Thai forest tradition for twenty years and is the co-abbot of
              Abhayagiri, a monastery he helped to found two years ago in northern
              California. He grew up J. C. Horner in the English countryside and studied
              physiology and psychology at the University of London, where he realized that
              "after forty years of studying the mind, my professors were no happier or
              wiser than I was." As a student, his mind-expansion technology consisted
              of listening to music, reading mystical literature—"Ramakrishna and the
              like"—and pursuing Dionysian revelry. But a Rudolf Steiner-school
              philosopher, Trevor Ravenscroft, pointed him toward Asia. At the age of
              twenty-one, he landed at Wat Pah Nanachat, a monastery in the forest tradition
              for the Western disciples of meditation master Ajaan Chah.</span></p>

              Amaro Bhikkhu, as he was then known, spent two years training in Thailand
              before returning to England. Here he joined the man who would be his teacher,
              Ajaan Sumedho, an American disciple of Ajaan Chah, at the newly founded
              Chithurst Monastery in the woods seventy miles southwest of London.</span></p>

              sits on 250 mountain acres in Mendocino County that were donated to Ajaan
              Sumedho and the order by the late Master Hsuan Hua, the Chinese Buddhist
              teacher and founder of the California temple City of Ten Thousand Buddhas.
              Nestled amidst madrone-covered hills are the meditation hall, a common building
              with kitchen and offices, and a half-dozen isolated wooden huti, or meditation
              huts, where nine monastics—seven men and two women—live and practice, each hut
              adjoining a shaded path for walking meditation. Some of the monastics as well
              as lay visitors to the community stay in tents and trailers. Abhayagiri, unlike
              its sister monasteries, whose funding comes largely from Thailand and other
              Asian communities, is supported by "good old Caucasian middle-class
              intellectual meditators." Ajaan Amaro is the author of <em>Silent Rain</em>,
              a collection of journal entries and dharma talks. He spoke with Mary Talbot at
              Abhayagiri in May 1998.</span></p>

              ignorance that human beings experience is largely based around the
              identification that we have with our bodies, with our personalities, our
              families, and our work, and because we're so woven into those identities—in the
              midst of our family, in our role as a doctor or teacher, parent, or child, as a
              personality among other personalities—it's very difficult to get any kind of
              perspective. Being in natural surroundings, you don't have to perform; you
              don't have to be anything. Your role as someone with a university degree or as
              the third sibling in your family is irrelevant to the lizards and the trees. You're
              just another thing in the forest. And those cultural identities fall into a
              much more diminished position in your consciousness. When you're around other
              people—and this is true in monastic life as well—it's hard to keep that
              perspective. But life in the forest gives you that contrast, where you can
              exist and not be anything. You're able to look at the flow of
              consciousness—thoughts, feelings, memories, ideas—without having to act on any
              of them. And you're there with the simplest elements of your being: breathing,
              feeling the heat or cold, learning to live with the other creatures of the
              forest. You're moving from a person-centered perspective to one centered on
              nature.</span></p>

              example is that I'd never related to myself as a food source before. We talk
              about precepts of nonviolence, and there you are faced with mosquitoes and
              other critters and you're moaning and complaining when they come along to bite
              you. But when you look at it, you've just brought this huge, luscious, pungent
              piece of meat into their midst. You're like a huge flashing sign outside of
              Dunkin' Donuts that says "Eat Me! Free Food! Help Yourself!"</span></p>

              there's no condition in which your heart is invested. The principle of
              renunciation is not to encourage a state of lack, but to establish as complete
              a state of simplicity as possible. In that simplicity you can more clearly see those
              patterns of wanting, not wanting, fearing, hoping, as they take shape. And the
              more complex our life is, the harder it is—particularly those emotional
              involvements with other people that create the most dense and potent conditions
              or qualities of mind that we deal with. The more charged-up our emotional
              bonds, the more difficult it is to get objectivity on them. It's not a moral
              judgment; it's just physics. Picking up a one-hundred-pound bag takes more
              effort than picking up a twenty-pound bag.</span></p>

              things hit you at different phases of your evolution. Early on, I had a lot of
              restlessness and youthful physical energy. I was twenty-one when I started.
              Just finding a place to put all that energy was hard work. But Ajaan Sumedho
              helped me channel that. At other points, it's been conflicting with people.
              When you're living in community you can't just say, "I'm out of
              here." You actually have to stay and work things through.</span></p>

              recognize that as part of the human condition there are urges and fear and
              aggression and sexual desire and ambition, and they're always easily ignited in
              any kind of community because of our biological makeup. The Buddha said that
              sexual energy is the most powerful force in the universe. It's extraordinarily
              powerful, because it has to be. If it wasn't so compelling as to override all
              sons of fear and discernment, then you'd never engage with another person in
              that way.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Looking
              at a tree, I would say, that's a beautiful tree. Or a horse. That beauty isn't
              having the same confusing effect as when I think about So-and-So. So comparing,
              and really studying the chemistry of it. When I look at this tree and this
              horse, the mind is clear and open. When I look at this person, I can see it in
              a clear and open way momentarily, but it gets confused. Now, what's causing
              that? When you know how it works, it's much easier not to be fooled by it. When
              you're a monastic and you're functioning in a nonsexual way, you're consciously
              laying aside that manner of relating. So you're better able to function with
              other beings on the basis of being-to-being rather than "Am I attractive?
              Is she attractive?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 7.85pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">What rules have you had to modify for this monastery?</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">Adherence
              to the rule might be very faithful but totally impractical, perhaps totally
              stupid. A temple in England spent £37,000 on a heating bill because the monks
              went bare-shouldered in an English winter. All of the adaptations we've made we
              waited until there was a real need, and then we changed. When Ajaan Sumedho was
              in Thailand and preparing to come to England, he decided: we'll just do what we
              do until we need to change it. So first of all, they went out on alms-round
              every day barefoot. And then they got to their first winter, and then they'd
              come back to the <em>vihara</em> and their feet would be blue. There were so many
              complaints and fears from the laypeople who saw what they were doing that they
              decided to go out with shoes and socks. If you look at the Vinaya, it says over
              and over again, "The laypeople saw such and such and they were upset so
              they took the matter to the Buddha and the Buddha said, 'Monks, I allow you to
              do such and such.'" There are a number of rules that even highly observant
              monks in Asia break quite cheerfully on a daily basis. In Thailand, for
              instance, the size of the robes is vastly greater than what's allowed in the
              Vinaya, which is supposed to be nine hand spans of the Buddha by six hand spans
              of the Buddha. And the robes we have are two meters by three meters. And they
              get around that by saying, "Well, the Buddha was eighteen feet tall."
              Which is, in my humble opinion, patently absurd. But every monk in the country wears
              a robe that's too big compared to the size allowed in the Vinaya. And it's
              against the Vinaya to travel in a vehicle. But that's because a vehicle would
              have been a cart pulled by an animal and you don't want to burden another
              being.</span></p>

              forest tradition by creating your own nuns' rules.</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">That's
              the biggest change we've made. Thailand is probably the worst situation for
              women's training in monastic life. There's only the Eight Precept ordination.
              And in Thailand, for a woman of an upper-class family, it's basically a
              disgrace to be ordained. She would not be allowed by her family to ordain. It
              would be as bad as becoming a streetwalker. It's believed that a woman who
              ordains would do so only if she were socially inept, couldn't bear children,
              couldn't find husband—it's like you're a failed being. And it brings a kind of
              shadow into the family. Which is bizarre, because to be a monk is considered
              the most meritorious thing you can do in a family.</span></p>

              Sumedho gave four women the Eight Precept ordination, and everything was dandy.
              But after a couple of years, we realized that men who had just arrived were
              getting higher places in the community and the nuns were still in the kitchen,
              wondering if they would still be cooking the beans in forty years.</span></p>

              became clear that none of the women in our community wanted to live according
              to most of those rules. One of the rules—and it's a serious offense to break
              it—is that you may never sleep more than a forearm's distance from another nun.
              So if you're a bhikkhuni, you can never sleep in your own room ever again. You

              own was extraordinarily vulnerable. A lot of the nuns' Vinaya was about
              safety—they can't travel alone, they can't sleep alone, they couldn't go out in
              the forest because of the danger of being molested and raped. In a way, it's
              almost a blessing that the nuns' order died out in the Theravada so you can
              reestablish it according to the culture as it exists.</span></p>

              "commune" style that has shaped Western residential centers in this

              been an interesting thing to watch here in the United States—the number of
              people in other traditions where there's marriage and mixed communities,
              wanting to learn about our tradition. It's because they come from mixed
              communities, and the pairing off that happens can create immense headaches.
              You're putting together people in this crucible and developing this immense
              intimacy. In a monastery there's tremendous intimacy between the monks and the
              nuns. You're really affecting each other. Then, if you've got the whole sexual
              element in addition to that, and who's with who, and who used to be with who,
              and I can't sit next to so-and-so in the zendo—aagh!—there are that many more
              karmic whirlpools.</span></p>

              tradition is very workable. People have to understand that renunciation and
              celibacy are not some kind of weird quirks left over from a spiritual
              authoritarian. The Buddha was an immensely pragmatic person. And he was totally
              beyond suffering. If you're incapable of suffering, why would you choose to
              live as a barefoot celibate mendicant wandering around Bihar for forty-five
              years? Why not just go back to the palace and move in with Yashodhara
              [Siddhartha's wife] again? Why was the Buddha a monk? And why did he live in
              the forest? And the answer, I feel, is that that simplicity of living is the
              most delightful way to be. And when the heart is utterly free from delusion and
              compulsions, you don't want to have sex, you don't want to lie, you don't want
              to be burdening yourself with a load of unnecessary duties. If people who want
              to offer you some alms food aren't around, then fine—you just help yourself to
              some water out of the creek and fast for a few days.</span></p>

              years ago Ajaan Chah asked Ajaan Sumedho if he ever thought he'd move back to
              the West. And Ajaan Sumedho said, "No way. There wouldn't be anyone to
              offer you alms food. How would you live?" And Ajaan Chah just said,
              "Do you mean to say there are no kind people in America?" And that
              was the moment he knew he'd be coming back to the West. Because that's all it
              takes. If you're living in a way that warms people's hearts, they'll want to
              support you. Renunciation is a state of freedom. That's what it's about. But there's
              a quality of the American mind that really fears renunciation. You can't talk
              about ending suffering, you have to talk about maximizing happiness [<em>laughs</em>].
              People don't like that negativity. But Buddhist practice only works when it's
              on the edge. And that's what the renunciant lifestyle is about, what living in
              the wilderness is about, what meditation is all about—getting to the edge.
              Because that's where we are transformed. What we're trying to do is create a
              situation that preserves the sharpness of the edge. We try to keep the
              principles of living on <em>dana</em> (charity) and never charging for the
              teachings and trying to stay very clearly in accord with the Buddha's teachings
              on liberation, and not water that down so that it has a pleasant or familiar taste.</span></p>

              doesn't, it won't. A lot of people have thrown themselves into meditation
              retreats or vipassana and then they hit a sort of dry patch—so they get
              interested in things like Dzogchen and Advaita Vedanta. And what's fascinating
              is that now the leaders of the American vipassana movement are saying, "Of
              all the teachings, I find that the teachings of the Thai forest masters are
              closest to Dzogchen." It's like, "Where have you been hiding?"
              We weren't hiding. And some of those people have developed a real appreciation
              that within their own monastic tradition—the very one they were trying to pull
              away from—there is the very jewel that they had been seeking in Hindu or
              Tibetan traditions.</span></p>

              has?</span></em><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 13.1pt;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  ">The
              teachings on emptiness. On non-abiding. I went on a retreat with a Tibetan
              rinpoche and had read a few books on Dzogchen, and I thought, "This is our
              song." Liberation through seeing with naked awareness. That teaching has
              been missing from some of the schools of meditation, like the vipassana
              movement, where it's almost as if the teaching is about trying to neutralize
              the senses, getting a degree of concentration and focus and looking upon the
              senses as the enemy. That's really exalting states of concentration where
              everything disappears. I think a lot of people have gotten weary of that—you
              arrive at this morbio inferiori and say, "This is it? This big empty blank
              space?" Like being shut in an empty refrigerator—nothing there, but it's
              pretty cold. So people have been turning to these other traditions to pull
              themselves back to that insight: The nature of mind is intrinsically pure, and
              then defilements come and obscure it. But there is nothing to perfect, and
              there's no one to perfect it. Just stop being confused. Be quiet. Wake up. And
              there it is. That's the national anthem of the forest monks of Thailand.</span></p>
