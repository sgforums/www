              </p><p>Advice from Atisha's Heart</p>
              <p>"How wonderful!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Friends, since you already have great knowledge and clear understanding, whereas I am of no importance and have little wisdom, it is not suitable for you to request advice from me. However because you dear friends, whom I cherish from my heart, have requested me, I shall give you this essential advice from my inferior and childish mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Friends, until you attain enlightenment the Spiritual Teacher is indispensable, therefore rely upon the holy Spiritual Guide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Until you realize ultimate truth, listening is indispensable, therefore listen to the instructions of the Spiritual Guide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you cannot become a Buddha merely by understanding Dharma, practice earnestly with understanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Avoid places that disturb your mind, and always remain where your virtues increase.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Until you attain stable realizations, worldly amusements are harmful, therefore abide in a place where there are no such distractions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Avoid friends who cause you to increase delusions, and rely upon those who increase your virtue. This you should take to heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since there is never a time when worldly activities come to an end, limit your activities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dedicate your virtues throughout the day and the night, and always watch your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because you have received advice, whenever you are not meditating always practice in accordance with what your Spiritual Guide says.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you practice with great devotion, results will arise immediately, without your having to wait for a long time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If from your heart you practice in accordance with Dharma, both food and resources will come naturally to hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Friends, the things you desire give no more satisfaction than drinking sea water, therefore practice contentment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Avoid all haughty, conceited, proud, and arrogant minds, and remain peaceful and subdued.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Avoid activities that are said to be meritorious, but which in fact are obstacles to Dharma.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Profit and respect are nooses of the maras, so brush them aside like stones on the path.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Words of praise and fame serve only to beguile us, therefore blow them away as you would blow your nose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since the happiness, pleasure, and friends you gather in this life last only for a moment, put them all behind you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since future lives last for a very long time, gather up riches to provide for the future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will have to depart leaving everything behind, so do not be attached to anything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Generate compassion for lowly beings, and especially avoid despising or humiliating them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have no hatred for enemies, and no attachment for friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not be jealous of others' good qualities, but out of admiration adopt them yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not look for faults in others, but look for faults in yourself, and purge them like bad blood.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not contemplate your own good qualities, but contemplate the good qualities of others, and respect everyone as a servant would.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See all living beings as your father or mother, and love them as if you were their child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Always keep a smiling face and a loving mind, and speak truthfully without malice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you talk too much with little meaning you will make mistakes, therefore speak in moderation, only when necessary.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you engage in many meaningless activities your virtuous activities will degenerate, therefore stop activities that are not spiritual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is completely meaningless to put effort into activities that have no essence.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the things you desire do not come it is due to karma created long ago, therefore keep a happy and relaxed mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Beware, offending a holy being is worse than dying, therefore be honest and straightforward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since all the happiness and suffering of this life arise from previous actions, do not blame others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All happiness comes from the blessings of your Spiritual Guide, therefore always repay his kindness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you cannot tame the minds of others until you have tamed your own, begin by taming your own mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you will definitely have to depart without the wealth you have accumulated, do not accumulate negativity for the sake of wealth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Distracting enjoyments have no essence, therefore sincerely practice giving.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Always keep pure moral discipline for it leads to beauty in this life and happiness hereafter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since hatred is rife in these impure times, don the armour of patience, free from anger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You remain in samsara through the power of laziness, therefore ignite the fire of the effort of application.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since this human life is wasted by indulging in distractions, now is the time to practice concentration.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being under the influence of wrong views you do not realize the ultimate nature of things, therefore investigate correct meanings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Friends, there is no happiness in this swamp of samsara, so move to the firm ground of liberation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meditate according to the advice of your Spiritual Guide and dry up the river of samsaric suffering.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should consider this well because it is not just words from the mouth, but sincere advice from the heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you practice like this you will delight me, and you will bring happiness to yourself and others.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I who am ignorant request you to take this advice to heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the advice that the holy being Venerable Atisha gave to Venerable Jangchub Ö."</p>
