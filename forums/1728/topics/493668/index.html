              That Everyone Should Know About</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">09/03/2017 Joanna Cates
              Huffpost  </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              is variously described as a spiritual tradition, a religion and a philosophy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Now
              I can’t possibly do justice to the ancient wisdom of Buddhism in a short post
              like this. And I in no way want to distort or dilute these ideas. But as a
              psychologist I have been astounded at the psychological insight that is to be
              found in Buddhist teachings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              I don’t doubt that you would benefit more from them if you were, I believe that
              you do not have to be a practicing Buddhist to benefit from Buddhist ideas.
              Many of these teachings are relevant to any human being, especially in this
              materialistic and often troubled world that we find ourselves in. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">1. The importance of gratitude</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              human beings we are designed to be constantly moving forwards in our lives, goal-directed
              and grasping for more..... and more..... and yet more. This plays well to the
              business model of our western capitalist society because it means we can be
              sold more...and more......and yet more. There is no end to this wanting.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              Buddhism emphasizes the need to pay attention to what we already have. It’s
              easy to take for granted many things in our lives - the health of our children,
              that we will have a meal today, that we have a roof over our heads. When we
              look at our lives relative to many others in the world, there are often many
              things we notice that we might be grateful for. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another
              thing that Buddhism reminds us to be grateful for is that we are alive at all.
              Think about all the events that had to take place since the beginning of time in
              order for you to be born. For instance every single one of your ancestors,
              going right back to the very first inklings of life in the primordial soup, had
              to meet and procreate at the exact moment that they did. And that’s
              mindboggling enough without thinking about the statistics involved once you
              factor in eggs and sperm and the biology of it all!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">2. The real meaning of karma</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Any
              time a driver cuts in front of our car to change lane, only to find themselves
              stuck in a slower lane of traffic, my husband will giggle gleefully. “Well
              that’s karma for you!” he’ll say. But is it? Like my husband, many people think
              that karma is the universe’s way of teaching you a lesson. Of getting you back. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              there is nothing supernatural or mysterious about karma. A Buddhist
              understanding of karma is simply the idea that our thoughts and our actions
              have consequences. So good thoughts and kind actions contribute to good karma
              and future happiness. However, bad intent and unkind actions lead to bad karma
              and future suffering. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Another
              way of understanding how karma works is similar to the concept of conditioning.
              It is well known by psychologists that if you behave in a certain way, through
              the psychological phenomenon of conditioning you increase the chances that you
              will behave in that way again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              if I shout at my children today, I am more likely to shout at them again
              tomorrow. If I can resist the urge to shout and can find another way to deal
              with a situation in which I might have shouted, I will be less likely to shout
              tomorrow. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">3. What does this moment require?</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              are frequently moments in life when we feel overwhelmed, and it can sometimes
              feel like we are being pulled in a million different directions. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              these sorts of situations our minds may be filled with unhelpful thoughts. But
              rather than asking of ourselves, “What is bothering me?” we should ask of
              ourselves “What does this moment require of me?” Once we have established the
              answer, we should do it. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Next
              time you are feeling overwhelmed (and consequently frustrated, resentful or
              irritated) stop ruminating about things that have happened in the past or that
              you are worried may happen in the future and focus on the exact moment and what
              needs to be done. Go on - try it!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">4. Mindfulness</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Very
              often we are so caught up in the endless stream of thoughts going through our
              minds that we don’t notice much of what is going on around us. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              yet at every single moment of our lives there is a virtually infinite amount of
              stimuli that we could choose to pay attention to instead of these thoughts. So
              you could choose to pay attention to what you can hear. However faint, even if
              it is just the sound of your own breathing, there will always be some sound you
              can hear. Or you could choose to pay attention to the way your feet feel inside
              your shoes or the way your back feels where it touches the chair.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              we can do this, even for just a few moments, we notice a calm feeling which is
              a reflection that our mind has stop flitting about from one thought to another
              and is momentarily focused on something other than our thoughts. This is what
              we mean by mindfulness. Very simply, it is about non-judgmental awareness of
              what is happening at any single moment. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">5. The Middle Way</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              Buddhist path is often called the “Middle Way” and can be thought of as one
              that runs between extremes. The Buddha believed that the wisest path in life
              was one of moderation. So whether it is striking a balance between being
              isolated and alone or being excessively dependent on others for company; over-exercising
              or not exercising at all; living a life of obscene over-indulgence or punitive
              austerity - life is about balance and Buddhism recognizes this. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              can provide answers to those who are seeking to answer questions about
              meaninglessness and purpose in life. It teaches a way of life that Buddhists
              argue is the only way to attain true happiness. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Though
              I am keenly aware that this post hardly scratches the surface of Buddhist
              teachings, should you find any of these ideas helpful, perhaps these seeds will
              inspire you to find out more.</span></p>
