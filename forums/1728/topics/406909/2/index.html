              <p>Let's put it this way,  when you die, supernatural powers are not going to be of much use.  It is like money, beauty, fame etc.  All these supernatural powers are transient.  And also, without wisdom, supernatural powers are not consistent and not 100% within one's control, also they can fade away when certain conditions are no longer there.  Basically, it is like good luck... sometimes have it, sometimes no. </p>
              <p>One teacher once said, if you are seeking psychic powers, just go and knock your head on the wall and die.  When you are in the bardo, you have alot of supernatural abilities eg. knowing others thoughts etc... of course this is just humour... don't take it seriously hor...</p>
              <p>When we practice, whatever form of Buddhism, the minimum criteria is confidence in facing death. I myself feel that this is the benchmark and thing to work towards...  of course i am not saying Dharma people are so life-denying and only focus on death... but this is a very 100% sure future situation we have to face, so while we treasure life and enjoy it, if we have some sense, we should also make sure our enjoyment continues longer into the future than only this life... </p>
              <p>psychic powers is like a short-lived kick... if you have it, then what next?  One should always think like that.  With afflictions in one's mindstream, no matter how external changes, we will always be suffering... therefore, you should think twice about what you wish for... or you may simply be getting a very lousy bargain for all your time, life and energy invested.</p>

              <p>There are different form of bliss. Some short/transient, not-so-intense pleasurable sensations can arise, but those are not considered jhana. Rapture can pervade your entire body very intensely... a very intense kind of pleasure beyond anything you have experienced in ordinary life (better than sex, as some teachers put it). It is rapture born not from indulging in sensual pleasures, but pleasure born from absorption. When you reach that it is first jhana - to even reach this level you need to attain certain level of concentration to the point of absorption. As you get into higher levels the joy becomes ever more subtle and turns to equanimity, etc.</p>
              <p>The bliss of Nirvana however is very different. It is the bliss of clarity to put it in Thusness's words.</p>
              <p>As for supernatural powers: you need to gain mastery of 4th Jhana, and then with directed thought and resolution you can manifest the powers (listen to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/236-buddhist-geeks/episodes/3665-buddhist-magic-what-possible">http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/236-buddhist-geeks/episodes/3665-buddhist-magic-what-possible</a>). However, don't practice with the goal of attaining supernatural powers. Not even jhanic bliss should be your ultimate aim (jhanas are still samsaric, conditional states) - just treat them as a sweetener in your practice, as Thusness told me.</p>
              <p>Your goal of practice should be nothing short of enlightenment and liberation.</p>

              refuge from the burning ground. When they find an apparent shelter, they
               are locked inside it as it blazes around them, while they scream 
              inside. Life in this Naraka is 8.2944*10<sup>14</sup> years long.</li>
              </ul>

               their own body by hurting others. In this hell, ruru animals known as 
              kravyÄ�da torment them and eat their flesh. Life in this Naraka is 
              6.63552*10<sup>15</sup> years long.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li><strong><a class="new" title="Tapana (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tapana&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Tapana</a></strong> – the "heating" Naraka. Here Yama's servants impale the beings on a 
              fiery spear until flames issue from their noses and mouths. Life in this
               Naraka is 5.308416*10<sup>16</sup> years long.</li>

              Tapana Naraka, but the beings are pierced more bloodily with a trident. 
              Life in this Naraka is 4.2467328*10<sup>17</sup> years long. It is also said to last for the length of half an <em><a title="Buddhist cosmology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology#Temporal_cosmology">antarakalpa</a></em>.</li>
              </ul>

              <li><strong><a title="Avici" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avici">AvÄ«ci</a></strong> – the "uninterrupted" Naraka. Beings are roasted in an immense blazing 
              oven with terrible suffering. Life in this Naraka is 3.39738624*10<sup>18</sup> years long. It is also said to last for the length of an <em><a title="Buddhist cosmology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_cosmology#Temporal_cosmology">antarakalpa</a></em>.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These Narakas by no means exhaust the tale of possible sufferings. 
              Some sources describe five hundred or even hundreds of thousands of 
              different Narakas. In Chinese Buddhist texts, the numbers and types of 
              Narakas were elaborated in a variety of creative ways; see <a class="mw-redirect" title="Di Yu" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Yu">Di Yu</a> for examples of this sort of treatment.</p>
              <p>The sufferings of the dwellers in Naraka often resemble those of the <a title="Preta" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preta">Pretas</a>,
               and the two types of being are easily confused. The simplest 
              distinction is that beings in Naraka are confined to their subterranean 
              world, while the Pretas are free to move about.</p>

              <p><br>Buddha taught the three principle/pillars:- precepts/discipline, deep concentration and wisdom.</p>

              <p>This three principle of precepts/discipline, concentration/stillness and wisdom help sever the three posions of greed, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hatred</span> and folly RESPECTIVELY.</p>

              I have browse through several pages.
              
              To be frank with everyone, currently, I am not whole-heartedly seeking enlightenment. I am a free-thinker in this lifetime and I do not agree 100% with buddhists' teachings.
              
              For example, some people believes that the physical body+emotions+thoughts are defilements that should be identified and discarded. From enlightened beings sense, it may be true as anything there is not pure is an obstacle to enlightenment. 
              
              But from my point of view, everyone is both enlightened and on the path to enlightenment, is just a matter how you look at it and what is the purpose of the being being incarnated into this world at this period of time. 
              
              If you think you are incarnated into this world and your only purpose is to gain enlightenment, then seriously, you are at the wrong place. You should be at Buddha Pureland or become a monk/nun right now. There must be some other reasons why you here at this place, at this time other than 100% directly seeking enlightenment.
              
              Why I encourage everyone to practice meditation is because this period of time is very crucial and critical for Earth's Ascension. Just imagine everyday, there are billions of people producing rubbish and more rubbish and there is less then 10% of the people trying very very hard to clean up the mess... If everyone of us join hands and start cleaning up the mess, it will be way much easier and better for all of us.

              <p>I used to think I have a purpose, my cousin who work as a healer gave me some books on purposes too. So I search and search. After a few years, I found out that these purposes that I feel I should follow in my mind - are but false and impermanent. It could very well been my habitual tendency of thinking towards this directions carried over from many past lives that cause me to be fall back to this state. If I don't achieve this purpose and I die then everything I tried to do in this life would become a dream. Then in my next life I try again? And again... and again... It's tiresome and burdensome. Besides who can gaurantee I will still be human next life? It's not good to take this kind of risk...<br><br>What we did in the past conditions what we are / have now, but what is going to happen in the future is determined by what we do now. So whatever false thoughts we have for our purposes can be changed to the thought for enlightenment. If we turn it around and choose another purpose, we will walk down a completely different path. <br><br>It is not easy to be born in Buddha's Pureland. Say the western pureland of Amitabha Buddha - it says in the sutra that one cannot be born in the Pureland with å°‘å–„æ ¹ï¼Œç¦�å¾·ï¼Œ å› ç¼˜. In fact to be able to encounter the teaching on Pureland or even Buddhism is not easy. Even if you encounter, you may not believe. Even if you believe, you may not practice. Also to be a monk or nun require good merits, if you don't have sufficient merits, you can't have the conditions to be one. In samsara, we cannot control a lot of things, we want to do this we can't, we want to be a monk/nun, we may not be able to take the hardship or not have enough causes and conditions. The only "things" that are within our control is our own thoughts, so it's important to choose the right purpose of enlightenment.<br><br>Yes, too much rubbish, this is the reason why we have to get enlightened or into the Pureland, to stop producing these rubbish. If we don't get enlightened or into the Pureland, after we get out of meditation if we don't continue practicing, we will start producing rubbish again.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>Just an opinion.</p>
              <p>Yes, very few are really interested in enlightenment. For those that are not interested, there is no point in pushing.... Most of these people are still feeling the need to experiment and explore different kinds of experiences, feelings and emotions. Just like as one is young, everything is fresh and new... but when one is older the fresh and new is not seem in the same light anymore.</p>
              <p>However, many who are interested are also accutely clear about the state of recurring difficulties in the re-carnation cycle.</p>
              <p>For me, the resolve in getting out of the situation happened in one past life when i see incredible amount of pain and suffering... not of myself but others. At that life time, i don't even have a concept of Enlightenment. ... but the intention and resolve is strong enough to propel one forward in that direction in future life.</p>
              <p>I think you are trying to convey that the purpose of life at this time has to do with the Planet's ascension. Fact is, by following an enlightenment path, one is benefiting that 'purpose' too.</p>
              <p>Also when you gain insights/realisation, you will also understand how supernatural powers are possible... but that does not mean that one will have it... as it may not being developed in that area and also due to conditions. Supernatural power such as remote viewing, bi-location and all those stuffs are possible because the universe is 'empty'. It is 'holographic, timeless, interconnected, etc'. The condition of physicality generate additional patterns and conditions that prevents the supernatural powers... that is all.</p>

              <p><br>Not everyone is meant to walk the same path in Life. To follow the path of another person, in the hope of having an easier journey in the Universe (often over-simplified as afterlife or rebirth), is not necessarily for our highest good, as everyone's lifeplan is unique.</p>
              <p>Just a personal advice to all who are open:</p>
              <p>Come back on 2 Oct 2011. Assess our life very honestly and without any form of prejudices and attachments then. If we're still totally at peace within ourselves, and still having a fulfilling life, with no fear whatsoever, then all should be fine. Else, it would be prudent to ponder by that time, if we're truly walking the most appropriate path for ourselves. :) </p>

              <p>The most important reasons for practising Buddhism is the realisation of suffering within the samsaric existence.  The reason Buddhism is suitable for most humans is the absence of overwhelming distraction of suffering and pleasure. Ideally, a balance of awareness of suffering and the pleasure of leisureliness to contemplate.</p>
              <p>Buddhism is based on focused concentration  and awareness, that I believe you are aware of.</p>
              <p>On your take of physical body, emotions and  thoughts  as defilements, is that when identified and lumped together, "I"or "Me "arises, and is the cause of suffering due to the duality of "I" and others.</p>
              <p>If one were a Varjayana practitioner, one would not shun away from the body, emotions and thoughts, but a vessel for practising awareness and arousing compassion. It all depends on the skillful means of practice.</p>
              <p>All mind is originally pure, of Buddha nature, hence the term ordinary mind , primordial etc.  Due the formation of I, constant craving, attachment, delusional view sets in.</p>
              <p>With the delusional mind, we do not have mental stillness, acting and reacting to our inner and external detractors.Why do you advocate meditation, when things are "satisfactory"  as it is? Of cause it is not, that why you are doing something(meditation) about it! </p>
              <p>Another thing is the difference between the concept of rebirth and reincarnation. When the "I' was strong in me(relative), it is easy to believe in the immortal "I", and look for the reason for my existence. However, we  live and we die irregardless of our beliefs.</p>
              <p>I do not know or understand what earth ascension means, but it's ok . Although the mess we are in might not get worse to the point of intolerance within my life, what is important is we have compassion and awareness of suffering our individual and collective action  it  causes. </p>
              <p> Gaining enlightenment is an aspiration, some are actively seeking it within this life time, some are not. But again, there is no time like NOW is'nt it. We plant the aspiration like a indestructible seed, hoping it will germinate and flower later now.  Some sprout immediately, some, later. But if we do not even plant a seed...</p>
              <p>We are here because we exist as an individual "I" and we cling, claw and slash and feed in order to exist, this is life is'nt it? Look around, sentients are struggling for their existence and a piece of dirt.  Whether we look for a higher purpose or not, it is fundamentally us.. Do the right things, we thrive and go one up(upper realms), do the wrong things life can be hell.  </p>
              <p> One either learns to be content and accept the suffering of samsara, or one can yoke one's dissatisfaction, and bring the ceaseless samsaric existence to an end!  </p>
              <p>One thing about being born into Pureland, is also about being born as a Bodhisattva, is that eventually, the aspiration of a Bodhisattva will ripen.</p>
