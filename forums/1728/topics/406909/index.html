              <p>There is this book "ç”Ÿå‘½ä¸�æ­»" written by a doctor who is a Christian. This doctor practice in U.S. He encountered 2 white Americans who spoke æ–‡è¨€æ–‡ during hypnotherapy. æ–‡è¨€æ–‡is an ancient Chinese language (dated thousands of years ago). These 2 guys must have gone through countless reincarnation.</p>
              <p>Karmic debts can be cleared by following Buddha's teachings and by practicing, one can end the rebirth cycle in this life. I'm practicing Pureland Teachings, Pureland Teachings is salvation both by work and Amitabha's grace.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes, but not to look for bad karmic to clear. As and when you conduct kind deeds, and you met with setback, just take it normally. In this manner, yr bad karmic will naturally clear and you always on the good karmic. Observing vegetarian is both clearing bad karmic and increasing good karmic. Life liberation by not habouring ill intent on others and liberate animals that are going to be killed for foods as well as not condemning animals liberation is heavenly karmic.</p>

              <p>There are many many levels of heavens. There are 6 planes of heaven in the sense-desire realm, and I think 22 jhana heavens.</p>
              <p>If you develope 4th jhana, and gain some supernormal powers, you may be able to visit some of those realms.</p>
              <p>My taiwanese teacher has visited both heaven and hell in meditation. His description of heaven (he bought one of his students along as well) sounds like tavatimsa heaven - there were mansions, palaces, made entirely of jewels from top to bottom. Tavatimsa heaven is still a sense desire realm, not the jhana heavens.</p>
              <p>Recently someone posted his/her past life memory of being a deva in another (not Buddhist) forum by Simpo, and that description seems very similar to my Taiwanese teacher's.</p>

              <p>"<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: normal;">I've been Trying to figure out, what and where my "true" origins are 
                          from. so the last few meditations Ive had thats been my focal point. My 
                          first "true" vision, happened a few days back when i kinda just dropped 
                          into a different conscious dimension. When i woke i was compelled to 
                          write down what i could remember during this dream like state.... it was
                           hard to form what i saw on that plain to this one. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;"><br><br> First 
                          “true” vision: Majestic hall of the purest radiating energy, the marble a
                           whitish offset but still bright to the eye, there in the middle of huge
                           pillars, 12 pillars, is a woman, or what looks to be a woman. She’s 
                          dressed in the robes of purest light, which shines for an unending 
                          eternalness. The women’s eyes of piercing blue, radiates me to the very 
                          center. “At home am I in this place” is the song she silently sings to 
                          me.<br><br>Now i could only remember so much while writing but certain 
                          things stud out, such as the 12 pillars, the womans robes and her 
                          piercing blue eyes. <br><br>After this first vision i focused more on 
                          trying to figure out why i remember these things. at first i thought 
                          maybe it the the area that i saw her, that was important, but for some 
                          reason that didn't seem right. i then tried less on focusing on one item
                           of the vision to asking why i was gifted this sight and to what she 
                          ment by "at home you are in this place."  this is where i was given 
                          another spiritual vision. This time i was in a mediative state.<br><br><br>Search
                           for my past: I extend my heart to find what past was truly mine, I ask 
                          the creator what my past and home truly is. I arrived on a different 
                          plain there in my vision is the loveliest star I’ve ever seen radiating a
                           blue glow, and a purplish energy spreading wealth and love to its solar
                           systems and hierarchy. This is my home my heart sings to me, here once 
                          again is the….presence of the white lady with piecing blues eyes, as if 
                          answering the question my heart desires “Sirius”…. My original origins, I
                           all most feel lifted as if I have always knew I was from the heavens. 
                          My soul is old I am told, destined to live and give strength to those 
                          around me… I try to press farther but I am denied the right…. Pushed 
                          back to the reality I am in now, my guide or the white lady with blue 
                          eyes, sends me off with a gentle sign of happiness and the knowledge I 
                          may come back whenever I like… <br><br> The reason im posting this, is i
                           would like other interpretations. I believe that in search of knowledge
                           and truth you most get every aspect.<br> Also ill be happy to answer any questions to the best of my ability" </span></p>

              <p>This is very true. I have some experience with jhanas... the jhana itself is truly heavenly bliss, it is not the kind of pleasure or bliss you can ever find in the human realm. The jhana itself is heaven.</p>
              <p>Though jhanas are also not the ultimate aim of Buddhism. The bliss of Nirvana is supreme.</p>

              were born here as personal attendants of other gods. It is said in the
              Paramatthajotika that if a new god or goddess is born on the lap of the
              owner of a palace, he or she will be regarded as the son or daughter of
              that god; if a goddess is born in his bed, she will be his wife; if a new
              god or goddess is born in the precinct of his palace, he or she will become

              <p>There are many many levels of heavens. There are 6 planes of
              heaven in the sense-desire realm, and I think 22 jhana heavens.</p>
              <p>If you develope 4th jhana, and gain some supernormal powers, you
              may be able to visit some of those realms.</p>
              <p>My taiwanese teacher has visited both heaven and hell in
              meditation. His description of heaven (he bought one of his
              students along as well) sounds like tavatimsa heaven - there
              were mansions, palaces, made entirely of jewels from top to bottom.
              Tavatimsa heaven is still a sense desire realm, not the jhana
              heavens.</p>
              <p>Recently someone posted his/her past life memory of being a deva
              in another (not Buddhist) forum by Simpo, and that description
              seems very similar to my Taiwanese teacher's.</p>
              <p>podog:</p>
              <p>"<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: normal;">I've been
              Trying to figure out, what and where my "true" origins are from. so
              the last few meditations Ive had thats been my focal point. My
              first "true" vision, happened a few days back when i kinda just
              dropped into a different conscious dimension. When i woke i was
              compelled to write down what i could remember during this dream
              like state.... it was hard to form what i saw on that plain to this
              one. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: normal;"><br> <br> First “true” vision: Majestic hall of the purest radiating energy,
              the marble a whitish offset but still bright to the eye, there in
              the middle of huge pillars, 12 pillars, is a woman, or what looks
              to be a woman. She’s dressed in the robes of purest light, which
              shines for an unending eternalness. The women’s eyes of piercing
              blue, radiates me to the very center. “At home am I in this place”
              is the song she silently sings to me.<br> <br> Now i could only remember so much while writing but certain things
              stud out, such as the 12 pillars, the womans robes and her piercing
              blue eyes.<br> <br> After this first vision i focused more on trying to figure out why
              i remember these things. at first i thought maybe it the the area
              that i saw her, that was important, but for some reason that didn't
              seem right. i then tried less on focusing on one item of the vision
              to asking why i was gifted this sight and to what she ment by "at
              home you are in this place." this is where i was given another
              spiritual vision. This time i was in a mediative state.<br> <br> <br> Search for my past: I extend my heart to find what past was truly
              mine, I ask the creator what my past and home truly is. I arrived
              on a different plain there in my vision is the loveliest star I’ve
              ever seen radiating a blue glow, and a purplish energy spreading
              wealth and love to its solar systems and hierarchy. This is my home
              my heart sings to me, here once again is the….presence of the white
              lady with piecing blues eyes, as if answering the question my heart
              desires “Sirius”…. My original origins, I all most feel lifted as
              if I have always knew I was from the heavens. My soul is old I am
              told, destined to live and give strength to those around me… I try
              to press farther but I am denied the right…. Pushed back to the
              reality I am in now, my guide or the white lady with blue eyes,
              sends me off with a gentle sign of happiness and the knowledge I
              may come back whenever I like…<br> <br> The reason im posting this, is i would like other interpretations.
              I believe that in search of knowledge and truth you most get every
              aspect.<br> Also ill be happy to answer any questions to the best of my
              ability" </span></p>

              <p>There are different form of bliss. Some short/transient, not-so-intense pleasurable sensations can arise, but those are not considered jhana. Rapture can pervade your entire body very intensely... a very intense kind of pleasure beyond anything you have experienced in ordinary life (better than sex, as some teachers put it). It is rapture born not from indulging in sensual pleasures, but pleasure born from absorption. When you reach that it is first jhana - to even reach this level you need to attain certain level of concentration to the point of absorption. As you get into higher levels the joy becomes ever more subtle and turns to equanimity, etc.</p>
              <p>The bliss of Nirvana however is very different. It is the bliss of clarity to put it in Thusness's words.</p>
              <p>As for supernatural powers: you need to gain mastery of 4th Jhana, and then with directed thought and resolution you can manifest the powers (listen to <a href="http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/236-buddhist-geeks/episodes/3665-buddhist-magic-what-possible">http://personallifemedia.com/podcasts/236-buddhist-geeks/episodes/3665-buddhist-magic-what-possible</a>). However, don't practice with the goal of attaining supernatural powers. Not even jhanic bliss should be your ultimate aim (jhanas are still samsaric, conditional states) - just treat them as a sweetener in your practice, as Thusness told me.</p>
              <p>Your goal of practice should be nothing short of enlightenment and liberation.</p>

              <p>Like zero thought says, other and avoiding evil and doing good, to be liberated we must purify the mind.</p>
              <p>Of what?</p>
              <p>Afflictions, defilements - greed, hatred, ignorance, habitual energies, and the 'ignorance' part includes the delusion of being a Self or things as having independent existence. All these things are binding us to the endless cycle of samsaric rebirths, unless we purify our minds of those binding afflictions.</p>
              <p>Liberation and purification is only possible through practicing Buddhism and attaining enlightenment, realizing our true nature.</p>
              <p>We must learn the correct teachings, and practice correctly.</p>
              <p>You can read some of the articles at <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/</a> for a start, they are simple to understand and practice.</p>
              <p>Your goal should be liberation and Buddhahood, not supernatural powers. Many non-Buddhist teachings teach about developing psychic powers but these things do not lead to liberation, enlightenment, or end of suffering.</p>
              <p>Enlightenment is highly achievable even today, you just need to know the teaching and method and then practice it. That is why it is important to understand the dharma.</p>
