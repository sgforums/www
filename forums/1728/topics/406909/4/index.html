              <p>Tradition relates that after the Buddha's complete
                  enlightenment, he uttered the following words<br> <br> 'Seeking but not finding the housebuilder, I have traveled through
                  the round of countless births. How painful is birth over and over
                  again. Oh housebuilder! You have now been caught! You shall not
                  build a house again. Your rafters have been broken. Your ridgepole
                  demolished. The unconditioned consciousness has been attained. And
                  every kind of craving has been destroyed.' (DhammapÄ�da, verses
                  153,154)<br> <br> The 'housebuilder' to which the Buddha refers is just this mental
                  faculty of sankhÄ�ra-khandha whose products, the volitional
                  formations, are conditioned by ignorance.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing your experience. :)</p>
              <p>Ehmm... about further higher self discussion i will like to request you to either PM me or post on the supernatural forum. I don't wish to confuse readers with terminologies not found in the traditional Buddhist teachings. Sorry about that .</p>
              <p>As mentioned in a previous post, there is 2 distinction experience of the higher self. 1. Is transmission/vision from it. 2. Directly be in the state/realm of the higher self.  Have you had the second experience? It is a good experience to have the second experience, the perspective from that will be different from the one of a human-being living on Earth. BUT, also to take note that higher self is really the full accumulation of understanding gained from the experiences in all the past-lifes. It is wise by the comparision to the individual human-being self but it can benefit from further understandings and realisations. If you can, feed into its databank the insights of no-self, impermanence and if possible too 'emptiness'. The higher self is basically the part of consciousness that is aware of the weariness of endless rebirth cycle... this part of consciousness is more eager to complete the rebirth cycle that the individual incarnations... if you are willing, please gain the neccesary experience and it will automatically be 'recorded' into the memory databank.</p>
              <p>When the insight of no-self is gain and well understood, one will gain a better understanding of how consciousness works. From that point onwards, one may start to use a more thorough and advanced method of clearing than the one being described by you. Basically, one will just let whatever arises on the surface or is being awared of to be pass off from the system equanimously. That way, there will be no additional habit imprints of using counter-ways to neutralise. There is no need for negatives to be neutralised by positive. Negatives become feared when it is judged by the mind as bad. The advanced method do not judge at all. But for that to happen, the insights and realisations must occur first.</p>
              <p>All the best to you !! :)</p>

              and so cultivate a stock of merits, aspiring
              for birth in that land. Such beings are born
              in a palace, where they dwell for five hundred
              years without being able to behold the Buddha,
              hear his exposition of the Dharma, or see
              the hosts of bodhisattvas and shravakas.
              For this reason, that type of birth in the
              Pure Land is called 'embryonic state.'<br> "If there are sentient beings who with resolute faith accept these
              kinds of wisdom, from the Buddha's wisdom to the supreme wisdom, do meritorious
              deeds and sincerely transfer the merit acquired (to that land), [278b]
              those beings will be born by transformation spontaneously. seated with
              legs crossed, in the seven-jewelled lotus-flowers, and instantly attain
              the same glorious forms, wisdom and virtue as those of other bodhisattvas
              there.</h3>
