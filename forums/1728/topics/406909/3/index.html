              <p>I would like to ask a question about ghosts and spirits. In
              buddhism, do people believe that we can see them?</p>
              <p>I ask this because of the different perceptions of different
              religions, and I hear that in buddhism, some say we can and some
              say we cannot or perhaps this is because in singapore buddhism and
              taoism are kind of close, or it seems like that to me.</p>

              <p>Buddhist believe in the existence of  hell beings and ghost. Seeing them is a individual ability, some see it some don't. There some who believe the young children can see them, only to lose the ability later on. Most people are unable to see ghost, so the uncertainty of an answer!</p>
              <p>The reason Buddhist and Taoist  seem similiar, is because Buddhism and Taoism and Confucianism and folk beliefs have coexisted and blended in China before it reaches here.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>Removing negativity need more than just the willingness to do so. There is a need for the correct method of doing so. .. of which Vipassana practice is very effective.</p>
              <p>That is the reason, why in the previous post that i said that when one walk the enlightenment path, he/she is at the same time benefitting the Earth and removing the negativity.</p>
              <p>The willingness to remove negativity is only the first step. With that, one tries to keep to the precepts as much as possible. Next the meditation and vipassana/mindfulness practice allow the negativity (in the form of sanskaras) to be observed, seen and flush out of the consciousness.</p>
              <p>The difficulty is that what an average person knows about himself/herself is only the surface of consciousness. Much of the imprints are in the unconscious and subconscious portion of mind. Therefore without the correct method of doing, there will be not much changes.</p>
              <p>There is not just a need to direct people to  information about what will happen and blah blah. There is an even more important need to teach people how to do it correctly.</p>
              <p>If any lightworker need to be successful, he or she not only need to inform. He or she need to have the experience to teach the effective method of clearing.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>The anger come up real fast is because  anger is actually in the subconscious level of mind. The stay calm is only at the surface level. It will take a lot of time for the subconscious part of mind to slowly unload itself of the imprints. In the meantime, what we can do is not to keep it rolling on.</p>

              <p>Hi SoulDivine,</p>
              <p>Thanks for the sharing.</p>
              <p>Removing negativity need more than just the willingness to do
              so. There is a need for the correct method of doing so. .. of which
              Vipassana practice is very effective.</p>
              <p>That is the reason, why in the previous post that i said that
              when one walk the enlightenment path, he/she is at the same time
              benefitting the Earth and removing the negativity.</p>
              <p>The willingness to remove negativity is only the first step.
              With that, one tries to keep to the precepts as much as possible.
              Next the meditation and vipassana/mindfulness practice allow the
              negativity (in the form of sanskaras) to be observed, seen and
              flush out of the consciousness.</p>
              <p>The difficulty is that what an average person knows about
              himself/herself is only the surface of consciousness. Much of the
              imprints are in the unconscious and subconscious portion of mind.
              Therefore without the correct method of doing, there will be not
              much changes.</p>
              <p>There is not just a need to direct people to  information
              about what will happen and blah blah. There is an even more
              important need to teach people how to do it correctly.</p>
              <p>If any lightworker need to be successful, he or she not only
              need to inform. He or she need to have the experience to teach the
              effective method of clearing.</p>

              <p>Just to share with you.</p>
              <p>I am already attuned to Reiki-2 many years ago. I also have bought DNA activation stuffs years ago. I attended lightbody and channelling talks. I also have past life regression tapes. I had a teacher who taught me how to read vision and dream messages. There was a period of time that i relied much on recieved visions. On hindsight, those are intepreted informations and there is a need to actualise them into direct realisations.</p>
              <p>Also, for you only, (hopefully this won't confuse other readers and this is not representative of Buddhism), there is a difference between recieving transmissions from a 'higher dimension' and being actually be in the state from that realm that you will call the Higher self. I have both experiences.  The higher self is totally unlike you as a human-being, but is still of one's being... It is a subtle fine vibration form of mental state.. It is also devoid of emotion which is a lower vibration state.. BTW, higher self do not necessarily understand the insights of no-self. It still sees itself as a self (6th dimensional state), but a formless state that is beyond the physical. The higher self will most probably be what Buddhism call the Alaya consciousness. It does not necessarily understands the insights the no-self, impermanence and emptiness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>LOL... you seems to be following a path that I took years ago.</p>
              <p>Anyway. All the best, my friend.</p>
              <p>May you succeed in your goal :)</p>

                                          bitter, fearful, suspicious, greedy, pessimistic, selfish,
                                          unforgiving, cruel, always complaining, closed-minded.

                  <h4>What is a negative act?</h4>
                  <br>
                  <p>You can rename negative acts as malicious acts. Malicious refers to "<span class="sense_b "><span class="def parentof__def__is__sense_b">intended to harm or upset other living beings".</span></span></p>
                  
                  <p> There are plenty of "negativity" examples all over the world, even in mass communication media we are so used to watching and listening everyday. Other than the usual malicious acts like killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, slandering, harsh speech and vain talks. We still have people constantly generating/promting greed, lust, anger, hatred, violence, fear and false views. We even have people destroying the world we live in by generating air/water/land pollution, underground/undersea explosions and deep mining.</p>
                  
                   <p>For all the malicious acts humanity had done, we will have to pay back eventually, but I do not want to talk about retribution at all, you can open minds and hearts to see/feel for yourselves.</p>
                  
                  <h4>What is the origin of negativity? (Very complex and difficult question) </h4>
                  <p>Everyone has a spirit that is inherently pure and filled with love.</p> 
                  <p>To trace back to origin of negativity requires knowledge of billions of years of earth history, and also knowledge of beings that comes from other star systems.

              <p><br>Hi Souldivine,</p>
              <p>Higher-self IS ego structure... it is where the rest of the problems came from... Higher self may seem to be refined and pure but it has to maintain itself. The maintenance slowly spreads out into your so-called negativity. </p>
              <p>Looking at Atlantis, they may have great knowledge,science or understanding... but because they did not have egolessness, or realisation, therefore even when they had everything, it can still devolve down to destroying themselves and to mankind like it is nowadays.  Practice of Buddhism brings one beyond any possibility of devolution.  It dismantles devolution completely.  Got to understand the difference.</p>
              <p>Look at Shambhala pureland, where the people are highly enlightened... and practice the Kalachakra teachings... there is no possibility of devolution or degenerating somewhat... the people there constantly evolving to total perfection.  There is no and will not be any form of major disaster or self-destruction there and i believe it has lasted longer than Atlantis. Still exists now. Perhaps, the models you are adopting have to be re-examined.</p>

              <p>What will be, will be, my friend. ;)</p>
              <p>There is a Universal Law of Allowing, which prevents outcomes from happening properly, if we don't allow the Universe enough 'space' to handle situations at the appropriate time.</p>
              <p>Everyone's lifeplan, life path, destiny and stage of evolution is different, and hence degree/perspective of understanding also differs. Without actual real-life experience of taking joyful or painful steps of one's personal choice, true realisation and learning cannot be completed. And that defeats the purpose of Life on Earth.</p>
              <p>For many cases, people can only understand the severity of the consequences of their choices made in this lifetime, in the next lifetime and beyond. Though it may seem unfortunate from a 3rd party's perspective, it's only the Universal Law of Cause and Effect at work. Not everyone is ready to end their reincarnation cycles in this lifetime, but those who truly are, will be given all the help and guidance needed, by beings that have an affinity with them.</p>
              <p>No amount of studying or simulation can prepare one to fly a plane and survive. Only when we have to do it by ourselves up in the air alone when the time comes, and tested under different weather conditions, will we all know if we are truly ready and have learnt enough. Naturally, there will be planes that are able to take-off, stay in the air and land well, and there will be plane crashes. But in the journey of Life, crashes will just mean more lifetimes to learn more thoroughly or choose a more appropriate path.</p>
              <p>Exciting times are not far ahead. Everyone will have the chance to test their readiness to fly a plane in this lifetime, whether people are ready or not. It will be a time of true awakening for many. It will be a time that will end all pretences.</p>

                  <p>Tradition relates that after the Buddha's complete enlightenment, he uttered the following words<br><br>'Seeking but not finding the housebuilder,
                  I have traveled through the round of countless births.
                  How painful is birth over and over again.
                  Oh housebuilder! You have now been caught!
                  You shall not build a house again.
                  Your rafters have been broken. Your ridgepole demolished.
                  The unconditioned consciousness has been attained.
                  And every kind of craving has been destroyed.'
                  (DhammapÄ�da, verses 153,154)
                  <br><br> The 'housebuilder' to which the Buddha refers is just this mental faculty of sankhÄ�ra-khandha whose products, the volitional formations, are conditioned by ignorance.</p>
