              <div class="author">By Mark Epstein, M.D.</div>
              <div class="author"><br></div>
              <p>One of my favorite stories comes from the Sufi tradition of mystical 
                          Islam. It is a tale that tells us exactly what we will have to face if 
                          we endeavor to walk the path of desire. A man sits in the center of a 
                          Middle Eastern marketplace crying his eyes out, a platter of peppers 
                          spilled out on the ground before him. Steadily and methodically, he 
                          reaches for pepper after pepper, popping them into his mouth and chewing
                           deliberately, at the same time wailing uncontrollably.</p>
              <p>"What's wrong, Nasruddin?" his friends wonder, gathering around the extraordinary sight. "What's the matter with you?"</p>
              <p>Tears stream down Nasruddin's face as he sputters an answer. "I'm looking for a sweet one," he gasps.</p>
              <p>It is one of Nasruddin's most endearing qualities that he speaks out of 
                          both sides of his mouth. Like desire itself, teaching stories about 
                          Nasruddin always have two aspects. Nasruddin is a fool, but he is also a
                           wise man. There is an obvious meaning to his actions, containing one 
                          kind of teaching, and a hidden meaning, containing another. The first 
                          meaning jumps out from the story right away. It is the basic message of 
                          both Buddhism and Freudian theory. <strong>Desire never learns; it never wakes 
                          up. Even when eliciting nothing but suffering, it perseveres. Our 
                          indefatigable pursuit of pleasure keeps us doing some awfully strange 
                          things.</strong></p>
              <p>Certainly, Nasruddin is modeling our lives for us: Struggling against 
                          the tide of disappointment, we continue to search for a sweet one. As 
                          his friends must be wondering as they gaze at him incredulously, would 
                          it not be better just to give up? In this version of the story, 
                          Nasruddin is rendering a conventional spiritual teaching. <strong>Our desires 
                          bind us to the wheel of suffering. Even though we know that they bring 
                          us pain, we cannot convince ourselves to relinquish our grip.</strong> As Freud 
                          liked to say, there is an "unbridgeable gap" between desire and 
                          satisfaction, a gap that is responsible for both our civilization and 
                          our discontent.</p>

              <p>Not so confident about the message in the book from which this story is 
              excerpted.  Nevertheless, this story is funny and illustrates well how 
              humans crave, even when this craving keeps landing us in the same place.</p>
