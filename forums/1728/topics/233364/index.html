            <div class='col-md body'>My concern is that your mom may interpret your decision to stay in a hostel as forsaking her... and that this may cause her a lot of hurt.<br><br>Maybe you can still stay with her under the same roof but avoid prolonged contact with her. Eg... Stay in your own room and close the door etc. Might also be useful to constantly remind yourself of your mom's good points instead of continually dwelling on her bad points.<br><br>Suggestion only... every household and every individual and circumstances is different. You might not want to follow my (or anyone else's) advice fully.</div>

Let me share something with you.<br><br>I still remembered the time when my mum and I had the same conflict. She's hot-tempered and would pick at every little thing I do. I shouted at her many times and went into cold wars on and off which lasted couple of months to one whole year. I did not have a hostel to seek refuge and I did all these right at home. My father was at a lost because one is his son and the other his wife. Sometimes during these periods of cold wars, my mum and dad would have long talks in their room into the wee hours at night about why I'm this way. I could even hear her cry sometimes<br><br>It was later on that I realised that the way she behaved is not what she wants. She just wants the best for me and for everyone. I stopped the last cold war slowly by talking to her and opening up my heart to her telling her how I felt. She was still hot-tempered but I guess it was her characteristic and I have to learn to be patience and be in her shoes. Haha, this cultivation of patience took a few years! But I'm glad I did so because now she's no longer hot-tempered and I do not have anymore cold wars with her.<br><br>My 2 cents opinion is that even with cold wars and seek refuge elsewhere will bring no solutions becasue the problem still exist and will come to you again. I do understand it is not easy to be patience but do take small steps at a time. Whenever you get angry with her, just think of all the good things she had done for you and your family. Bring her out for dinner often. Talk heart to heart more with her. If talking to her is difficult, then care for her more. If you are still in hostel, just call home more often just to check if she had her dinner or what she had for dinner. If it is cold at night just remind her to keep warm. If she is sick, remind her to take medication and so on. Small small actions counts. Hope that this will work for you and may you find peace and happiness soon.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cherrio</div>

If she is not you may want to gradually try to promote Buddhist teachings to her. Of course you yourself must be a good example. It is a great merit as well to be able to give the gift of dharma to your parents, or to lead them to Buddhism. It is saying in the sutras that even if you carry your parents on your back for three thousands years (is it 3000 years or what?) you will still be unable to repay the kindness. My dharma teacher told me I had to lead my father to Buddhism in the future... my mother was the one who led me to Buddhism but she was unable to do the same to my father.<br><br>Giving dharma is much better... the Buddha left planet earth for 3 months to Trayatrimsha Heaven to teach the dharma to her mother as well. His father also attained enlightenment and entered into Nirvana. When your parents know the dharma, more people in your family know the dharma, gradually your family will have the Buddhist culture factor, and gradually your mother's behaviors will improve as well.<br><br>In the meantime, you can practise extra mindfulness and metta (loving kindness) practise. You can also reflect on the happy times with your mother and know that whatever afflictive emotions that is appearing now is merely a conditioning of her deep rooted ignorance and afflictions, and she has no control over them. Know every such occassion to be an opportunity to practise metta and patience. To practise the Four Immeasurables. The Dalai Lama said, "We cannot learn real patience and tolerance from a guru or a friend.  They can be practiced only when we come in contact with someone who creates unpleasant experiences.  According to Shantideva, enemies are really good for us as we can learn a lot from them and build our inner strength." But not only enemies, parents are also very good opportunity to practise dharma. And this is universal, you are definitely not alone, we get into these problems most often with parents. We seldom get these problems with friends or strangers.<br><br>Mindfulness is important, in fact mindfulness is the essential practise of Buddhism. All practitioners should strive to maintain mindfulness as far as their ability, and if they fail, they should make a resolution to improve their mindfulness skills. Also, without mindfulness, there can be little achievements/attainments in Buddhism. Without mindfulness skill, the mind easily gets swayed into thoughts and emotions by its environment and the people around him.<br><br>Mindfulness is important because the moment you are mindful, everything is just seen as it is without any mental interpretation and judgement. Even anger and emotion is seen as it is, but the mind is no longer stuck on the content and story. Mindfulness is like a mirror that reflects everything, it rejects none, yet holds onto none. A mirror does not discriminate what to reflect, whether something/someone is good or bad.. so be the mirror-like awareness, be mindful, see things as it is.<br><br>It is also good to contemplate emptiness:<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/lamazopa/anger.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.lamayeshe.com/lamazopa/anger.shtml</a><br><br>Another thing that is very good is what Pabongka Rinpoche explains in Liberation in the Palm of Your Hand: generally speaking one doesn't get angry at the stick that the person used to beat you. The stick itself is used by the person, so therefore there is no point in getting angry at the stick. Similarly, the person's body, speech and mind are completely used by the anger, by the delusion. The person's body, speech and mind become like a slave, completely used as a tool of the anger. The person themself has no freedom at allÂ—no freedom at all. So therefore, since the person has no freedom at all, they should become an object of our compassion. Not only that, one must take responsibility to pacify that person's anger. By whatever means you can find, help the person's mind, pacify the anger; even if there is nothing you can do, pray to Buddha, Dharma and Sangha to pacify the person's mind. </blockquote></div>

Since Diamond Sutra is being discussed nowadays on Skype (it'll be good if you can join the next session's sharing, the topic will be on 'no-form'), I would like to share something simple about it:<br><br><blockquote>In cultivation we seek to let go of the Three Minds [2] and eliminate the Four Forms [3]. At the time of practising this method, the mind of the past, the present and the future does not exist. Furthermore, the ego-form, human-form, sentient being-form and time-form are also non-existent.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">[2] The Three Minds: (i) the past is gone and cannot be grasped. (ii) After this moment, the present becomes past and also cannot be grasped. (iii) The future is not here yet and therefore cannot be grasped too.<br><br>[3] The four forms: Form Â– Characteristics; (i) Everybody has an ego, this is the ego- form. (ii) When we see another person, we arise in our mind the human-form. (iii) When thoughts arise in our mind, we produce the sentient being-form in our mind. (iv) The continuity of these thoughts through time gives rise to the time-form.</span></blockquote><blockquote>I had attended a talk by a venerable who was speaking on gratitude.<br><br>She had mentioned about giving the gift of dharma to her grandmother. She had mentioned about using skillful methods when bringing our kins to the dharma. It is effective tat way.<br><br>Thanks : )</blockquote>Yes skillful means is needed for everything to be successful <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
