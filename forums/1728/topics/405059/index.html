              <h1><a title="How to Practice Anapana &amp;#8211; Pointers" href="http://www.meditationexpert.com/blog/2010/03/how-to-practice-anapana-pointers/">How to Practice 
                  Anapana – Pointers</a></h1>
              <div class="entry_content">
              <p>Shakyamuni Buddha used anapana practice extensively to attain 
                  enlightenment. After his enlightenment, he undertook three retreats in 
                  his life of several months duration each time. During those retreats he 
                  extensively practiced anapana.</p>
              <p>When his son Rahula came to him asking for instruction on how to 
                  attain enlightenment, he taught Rahula anapana. He taught his number one
                   student Mahakasypa (and other students) anapana so he could get the 
                  Tao, too. From all this we know that anapana is one of the most 
                  important methods of cultivation to reach enlightenment. It is a 
                  non-denominational method that can be practiced by every individual. So 
                  if you are a member of any religion, there is no harm in practicing it.</p>
              <p>Anapana is one of the two methods by which Buddhism gained entry into
                   China due to the effectiveness of its cultivation methods. The two 
                  methods that made this possible were anapana and the white skeleton 
                  visualization (body impurity) method. The white skeleton visualization 
                  method helps lay the foundation for transforming the body and its chi 
                  channels for cultivation, and anapana helps you attain enlightenment. 
                  Surprisingly, despite its key importance in cultivating for attainment, a
                   strong anapana tradition never made its way into Tibet which is a pity 
                  because with anapana it is easier to gain enlightenment than most of the
                   esoteric practices people think are high stage in Tibet! You can read 
                  about this on Wikipedia:</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anapanasati</a></p>
              <p>So how do you practice anapana?</p>
              <p>Some people say there are six steps to anapana, such as the Chinese 
                  Tien-tai master Chih-i. You can read about this in THE SIX DHARMA GATES 
                  TO THE SUBLIME that has recently been translated into English after so 
                  many centuries of waiting. Such an important little book and it’s taken 
                  years for someone to translate it. People always pick the wrong things 
                  to translate rather than the really useful stuff. Amazon.com has it 
                  here:</p>
              <p><a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=meditationexp-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1935413015&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr">http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=meditationexp-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1935413015&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_blank&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr</a></p>
              <p>Some people say there are 16 steps to anapana, the last one being to 
                  offer everything away. See the following for details:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.meditationexpert.com/meditation-techniques/m_anapanasati_sutra_breathing_yoga_pranayama.html">http://www.meditationexpert.com/meditation-techniques/m_anapanasati_sutra_breathing_yoga_pranayama.html</a></p>
              <p>In the Anapansati Sutra spoken by Buddha, only a few instructional 
                  steps were originally recorded that have you watching your breath. 
                  Further details were added by later generations of masters, with perhaps
                   the most important addition to this practice understanding being the 
                  “Dharmatara Dhyana Sutra” first translated by Buddhabhadra.</p>
              <p>This sutra, if translated into English today, would explain anapana 
                  and the practice steps and gong-fu of cultivation in a very clear, 
                  non-denominational fashion and would revolutionize most all religions. 
                  It would blow people away, and I’m praying for a translator to take it 
                  on. However, the Dharmataradhyana sutra is very hard to translate, so no
                   one has touched it for about 1000 years. However, it is really the 
                  foundational work for the Zen school, and something people should 
                  translate if given the chance. But as usual, people spend their time 
                  translating almost everything else other than what’s really needed, 
                  helpful and useful and will save the most people … like a book of koans 
                  or another book of Tibetan yoga for instance. Fun stuff, but doesn’t 
                  really help anybody in any major way whereas the foundational practice 
                  method for enlightenment, for Zen, and which never made its way into 
                  even the Tibetan tradition or western schools remains neglected.</p>
              <p>Imagine: Buddha succeeded through anapana, his students succeeded 
                  through anapana, Buddhism made its way into China because of anapana, 
                  the anapana tradition did not make its way into Tibet in a big way 
                  despite its importance, this sutra was key in helping lay the practice 
                  foundation for the entire school of Zen and no one, nobody has 
                  translated it. See what I mean when I tell people over and over again it
                   is very hard to get the real teachings or really important teachings? 
                  And people wonder why the religions don’t have many individuals of high 
                  stage attainment or a clear path. This is just another example of the 
                  bad karma of human beings. But enough of that …</p>
              <p>Let’s turn to practice instructions…</p>
              <p>Now in some explanations of anapana, it says you should focus on the 
                  tip of your nose. Yoga schools often say that as well. But if you 
                  actually focus on the tip of your nose, some people go crazy, so that’s 
                  not the meaning at all. How can you enter samadhi if you are actually 
                  continually focusing on the nose? People came up with this idea because 
                  they did not understand the instructions in the sutra. And if you count 
                  your breatsh and focus on the numbers, all you can ever hope for is to 
                  become a super  accountant….errrrh… crazy accountant.</p>
              <p>The right way to do it is to attain a state so relaxed and 
                  comfortable that you forget your body, like being half awake or half 
                  asleep. In that state you still know when the breath enters or leaves 
                  the nostrils because of awareness. Is there any special effort to this? 
                  No! Try it right now. Close your eyes and witness/watch/observe with 
                  your mind. Do you know when the breath enters or leaves the nose? Of 
                  course. Did you have to make any special effort? No, of course not. When
                   you naturally know the breath enters or leaves the nostrils, that’s the
                   meaning of focusing on the tip of the nose. That’s anapana practice.</p>
              <p>Typically your mind stream is in a state of flow, consciousness is a 
                  scenario that flows like a river, but the breathing is an in and out 
                  event, a discrete event that is separate from what goes on within that 
                  flow. It happens despite the flow or contents of consciousness, so you 
                  can use it as an anchor to drop the attachment to the tableau. When you 
                  concentrate on that breaking phenomena of birth and death, you can 
                  detach from the entire flow visage/scenario/continuum/soup that you are 
                  in without knowing it, and realize awareness itself.</p>
              <p>It is awareness practice that will enable you to eventually separate 
                  from consciousness and cultivate pure awareness. From there you can then
                   proceed farther. I’m not going to go into the details how or why or 
                  what comes next, just the entry way. You have to practice to prove 
                  things for yourself. But here’s one big secret I’m going to share with 
                  you: in many schools they tell you to combine your breath with thought. 
                  You don’t have to make any effort to do this. You don’t have to try to 
                  squeeze the two together or anything like that. Once you know there is 
                  breath going in and out the nostrils, that’s the meaning of breath and 
                  awareness become one. You know it, so thoughts and breath are unified. 
                  Later you attain respiratory cessation and when you know that, they are 
                  unified as well. But initially you should consider  just knowing the in 
                  and out breath as union.</p>
              <p>Eventually with good anapana practice you’ll realize it’s not YOUR 
                  awareness, but just “awareness” that knows or “awareness that functions”
                   because the ego quiets down. That’s real progress. Buddha said that the
                   real mind is everywhere, that awareness is everywhere and not within  
                  the body. Therefore it is really universal awareness powering things. 
                  You think of awareness as yours because of the habit of hearing thoughts
                   in the head, but it is actually just the universal awareness 
                  operating. Thoughts and the chi flow that comes with them are a separate
                   issue.  </p>
              <p>The awareness/presence of the internal dialogue or wandering mind  
                  makes you think you are an ego. It’s due in part to the presence of the 
                  body anad attachment to its energies and perceptions of which 
                  consciousness is one as well. Who said the the thoughts inside of being 
                  an ego are correct? Who? To discover the universal nature of awareness 
                  that everyone shares, and then what lies beyond, you can use anapana as a
                   route. You can also use Kuan Yin’s method of listening to sound to 
                  detach and find the course, but that’s different and we’ll describe 
                  it later. When you match the two you’ll see what everybody is after when
                   they seek enlightenment. Each religion … same thing, same end point if 
                  they target high enough. Some don’t want the ultimate nature but that’s 
                  another story.</p>
              <p>People always think it’s THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL awareness that is 
                  functioning and forget that there is only one awareness in the universe 
                  that shines through all sentient beings, just like there’s one moon in 
                  the sky that is seen in all the puddles below. One moon, 10000 puddles, 
                  10000 moons. Now you knwo the meaning of that Zen story.</p>
              <p>That one original awareness shines through all our seeing, hearing, 
                  thinking, knowing.  it powers it. It is it. Somehow we combine ideas of 
                  being an individual ego with that one awareness shining and get them all
                   mixed up and start clinging to the ego ideas (Buddha described this int
                   he Surangama Sutra), but anapana will help us make things clear. It’s a
                   way to reach the independence of awareness from the scenario that is 
                  being witnessed/experienced in consciounsess. Some schools call this 
                  “detachment”  and now you know the meaning, for detachment is the 
                  process and aarness realizaiton is only the preliminary stage or step of
                   completion. But you have to practice to know that.</p>
              <p>You do not make anything new or create anything in anapana but use 
                  this observation method to basically cut through delusion-ignorance to 
                  see what really is, like using Manjushri’s sword to cut off delusions. 
                  Through anapana you can detach from body and mind, mind in this case 
                  meaning thoughts and consciousness. When you realize how the ordinary 
                  mind really works from self-observation, we call that understanding 
                  wisdom. In western schools we call it “Sophia” whereas in Buddhism we 
                  call it prajna and in other schools discriminative analysis.</p>
              <p>In other words, “you have to know your own mind” means you have to 
                  investigate it. Without investigation (Confucius’ term) you’ll never get
                   the Tao, only samadhi states. That’s how Buddhism is different from all
                   the world’s religions. Buddhism stress prajna wisdom, or understanding 
                  and analysis of what’s going on. All the religions have samadhi — which 
                  produces saints and sages — but if you want answers for everything and 
                  analysis, you must turn to Buddhism. Judaism, Islam, Christianity, even 
                  Taoism and Confuciansim cannot help you. But you have to investigate 
                  which is why even Confucius told you so.</p>
              <p>You don’t need to count to do anapana. Just notice the breath going 
                  in and then out. Once you notice something else you’ve lost that unity. 
                  One other point — for more advanced practitioners. People who practice 
                  anapana often notice there is tightness in the body or pain, hotness, 
                  cold, etc. Just watch it, obsevre it and it will dissolve. Don’t focus 
                  on it or force it.</p>
              <p>Once again, to open up the constricted channels causing this in those
                   areas, just notice the area and let it breathe. Some schools use the 
                  mental issuance of two silent sounds – HA and HUNG (such as in “soha” or
                   “om mani padme hung”) imagined lightly originating from those knots to 
                  help release the channels in those areas so the chi can go through. “Ha”
                   for instance helps you break the tendency to grab and reminds you to 
                  give away, to offer. Mantras work, too. So does letting the area 
                  dissolve into light or slowly pulsing light THROUGH the area without 
                  resistance as you sometimes see in videos of cuttlefish or deep sea 
                  pulsing jellyfish.</p>
              <p>The point is, you shine light or let light shine without force or 
                  obstructions in such a way that the tissues relax. If you use skeleton 
                  visualization on the spot, you just imagine the area is the underlying 
                  skelton for a single fraction of a moment, and then let go. Repeat if 
                  required. Liek shampoos say: wash, rinse, repeat … but only repatif 
                  necessary and not necessarily immediately. The areas open up if you 
                  practice emptiness, so don’t use force.</p>
              <p>Always use the out breath to recite these sounds. The skeleton 
                  visualization is another method to help loosen knotos — in a fraction of
                   ta second you just know you are a skeelton, let go and you are done. 
                  That’s real white skeleton visualization practice, but people ordinarily
                   think they need to use force.</p>
              <p>Just never try to force a knot to open. That’s incorrect Tao school, 
                  yoga and esoteric school practice. “Hung” is a more forceful sound than 
                  “ha” if you must use a little extra strength dissolution method. There 
                  are lots of helpful practice techniques like this at the earliest stages
                   of the path, but don’t turn the method into qi-gong. It’s watching the 
                  breath, not anything else though Mencius called it “cultivating the 
                  breath” because when you watch the breath and let go, you eventually can
                   let go of the body and realize the body of universal awareness with its
                   own type of universal chi. But only a cultivator can do it. The point 
                  is, you can use anapana to help transform your body. It’s pretty darn 
                  easy to do so when you practice anapana correctly.</p>
              <p>If you follow your breathing in and out the tip of the nose, as you 
                  get better at it you can eventually switch the focus to the middle of 
                  the nose, then the upper bridge and then the third eye location of the 
                  Ajna chakra. A really talented practitioner can even do breathing 
                  through all his chakras, but not beginners at the earliest stages of 
                  practice. When you reach this point you can use anapana to rejuvenate 
                  yourself with energy, or even to extend your life for long periods of 
                  time if your chakras and channels are all open. That’s why Buddha, Tsong
                   Khapa and several other great enlightened masters were able to order 
                  several of their students to stay living in this world until the next 
                  Buddha. Many traditions have this. You can transform the entire body to 
                  be able to do this and reach a stage not only of the Arhats where the 
                  body can appear and disappear at will, but even further. When this 
                  happens the entire body and cells fill with chi and you can let go of 
                  the body to enter into dhyana. You don’t hold on to that state but just 
                  fill with chi and let go.</p>
              <p>Know when the air flows through the nostrils. You don’t focus on the 
                  in breath or out breath but just know that the in and out of the air is 
                  there. You can feel it in the nostrils. The whole idea is to forget the 
                  body and detach from the realm of chi/energy associated with the 
                  ordinary panorama of consciousness. You want to start to cultivate 
                  AWARENESS without clinging. Let go of everything. Then you can enter 
                  into the first dhyana. In the first and second dhyana you’ll always be 
                  happy and blissful, you’ll forget about hunger and sex, and will be able
                   to leave the world at will. If you don’t want to be here anymore, with 
                  one thought you can depart.</p>
              <p>In order to better relax and forget the body when you practice 
                  anapana, it helps to first understand some basic principles of 
                  cultivation practice. This is not “theory” but truth. Everything you see
                   right now is your mind. Everything you see, hear, feel, taste, smell is
                   your mind that you are experiencing. PAUSE right now and think about 
                  what you just read. You only ever experience your mind and nothing else.
                   In fact, you can never experience anything else other than your mind.</p>
              <p>What do you think you are experiencing, the world? Ridiculous. You 
                  are only knowing your own mind. You sense the world and those senses are
                   turned into images of consciousness, so you only ever experience mental
                   states, ie. consciousness or mind. Think about it. .. Take your time to
                   pause and think about it as this article will still be here. No reason 
                  to rush ahead.</p>
              <p>Now because the mind is changeable like a dream, it’s unreal and yet 
                  there is an appearance  there. So what appears to be there is both real 
                  and unreal, or let’s say neither real nor unreal. And because you only 
                  ever experience your own mind, that’s why there is no inside or outside,
                   no in or out, no coming or going. You are always within consciousness, 
                  and the cloud of  consciousness that flows is within mind but you think 
                  it’s the external world. WHy? Because you forgot, you didn’t do this 
                  analysis. Your prajna wisdom is not active.</p>
              <p>The real mind that knows always stays, is non-moving, still. The 
                  movie scenes change but the projection screen never changes, is always 
                  empty, still, silent, true and knows. We think consciousness is the 
                  mind, but it is the contents of the mind. The true self that’s real, 
                  dependable, never moves, never comes nor goes, that’s pure, eternal, 
                  blissful is the One fundamental nature that has the power of awareness 
                  as just one of its myriad infinite functions, and so we often call This 
                  the One Mind or true mind of reality. That’s what Zen calls the original
                   nature. You usually call this “God” but It is not a person or being or 
                  state or anything you can call existence or non-existence. You can only 
                  find it through cultivation and by   wisdom analysis, which we call  
                  “prajna.” That means understanding all this. You also need merit to 
                  rediscover your true self which is why I always tell people to do good 
                  deeds and clarify their behavior. Don’t think you can just meditate and 
                  Bingo-Presto you get it. Sorry Charlie.</p>
              <p>As an example using sight, your physical eyes translate visual 
                  signals into consciousness and this is what you experience — 
                  consciousness only, a mental continuum of images — consciousness only. 
                  So you are only ever experiencing your OWN MIND. That being the case, 
                  whatever you see, hear, feel, touch is you. You can now relax during 
                  meditation. You only ever experience YOU. The world you see is YOU that 
                  you are experiencing. Why? Because it’s your mind, your mental images, 
                  your consciousness, you. You only ever experience your own 
                  consciousness, i.e. YOU.</p>
              <p>That being the case, let go. There’s nothing to figure out because 
                  you are that knowing nature and can know, and when you need to figure 
                  out something you will. It will always be you which does this. Who cares
                   what arises — pain, pleasure, emptiness, whatever. It will always be 
                  you. You might not figure out things correctly but the experiencer will 
                  alwasy be YOU. Later, we can talk about no expereince, no experiencer, 
                  no experiencing but right now at this stage stick with this.</p>
              <p>Other people are also always experiencing only themselves. And since 
                  everyone is experiencing the same environment, you will eventually 
                  realize that the underlying foundation of everyone’s consciousness is 
                  the same. There is just an illusion of separation, of individuality that
                   we cling to out of ignorance. Everyone is a Buddha. Everyone is the 
                  same original nature shining awareness. The proof is more robust than 
                  that, but the words should give you some faith in the one original 
                  nature. It is the ultimate source of both matter and mind, but we use 
                  awareness to reach it. You’re not an exception and everyone else is It. 
                  It is ALL It.</p>
              <p>You can never find your original nature through the avenue of science
                   that investigates matter or energy either. Ridiculous. Never. Billions 
                  and trillions of dollars and effort every year … even to know why a 
                  salamander changes color or something like that … but not a drop for 
                  cultivation. Amazing. You must experience all this within your own mind 
                  by tracing awareness back to its empty source and then your body — 
                  composed of hardened chi or energy — will start to transform just as the
                   whole dream plane is transforming. Why hold on to things if that’s the 
                  way it really is? You can’t make an illusion into something real no 
                  matter how hard you can try. You can only drop into pain, suffering,  
                  ignorance and discomfort. You can revolve around in miserable states 
                  forever.</p>
              <p>After you see the Tao, that’s when masters can cultivate the 
                  sambhogakaya, or perfected human body and “beautified” or purified chi 
                  bodies. After they see the Tao by letting go of thoughts, their chi 
                  starts to move because the universe is moving and alwasy trasnfrorming; 
                  thoughts hold the body and it’s chi in artifical shapes we are not. If 
                  you try to cultivate the body ahead of gaining the right view there’s 
                  just no way anyone succeeds. They all think they will, but none do. Same
                   story in Taoism, Tibetan Buddhism, yoga, kaballists, western alchemy, 
                  Shinto, you name it. But let’s not go into that because we want to talk 
                  about anapana which incidentally, does help your transform the body 
                  while helping you reach the Tao. No other method is safer. No other 
                  method is as useful in terms of banishing sickness and extending the 
                  life, as well as opening up chakras, chi channels and so forth. So if 
                  you want enlightenment into the original nature, the original mind then 
                  practice anapana. If you want to transform your karmic body into the 
                  sambhogakaya reward body of purified chi and purified karma, then 
                  practice anapana.</p>
              <p>There’s no inside or outside of the mind or your head. You hear 
                  thoughts in your head and feel the back of the skull when you meditate, 
                  but open your eyes and you see the world. Inside-outside, eyes opened or
                   eyes shut, dreaming or waking states, awake or asleep — it’s all the 
                  same one thing: consciousness.  It’s not light or dark, long or short 
                  but consciousness. Knowing the mind’s  true nature, we call this the 
                  “light of awareness.” It’s pristine, clean, pure, stainless,  immovable,
                   present. It’s all you so there is no difference in terms of the 
                  experience being consciousness or not consciousness. There is always 
                  awareness. The contents of awareness are consciousness, so you can relax
                   because awareness will always be there but the contents will always be 
                  changing, just like in a dream. You cannot hold on to them. To hold on 
                  to them is samadhi. Awareness will alwasy be there so you will neevr be 
                  alone. That’s why we say there is a Buddha everywhere.</p>
              <p>Energy will always be there too. Energy is the substance of 
                  consciousness. Chi and consciousness are linked because chi is energy 
                  and consciousness is appearance. It’s like two sides of a coin in that 
                  both go together. That is, only at the low stages of the path. In terms 
                  of the ultimate, there is no such thing — no such thing as chi or 
                  consciousness. (1) Or you can say the “substance” or “essence” is the 
                  most purified chi, so pure that it’s no longer chi, no longer there, so 
                  that there is nothing any longer. It’s empty of everything including chi
                   and mind and that’s essence. (2) Or you can say that consciousness 
                  becomes so pure, so still, so unmoving, so absent of suffering, marks 
                  and undulations that there is no consciousness any longer. There is 
                  emptiness or void. It’s not a “thing” that’s empty because what is real 
                  is that absence of everything, including what we call emptiness.</p>
              <p>Emptiness that you are thinking about is an image, and it’s not empty
                   space, empty consciousness, or even nothingness. We just call it EMPTY.
                   We use those words to denote negation of anything we might know … any 
                  phenomena, experience, existence in general etc. So some schools say 
                  empty, some say pure consciousness, some say no consciousness at all. 
                  Some use words like awareness, clear light, perception, being, 
                  reality or existence. So the original nature that is right now this very
                   moment is empty yet where we have this world of appearance that seems 
                  to be here but is unreal, so you cannot say it’s non-existence if this 
                  is here, and you cannot say what’s here is real if it doesn’t stay and 
                  is as changeable and effervescent as a dream, which it is but you just 
                  don’t know it. You just think it’s stable because you’ve created that 
                  thought habit in yourself and it’s becomes a set of colored lens that 
                  attached rigid edges onto everything in such a way that you take all 
                  things as individual units. But everything interpenetrates and is 
                  connected to everything else in one big soup, one big jewled net of 
                  Indra … every atoms, cell, electron is like this.</p>
              <p>There are no individual units of anything, just a false perception 
                  of individuality and separate units formed through aeons of wrong habit 
                  energy. meditation is to let go of habit energies through detachment, 
                  and detachment through wisdom, and through wisdom to let go of saamdhi 
                  to reach the One behind. Even to take things as a single agglomeration 
                  is wrong because that “one agglomeration” means you’ve abandoned 
                  emptiness – you’ve got an image of “one” in your mind. The highest Tao 
                  is not emptiness, but neither emptiness nor existence. But don’t cling 
                  to that either, for the duality of knowing and not knowing are both 
                  functions of the original nature. Seems you cannot escape. It’s one big 
                  circle/whole. The two are the same, nirvana and samsara are one and you 
                  get there through the mind, i.e. meditation. That’s the only way. Not 
                  through cultivating the body. But anapana will help you cultivate both 
                  mind a body — a double whammy that saves precious time. If you are old 
                  if will help restore you, too.</p>
              <p>That’s just my way of explaining it, not the real truth of the 
                  matter. I’m skipping facts and details to write a brief article. It’s 
                  just to help you for this method, so don’t take those words as the 
                  ultimate. Just use them to help.</p>
              <p>You just experience different pictures or images in consciousness but
                   it’s still the same one consciousness. The same thing that gives birth 
                  to awarness you had as a child is the same one you have today, but the 
                  flow has changed all along. It is the same thing standing behind 
                  awareness you have right now, isn’t it? THAT – which you think of as YOU
                   – has not changed, has it? It hasn’t aged, has it? The body has aged, 
                  the contents or flow of consciousness has changed, but now you know the 
                  body is not you. The purest empty consciousness that has not aged, that 
                  is the awareness that has not aged, that is the base of awareness that 
                  we call the non-moving empty original nature  and THAT is the real you.</p>
              <p>Sometimes for colloquial sake we call it “consciousness” to be lax, 
                  so you have to be forgiving and always interpret correctly. Many schools
                   don’t get the terminology correct and it confuses people — mind, 
                  consciousness, empty, awareness. Sometimes they mean the same thing and 
                  sometimes not, so it’s confusing. It confuses the hell out of me too but
                   we have to deal with all these different cultures and writings. In 
                  Tibet they just call it clear light, so you have all these different 
                  competing terminologies. The point is, that’s all you ever experience so
                   close your eyes with anapana practice, let go and relax because it will
                   alwasy be there and the contents of consciousness will change so don’t 
                  bother to hold on. You already know everything. You know when there is 
                  an in-breath in the nostrils and when there is an out-breath. Nothing 
                  will change, you’re not missing anything, just let go of thoughts and 
                  notice the breath and detach.</p>
              <p>One day you definitely will be old and gray but that one pure 
                  consciousness will never move or age. Your eyes may not work, your body 
                  may be sick or failing, but those are new scenarios of consciousness. 
                  They are not you. You will still be able to think and know, maybe not 
                  clearly, but mentation (whatever it is, however good or bad, crippled, 
                  crazy, insane, coma-like or perfect) are contents of consciousness. The 
                  knowing comes from the real you. Even if you get Alzheimers or dementia 
                  and lose your mind, there will be knowing of the contents of 
                  consciousness. Who said the contents are all good or will always be good
                   or are not like a broken machine? Those contents — thoughts — are not 
                  you but passing scenery. Good or bad, whatever you expereince — that’s 
                  karma. That’s why you cultivate — to change that fate. Current fate and 
                  future fate. Future fate for this life and future fate for subsequent 
                  lives.</p>
              <p>The different worldview, mind stream, cultural concepts, even access 
                  to cultivation teachings will change next time around. Don’t count on 
                  the fact you’ll be Jewish again, or a girl, or tall, or Chinese, or 
                  Hindu/Muslim, or rich or naturally musically talented or athletic … Most
                   important of all, cultivation teachings that help you surmount all this
                   and become the master and end suffering and increase your ability  to 
                  do things for the world — they might be there and might be denied. 
                  Depends on your merits so hurry to cultivate and make progress and plant
                   the seeds now. You WILL die and get a new life with a different sex, 
                  race, body, worldview, etc. maybe even become an animal, hungry ghost, 
                  heavenly being, whatever.  Then all the pain and suffering and ignorance
                   and yet more mistakes repeat over and over again with changing 
                  consciousness, with pain and suffering until you decide to cultivate and
                   jump out of the control of consciousness by no longer following along. 
                  Only the tableau of consciousness contents changes. Everything is always
                   transforming.</p>
              <p>Forget this New Age idea of evolution: “Each life I’m learning a new 
                  lesson  and getting better.”  Bullshit. There’s no guarantee of that or 
                  anything at all. Look around at the most painful conditions in the world
                   and that’s your future fate at some point in itme. Has to be, 
                  especially if it happens to the world’s majority. No one has good karma 
                  forever. SO JUMP OUT OF IT ENTIRELY. Work to do it now. “Evolution” 
                  lasts forever. It just means “transformation” and who says 
                  transformation is always upwards and for the better? That’s science 
                  fiction nonsense. Transformation is just transformation and better is 
                  because of good deeds and merit.</p>
              <p>Don’t let the last 100 years of human progress fool you. There are 
                  countless worlds, realms, etc. in different states and different 
                  trajectories and who knows what’s around the corner. Did you even 
                  predict this recession? If not, don’t talk wishy-washy 
                  love-the-whole-way round New Age gobbelygook nonsense. You cannot 
                  predict what will happen and where you will be, unless of course you 
                  become a master. Then you can choose. Otherwise, all this New Age idea 
                  of choosing is nonsense. You really think people are that powerful if 
                  they don’t cultivate, attain the dharmakaya and sambhogakaya. I’m 
                  laughing my butt off …. </p>
              <p>Do you want pain  and suffering forever? You only become a master by 
                  finding the ultimate one source (that all religions talk about — there 
                  is only one and it’s the same thing) and then you are free to come and 
                  go as you please, free of pain and suffering, and can help as you wish. 
                  That is the ultimate destination. What are you waiting for?</p>
              <p>There is no inside of you or outside of you. It is all one thing. 
                  There is no inside or outside when you open or close your eyes, or 
                  whether it’s this state or that state you experience. There is only one 
                  thing going on — a consciousness tableau you are experiencing. But where
                   is the “you” if you are not the transforming body or consciousness to 
                  which you identify? All that is being experienced is a limited 
                  consciousness, which is a flowing scenery like a river or waterfall or 
                  torrent or churning ocean. The flow is not real either since it doesn’t 
                  stay. There’s nothing you can grasp on to. But the flow, as a 
                  continuity, is not your true self either. Buddha warned you about that. 
                  The true self is what stays, what remains, what is pure and clear, 
                  blissful, peaceful, eternal, sure. It’s foundational — nothing beyond 
                  it, self-so, universal, nothing besides. All sorts of adjectives like 
                  that which you find in Judaism, Sufism, etc. but no one gets it. They 
                  all want a god, being, person, heaven, etc. but That unmoving one is the
                   eternal forever thing you want to find. It’s always there, still there,
                   always will be but you cover it over hankering after this or that which
                   cannot satisfy you or provide real pleasure and contentment. It’s your 
                  TRUE NATURE, not something you make up. You have to reach THAT ONE in 
                  spiritual cultivation. We call it awakeneing, enlightenment, realization
                   or liberation.</p>
              <p>Think about this, for to realize this is to attain the right view. 
                  Also, what is BEHIND the consciousness you experience? What’s behind it?
                   The non-moving one, that’s what is there. In fact, it’s always been 
                  there.</p>
              <p>When you know that, you can finally relax completely. Awareness is 
                  the knowing of consciousness. Awareness is empty, but the content of it 
                  is consciousness. Awareness is knowing. Consciousness is what can be 
                  known, ie. thoughts, images, discriminations, sensations, feelings, 
                  perceptions, etc. Awareness and consciousness are actually one, like a 
                  mirror and the reflection within it.</p>
              <p>They have to be a unity, there has to be no difference between the 
                  two. The reflection lacks substance and reality but it’s there. So who 
                  says that there is nothing or annihilation? When the mirror is empty we 
                  say extinction but there is the potential for an image or knowing that’s
                   just as valid. The image, or consciousness, doesn’t seem real but it’s 
                  real for as long as it lasts which is a moment so brief you must say 
                  it’s non-existent. Actually, nothing is really happening. So you can 
                  relax because there will always be knowing and contents, i.e. chi or 
                  energy and the appearance of  mind. But they’re empty, so why fret so 
                  much? Just let go and deal with whatever comes up, and create new good 
                  karma in its stead.</p>
              <p>So what is the original nature? Everything you read about in the 
                  Heart Sutra are the contents of consciousness that are not IT. The five 
                  skandhas, your eyes, ears, nose, etc. the linked chain of existence, the
                   Four Noble truths, prajna wisdom understanding, and so on. Even when 
                  asleep and you “experience nothing,” you wake up and the continuity of 
                  the world is there again. You cannot say you didn’t exist, can you? 
                  There was continuity during the time (waking) clear consciousness seemed
                   to be absent. Awareness wasn’t absent. It just didn’t have content, it 
                  didn’t have an object you were aware of. So even with the “samadhi of 
                  nothingness” in the Formless Realm there is still a foundational state 
                  you are not aware of while in that samadhi absorption, and that’s what 
                  you are seeking.</p>
              <p>Awareness is a function of the original nature. It’s always there and
                   always will be there. It’s simply that the content of awareness — the 
                  panorama or movie show — always changes and flows like a river. It’s 
                  empty, effervescent, all one thing so nothing is independent. It’s all 
                  one show of perfect interdependence. But it’s not one thing because it’s
                   empty of reality, so how can we say a thing is there? Even Vedanta says
                   all this — go read Ramana Maharshi’s  ”Be As You Are “to find out. All 
                  the sages tell you the same thing. Get off this Bible thing about a 
                  chosen people, we’re saved, someone else has saved us, there is a 
                  prophecy, etc. Sorry, the universe goes on forever, no one is chosen, 
                  you save yourself and it’s all due to cultivation. Otherwise up and down
                   you go again, bobbing like this through endless states of consciousness
                   transformation forever. The pot of soup never stops boiling, it’s 
                  always simmering, it’s always being stireed.</p>
              <p>Consciousness could be a visage of the ordinary world, a dream world,
                   deep dreamless sleep, any of the samadhi states. They are not the Tao 
                  but things that occupy consciousness, or occupy awareness, however you 
                  wish to word it. These are all passing dream states of consciousness 
                  that awareness knows. They change, nothing stays still, you cannot hold 
                  on to anything, you cannot gain anything in all this. Behind the 
                  awareness is something pure, still, unmoving, eternal, immaculate. 
                  That’s the original nature. You think you’re doing something but you’re 
                  not — it’s just consciousness moving. How to realize this? Anapana. 
                  Relax the body, let go of consciousness by knowing the breathing. The 
                  rest will happen slowly in time.</p>
              <p>So take seeing as an example. When you close your eyes, what you see 
                  is darkness. Darkness means black — it’s not the absence of light but a 
                  color. You are always seeing colors because AWARENESS sees colors, not 
                  light enables you to see, and this means you are always seeing light. 
                  All you are ever seeing is colors, or we can say “light” if we want. 
                  That’s “seeing the light” cultivation practice (i.e. Mahakasyapa) when 
                  you realize that and stay in that state without clinging.</p>
              <p>You’ll never be without light in the universe no matter where you go —
                   the visage of what you see is just  colors that change and we attach 
                  names and labels to parts of the scenario. So go to heaven, go to the 
                  deepest darkest hells and you will never be alone. There will always be 
                  light, there will always be energy or chi so we say there is a Buddha 
                  everywhere. This is why  the Bible says “God is light”. Wow, they even 
                  have it in there. You can’t get rid of it so you can just relax and let 
                  go.</p>
              <p>With light comes chi, or energy. Chi and light are synonymous. If 
                  there is light there is chi and if there is chi there is light. Wherever
                   you go in the universe the mind of awareness is always experiencing 
                  light and chi. Now that you know that, you can relax in meditation 
                  knowing you’re not going anywhere and will never be alone. It’s just a 
                  scenario of consciousness that changes — moving light and energy. Sound,
                   such as used in Kuan Yin’s method of tracing sound back to its source, 
                  is energy, too. The real YOU never moves. The scenery, however, all just
                   passes by. You can’t get rid of it so just relax. Don’t hold on to it. 
                  It’s changing anyway, so why bother? Pain, pleasure, riches, fame, 
                  whatever … they just flow in front of it like an endless river. There’s 
                  nothing you can grab onto and hold as real, permanent, lasting, real.</p>
              <p>If you can do this and forget the body which is just light and chi, 
                  and therefore ignore the body sensations and things you see while 
                  practicing anapana, you can enter the first dhyana. Throw all that stuff
                   away and let go of it because it’s not the real you, it’s an illusion 
                  that cannot last, it’s not important during your practice session 
                  anyway. You don’t need to understand with forced thinking, you just know
                   so let things go naturally. You will focus on the breath which is quasi
                   independent of the rest of the flowing tableau with an independent beat
                   of birth and death, birth and death, in and out, birth and death. It’s 
                  quasi independent because breathing always happens. It gives you a way 
                  to jump out, something you can focus on within that flow because of its 
                  regularity.</p>
              <p>Breathing has to go in and out, so it is a way of realizing birth and
                   death and breaking free of following thoughts rather than the sleepy, 
                  dreamy way of going along with consciousness we normally get accustomed 
                  to. If awareness can detach from the normal tableau because of the 
                  knowing of breathing, you can enter into samadhi. Breathing  seems a bit
                   independent because your body just does it rhythmically, and it is 
                  involved with the chi of your body as well. You can use that to your 
                  advantage to let go and realize the true nature of awareness in that it 
                  is separate, independent of consciousness and clear and empty. But you 
                  have to come to that realization yourself. Just watch the in and out 
                  breath, become filled with chi, ignore all that, and see what happens. 
                  Your mind is clear so KNOWING is separate from the chi of breathing. 
                  This means that thoughts come and go, come in and then go out like birth
                   and death, Only knowing never moves. Remember that: only knowing never 
                  moves. So with this method you can realize prajna emptiness.</p>
              <p>Knowing is so clear. Thoughts are temporary things in the 
                  mind/consciousness that arise and depart, but the habit pattern of 
                  clinging to them and covering over the foundational mind of who you are,
                   what you are is too old to break away from without cultivation 
                  practice. Everything you experience in the mind — the whole mental 
                  continuum of the five skandhas of feelings, appearances, sounds, colors,
                   etc. are THOUGHTS, images, marks, names and labels. Behind them your 
                  true mind is always there. You don’t have to create it, but just 
                  discover it once again but letting go of ignorance, ignorant view, and 
                  detaching from thoughts that stain it. It is empty from the start. All 
                  sentient beings have it from the lowliest worm or microbe to the biggest
                   whale. Humans, ghosts, protect Gods, animals, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas —
                   they are all It. That’s why we say all are Buddhas. It’s all the same 
                  thing, the same one thing, so what are you religions fighting over? 
                  Certainly not the Tao.  Must be something else. I see no reason for a 
                  jihad of killing or “you must follow my master’s way.” Let everything go
                   and you can realize the original nature which is what you are. The 
                  jihad is in your own mind, not something you do to someone else. So why 
                  be afraid to let go and find out what you are since this is what you 
                  are. The only thing that happens is that illusions and ignorance depart,
                   false thinking disappears, mistakes of perception are not made. All the
                   sages of every school tell you the result is peaceful, blissful, 
                  “Union,” and if you want to be active and help the world, this is the 
                  only true way — for reasons I will not go into.</p>
              <p>Just use this understanding to attain samadhi and let go. Don’t argue
                   with it or find fault or punch holes in what I said. You want samadhi? 
                  Go along with the ride without too much analysis and practice. Practice,
                   practice, practice anapana. Forget the body knowing you are never 
                  missing anything and will never be alone. Awareness will always be 
                  there, the true self will always be there, contents will always be there
                   but will simply be changing as they always do. Nothing has changed 
                  except your understanding, your knowing of this has transpired which we 
                  call “prajna wisdom” or transcendental understanding. Now you can let go
                   and be blissful and free, free of suffering and sorrow and tremendously
                   helpful to other sentient beings.</p>
              <p>Whether what I said is right or wrong, don’t argue. Just use this 
                  door as an entryway into dhyana. Awareness can learn to separate from 
                  the visage of consciousness – the chi feelings in the body and colors 
                  you see – and be pure by itself.</p>
              <p>Start by practiing anapana. If you can do this and forget the body — 
                  which is just light or chi — you can enter into the first dhyana. Just 
                  use the technique to attain samadhi by letting go. Forget the body 
                  knowing you are the mind, not the bodynor images, colors, lights, 
                  appearances you see. Forget the chi (energy) you feel as your body or as
                   movement because chi is alwasy there changing, rolling, trasnforming 
                  and is not you either. It’s empty. It’s empty of fixity. It’s empty of 
                  non-clinging. Just let go, dioscard everything and know the in breath 
                  and out breath through the nostrils. Then the chakras will open but 
                  forget this and enter into samadhi.</p>
              <p>If you need more instructions, see the sutra articles on anapana and 
                  research Rahula’s instructions ont he internet, or the 100 word 
                  inscription in Taoism. The world is like a dream so treat it that way 
                  and don’t use force. This body is not you, it’s not yours. It’s a waste 
                  of life if you don’t practice and if you do practice that you don’t 
                  realize your true self. Don’t think that these instructions are so east 
                  to come by or that just by reading them youwill understand them. You 
                  must practice to truly understand and master a technique. You must prove
                   everything in spiritual cultivation and not settle for dogma, no matter
                   what school, path or religion.</p>
