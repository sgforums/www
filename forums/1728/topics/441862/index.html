He hardly donate to charity. One day, he went for a hair cut. His hairdresser said to him " You must be a very rich man." The rich man was very happy to hear that. The hair dresser carried on to tell the rich man that no matter how rich he was, he was only $3000 richer than him.<br><br>The rich man was very angry and asked why the hair dresser said that. The hair dresser asked him to cool down and asked him how much was the cheapest and the most expensive coffin. The rich man said the cheapest was about $1000 and the most expensive was about $4000. The hair dresser said he was poor so most likely he would be lying in the cheapest coffin which was $1000 and the rich man would be lying in the most expensive coffin which was $4000. The last property the rich man would have was only $3000 more than the hair dresser.</p>
              <p>The rich man was suddenly enlightened and began to donate.  </p>

              <p>nowadays the trend is to invest in a cemetary urn place in those modern urn building.</p>
              <p>Taiwan has people who buy and sell the urn place for a quick profit and one urn's place is being "fried" until very high .  The Taiwan mafia has a hand in it.  They are now going into the dead people's business that can also bring them lotsa of money.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, the Nirvana Memorium already have some people doing this type of trade ( like stock market), they buy a row of urn's place at the original price and then sell them high for a profit.  The guy that was shown on TV doing that is the drum player of True Buddha School. He is a malaysian and he is starting this type of "dead people" business in Singapore.  Making use of the dead.  He is a malaysian so he doesn't feel guilty of using the dead in Singapore to make his first pot of gold.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This guy only studied till High School in Malaysia and only working as a technician in Singapore. Where did he get the sum of money to invest in a row of urns? He is only 31, does he need a row of urns? He only buy for investment and i am not surprised if he has a mountain behind him who gives him the money to fry the value of the urns place high.  This True buddha School disciple name is Lam Yew Sin, his brother Lam Yew Kin is a staff of Nirvana Memorium.  With his brother working inside, Lam Yew Sin can get the best row of urns at the cheapest price, then he sold them off at a very high price. We Singaporeans become suckers.</p>
              <p>The Nirvana Memorium is actually owned by Taiwanese and i am not surprised if the Taiwan mafia has a hand in it.</p>
              <p>They are coming to Singapore to spoil the market of Singaporeans " resting place for the death "and earning high Singapore money, laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
              <p>They know Singapore is short of land and sooner or later, we all need a urn's place, so the Taiwanese and the Malaysians start first in our country. Fried the urn's place value high and it won't drop in the future.</p>
              <p>We are being made use of by these people from other countries.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Actually, one can just collect abit of the powder ash ( a small glass of container) after cremation and offered at home. Or scatter the ash at the monastery place. And there are also many public columbariums around that offered affordable price. If you desire for buddhaland, why bother about your rottening body...in fact, for the wealthy, it's not a bad idea to invest their ash at comforting place that having chanting to transfer merit over to them....one can't bring over their wealth, but it can be converted to blessing....:D</p></div>

              <p>The koreans are now having this trend of converting their loved ones ashes to colourful beads and bring them around. They have invented this new technology of doing it.</p>
              <p>I hope someone will bring it into Singapore.  So instead of buying very highly "traded" urn's place, we can convert the ashes to colourful beads.  Compact, odourless, and easy to carry around with us.</p>
