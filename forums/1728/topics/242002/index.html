            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday I was searching on google about 'no coming no going' (the other time I was searching on 'no doer' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) and come across an article from Zen Master Chinul. I think I like the way the website present little stories and conversations in journals... and found many jewels that I think is worth sharing here.<br><br>Here's one to start with... the first journal on the website. I will post subsequent journals as well.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading1.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading1.asp</a><br><br>Kuei-shan Ling-yu (771-853)<br><br>There have been many characters in Zen, both teachers and students, and stories have served as excellent vehicles for portraying some of the essence of Zen in recounting their relationships. We never seem to tire of learning through the medium of stories. This week we open with Kuei-shan Ling-yu.<br><br>Hsiang-yen was originally a novice under Pai-chang; he was exceptionally brilliant and quick witted, strong in analytical power and logical acumen, and versed in the scriptures. But he was not initiated into ChÂ’an (Zen). At the death of Pai-chang, he made himself a disciple of Pai-changÂ’s senior disciple Kuei-shan. Kuei-shan said to him, "I hear that when you were with our late Master Pai-chang, you could give ten answers to a single questionÂ…..This shows your remarkable intelligence and ingenuity, which enables you to understand ideas and unfold their consequences. Now the question of birth and death is the most fundamental of all. Try to tell me something about your state before you were born of your parents."<br><br>This question plunged his mind into a thick fog. He did not even know what to think. Returning to his room, he made a feverish search in all the books that he had read for something appropriate to say in answer to the question; but he could not find a single sentence that could be used.<br><br>So he sighed to himself, saying, "As the saying goes, a painted cake satisfies not the hunger." After that, he pressed his master time and time again to break the secret to him by speaking explicitly. Every time Kuei-shan said, "If I should expound it explicitly to you, in future you will reproach me for it. Anyway, whatever I speak still belongs to me, and has nothing to do with you."<br><br>In his despair, Hsiang-yen burnt all his books, saying, "In this life I will not study Buddha dharma any more. Let me become a mendicant monk ever on the move from one place to another." He took leave of his master weeping. His wandering brought him to the ruins of a temple in Nan-yang associated with the memory of Master Hui-chung. There he made his temporary abode.<br><br>One day as he was mowing and cutting the grass and trees, he tossed at random a piece of broken tile, which happened to hit a bamboo tree, causing it to emit a crisp sound. Startled by the unexpected sound, he was suddenly awakened to his true self not born with his birth. Returning to his cell, he bathed himself and lit incense to pay his long-distance obeisance to Kuei-shan, saying, "O Venerable Abbot, how great is your compassion! I am grateful to you more than to my parents. If you had broken the secret to me then, how could I have experienced the wonderful event of today?"<br><br>I sometimes wonder how many promising talents have been nipped in the bud, simply because their master had overdone their explanation of a subject, whose mastery depends by its very nature upon an experiential realization. Great as Kuei-shan was in what he expressed, he was greater in what he left unsaid.<br><br>------------------------<br><br>The following passage taken from one of his talks speaks of the style and thought of Kuei-shan:<br><br>Let each and every one of you turn the light inwards and not try to memorize my words.... The one thing essential now is to recollect your mind to attain the fundamental, the very root of your being. Having arrived at the root, you need have no worry about the accidentals.<br><br>- from The Golden Age of Zen edited by John Chwan-Hwa Wu<br><br>-----------------------------------<br><br>Too often in practice it seems, like Hsiang-yen, we are just after more answers, as if getting the "right" answer to that "big" question will straighten out everything. Yet, staying with a question which has the power to stop the mind can transform a life. Real questioning is like polishing a gem, removing the "extra." The answer to the question is the polishing, the dropping off of the extra. What about a wordless question whose purpose is simply to reverse the outward flow of the mind? Think about it... and question well.<br><br>.In Peace,<br>The Monkess</div>

It is not green nor yellow, and has neither form nor appearance. It does not belong to the categories of things which exist or do not exist, nor can it be thought of in terms of new or old. It is neither long nor short, big nor small, for it transcends all limits, measures, names, traces and comparisons. It is that which you see before youÂ—begin to reason about it, and you at once fall into error. It is like the boundless void which cannot be fathomed or measured.<br><br>The One Mind alone is the Buddha, and there is no distinction between the Buddha and sentient things, but that sentient beings are attached to forms and so seek externally for Buddhahood. By their very seeking they lose it, for that is using the Buddha to seek for the Buddha and using mind to grasp Mind. Even though they do their utmost for a full aeon, they will not be able to attain it.<br><br>They do not know that, if they put a stop to conceptual thought and forget their anxiety, the Buddha will appear before them, for this Mind is the Buddha and the Buddha is all living beings. It is not the less for being manifested in ordinary beings, nor is it greater for being manifested in the Buddhas.<br><br>As to performing the six paramitas and vast numbers of similar practices, or gaining merits as countless as the sands of the Ganges, since you are fundamentally complete in every respect, you should not try to supplement that perfection by such meaningless practices. When there is occasion for them, perform them; and, when the occasion is passed, remain quiescent.<br><br>If you are not absolutely convinced that the Mind is the Buddha, and if you are attached to forms, practices and meritorious performances, your way of thinking is false and quite incompatible with the Way.<br><br>The Mind is the Buddha, nor are there any other Buddhas or any other mind. It is bright and spotless as the void, having no form or appearance whatever. To make use of your minds to think conceptually is to leave the substance and attach yourselves to form. The Ever-Existent Buddha is not a Buddha of form or attachment.<br><br>To practise the six paramitas and a myriad similar practices with the intention of becoming a Buddha thereby is to advance by stages. Only awake to the One Mind, and there is nothing whatsoever to be attained. This is the real Buddha. The Buddha and all sentient beings are One Mind and nothing else.<br><br>- from The Zen Teaching of Huang Po On the Transmission of Mind Translated by John Blofeld<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Huang-po is recounting for his students an ultimate state of awareness and being. How does this apply to those of us who "practice" here and now?<br><br>ThereÂ’s practice and thereÂ’s Practice. One seems to keep us enmired in the world of relativity and gaining mind, levels, and stages. If not careful we can become lost in initiations and rituals that become repetitive and dull over time and fail to deliver that essence we long for. First we must examine our own intent in practice. Gaining mind is subtle to see in oneself, but all of us have experienced this with practice.<br><br>To really enter the realm of Practice we have to find a way to do without doing, to do without the feeling of doing and to discover a kind of pure intent which allows us to throw ourselves into practice simply for the joy of participation in the whole and not to get just another understanding.<br><br>True practice is a way for returning to who we are before our sense of limitation arises; to return to that state before the beginning, before gaining mind confuses everything. Huang-po is reminding his students about practices and Practice Â– One Mind.<br><br>What is your practice based on? Examine for yourself your intent in practice. Pause now and return to the before-mind, the blue sky mind. Look out from the window of the mind. Discover Practice before beginning to practice.<br><br>Dedicated to a life of Practice,<br>The Monkess</div>

The empty, illusory body is the very body of the Dharma. When the Dharma-body is realized, thereÂ’s nothing at all. The original nature of all things is innately Buddha.<br><br>Elements of the self come and go like clouds, without purpose. Greed, hate, and delusion appear and disappear like ocean foam.<br><br>When you reach the heart of reality, you find neither self nor other, and even the worst kind of karma dissolves at once. The instant you awaken to the ChÂ’an of the Tathagata, all practices and means of liberation are perfected at once.<br><br>In lifeÂ’s dream, passing from heaven to hell, each realm seems real. But with awakening, the whole cosmos is completely empty.<br><br>Dust builds up on a mind-mirror not cleaned. With one decisive stroke now, lay the glass bare! Who is it that has no thought? Who is it thatÂ’s unborn? ItÂ’s as if really not born, yet not unborn either.<br><br>Going straight to the root is the hallmark of the Buddha; picking up leaves and collecting branches is no use at all. Most people donÂ’t know the pearl that answers all wishes, the great pearl found in the treasurehouse of the Tathagata.<br><br>DonÂ’t seek the true and donÂ’t reject the false; realize the emptiness and formlessness of both. The mind-mirror shines brilliantly, without obstruction, its light reaching worlds as countless as sands of the Ganges.<br><br>I reveal the bliss-bestowing pearl to you now, and all who take this to heart will come to accord: When you see clearly, thereÂ’s nothing at all; there are no people, there are no Buddhas.<br><br>The myriad worlds are like so much foam on the sea, old worthies and great sages merely flashes of lightning.<br><br>- Yung-chia (d. 713)<br><br>-------------------<br><br>Yung-chia Hsuan-chueh is known in the annals of ChÂ’an as the Master Who Spent One Night with the Ancestor. The Ancestor in question is Hui-neng. The famous Song of Realizing the Way alludes to this legendary meeting of minds.<br><br>Though the author of the poem refers to himself as a mountain monk and sings the praises of hermit life, the Yung-chia of record was hardly a reclusive or obscure figure. He attracted enough notice during his lifetime to draw numerous disciples, and after his death, the imperial court honored him with the title Master of Formlessness.<br><br>Along with traces of Taoism, the Song of Realizing the Way contains numerous references to the teachings, metaphors, and mythology of Indian Buddhism. All the same, it is unmistakably a ChÂ’an poem, laying out many of the schoolÂ’s central themes, including the futility of conceptual study as a means to true understanding, the necessity of realization, its suddenness and availability to all, and the nature and importance of emptiness and not-knowing.<br><br>- from The Roaring Stream; A New Zen Reader edited by Nelson Foster and Jack Shoemaker<br><br>--------------------<br><br>The above is excerpted from the entirety of the poem to convey the flavor and depth of the writing. Through writing such as this we come to love the way of the sages. Through our pure intent and commitment we follow the way of the sages.<br><br>With gratitude,<br>The Monkess<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading22.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading22.asp</a><br><br><strong>Secrets of Cultivating the Mind</strong><br><br>- Son Master Chinul<br><br>If you want to avoid going around in circles, nothing compares to seeking Buddhahood. If you want to seek Buddhahood, Buddha is mind. Need mind be sought afar? It is not apart from the body.<br><br>The material body is temporal, having birth and death. The real mind is like space, unending and unchanging. Thus it is said, "When the physical body decays and dissolves back into fire and air, one thing remains aware, encompassing the universe."<br><br>Unfortunately, people today have been confused for a long time. They do not know that their own mind is the real Buddha. They do not know that their own essence is the real Dharma. Wishing to seek Dharma, they attribute it to remote sages; wishing to seek Buddhahood, they do not observe their own mind.<br><br>If you say that there is Buddha outside the mind, and there is Dharma outside of essence, and want to seek the Way of Buddhahood while clinging tightly to these feelings, even if you spend ages burning your body, branding your arms, breaking your bones and taking out the marrow, wounding yourself and copying scriptures in your own blood, standing for long periods of time without sitting down, eating only once a day, reading the whole canon and cultivating various austere practices, it will be like steaming sand to produce cooked rice; it will only increase your own fatigue.<br><br>Just know your own mind and you will grasp countless teachings and infinite subtle meanings without even seeking. That is why the World Honored One said, "Observing all sentient beings, I see they are fully endowed with the knowledge and virtues of Buddhas." He also said, "All living beings, and all sorts of illusory events, are all born in the completely awake subtle mind of those who realize suchness."<br><br>So we know that there is no Buddhahood to attain apart from this mind. The Realized Ones of the past were just people who understood the mind, and the saints and sages of the present are people who cultivate the mind; students of the future should rely on this principle.<br><br>People who practice the Way should not seek externally. The essence of mind has no defilement; it is originally complete and perfect of itself. Just detach from illusory objects, and it is enlightened to suchness as is.<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> If Buddha-nature is presently in our bodies, it is not apart from ordinary people. Then why do we not perceive Buddha-nature now?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> It is in your body, but you do not perceive it yourself. At all times you know when you are hungry, you know when you are thirsty, you know when you are cold, you know when you are hot; sometimes you get angry, sometimes you are joyful-ultimately, what is it that does all this?<br><br>Now then, the material body is a compound of four elements: earth, water, fire, and air. Their substance is insentient; how can they perceive or cognize? That which can perceive and cognize has to be your Buddha- nature.<br><br>This is why Linji said, "The four gross elements cannot expound the Teaching or listen to the Teaching. Space cannot expound the Teaching or listen to the Teaching. Only the solitary light clearly before you, that which has no form, can expound the Teaching or listen to the Teaching."<br><br>What he called that which has no form is the stamp of the truth of all Buddhas, and it is your original mind. So the Buddha-nature is presently in your body; what need is there to seek outside?<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> You say that the two categories of sudden enlightenment and gradual practice are guidelines followed by all sages. If enlightenment is sudden enlightenment, what is the need for gradual practice? If practice is gradual practice, why speak of sudden enlightenment? Please explain the meanings of sudden and gradual further, to eliminate doubts.<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> As for sudden enlightenment, as long as ordinary people are deluded, they think their bodies are material conglomerates and their minds are random thoughts. They do not know that inherent essence is the true body of reality. They do not know that their own open awareness is the real Buddha. Seeking Buddha outside of mind, they run randomly from one impulse to another.<br><br>If a real teacher points out a way of entry for you, and for a single instant you turn your attention around, you see your own original essence. This essence originally has no afflictions; uncontaminated wisdom is inherently complete in it. Then you are no different from the buddhas; thus it is called sudden enlightenment.<br><br>As for gradual practice, having suddenly realized fundamental essence, no different from Buddha, beginningless mental habits are hard to get rid of all at once. Therefore one cultivates practice based on enlightenment, gradually cultivating the attainment to perfection, nurturing the embryo of sagehood to maturity. Eventually, after a long time, once becomes a sage; therefore it is called gradual practice. It is like an infant, which has all the normal faculties at birth, but as yet undeveloped; only with the passage of years does it become an adult.<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> By what expedient means can we turn our minds around instantly to realize our inherent essence?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> It is just your own mind; what further expedient means would you apply? If you apply expedient means to go on to seek intellectual understanding, this is like wanting to see your own eyes because you think you have no eyes if you cannot see them. As long as you have not lost them, that is called seeing eyes. If you have no more desire to see, does that mean you imagine you are not seeing? So it is also with one's own open awareness. Since it is one's own mind, how can one yet seek to see it? If you seek understanding, then you do not understand it. Just know that which does not understand; this is seeing essence.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>(continued)<br><br><strong>Question:</strong> In terms of my present state, what is the mind of open awareness of silence and emptiness?<br><br><strong>Answer:</strong> What enables you to ask me this question is your mind of open awareness of emptiness and silence; why do you still seek outside instead of looking within? I will now point directly to the original mind in you, to enable you to awaken; you should clear your mind to listen to what I say.<br><br>Throughout the twenty-four hours of the day, you operate and act in all sorts of ways, seeing and hearing, laughing and talking, raging and rejoicing, affirming and denying: now tell me, ultimately who is it that can operate and act in this way?<br><br>If you say it is the physical body operating, then why is it that when people's lives have just ended and their bodies have not yet decomposed at all, their eyes cannot see, their ears cannot hear, their noses cannot smell, their tongues cannot talk, their bodies do not move, their hands do not grip, their feet do not step? So we know that what can see, hear, and act must be your basic mind, not your physical body.<br><br>Indeed, the gross elements of this physical body are inherently empty, like images in a mirror, like the moon reflected in water; how can they be capable of perfectly clear and constant awareness, thoroughly lucid, sensitive and effective, with countless subtle functions? Thus it is said, "Spiritual powers and subtle functions - drawing water and hauling wood."<br><br>But there are many ways of access to the principle. I will point out one entryway, by which you can return to the source. Do you hear the cawing of the crows and the chattering of the jays?<br><br><strong>Student:</strong> I hear them.<br><br><strong>Master:</strong> Now turn around and listen to your hearing essence; are there still so many sounds in it?<br><br><strong>Student:</strong> When I get here, all sounds and all discriminations are ungraspable.<br><br><strong>Master:</strong> Marvelous, marvelous! This is the Sound Seer's gateway into the principle. Now let me ask you further: You say then when you get here all sounds and all discriminations are totally ungraspable. Since they cannot be grasped, does that not mean that there is empty space at such as time?<br><br><strong>Student:</strong> Originally not empty, it is clearly not obscure.<br><br><strong>Master:</strong> What is the substance that is not empty?<br><br><strong>Student:</strong> It has not form; there is no way to express it in words.<br><br><strong>Master:</strong> This is the life of the Buddhas and Zen masters; do not doubt anymore. Since it has no form, could it have size? Since it has no size, could it have bounds? Because it has no bounds, it has no inside or outside. Having no inside or outside, it has no far or near. With no far or near, there is no there or here. Since there is no there or here, there is no coming or going. Because there is no going or coming, there is no birth or death. Having no birth or death, it has no past or present. With no past or present, there is no delusion or enlightenment....<br><br>Those who realize this and keep to it sit in one suchness and are immutably liberated. Those who stray from this and turn away from it traverse the six courses and go round and round for eternity. Therefore it is said that straying from the One Mind to traverse the six courses is "departure," or "disturbance," while awakening to the realm of reality and returning to the One Mind is "arrival," or "tranquility." * Secrets of Cultivating the Mind was composed by Chinul (1158 - 1210). Ordained as a monk at eight, Chinul had no teacher. His first awakening occurred as he read a Chan Buddhist classic when he was 25 years old. After that Chinul went into seclusion in the mountains. Eventually Chinul began to instruct others and this manual of meditation clearly defines and contrasts the principles and methods of sudden and gradual enlightenment.<br><br>Son Master Chinul<br><br>- taken from Minding Mind - A Course in Basic Meditation, edited and translated by Thomas Cleary (1995)<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I would agree with Chinul in his assessment that people are very confused in his time as well as today about practice, and make the Way a perplexing search at times. Chinul manages in this translation to give a direct glimpse into original mind. If you can enter into the reading, you can feel the questions of the student and perhaps experience first hand the seeing into that which is, uncomplicated and always so.<br><br>*<br><br>We ask the same kinds of questions today as in Chinul's time:<br><br>Question: What is beholding the luminosity of the Mind?<br><br>Answer: If your mind is very quiet, you will see the very energy which is moving, which allows you to be an animate being. It is your awareness. It is to actually fold back into your awareness. It is to be your awareness. It is to be that luminosity. Beholding the luminosity of your own mind is meditation. As you go deeper you see more; you spend more time with it and you see more.<br><br>Continuing along the Way,<br>The Monkess</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading0611.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading0611.asp</a><br><br><strong>From the Record of Things Heard</strong><br><br>Dogen  (1200-1253)<br><br><img src="http://www.buddhanet.net/lineart/zen/images/c-dogen.jpg"><br><br>One day a student asked: Â“I have spent months and years in earnest study, but I have yet to gain enlightenment. Many of the old masters say that the Way does not depend on intelligence and cleverness, and that there is no need for knowledge and talent. As I understand it, even though my capacity is inferior, I need not feel badly for myself. Are there not any old sayings or cautionary words that I should know about?Â”<br><br>Dogen replied: Â“Yes, there are. True study of the Way does not rely on knowledge and genius or cleverness and brilliance. Because study has no use for wide learning and high intelligence, even those with inferior capacities can participate. True study of the Way is an easy thing.<br><br>Even in the monasteries of China, only one or two out of several hundred, or even a thousand, disciples under a great ChÂ’an master actually gained true enlightenment. Therefore, old sayings and cautionary words are needed. As I see it now, it is a matter of gaining the desire to practice. A person who gives rise to a real desire and puts his utmost efforts into study will surely gain enlightenment. Essentially, one must devote all attention to this effort and enter into practice with all due speed. More specifically, the following points must be kept in mind:<br><br>Â“In the first place, there must be a keen and sincere desire to seek the Way. For example, someone who wishes to steal a precious jewel, to attack a formidable enemy, or to make the acquaintance of a beautiful woman must, at all times, watch intently for the opportunity, adjusting to changing events and shifting circumstances. Anything sought for with such intensity will surely be gained. If the desire to search for the Way becomes as intense as this, whether you concentrate on doing zazen alone, investigate a koan by an old master, interview a Zen teacher, or practice with sincere devotion, you will succeed no matter how high you must shoot or no matter how deep you must plumb.<br><br>Â“Without arousing this wholehearted will for the Buddha Way, how can anyone succeed in this most important task of cutting the endless round of birth and death? Those who have this drive, even if they have little knowledge or are of inferior capacity, even if they are stupid or evil, will without fail gain enlightenment.<br><br>Â“Next, to arouse such a mind, one must be deeply aware of the impermanence of the world. This realization is not achieved by some temporary method of contemplation. It is not creating something out of nothing and then thinking about it. Impermanence is a fact before our eyes. Do not wait for the teachings from others, the words of the scriptures, and for the principles of enlightenment. We are born in the morning and die in the evening; the person we saw yesterday is no longer with us today. These facts we see with our own eyes and hear with our own ears. You see and hear impermanence in terms of another person, but try weighing it with your own body.<br><br>Â“Even though you live to be seventy or eighty, you die in accordance with the inevitability of death. How will you ever come to terms with the worries, joys, intimacies, and conflicts that concern you in this life? With faith in Buddhism, seek the true happiness of nirvana. How can those who are old or who have passed the halfway mark in their lives relax in their studies when there is no way of telling how many years are left?Â”<br><br>Think of those who gained enlightenment upon hearing the sound of bamboo when struck by a tile or seeing blossoms in bloom. Does the bamboo distinguish the clever or dull, the deluded or enlightened; does the flower differentiate between shallow and deep, the wise and stupid? Though flowers bloom year after year, not everyone who sees them gains enlightenment. Bamboo always gives off sounds, but not all who hear them become enlightened. It is only by virtue of long study and much practice that we gain an affinity with what we have labored for and gain enlightenment and clarity of mind.<br><br>The most important point in the study of the Way is zazen. Many people in China gained enlightenment solely through the strength of zazen. Some who were so ignorant that they could not answer a single question exceeded the learned who had studied many years solely through the efficacy of their single-minded devotion to zazen. Therefore, students must concentrate on zazen alone and not bother about other things. The Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors is zazen alone. Follow nothing else.<br><br>At that time Ejo asked: Â“When we combine zazen with the reading of the texts, we can understand about one point in a hundred or a thousand upon examining the Zen sayings and koans. But in zazen alone there is no indication of even this much. Must we devote ourselves to zazen even then?Â”<br><br>Dogen answered: Â“Although a slight understanding seems to emerge from examining a koan, it causes the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors to become even more distant. If you devote your time to doing zazen without wanting to know anything and without seeking enlightenment, this is itself the Ancestral Way. Although the old Masters urged both the reading of the scriptures and the practice of zazen, they clearly emphasized zazen. Some gained enlightenment through the koan, but the merit that brought enlightenment came from the zazen. Truly the merit is in the zazen.Â”<br><br>The basic point to understand in the study of the Way is that you must cast aside your deep-rooted attachments. If you rectify the body in terms of the four attitudes of dignity, the mind rectifies itself. Students, even if you gain enlightenment, do not stop practicing, thinking that you have attained the ultimate. The Buddha Way is endless. Once enlightened you must practice all the more.<br><br>Dogen (1200-1253)<br><br>Excerpted from The Roaring Stream - A New Zen Reader<br><br>Edited by Nelson Foster and Jack Shoemaker 1996<br><br>*<br><br>One of the challenges to a life of practice is to protect and nourish the Mind that seeks the Way.  In the beginning it is easy to have the intensity of BeginnerÂ’s Mind; everything is so fresh, so vital, so exotic sounding.  Here, though, a student is questioning Dogen about his lack of attaining enlightenment, a feeling many in practice experience from time to time.<br><br>Dogen answers by assuring him that anything you devote your energy to with intensity and sincere desire will over time bear fruits for your labor. Later on he answers more directly by stating: Â“If you devote your time to doing zazen without wanting to know anything and without seeking enlightenment, this is itself the Ancestral Way.Â”<br><br>At some point in training sitting is just enough in and of itself; the Â“goalsÂ” of practice take more of a back seat. Meditation is just sitting in the lap of the universe and expressing your nature.<br><br>All of us have our own genjo koans, or life questions that help to keep practice vital. To settle for answers to unanswerable questions dulls the mind and practice. To live with our questions each day, to see them in our lives, and to see them evolve into new questions keeps the practice Â“keen and sincere.Â”<br><br>May your Way Be Clear,<br><br>Elana, Monkess for Daily Zen<br><br></div>

Although it is not the profound Bright Mind, it is like a second moon but is not a reflection of the moon in water. Now listen attentively to my explanation of that which cannot return anywhere.<br><br>"Ananda, the doors and windows of this hall are wide open and face east. There is light when the sun rises in the sky, and there is darkness at midnight when the moon wanes or is hidden by fog or clouds. Your seeing is unimpeded through open doors and windows but is obstructed where there are walls or houses. Where there is discrimination, you perceive the stirring causes, and in the dull void you only see emptiness. An unconscious condition results from confused externals whereas an awakened state leads to clear perception.<br><br>"You should know that the essential Bodhi is wondrous and bright, being neither cause nor condition, neither self as such nor not self as such, neither unreality nor not unreality, for it is beyond all forms and is identical with all things. How can you now think of it and use frivolous terminology of the world to express it? This is like trying to catch or touch the void with your hand; you will only tire yourself, for how can you catch the void?<br><br>"Ananda, consciousness has no origin and is an illusion arising from the six organs and sense data. Look at this assembly and turn round to see those present; your eyes are like a mirror which cannot discern while your consciousness notices in turn the presences of Manjushri, Subhuti, Sariputra and the others. Does this consciousness come from perception, form, or the void, or does it emerge suddenly without any cause? Because your mind is unsettled, you do not realize that the seeing and hearing that arouse consciousness, come fundamentally from the Tathagata store. You do not realize that consciousness is the enlightened basic Bodhi. It embraces and pervades the whole Dharma-realm and is not found in a given place or direction manifesting according to the laws of karma.<br><br>"Ignorant worldlings think wrongly that it is causal, conditional and due to the self as such, according to the way their consciousnesses differentiate and discriminate while they do not know that the language they use has no real meaning."<br><br>After listening to the Buddha's profound instruction, Ananda and the assembly realized that their bodies and minds were now free from all obstructions. Each understood that self mind pervades the ten directions of space, this clearly seen like a leaf held in the hand. All things were seen as the wondrous and bright fundamental Mind of Bodhi. While this essence of Mind embraced all and contained the ten directions, Ananda looked back at his own body given him by his parents, and beheld it like a speck of dust dancing in the great void sometimes visible and sometimes not, like a bubble rising and falling aimlessly in a boundless clear ocean. After seeing all this clearly, they all realized their fundamental, profound, permanent and indestructible self-minds, and brought their palms together to offer thanks for being shown what they had never seen before.<br><br>Â— from The Surangama Sutra<br>Translated by Upasaka Lu K'uan Yu (Charles Luk) 1966<br><br>---------------------------------<br><br>The Surangama Sutra was predicted to be the first sutra to disappear in the "Dharma ending age." In this work the Buddha begins by revealing Ananda's attachment to his illusions and then reveals to him the teaching of the One Mind. Many of the parables from the sutra are recognizable to us and certainly have managed to stay alive in our times.<br><br>"You are still clinging to your mind to listen to the Dharma; you fail to realize the Dharma nature. This is like a man pointing a finger at the moon to show it to others who should follow the direction of the finger to look at the moon. If they look at the finger and mistake it for the moon, they lose sight of both the moon and the finger. Why? Because the bright moon is actually pointed at; they mistake the finger for the bright moon and are not clear about brightness and darkness."<br><br>While many of the sutras seem quite intellectual and vast in scope, the Surangama Sutra is still a primary source for many schools of Zen.<br><br>Studying Roots and Branches,<br>The Monkess</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><a href="http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading0309.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyzen.com/zen/zen_reading0309.asp</a><br><br><strong>The Practice of Compassion<br>Â— Ji Aoi Isshi</strong><br><br>Some mistakenly think that zen soars high above any need for compassion. Don't be one of them. Since I have compassion for <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span>, I'll try to set you straight on this point right now! Open your minds:<br><br>Universally in Buddhism, and Zen as well, we find the ideal of Compassion firmly entrenched. Compassion is personified in Buddhism by the bodhisattva Kannon, who is the "Hearer of Cries" of all the suffering in the world. When we too decide to listen and become receptive to the ubiquitous suffering, we become another ear of the Hearer. When we are further moved to compassion via this receptivity, we then become as an arm of the bodhisattva, ready to turn compassion into action, utter the compassionate word, or simply send our loving kindness radiating toward all beings.<br><br>Compassion provides us with a concrete way to make the world a better place, and this alone is entirely worth its development. Everyone recognizes the innate value of kindness. This is not news. After death, a compassionate person is lauded: "Her kindness touched all who met her" "His compassion healed many wounds." Very seldom do we read on a tombstone how clever someone was, or how rich or successful! Kindness, however, seems to touch a universal chord in us all. It's hard to imagine a world devoid of the simple, powerful trait of compassion.<br><br>In Zen, wisdom (prajna) is often made out to be king. But if that is true, then it is compassion that is the sole queen of zen, and no less important at all. Perhaps that is why Avalokiteshvara morphed from male to female over the course of centuries, in order to express this steady, unwavering compassion akin to a mother's love for her child. Strength and wisdom are completed by the addition of compassion and are not necessarily positive traits by themselves.<br><br>The pure act of compassion provides us with a powerful, twofold means of practice. It is both a means of turning <span style="font-style: italic;">emptiness into form</span> by giving (dana) toward all sentient beings while realizing at the same time the Buddhist principle that there is no set rigid identity; and it is also a means of turning <span style="font-style: italic;">form into emptiness</span> by overcoming the "form" of the ego (ours!), when we ourselves forget that very same principle (anatta)!<br><br>When we suffer due to our own deluded view of "self" it does no good at all to tell us that there is really no one there to suffer. <span style="font-style: italic;">I hurt, therefore I am!</span> Conversely, when we are able to turn <span style="font-style: italic;">form into emptiness</span> by leaping over ourselves and our petty sense of "me and mine," then we are truly practicing a tangible form of zen compassion. Jumping over ourselves, we save all sentient beings; jumping over our pride, we save all sentient beings; jumping over our own difficult situations, we save all sentient beings! Only to the extent that we're able to jump over our limited sense of self for the sake of others do we gain in the tangible power of the Way; the power of virtue.<br><br>To whatever extent that we discover this innate, universal compassion, our own troubles proportionately shrink. And to the extent that we share in this power, shrinking our estimation of our own troubles, we can remain serene in the face of life's inevitable hardships. And of course, becoming compassionate, powerful and serene we then have more to give to others. We become benefactors whose fortune is in the currency of kindness. Thus, the cycle of compassion turns and becomes exceedingly deep and strong. And so incidentally, without greed for our own growth, our practice becomes just as deep and strong!<br><br>So, within the Bodhisattva ideal of compassion lies a two fold path for deepening our practice while helping others bear the unavoidable burdens of life on this plane. Thus the world becomes a concretely better place, by just that much more compassion. In a world where might becomes justification, this balm of kindness is more necessary than ever before. Then, over and over, day in and day out, the continuity of this powerful practice of compassion unfolds, drawing us deeper into actually seeing the essential emptiness of our own ego while leading others still clinging to that illusory view to a newfound place of buoyancy and strength. Exponentially, candles light other candles, endlessly supplying light and care to all.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I vow to save all sentient beings, even though there are no separate individualities!</span><br><br>Make sense? No, not reallyÂ… except through the heart of compassion Â— then it does! There we surpass the definition and discover Being in the bargain. The value of compassion in today's world is obvious; and the value of the <span style="font-style: italic;">practice</span> of compassion is a two way street of depth without which zen practice might become merely a selfish charade.<br><br>May all beings be happy and may they then share that happiness with others via the twofold action of compassion!<br><br>Â— Ji Aoi Isshi<br><br>-----------------------------<br><br>In the beginning of practice we are fixated on our own progress and understanding. As we train further our ability to help others grows, whether in clarifying a technique or in sensing when a few kind words are needed. To continue in practice involves moving beyond our own personal practice to an awareness of the needs of others as well. The dissolution of the separation between self and others is more than an intellectual construct; our actions demonstrate how deeply Understanding has penetrated. Actions always speak louder than words, discussions, and concepts.<br><br>Compassion is a powerful doorway into a life of practice. How many of us will choose a life of compassion in action? Each moment we stand at a crossroads; every action reveals our heart.<br><br>Enjoy a compassionate Equinox,<br>The Monkess</div>

It is not something newly discovered; it has always existed. Truth is not far away; it is ever present. It is not something to be attained since not one of your steps leads away from it.<br><br>Do not follow the ideas of others, but learn to listen to the voice within yourself. Your body and mind will become clear and you will realize the unity of all things.<br><br>What is truth? The truth is the reality of mind which is formless and pervades the ten directions. It is being used presently right before your eyes, yet people do not trust it sufficiently, so they accept terms and expressions, seeking to assess Buddhism conceptually in the written word. They are as far away as the sky is from earth.<br><br>The slightest movement of your dualistic thought will prevent you from entering the palace of meditation and wisdom.<br><br>The Buddha meditated for six years, Bodhidharma for nine. The practice of meditation is not a method for the attainment of realization-it is enlightenment itself.<br><br>Your search among books, word upon word, may lead you to the depths of knowledge, but it is not the way to receive the reflection of your true self. When you have thrown off your ideas as to mind and body, the original truth will fully appear. Zen is simply the expression of truth; therefore longing and striving are not the true attitudes of Zen.<br><br>To actualize the blessedness of meditation you should practice with pure intention and firm determination. Your meditation room should be clean and quiet. Do not dwell in thoughts of good or bad. Just relax and forget that you are meditating. Do not desire realization since that thought will keep you confused.<br><br>Sit on a cushion in a manner as comfortable as possible, wearing loose clothing. Hold your body straight without leaning to the left or the right, forward or backward. Your ears should be in a line with your shoulders, and nose in a straight line with your navel. Keep the tongue at the roof of the mouth and close your lips. Eyes are slightly open, and breathing is quiet through the nostrils.<br><br>Before you begin meditation take several slow, deep breaths. Hold your body erect, allowing your breathing to become normal again. Many thoughts will crowd into your mind; ignore them, letting them go. If they persist be aware of them with the awareness which does not think. In other words, think non-thinking.<br><br>Zen meditation is not a physical culture, nor is it a method to gain something material. It is peacefulness and blessedness itself. It is the actualization of truth and wisdom.<br><br>In your meditation you yourself are the mirror reflecting the solution of your problems. The human mind has absolute freedom within its true nature. You can attain your freedom intuitively. Do not work for freedom, rather allow the practice itself to be liberation.<br><br>When you wish to arise from meditation, move your body slowly and stand up quietly. Practice this meditation in the morning or evening, or at any leisure time during the day. You will soon realize that your mental burdens are dropping away one by one, and that you are gaining an intuitive power hitherto unnoticed.<br><br>There are thousands upon thousands of students who have practiced meditation and obtained its fruits. Do not doubt its possibilities because of the simplicity of the method. If you cannot find the truth right where you are, where else do you expect to find it?<br><br>Life is short and no one knows what the next moment will bring. Open your mind while you have the opportunity, thereby gaining the treasures of wisdom, which in turn you can share abundantly with others, bringing them happiness.<br><br>Â— Excerpted from Buddhism and Zen<br>Translated by Nyogen Senzaki<br>and Ruth McCandless (1987)<br><br>--------------<br><br>This month we return to our roots, the essential points of a beginning meditation practice. Many are just beginning practice, and for those who have practiced for years, Dogen's piece on meditation has points that even the "advanced" students have not mastered. The reality for many is that they are practicing alone, far away from qualified teachers. For those of us who have had the good fortune to find a trustworthy teacher, we forget what this must be like to travel the Way alone. Yet, ultimately, all true learning is done on one's own. Hopefully we are fortunate enough to have teachers who don't tell us too much!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Learning and Practicing without a Good Friend can be very challenging at times. There are many pitfalls to watch out for. Sometimes you will think that you know more than you really do; other times you think you know less than you really do. Sometimes we wallow in slackness, at other time Practice itself becomes choked off by excess tension. Finding the natural balance isn't easy; and just when you do find it, things will change!<br><br>Even if you have the best friend and wisest teacher, you're really on your own mostly anyway. You still need to navigate, keep your eyes open, constantly adjust your course, and explore for yourself. If you leave it all up to the teacher, you won't learn much.<br><br>Â— Maverick Sutras</span><br><br>--------------<br><br>We begin freshly with meditation this year, and every day we will deepen our experience of life and practice.<br><br>Beginning Again,<br>The Monkess</div>

This question itself, however, indicates a failure to digest the implications of the term fundamental.<br><br>To reach the fundamental ground is not something like going from the country to the city or from one land to another. In reality it is like waking up from a dream. All the questions about where the fundamental ground is and how to get there are part of the dream, arising from the thoughts of a dream about a dream.<br><br>Even if you have not awakened, if you realize that your perceptions and activities are all like dreams and you view them with detachment, not giving rise to grasping and rejecting discrimination, then this is virtually tantamount to awakening from the dream; at least you may be said to believe in the existence of reality.<br><br>In the fundamental ground, there is no sign of ordinariness or sainthood, no purity or defilement. Because of the "dream" of consciousness conditioned by unconscious habit, purity and defilement appear in the midst of formlessness, and one sees distinctions between the ordinary and holy in the midst of the uncreated. When you think you are an ordinary mortal, you go running around after honor and gain, disappointed if you do not get them. When you think you are wise, you look down on everyone and develop a conceited attitude. When you are fooled by such delusions, you do not even believe in the existence of a fundamental ground of peace and happiness, let alone experience it.<br><br>The Complete Enlightenment Sutra says, "People mistake the material elements for their own bodies and take reflections of the objects of the six senses for their own minds. This is like diseased eyes seeing flowers in the sky, or a second moon. This is why they arbitrarily pursue the repetitious routines by which they live and die. That is called ignorance. Ignorance has no real substance; it is like seeing someone in a dream. It is not that there is no presence, but on awakening, that person is not there."<br><br><strong>Activity and Meditation</strong><br><br>People meditating on the fundamental carry out their ordinary tasks and activities in the midst of meditation and carry out meditation in the midst of ordinary tasks and activities. There is no disparity between meditation and activity.<br><br>It is for those as yet incapable of this, those weak in focusing their intent on the Way that special meditation periods were set up. The practice of meditating four times a day in Zen communities began in this manner during the 12th century.<br><br>People who really have their minds on the Way, in contrast, do not forget work on the fundamental no matter what they are doing. Yet if they still distinguish this work from ordinary activities even as they do them together, they will naturally be concerned about being distracted by activities and forgetting the meditation work. This is because of viewing things as outside the mind.<br><br>An ancient master said, "The mountains, rivers, and the entire array of outer phenomena are all oneself." If you can absorb the essence of this message, there are no activities outside of meditation; you dress in meditation and eat in meditation; you walk, stand, sit and lie down in meditation; you perceive and cognize in meditation; you experience joy, anger, sadness, and happiness in meditation."<br><br>Yet even this is still in the sphere of accomplishment and is not true merging with the source of Zen.<br><br>- Muso Kokushi (1275-1351)<br><br>Excerpted from Dream Conversations on Buddhism and Zen - Translated by Thomas Cleary (1994)<br><br>----------------------------------<br><br>Awakening from the dream of life is something we all comprehend, and yet exactly who we are once that has happened is quite the mystery. There are countless tales of enlightenment in many traditions and much practice has been based on stories from the past, hoping to recreate that one moment in someone else's quest to validate one's own efforts. Some get lost in the trappings of enlightenment, and like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz, go back to sleep within a different dream, the dream of false spiritual attainment.<br><br>We all begin by cultivating the Mind that seeks the Way, an aspiration that is present at all stages of practice. Maturation of practice includes not resting on any previous understanding or experience we have attained in practice. Since there is an endless universe to explore here, why stop with that first enlightenment? The dreams we have at night are easily recognized; the dream we awaken to is more subtle to perceive. As Zen Master Zuigon was in the habit of saying to himself: "Wake Up!"<br><br>Muso left us with exquisite temple gardens, calligraphy, and poetry in addition to his more formal teachings. The power of imagery in the poem below speaks volumes:<br><br>I don't go out to wander around;<br>I stay home here in Miura<br>While time flows on through the<br>Unbounded world.<br>In the awakened eye, mountains and rivers<br>Completely disappear.<br>The eye of delusion looks out<br>Upon deep fog and clouds.<br>Alone on my zazen mat I forget<br>The days as they pass;<br>The wisteria has grown thick<br>Over the eaves of my hut.<br>The subtle Way of Bodhidharma,<br>I never give it a second thought.<br>Does anyone know the truth<br>Of Zen or what to ask about it?<br>Â— Muso Kokushi (1275-1351)<br><br>Blessings of peace and joy<br>with the return of the Light,<br>The Monkess</div>

It engulfs space and covers all of heaven and earth, all of form and sound, and is equipped to function.<br><br>If we speak of its essence, it is so vast it embraces everything, so that nothing is outside of it. If we speak about its function... even great sages cannot get to the end of it.<br><br>This one thing is always with each and every person. Whether you move or not, whenever you encounter circumstances and objects, it is always very obvious and clear, clear everywhere, revealed in everything. It is quietly shining in all activities. As an expedient, it is called Mind. It is also called the Path, and the king of the myriad dharmas, and Buddha. Buddha said that whether walking, sitting or lying down, we are always within it.<br><br>Even Yao and Shun said: "Holding faithfully to the mean, without contrived activity, everything under heaven is well ordered." Weren't Yao and Shun sages? Weren't the buddhas and enlightened teachers special people? They simply managed to illuminate This Mind.<br><br>Therefore, since antiquity, the buddhas and enlightened teachers have never established words and texts as sacred: they just transmitted Mind with Mind, without any other separate teaching. If there is some other teaching outside This Mind, this is a deluded theory, not the words of the Buddha. Thus, when we use the name Mind, it is not the ordinary person's mind that falsely engenders discrimination: rather, it is the silent and motionless Mind in each person.<br><br>People cannot preserve this inherent Mind for themselves. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Unwittingly they make false moves and are suddenly thrown into confusion by the wind of objects: they are buried in sensory experiences, which arise and disappear again and again. They falsely create the karmic suffering of endless birth and death.</span></strong> Therefore, the buddhas and enlightened teachers and sages appeared in the world by the power of their past bodhisattva vows. They use great compassion and directly point out that the human mind is inherently enlightened, and they enable people to awaken to the mind-buddha.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your majesty must contemplate his own inherent mind. During lulls in the myriad functions of state, Your Majesty should sit upright in the palace, without thinking of good and evil at all, just like a golden statue of Buddha. Then the false thinking of birth and destruction is totally obliterated and the obliterating is obliterated, in an instant the mindground is quiet and motionless, with nothing to rest on. Body and mind are suddenly empty: it's like leaning on the void. All that appears here is total clarity and illumination.<br><br>At this moment you should look carefully at your original face before your father and mother were born. As soon as it is brought up, you awaken to it: then like a person drinking water, you know yourself whether it is cool or warm. It cannot be described or explained to anyone else. It's just a luminous awareness covering heaven and earth.</span></strong><br><br>When the realm I've just talked about spontaneously appears before you, you will have no doubts about birth and death, you will have no doubts about the sayings of the buddhas and enlightened teachers- indeed, you will have met the buddhas and enlightened teachers. This is the wonder transmitted from person to person by buddhas and enlightened teachers since antiquity.<br><br>You must make it your concern: be careful not to neglect it. Be like this even when attending to affairs of state and working for the renovation of the people. Use this Path also to be alert to all events and to encourage all our ministers and common subjects to share together in the uncontrived inner truth and enjoy Great Peace. Then the buddhas are sure to rejoice.<br><br>- T'aego (1301-1382)<br>Taken from A Buddha from Korea: The Zen Teachings of T'aego, Thomas Cleary (198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>--------------------------------<br><br>We no longer live in times where leaders ask Zen masters for guidance nor where true guidance is that easily attainable. However, to one who is sincerely trying to cultivate the "mind that seeks the Way" the tradition is still alive and worth finding. To understand how to maintain practice throughout one's daily life is the koan for many of today's students. That is at heart what T'aego is offering to the King in the excerpt above, how to realize Mind in everyday activities. Sometimes using language at all to communicate becomes the main barrier, then we have the language of ages past and the situation becomes more abstruse. In more recent times this same message was communicated in the following:<br><br>*<br><br>You can be your own sage. You can be your own teacher if you are a person for whom no task is worth losing the Way. No goal, no thing, nothing you are doing, is really worth throwing that awareness away for. No feeling that you have is as important as staying at that cool, clear center of awareness. If you are going to move like a fly buzzing around, or you are going to be oppressed by a thought or feeling that comes up, where is your love of the Way then? Where is your love of the Way when you are buzzing around? That is when you have to keep coming back and find it.<br><br>This takes a tremendous effort. A tremendous amount of energy is all that it takes the next time you feel that way. It is like pushing your way through to your second wind. The next time that you have a feeling oppressing you, stand up, observe and use every atom of energy you have to observe. Don't just sit there and let it push you to the ground.<br><br>To be that still, clear mind everyday is the only thing that makes life truly worth living. The rest is just gaining, winning, and losing. You should put every atom into living these principles -- to realize them, to see them, to use them.<br><br>Everything you do is from Blue Sky Mind. You don't run off with your delusions when they arise. You see them as clouds. You understand that which stays and that which goes. This consciousness that you have, the Blue Sky Mind observes all these states and sees them all clearly.<br><br>- Taken from unpublished manuscripts of Traceless Way<br><br>Returning to Blue Sky Mind,<br>The Monkess<br></div>
