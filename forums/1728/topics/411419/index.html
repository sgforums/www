              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">
              </p><p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              </span></p><p> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">There it is, without monetary foreplay, New Age window-dressing, or any fancy highly priced presentations delivered by touring metaphysical personalities. However, the revelation of a<em> REAL </em>SECRET as being, "To seek only that which we can really have" immediately begs a question:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <span style="font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"What is the only thing we can really have?"</p>
              </span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Now, <em>this</em> is where the scratch meets the itch.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The answer to this question is not something we can <em>get</em> through <em>thinking</em>, <em>positive affirmations, or needy wishfoolness</em>. A <em>REAL </em>SECRET is not about <em>getting;</em> it is about receiving. It is also not about <em>consuming</em> and so is not attractive as an ingredient for "consumer spirituality". A <em>REAL </em>SECRET is not in any way commercially <em>attractive;</em> it is therefore not accessible as a commodity and a means for media-ordained "Law of Attraction gurus" to accumulate as much of our income as they can get their hands on.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">To unravel the question triggered by a<em> REAL </em>SECRET requires an initial perceptual adjustment because it entails <em>asking a series of seemingly simplistic questions without interfering with the answering process</em>. Fully unraveling the immensity of a <em>REAL</em> SECRET is an "Ask and you shall receive" arrangement, not an "Ask and then go and get" arrangement.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">One of humanities greatest pitfalls is that we have become obsessed with "the answer" at the expense of "the question". We also seek "the answer" only as a mental concept and not as an integrated physical, mental, and emotional experience. What we do not realize, because the mental body cannot grasp this, is that <em>we can receive the answer to any question we ask as long as we do not get involved in the answering process</em>. This realization comes through embracing the question as <em>the cause</em> and the answer as <em>the effect</em>. When we stay in a causal place, when we get out of our own way, the effect is always guaranteed. This is an emotionally mature approach to, and application of, The Law of Attraction.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">If a<em> REAL </em>SECRET is "To seek only that which we can really have", then the first step in realizing this is "to ask the right question without allowing the mental body to sabotage the answering process" so that the answer unfolds as an integrated physical, mental, and emotional experience. In this way, the answer manifests as something "we know experientially for ourselves", as opposed to "some piece of sexy metaphysical information we get from someone else".</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">If a<em> REAL </em>SECRET is "To seek only that which we can really have", then the first step is to ask the obvious question:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              </span><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"What is the only thing we can really have?"</p>
              </span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Now, we can leave it at this, because if we do so the answer will eventually manifest. Or, we can facilitate ourselves into going deeper; we can initiate a temporary, simple, and profoundly powerful practice that effortlessly and efficiently brings about the answer to this question as an integrated physical, mental, and emotional experience.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This practice is recommended for 21 days, to be done once in the morning and once in the evening as follows:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Sit comfortably in a position you can hold for about 15 minutes.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Ask yourself the following series of questions:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              </span><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"Who am I?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"What am I?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"Where am I?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"How am I?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"When am I?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"Why am I?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <blockquote></blockquote></span><blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Between each question pause for a few seconds as if to listen. <strong>Take note:</strong> The mental body will immediately attempt to provide an answer to some of these questions. Observe these answers but do not accept them as being "an answer". By repeatedly asking these questions twice a day the mental body is also bound to get annoyed, frustrated, and may even come up with an attractive reason or two that convincingly justifies terminating this practice. This is because the experiential answer generated by repeatedly asking these questions for about 21 days is destined to terminate the mental body’s illusion that it is the source of and means to all that can be known.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">After asking all the above questions take your attention off them completely and be still for about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">During this period of stillness do not intend to "do or accomplish anything". Watch how you <em>try</em> to do something. Allow whatever happens to unfold. Be alert to the sounds around you and the sensations of your body. Watch your thoughts as "an observer" without joining in with them or sedating or controlling them in any way.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">After 15 minutes carry on with something else.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">You may even use this practice temporarily as an introductory to your regular mediation practice - if that is something you are already attending to twice a day.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <strong>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">After 21 days drop this practice completely; DO NOT CONTINUE ASKING THESE QUESTIONS.</p>
              This "dropping of the questioning process" is essential to open a space for "the answer to manifest experientially".
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The answer to the question "What is the only thing I can really have?" will come when you least expect it, so <em>do not entertain expectation</em>. All expectations are fantasies of the mental body. The answers to these six questions will unfold as a unified, integrated, physical, mental, and emotional experience.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Because there is nothing to be gained by holding anything back from you, let me also give you a pointer as to how to recognize the profound consequences of this questioning practice:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">One day you will realize that you have entered a somewhat unusual experience. This realization will sneak up on you so do not watch for it. It will feel like this: That no matter what outer experience you go through, it feels like "nothing is happening". Of course things <em>will</em> be happening; you will be actively involved in all sorts of outer activities, but it will still feel like "nothing is actually happening". For example, you may go through an event that previously used to be negatively or positively charged and afterward you may comment to yourself, "That was nothing…it felt like absolutely nothing happened".</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This will feel a little odd at first, as if something has stopped, or even died.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Once you notice this experience you will also find yourself waiting for it to pass, expecting to return to the previous atmosphere of dramatic emotional shifts you have been used to all your life. You may occasionally dip into such encounters, but you will automatically return, like a bobbing cork, to the <em>feeling</em> that despite all the activity around you, it feels like "nothing has happened or is happening".</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This <em>feeling</em> that "nothing is happening", despite your obvious outer activity, is the unifying and integrated answer to your questioning practice.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">This feeling is a portal into an awareness of a <em>REAL</em> SECRET.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Yet, it is way bigger than what the mental body can grasp through my written explanations here. This is why it is recommended you enter "the experience" of this by initiating the simple questioning practice for 21 days, and then letting go of it. By activating this <em>feeling of nothingness</em> experientially for yourself you will be awakening a powerful realization: <strong>No matter what happens to and around you, there is something that always remains unchanged.</strong> This is a real taste of who and what you really are.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              </strong></span></blockquote></blockquote><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The <em>feeling</em> that "nothing is really happening" is an experiential encounter with the part of your self that is <strong>no thing</strong>.</p>
              </span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">In essence, through the simple practice of asking a series of de<strong>liberate</strong> questions without sabotaging the answering process by involving your mental body in it, you set in motion the effortless rediscovery of your authentic self. Of course, this experience may be puzzling at first, because it will not be the outcome or answer you expected. You may have been <em>expecting some thing </em>more "spiritual" or exciting? Maybe you were expecting bells and whistles? Initially, this encounter will definitely not be what you thought you even wanted or were looking for! You most likely didn’t expect to discover that "your authentic self is <strong>no thing</strong> and therefore <strong>no body</strong>". Such a discovery is shattering and offensive to any well-manicured ego.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">However, when you place your attention within this <em>no thing-ness,</em> and when you sit within this <em>no body-ness,</em> you discover an immaculate silence, stillness, and authentic peace – tangible even in the midst of ongoing outer activity. You also discover that the feeling of this peace, this inner inactivity, begins quenching a thirst you had no idea you suffered from. As you spend more moments during your day immersing yourself within this experience of <strong>no thing</strong> and <strong>no body,</strong> you realize you begin feeling renewed, refreshed, and revitalized, as if you are ingesting some super-charged nutrition.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Also, as you become deeply acquainted with this unchanging resonance you inevitably realize that <em>this is the only part of</em> <em>this life experience that you can take with you when you leave;</em> all else must be surrendered at the door of physical death.</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">So let us re-examine a <em>REAL</em> SECRET. We started by stating that a <em>REAL</em> SECRET is "To seek only that which we can really have." So, "What is the only thing we can really have?" As we become increasingly intimate with and nourished by The Presence of our authentic essence, and as we immerse ourselves within its eternal well of magnificent peace, the answer to the question dawns:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              </span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"What we really seek to have is more and more of this <strong>no thing</strong>-ness and to become intimately acquainted with the part of our Self that is <strong>no body</strong>!"</p>
              </span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">The problem is that we cannot make a glamorous movie about <em>no thing</em> and with <em>no body</em>. We cannot go on a world tour selling <em>no thing</em> and <em>no body</em> as a tangible commodity. We can only know this truth as an inner experience and share it daily through our radiant example. As a consequence of this revelation other questions arise:</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              </span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"Are we ready to receive the experience of awakening to this part of our Self that is no thing so that we may have an intimate encounter with the eternal part of us that is no body?"</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">"Are we really ready for the authentic inner peace inherent in awakening to a <em>REAL</em> SECRET?"</p>
              </span><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Tahoma;">
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%">Or, are we still going to be satisfied with THE (other) SECRET that hypnotizes us into believing that attracting more and bigger stuff and becoming some important body will really manifest the nutrition required to quench our seemingly insatiable thirst?</p>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
              </span>
              <p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"> </p>
