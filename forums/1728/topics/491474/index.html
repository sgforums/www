                  demographic: middle-class Indians in urban areas.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Cambria","serif";    color: #4b4b4b; border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;'> <br> While the narrative of its complete extinction in medieval India is
                  problematic, Buddhism is nevertheless a minority religion in its home country
                  today. It is currently supported by the impoverished but politically powerful
                  Dalit community, as well as ethnic minorities such as the Mog, Chakma, Barua,
                  and Uchai in states like Tripura. The new crop of urbanites subscribing to
                  Buddhist practice encompasses a diverse spectrum of people and professionals
                  ranging from students to wives, mothers, and businesspeople.<br> <br> According to a January article on Catch News by Lamat R. Hasan, these
                  demographics are turning to Buddhism for its practical solutions to rising
                  stress levels, methods of cultivating peace with oneself, and openness to
                  non-Buddhist cultural practices (in this case, Hindu ones). This distinction
                  between Buddhist “non-Indian-ness” and Indian Hindu culture (which is ironic
                  given Buddhism’s origins) becomes apparent with the Bharat Soka Gakkai, which
                  emphasizes the Japanese chant “Namo myoho renge kyo.” According to Hasan, this
                  Nichiren-inspired school is the most popular one in India, although other
                  Mahayana schools are finding a growing following as well.<br> <br> One of these Indian Buddhists is Shantum Seth, a lay teacher in the Plum
                  Village tradition. In a casual exchange last year, Shantum spoke to
                  me about his initial difficulties with reconciling his conventional Hindu
                  identity with his spiritual beliefs: “Those of us who feel spiritually Buddhist
                  still find it difficult to pull away completely from our Hindu identity, which
                  is everywhere in India. So we still feel culturally Hindu,” he said. He has
                  praised the non-sectarian and open teaching style of the Vietnamese Buddhist
                  master Thich Nhat Hanh, which he feels is attractive to people immersed in
                  religious culture from birth.<br> <br> In her article, Hasan offered a few probable reasons why Hindus are not finding
                  it hard to convert to Buddhism: “Most of those adopting Buddhism are Hindus
                  though followers from other faiths are not unusual. Most find the transition
                  from Hinduism to Buddhism easy—largely because Buddhism doesn’t interfere with
                  their existing belief systems. That means many feel that it is possible to be
                  part-Hindu, part-Buddhist.” Words used by Indian Buddhists that she interviewed
                  include: liberating, positive, stronger, calmer, and more in control of
                  emotions.<br> <br> “Even those conflicted at the prospect of changing their religion find it easy
                  to see Buddhism as a philosophy rather than religion, since its beliefs don’t
                  contradict anything in their own religion,” wrote Hasan. “Clearly, implicit in
                  Buddhist practice is that it doesn’t seem to require renouncing the religion
                  you come from. That makes a crossover of beliefs not just easy but seductive.”<br> <br> Not everyone welcomes the resurgence of Buddhism in the urban, middle-class
                  conclaves of New Delhi or Mumbai. “Even today, some Indians of higher castes
                  associate Buddhism with the activist goals of the Dalits,” said Shantum. “This
                  is really problematic as the Dalits have a very political form of Buddhism that
                  feels exclusionary and political to many. We need urgently to change this
                  perception if more Indians are to appreciate the depth and diversity of
                  Buddhism.”<br> <br> “For now, it seems like millions of urban Indians are happy to find a medium
                  between the religion they were born into, and the one that speaks to
                  them—especially because they’re not being pushed into a corner and asked to
                  choose,” said Hasan in her conclusion. “While other religions may battle it out
                  for supremacy, we may already have the winner under our very noses.” We may
                  well be seeing many more stories like Shantum’s and those in Hasan’s article in
                  the years to come.<br> </span></p>
