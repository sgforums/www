In the Earth-Store Sutra (Ksitigarbha Sutra), The Buddha delegates HIS responsibilities to Kstigarbha Bodhisattva for the times where No Buddhism is around until the coming of Future Buddha Maitreya. According to some claim, Dharma can only last for 12000 years (most say 5000). The last to survive is "Pure Land" Buddhism. It will take another few billions of years for the coming of Maitreya Buddha (The Fifth Buddha), where Buddhism is not available.<br><br>Recitations of "Di Zhang Pu Sa" and or "Di Zhang Pu Za Ben Yuan Jing" is really awesome. "Di Zhang Pu Za Ben Yuan Jing" (Ksitigarbha Sutra) is the fundamental and foundation of Buddhist cultivation. Every thing else branch out from here.<br><br>cheers,<br><br></div>

According to what I understand, most of the dreams are "Ai1 lai2 Ye2 Shi2" in action - from this life and previous lives.</blockquote>Yes thats right. To be more precise, it is the 7th Consciousness digging out all the 'videotapes' in the alaya (8th consciousness) to watch. Thats why bodhisattvas do not have dreams, because their 7th consciousness is turned into pure awareness. Of course my practise is not up to that level. My dharma teacher do no have dreams - she maintains mindfulness even during sleep. In this way even if you die in sleep you are safe.<br><br>Also see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=136527" rel="nofollow">How dreams work</a> (in buddhism)<br><br>But sleep paralysis is not a dream. It is being Fully Conscious yet not able to control your body - you can think whatever you want, you can chant buddha name, and its annoying because you cant control your body. This 'annoyance' is because you lost your mindfulness/awareness. There is attachment to body. Realise the BODY is NOT YOU. NOT YOURS. Let go... just maintain mindfulness.  And you will become much at ease. Focus on chanting the Buddha Name Yi4 Xin1 Bu4 Luan4. One-mind-not-confused.<br><br>Sleep paralysis is also a training. Because when you die - you also cannot control your body anymore. We must learn to let go of attachment to the body. Death is something like sleep paralysis - and it could be much worse...<br><br><blockquote>Buddha delegates HIS responsibilities to Kstigarbha Bodhisattva during the times where No Buddhism is around until the coming of Future Buddha Maitreya.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>This is something new.

Some people also explain that seeing ghosts could be hallucinations during sleep paralysis. But I think they wont be able to explain how out-of-body experiences happen during sleep paralysis.

I was really in the room.<br><br>BTW, I did not have sleep paralysis anymore after putting the di zhang wang picture beside me.<br><br>Anyway good you chase the dog away.

She entered into the spirit realm... if memory serves its just like a street... but its the spirit world and all the beings there were spirits/ghosts. Then suddenly a person appeared to her, and told her, "Why don't you chant Na Mo Fut Pu Sat"? My mom asked him "Who are you?" and the person replied "I am the Dream Deity (meng shen)". My mom chanted "Na Mo Fut Pu Sat" and immediately woke up from the dream.<br><br>It was a long time later, after she became a Buddhist, that she realise "Na Mo Fut Pu Sat" is the ancient/olden way of calling "Fo Pu Sa". I don't know who the dream deity was, but he definitely was a Buddhist. Or perhaps even a manifestation of a Buddha or a Bodhisattva?</div>
