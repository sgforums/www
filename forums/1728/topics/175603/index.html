'Ti Tsang', meaning 'Earth-Store' is a direct translation of the Bodhisattva's name KSITIGARBHA in Sanskrit. Among the countless Bodhisattvas in the universe, he and three others have firmly captured the hearts of the Mahayanists. These four main P'usas or Bodhisattvas are depicted in the Chinese Buddhist Pantheon and they represent four basic great qualities:<br><br>KUAN SHIH YIN as Great Compassion;<br>WEN SHU as Great Wisdom;<br>PU HSIEN as Great Love and Perfect Activity;<br>TI TSANG as Great Vow to help and to deliver all beings.<br><br>His greatest compassionate Vow being: "If I do not go to the hell to help the suffering beings there, who else will go? ... if the hells are not empty I will not become a Buddha. Only when all living beings have been saved, will I attain Bodhi."<br><br>The Sutra of the PAST VOWS OF THE EARTH STORE BODHISATTYA, one of the most popular Chinese Buddhist Sutras, tells of the great filial piety, which the Bodhisattva practised that led to his illimitable vows to save all living beings. This Sutra was spoken by the Buddha towards the end of his life to the beings of the Trayastrimsa Heaven as a mark of gratitude and remembrance for his beloved mother.<br><br>In this Sutra the Buddha revealed that in the distant past aeons, Ti Tsang P'usa, then a Brahman maiden by the name of 'Sacred Girl', was deeply troubled when her mother died, as she had often been slanderous towards the Three Jewels: the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha.<br><br>To save her from the great tortures of hell, the young girl sold whatever she had and used the money to buy offerings which she offered daily to the Buddha of her time, known as The Buddha of Flower of Meditation and Enlightenment. She made fervent prayers that her mother be spared of the pains of hell and requested the Buddha for help.<br><br>One day at the temple, while she was thus pleading for help, she heard the voice of the Buddha advising her to go home immediately and there to sit down and practise meditation on His name if she wanted to know where her mother was. She did as she was told and while doing so, her consciousness was transported to the Hell Realm where she met a hell-guardian who informed her that through her fervent prayers and pious offerings, her mother had accumulated much merits and therefore shel had already been released from hell and ascended to heaven. She was greatly relieved and should have been extremely happy, but the sights of the great sufferings in Hell that she had witnessed so touched her tender heart that she made an immediate vow: "I shall do my very best to relieve beings of their sufferings forever in my future lives of kalpas to come".<br><br>The young maiden has since then become an accomplished Bodhisattva through her great acts of merits and is now known as Ti Tsang P'usa.<br><br>Ti Tsang P'usa has often been mistaken by uninformed Buddhists to be Mogallana who was a disciple of Sakyamuni Buddha, because he too had a similar experience of descending to the Hell Realm to seek and save his mother. The stories may sound similar but they happened at different times and adopted quite different methods to save their mothers.<br><br>Many others also tend to mistake Ti Tsang as Hsuan Tsang, the famous Tripitaka master of the Tang Dynasty who made the harzadous journey to the West to seek the Buddhist scriptures. This is mainly due to the Sangha robe and the five-leave crown which both are seen to wear.<br><br>Ti Tsang P'usa is again taken by many to be "Yen-Lo-Wang" or Yama, the "Over-Lord of Hell." It must be mentioned that Ti Tsang is a Bodhisattva and not a mere King of the Fifth Hell. He does not judge the dead <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>but seeks to save them from their suffering.</strong></span><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>How to not get into the 3 Evil Realms ??? Will chanting guan shi yin pusa or other buddhas name help ??</blockquote>Almost missed this part. Very simple, that is by observing the 5 precepts and not breaking any of them.<br><br>This is the least that a Buddhist must do... take refuge, observe the precepts. It will prevent us from falling into the 3 lower realms, so that we can continue our cultivation in future lifetimes.<br><br><blockquote>1. Panatipata veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami<br>I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures.<br>2. Adinnadana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami<br>I undertake the precept to refrain from taking that which is not given.<br>3. Kamesu micchacara veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami<br>I undertake the precept to refrain from sexual misconduct.<br>4. Musavada veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami<br>I undertake the precept to refrain from incorrect speech.<br>5. Suramerayamajja pamadatthana veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami<br>I undertake the precept to refrain from intoxicating drinks and drugs which lead to carelessness.</blockquote>However, if we have ALREADY committed sins that lead to lower realms, we must immediately REPENT to the Buddha and chant Namo Di Zhang Wang Pu Sa very often. True repentance also include making the effort into not committing the same mistakes again. While the foolish do not admit their mistakes, the intelligent admit their mistakes, and the wise repent.</div>
