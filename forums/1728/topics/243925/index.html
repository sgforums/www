Just look at your mind, when you are able to generate even a thought of kindness to someone and wishing someone be freed from pain and suffering, at that instant your mind is already more open, kind and tender than the moment before when you were thinking of ignoring that personÂ’s suffering.<br><br><strong>(2) When I transfer merits, my body, speech and mind become kinder, and affects others positively</strong><br>Therefore, the more kindness me and you generate and dedicate to the person, the more compassionate our minds and behaviours become, which in turn can affect the person whoÂ’s suffering or the people around him/her. For example, if I am someone taking care of this sick lady, and I posted a request for people to help dedicate merits to her. And when I come back to the website and I saw so many people actually dedicating their best wishes to her, and I know more many are silent but actually dedicating their merits to her on their own, I feel more comforted, I feel rejoiced, and I also feel more encouraged. Therefore when I take care of the sick lady, I will be acting more positively in body (I am gentle in the way I touch her), speech (I am kind and soothing in my words) and mind (I am positive and kind in my thoughts). All these can affect her in the positive ways. Whereas without these, I could be angry and frustrated, and these can affect the way I treat her in my body, speech and mind.<br><br><strong>(3) If the sick person can rejoice, he/she benefits more from it</strong><br>Now if this sick lady is able to rejoice in our kind intentions, that personÂ’s mind also generates positivity which definitely benefits her own mindstream.<br><br>That is a simple way of explaining how transference of merits work.<br><br>As for your question of whether the same logic can be applied to demerits. I think the conversation between King Milinda and Venerable Nagasena can help you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> King Milinda raised a similar question to Ven NagasenaÂ…..<br><br>Â“If some people prepared a meal and visited their relatives but those relatives did not accept the gift, would that gift be wasted?Â”<br><br>Â“No, venerable sir, the owners themselves would have it.Â”<br><br>Â“Just so, O King, the givers derive benefit from their almsgiving.Â”<br><br>Â“Is it then possible to share demerit?Â”<br><br>Â“This is not a question you should ask, O King. You will be asking me next why space is boundless and why men and birds have two legs whilst deer have four!Â”<br><br>Â“I do not ask this to annoy you, but there are many people in the world who are perverted or who lack common sense.Â”<br><br>Â“Though it is possible to ripen a crop with water from a tank it is not possible to use seawater. <strong>An evil deed cannot be shared with one who has not done it and has not consented to it. </strong>People convey water long distances by means of an aqueduct but they cannot convey solid rock in the same way. Unwholesomeness is a mean thing but wholesomeness is great.Â”<br><br>Â“Give me an illustration.Â”<br><br>Â“If a tiny drop of water were to fall on the ground would it flow over ten or twelve leagues?Â”<br><br>Â“Certainly not, it would only affect the spot where it fell.Â”<br><br>Â“Why is that?Â”<br><br>Â“Because of its minuteness.Â”<br><br>Â“Just so, O King, <strong>unwholesomeness is a mean thing and because of its minuteness affects only the doer and cannot be shared.</strong> However, if there was a mighty cloudburst would the water spread around?Â”<br><br>Â“Certainly, venerable sir, even for ten or twelve leagues.Â”<br><br>Â“Just so, O King, <strong>wholesomeness is great and by reason of its abundance can be shared by gods and men.Â” </strong><br><br>Â“Ven Nagasena, why is it that unwholesomeness is so limited and wholesomeness so much more far-reaching?Â”<br><br>Â“Whoever, O King, gives gifts, observes the precepts and performs the Uposatha, he is glad and at peace, and being peaceful his goodness grows even more abundantly. <strong>Like a deep pool of water from which as soon as water flows away on one side it is replenished from all around. Just so, O King, if a man were to transfer to others the merit of any good he had done even for a hundred years the more would his goodness grow.</strong> This is why wholesomeness is so great. However, on doing evil, O King, a man becomes filled with remorse and his mind cannot escape from the thought of it, he is depressed and obtains no peace, miserable and despairing he wastes away. Just, O King<strong>, as a drop of water falling onto a dry river-bed gains not in volume but is swallowed up on the very spot where it fell. </strong>This is why unwholesomeness is so mean and minute.Â”<br></div>
