              What I have posted are what i have learnt from Buddhism, and the various articles posted by AEN and other buddhist forumers. So, if I can see a concordance of views between Buddhism and Fugazzi, I donâ€™t see the reason behind Fugazzi keep taking issues with Buddhism, unless he has a hidden agenda as suggested by some forumers here
              
              Neither are there any buddhist here asserting we have monopoly over truth and wisdom. I think you have read too much into the various posts in the Buddhist forum, making you feel perhaps insecure or threatened.
              
              May be you can consider starting up a new forum called 'Fugazzi-ism" to preach your thinking.

              <p>This is far from semantics. It is a fact that only Buddhism talks about no self and emptiness - other religions establish an inherent existence. This is not semantics, but a quantum leap, a paradigm shift.

              <p><a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness/PasserBy's Seven Stages of Enlightenment</a></p>
              <p><br> <span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;">Stage 1: The Experience of “I AM”</span><br> <br> It was about 20 years back and it all started with the question of 
              “Before birth, who am I”. I do not know why but this question seems to 
              capture my entire being. I can spend days and nights just sitting 
              focusing, pondering over this question; till one day, everything seemed 
              to come to a complete standstill, not even a single thread of thought 
              arise. There is merely nothing and completely void, only this pure sense
               of existence. This mere sense of I, this Presence, what is it? It is 
              not the body, not thought as there is no thought, nothing at all, just 
              Existence itself. There is no need for anyone to authenticate this 
              understanding.<br> <br> At that moment of realization, I experience tremendous flow of energy 
              being released. It is as if life is expressing itself through my body 
              and I am merely nothing but this expression. However at that point in 
              time, I am still unable to fully understand what this experience is and 
              how I have misunderstood its nature.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;">Stage 2: The Experience of “I AM Everything”</span><br> <br> It seems that my experience is supported by many Advaita and Hindu 
              teachings. But the biggest mistake I made is when I spoke to a Buddhist 
              friend, he told me about the doctrine of no-self, about no ‘I’. I 
              rejected such doctrine outright as it is in direct contradiction with 
              what I experienced. I was deeply confused for some time and could not 
              appreciate why Buddha has taught this doctrine and worst still make it a
               Dharma Seal. Until one day, I experienced the fusing of everything into
               ‘Me’ but somehow there is no ‘me’. It is like an “I-less I’. I somehow 
              accepted the 'no I' idea but then I still insist that Buddha shouldn't 
              have put it that way...<br> <br> The experience is wonderful, it is as if I am totally emancipated, a 
              complete release without boundary. I told myself I am totally convinced 
              that I am no more confused so I wrote a poem (something like the below),<br> <br> I am the rain<br> I am the sky<br> I am the ‘blueness’<br> The color of the sky<br> Nothing is more real than the I<br> Therefore Buddha, I am I.<br> <br> There is a phrase for this experience -- Whenever and wherever there IS,
               the IS is Me. This phrase is like a mantra to me. I often use this to 
              lead me back into the experience of Presence.<br> <br> The rest of the journey is the unfolding and further refining of this 
              experience of Total Presence but somehow there is always this blockage, 
              this ‘something’ preventing me from recapturing the experience. It is 
              the inability to fully ‘die’ into total Presence..<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;">Stage 3: Entering Into a State of Nothingness</span><br> <br> Somehow something is blocking the natural flow of my innermost essence 
              and preventing me from re-living the experience. Presence is still there
               but there is no sense of ‘totality’. It was both logically and 
              intuitively clear that ‘I’ is the problem. It is the ‘I’ that is 
              blocking; it is the ‘I’ that is the limit; it is the ‘I’ that is the 
              boundary but why can’t I do away with it? At that point in time it 
              didn’t occur to me that I should look into the nature of awareness and 
              what awareness is all about, instead, I was too occupied with the art of
               entering into a state of oblivious to rid the ‘I’...this continues for 
              the next 13+ years (in between of course there are many other minor 
              events and the experience of total presence did occur many times but 
              with few months of gap)…<br> <br> However I came to one important understanding –<br> The ‘I’ is the root cause of all artificialities, true freedom is in 
              spontaneity. Surrender into complete nothingness and everything simply 
              Self So.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;">Stage 4: Presence as Mirror Bright Clarity </span><br> <br> I got in touch with Buddhism in 1997. Not because I wanted to find out 
              more about the experience of ‘Presence’ but rather the teaching of 
              impermanence syncs deeply with what I experience in life. I am faced 
              with the possibility of losing all my wealth and more by financial 
              crisis. At that point in time I have no idea that Buddhism is so 
              profoundly rich on the aspect of ‘Presence’. The mystery of life cannot 
              be understood, I sought for a refuge in Buddhism to alleviate my sorrows
               caused by the financial crisis but it turned out to be the missing key 
              towards experiencing total presence.<br> <br> I wasn’t that resistant then about the doctrine of ‘no-self’ but the 
              idea that all phenomenal existence is empty of an inherent ‘self’ or 
              ‘Self’ did not quite get into me. Are they talking about the ‘Self’ as a
               personality or ‘Self’ as ‘Eternal Witness’? Must we do away even with 
              the ‘Witness’ itself or the Witness is another illusion itself?<br> <br> There is thinking, no thinker<br> There is sound, no hearer<br> Suffering exists, no sufferer<br> Deeds there are, no doer<br> <br> I was meditating the above stanza deeply… about its meaning until one 
              day, suddenly I heard ‘tongss…’, it was so clear, there was nothing 
              else, just the sound and nothing else! And ‘tongs…’ resounding…. It was 
              so clear, so vivid!<br> <br> That experience is so familiar, so real and so clear. It is the same 
              experience of “I AM”….it is without thought, without concepts, without 
              intermediary, without anyone there, without any in-between…What is it? 
              IT is Presence! But this time it is not ‘I AM’, it is not asking ‘who am
               I’, it is not the pure sense of “I AM”, it is ‘TONGSss….’, the pure 
              Sound…<br> Then comes Taste, just the Taste and nothing else….<br> The heart beats…..<br> The Scenery…<br> <br> There is no gap in between, no longer a few months gap for it to arise…<br> There never was a stage to enter, no I to cease and never has it existed<br> There is no entry and exit point…<br> There is no Sound out there or in here…<br> There is no ‘I’ apart from the arising and ceasing…<br> The manifold of Presence….<br> Moment to moment Presences unfolds…<br></p>
              <blockquote> Comments:<br> <br> This is the beginning of seeing through no-self.  Insight into no-self 
              has arisen but non-dual experience is still very much 'Brahman' than 
              'Sunyata'; in fact it is more Brahman than ever.  Now "I AMness" is 
              experienced in All.<br> <br> Nevertheless it is a very important key phase where practitioner 
              experiences a quantum leap in perception untying the dualistic knot.  
              This is also the key insight leading to the realization that "All is 
              Mind", all is just this One Reality.<br> <br> The tendency to extrapolate an Ultimate Reality or Universal 
              Consciousness where we are part of this Reality remains surprisingly 
              strong.  Effectively the dualistic knot is gone but the bond of seeing 
              things inherently isn't.  'Dualistic' and 'inherent' knots that prevent 
              the fully experiencing of our Maha, empty and non-dual nature of 
              pristine awareness are two very different 'perceptual spells' that 
              blind.<br> <br> The subsection "On Second Stanza" of the post <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html#SecondStanza">"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness and Spontaneous Perfection"</a> further elaborates this insight.</blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;">Stage 5: No Mirror Reflecting</span><br> <br> <span style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">There is no mirror reflecting<br> All along manifestation alone is.<br> The one hand claps<br> Everything IS!<br> </span><br> Effectively Phase 4 is merely the experience of non-division between 
              subject/object.  The initial insight glimpsed from the anatta stanza is 
              without self but in the later phase of my progress; it appears more like
               subject/object is an inseparable union, than absolutely no-subject.  
              This is precisely the 2nd case of the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/01/three-levels-of-understanding-of-non.html">Three levels of understanding Non-Dual</a>.  I was still awed by the pristineness and vividness of phenomena in phase 4.<br> <br> Phase 5 is quite thorough in being no one and I would call this anatta 
              in all 3 aspects -- no subject/object division, no doer-ship and absence
               of agent.<br> <br> The trigger point here is the direct and thorough seeing that 'the 
              mirror is nothing more than an arising thought'.  With this, the 
              solidity and all the grandeur of 'Brahman' goes down the drain.  Yet it 
              feels perfectly right and liberating without the agent and being simply 
              as an arising thought or as a vivid moment of bell resounding. All the 
              vividness and presence remains with an additional sense of freedom.  
              Here a mirror/reflection union is clearly understood as flawed, there is
               only vivid reflection.  There cannot be a 'union' if there isn't a 
              subject to begin with.  Only in subtle recalling, that is, a thought 
              recalling a previous moment of thought, that the watcher seems to exist.
                From here, I moved towards the 3rd degree of non-dual.<br> <br> <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">The Stanza One complements and refines Stanza Two</a> to make the experience of no-self thorough and effortless into just 
              only chirping birds, drum beats, footsteps, sky, mountain, walking, 
              chewing and tasting; no witness whatsoever hiding anywhere!  
              'Everything' is a process, event, manifestation and phenomenon, nothing 
              ontological or having an essence.<br> <br> This phase is a very thorough non-dual experience; there is 
              effortlessness in non-dual and one realizes that in seeing always just 
              scenery and in hearing, always just sounds.  We find true delights in 
              naturalness and ordinariness as commonly expressed in Zen as 'chop wood,
               carry water; spring comes, grass grows'.  With regards to ordinariness 
              (see <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html#Maha">"On Maha in Ordinariness"</a>),
               it must also be correctly understood.  A recent conversation with Simpo
               summarizes what I am trying to convey with regards to ordinariness.  
              Simpo (Longchen) is a very insightful and sincere practitioner, there 
              are some very good quality articles written by him regarding non-duality
               in his website <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/08/longchensimpos-articles.html">Dreamdatum.</a><br></p>
              <blockquote> Yes Simpo,<br> <br> Non-dual is ordinary as there is 'no-beyond' stage to arrive at. It 
              appears to be extraordinary and grandeur only as an afterthought due to 
              comparison.<br> <br> That said, the maha experience appearing as "universe chewing" and the 
              spontaneity of pristine happening must still remain maha, free, 
              boundless and clear. For that is what it is and cannot be otherwise. The
               "extraordinariness and grandeur" that result from comparison must also 
              be correctly discerned from the 'what is' of non-dual.<br> <br> Whenever contraction steps in, it is already a manifestation of 
              'experiencer-experience split'. Conventionally speaking, that being the 
              cause, that being the effect. Whatever the condition is, be it the 
              result of unfavorable situations or subtle recalling to arrive at 
              certain good sensation or attempting to fix an imaginary split, we have 
              to treat it that the 'non-dual' insight has not pervaded into our entire
               being like the way 'karmic tendency to divide' does. We have not 
              fearlessly, openly and unreservedly welcome whatever is. :-)<br> <br> Just my view, a causal sharing. </blockquote>
              <p>Practitioners up to this level often get over excited and misunderstand 
              that this phase is final; in fact it does appear to be a sort of pseudo 
              finality.  Nothing much can be said.  Practitioner will also be 
              naturally led into spontaneous perfection without going further emptying
               the aggregates.  :-)<br> <br> For further comments: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/210722?page=6">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/210722?page=6</a><br></p>
              <blockquote> Comments:<br> <br> The drop is thorough, the center is gone. The center is nothing more 
              than a subtle karmic tendency to divide. A more poetic expression would 
              be sound hears, scenery sees, the dust is the mirror.  Transient 
              phenomenon itself has always been the mirror; only strong dualistic view
               prevents the seeing.<br> <br> Very often cycles after cycles of refining our insights are needed to 
              make non-dual less 'concentrative' and more 'effortless'.  This relates 
              to experiencing the non-solidity and spontaneity of experience.  The 
              subsection "On First Stanza" of the post <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html#FirstStanza">"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness and Spontaneous Perfection"</a> further elaborates this phase of insight.<br> <br> At this phase, we must be clear that emptying the subject will only 
              result in non-duality and there is a need to further empty the 
              aggregates, 18 dhatus.  This means one must further penetrate the 
              emptiness nature of the 5 aggregates, 18 dhatus with dependent 
              origination and emptiness.  Practitioner now moves from 'Brahman' to 
              'Sunyata'.  This individual stream of consciousness is itself non-dual 
              and entire; the need to reify a Universal Brahman is understood as the 
              karmic tendency to 'solidify' experiences.  This leads to the 
              understanding of the empty nature of non-dual presence.</blockquote>

              does not exist in actuality (anatta), there are only the aggregates.  
              However even the aggregates are empty (Heart Sutra).  It may sound 
              obvious but more often than not, even a practitioner that has matured 
              the anatta experience (as in phase 5) will miss the essence of it.<br> <br> As I have said earlier, phase 5 do appear to be final and it is 
              pointless to emphasize anything.  Whether one proceeds further to 
              explore this empty nature of Presence and move into the Maha world of 
              suchness will depend on our conditions.<br> <br> At this juncture, it is necessary to have clarity on what Emptiness is not to prevent misunderstandings:<br></p>
              <blockquote> • Emptiness is not a substance<br> • Emptiness is not a substratum or background<br> • Emptiness is not light<br> • Emptiness is not consciousness or awareness<br> • Emptiness is not the Absolute<br> • Emptiness does not exist on its own<br> • Objects do not consist of emptiness<br> • Objects do not arise from emptiness<br> • Emptiness of the "I" does not negate the "I"<br> • Emptiness is not the feeling that results when no objects are appearing to the mind<br> • Meditating on emptiness does not consist of quieting the mind<br> <br> Source: <a href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html">Non-Dual Emptiness Teaching</a></blockquote>
              <p>And I would like to add,<br> <br> Emptiness is not a path of practice<br> Emptiness is not a form of fruition<br> <br> Emptiness is the ground of all experiences.  There is nothing to attain 
              or practice.  What we have to realize is this ground, this 
              ‘ungraspability’, ‘unlocatability ’ and ‘interconnectedness’ nature of 
              all vivid arising.  Emptiness will reveal that not only is there no 
              ‘who’ in pristine awareness, there is no ‘where’ and ‘when’. Be it ‘I’, 
              ‘Here’ or ’Now’, all are simply impressions that dependently originate 
              in accordance to the principle of conditionality.<br></p>
              <blockquote> <strong>When there is this, that is.<br> With the arising of this, that arises.<br> When this is not, neither is that.<br> With the cessation of this, that ceases.</strong></blockquote>
              <p>The profundity of this four-liner principle of conditionality is not in words.  For a more theoretical exposition, see <a href="http://www.heartofnow.com/files/emptiness.html#ee">Non-Dual Emptiness Teachings</a> by Dr. Greg Goode; for a more experiential narration, see the subsection <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">"On Emptiness" and "On Maha"</a> of the post "On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness and Spontaneous Perfection".<br></p>
              <blockquote> Comments:<br> <br> Here practice is clearly understood as neither going after the mirror 
              nor escaping from the maya reflection; it is to thoroughly 'see' the 
              'nature' of reflection.  To see that there is really no mirror other 
              than the on-going reflection due to our emptiness nature. Neither is 
              there a mirror to cling to as the background reality nor a maya to 
              escape from. Beyond these two extreme lies the middle path -- the prajna
               wisdom of seeing that the maya is our Buddha nature.<br> <br> I am unable to express well in words this empty nature of presence.  The article <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html">Madhyamika Buddhism Vis-a-vis Hindu Vedanta</a> narrates this experience pretty well.<br> <br> The last 3 subsections ("On Emptiness", "On Maha in Ordinariness", "Spontaneous Perfection") of the post <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html#Emptiness">"On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness and Spontaneous Perfection"</a> elaborates this phase of emptiness insight and the gradual progress of 
              maturing the experience into the effortless mode of practice.  It is 
              important to know that in addition to the experience of the 
              unfindability and ungraspability of emptiness, the interconnectedness of
               everything creating the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html#Maha">Maha experience</a> is equally precious.</blockquote>
              <p><span style="font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold;">Stage 7: Presence is Spontaneously Perfected</span><br> <br> After cycles and cycles of refining our practice and insights, we will come to this realization:<br></p>
              <blockquote> Anatta is a seal, not a stage.<br> Awareness has always been non-dual.<br> Appearances have always been Non-arising.<br> All phenomena are ‘interconnected’ and by nature Maha.<br> Emptiness is the ground of all experiences.</blockquote>
              <p>All are always and already so.  Only dualistic and inherent views are 
              obscuring these experiential facts and therefore what is really needed 
              is simply to experience whatever arises openly and unreservedly (See 
              section "<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html#SpontaneousPerfection">On Spontaneous Perfection</a>").
                However this does not denote the end of practice; practice simply 
              moves to become dynamic and conditions-manifestation based.  The ground 
              and the path of practice become indistinguishable.<br></p>
              <blockquote> Comments:<br> <br> The entire article of <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection</a> can be seen as the different approaches toward the eventual realization of this already perfect nature of awareness. </blockquote>

              <p>I think what fugazzi have said are very much concordant with
              buddhism. So I don’t understand the bickering happneing over here.
              I see there is a parrellel (or at least on the surface) Perhaps,
              Fugazzi lacks an understanding of Buddhism (or pretend to be lack
              of it). If he knows Buddhism, i don’t think he would have wasting
              time here in this forum.</p>
              <p>With regard to the issue of view, I think there is an agreement
              here. To quote Nagarjuna:</p>
              <p>Ultimate serenity is the coming to rest of all ways of taking
              things, the repose of named things; no truth has been taught by a
              Buddha for anyone, anywhere. – Nagarjuna</p>
              <p>So, in my understanding, the <span>RIGHT VIEW</span> the buddhists and <span>AEN</span> talking about is the an
              expression of the above insight. It is not any <span>CONCEPTUAL</span> human <span>FABRICATION</span>. It
              should not be confused with the dictionary meaning of ‘view’ ( to
              borrow your words heheheh&amp;#8230<img title="Wink" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink">.</p>
              <p>I guess that is what trigger off your objection to <span>AEN</span> posts</p>
              <p>In the same vein, what you have been preaching can be said to
              constitute a ‘view’ as well. Of course, you may resist and prefer
              to resort to words play. If you think that having such a ‘view’ (as
              opposed to dictionary view) is an obstacle to realising reality,
              then you should stop talking for what you said can also be an
              obstacle.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the Buddha teaches us to take things with
              detachment. To take things with detachment is to view the mutitude
              of things <span>AS IT IS WITHOUT IMPOSING CONCEPTUAL AS
              WELL AS EMOTIONAL FABRICATIONS</span>. This what the Buddha means
              by <span>THUSNESS</span> or <span>SUCHNESS</span>. Many has misunderstood <span>THUSNESS</span> as meaning a transcendental reality that can
              only be described at best in <span>APOPHATIC</span> terms.
              This is <span>WRONG</span>. In fact the so-called
              ‘transcendent’ like <span>GOD</span> is just another kind

              Fugazzi. (some more 4 U)
              ..............................................................................................................................................
              One can play mind games (pious egoism is more like it) but one's intuitive heart never lies!
              ..............................................................................................................................................
              ..............................................................................................................................................
              Hence I use the word pond for the mind and river for the heart (aka soul, god or whatever resonates with oneslef)
              ..............................................................................................................................................
              
              You seem to suggest there are two mode of experiencing, namely through the mind/consciousness and heart. You also appear to associate the logic/conceptual with the inherent nature of the mind, and the intuition with the heart. Hence, effectively, you have dichotomised two modes of access to knowledge, with the latter being limited and cannot be trusted. This mistaken view led you to assert that those that engage the mind in meditation are playing mind game (which you have explicitly mentioned).
              
              
              We cannot talk about emotions in separation from the mind. Sadness and happiness is a state of the mind, not the heart. It is the state of mind that influence the heartbeat and bloodflow, arousing sensation and emotions, which are physiological manifestation of the mind. Similarly we can only have a bad or good mind but not a bad or good heart, although in the convention of language we put it in this way. When speak of a painful heart or a bad heart, we do it as a convention of language.  Convention is NOT EQUAL to reality. 
              
              
              I can create a synthetic / artificial heart and install it into a machine, but can the resulting machine express any emotion??? Can an inanimate object without mind/consciousness has emotions? Emotional complexity correlates with how highly evolved our consciousness is. The origination of emotion ultimately trace back to the mind, not the heart. Even love ultimately involves the mind not the heart. Disposition, which partly influences who you love, trace back to the mind, not the heart.
              
              
              So, the soul, god or whatever label (which you believe to exist) can only be found in the mind/consciousness, not in the heart.
              
              
              Both intuition and discursive (analytical, conceptual) thinking are two modes in which our mind flows.
              
              
              Intuition comes from the mind not the heart. Intuition is not even emotion. Intuition is NOT EQUAL to EMOTION. You seem to confuse the two. 
              
              
              Therefore, there is only a flowing (river) or non-flowing (pond) mind. There is no such thing as a flowing (river) heart and a non-flowing (pond) mind. A mind in its natural state (devoid of conceptual fabrications) is flowing, while a mind that is contrived with concepts is inhibited. 
              
              
              Therefore, we can only access the ultimate reality via the mind, not the heart, by liberating â€˜intoâ€™ (as opposed to â€˜out ofâ€™) the natural luminosity state of our mind, which have always been there but is obscured by human thoughts (much like a sun obscured by the clouds). This is what the Buddhist call direct un-mediated knowledge via intuition (NOT EMOTION).
              
              
              The heart does not play any part at all. If anyone cannot get this right (like Fugazzi), he is not just playing a mind games, but also an EMOTIONAL GAME. These people are not only imposing subtle concepts unknowingly on their experiences but human emotions as well.  This this reason why people, like fugazzi, who fathom the ultimate with emotions always describe their experience with phrases like â€˜ecstaticâ€˜and â€˜flowing or outpouring of love and spiritualityâ€™. They are using human emotions as an epistemological base of knowledge.
              
              
              This mistaken view is a result of a lack of understanding of the nature of our mind. People who are too afraid or feel threatened (religious ego), like Fugazzi, to explore their mind by meditation will never attain true knowledge.
              
              
              If fugazzi confuses intuition with emotions, I afraid to put much credibility on what he has preached.
              
              Just my 0.5 cents worth of comment. I don't claim to be an expert just like you.

              The heart does not play any part at all. If anyone cannot get this right (like Fugazzi), he is not just playing a mind games, but also an EMOTIONAL GAME. These people are not only imposing subtle concepts unknowingly on their experiences but human emotions as well. This this reason why people, like fugazzi, who fathom the ultimate with emotions always describe their experience with phrases like â€˜ecstaticâ€˜and â€˜flowing or outpouring of love and spiritualityâ€™. They are using human emotions as an epistemological base of knowledge.

              That is the reason why a Sufis WEEPS.

              It seems that most of my postings seems to be creating paranoia , it could be that of a straw-clutching stance that one's beliefs one's traditions, one's '"bible'' is questioned and this defense seems premised on numbers as opposed to questioning, examining. ? I can understand the seekers, but followers, know lah, they are just sheep. 
              Most seem to not know the difference between pschological growth as opposed to spiritual growth. The former is easy, just repeat knowledge, repeat, and use the past to ... hence it is intellectual,  a reaction, the latter is that of responding and that has no past in it. It is intelligence and being intelligent does not need the past!
              If one is earnest about truth, one need not form a ''club'' truth cannot be found in a club, and is there such a thing as collective truth. One has to grapple with this reality - is one seeking truth or is one just belonging to a Ã§lub cos of one's insecurity or one needs to be in a group to be validated.
              
              This presupposes self-honesty and of course, that sadly cannot be found in any book, scripture, temple or church. 
              
              Last but not least, anyone is free to spout ,, label or ... even castigate me ... the problem is not mine, the problem is inside the one who is reacting to what my postings challenge or ....  That cirumstances create people is a myth, reality is that it reveals, what is denied, what one is attached to  ... surfaces. 
              The irony of it is this - why personalize it? must be an attachment? must be a sense of self that is derived from a belief, a tradition or an attachment. One should not discount this - ego gratification/glory.  So much for awakening!
              
              Ps - when one judges another one assume that one is talking or remarking about another - no lah, the other is a mere excuse, the reality of the one judging speaks volumes of what is inside of this person. me not excluded

              Correction:
              
              You seem to suggest there are two mode of experiencing, namely through the mind/consciousness and heart. You also appear to associate the logic/conceptual with the inherent nature of the mind, and the intuition with the heart. Hence, effectively, you have dichotomised two modes of access to knowledge, with the FORMER being limited and cannot be trusted. This mistaken view led you to assert that those that engage the mind in meditation are playing mind game (which you have explicitly mentioned).

It has to be through these concepts that we free the attachments and, only then, can we use concepts freely without attachments.

However when I do not ''believe'' or ''disbelieve'' and allow it to happen as it happens, then i m being in space and being ''space'' there is no boundary and one cannot be enclosed!

One can relax and flow or one can make a goal out relaxation (meditation not excluded, idea of .....) and most likely the latter stance is no longer of flowing but futurizing.
