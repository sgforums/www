              <p>Hey everyone, I've been at what I jokingly refer to as the international buddhist buffet table for 2 plus years now. Read some books from different traditions, took the precepts under a theravadin monk, gone to dharma/dhamma talks... and is still trying to keep to a regular (samatha) meditation schedule.</p>
              <p>But nothing hardcore yet. No retreats, hardly any intense practice that will result in actual insight. While I don't plan to exclude any tradition from my studies, I do plan to stop just dabbling like a buffet diner and get down to really working towards enlightenment, which pretty much requires you to have serious practice in a tradition first.</p>
              <p>The problem now, is that while I have an idea what tradition I wouldn't follow (at least, at this point in time), I'm equally attracted to both chan/zen and theravada. Theravada was what got me interested in buddhism once again, given it's very down to earth teachings (personal view. brothers and sisters from other traditions, please don't get offended), but perhaps because of my conditioning when I was young, chan draws my interest very much as well.</p>
              <p>So my question to everyone here is, what advice do you have for me? Is there any way that can help determine what kind of practice I might be better suited for?</p>

              <p>In the end, it has to do with what you feel resonates with you... nobody can give you a straight answer.</p>
              <p>If Buddha were here, there is no such thing as traditionS. Now there are so many traditions, and none are more valid than another because there is no central authority who decides things (there is no such thing as a Buddhist Pope), you just have to discern yourself and follow what you feel close to heart.</p>
              <p>I would advice my own kind of practice (<a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com</a>), because that is what worked for me, but I cannot say it will resonate with others. I think all authentic teachers will do the same - recommend their own practice but do not say theirs is the only one that works or that it will suit everyone. You just have to find things out yourself.</p>
              <p>Personally, Zen's direct approach to realizing buddha-nature strikes close to heart, but I don't consider myself a Zen Buddhist.</p>

              <p>Jui,</p>
              <p>Personally, I would prefer to choose based on a method that resonates, rather than to choose purely based on tradition. </p>
              <p>Since you say you've been at the international buffet table for some time, you must have had a chance to do some sampling.  What has worked for you?  Which fits in better with your lifestyle?</p>
              <p>AEN was saying above that he likes the Zen direct approach.  But for me, I prefer a gradual approach because I'm the type that tends to lift the lid of the kettle to check if the water is boiling.  A gradual approach will yield me experiences in small increments until stabilisation of experience.  Building up a great ball of doubt in the context of working with <em>koans/huatous</em> somehow doesn't sit well with my temperament. </p>
              <p>I've also read somewhere that people with tendency towards discursive thinking will favour direct inquiry and those who are more intuitive will favour a sitting practice like <em>shikantaza</em>.  I chose to join a short-term Zen meditation class because I wanted to properly learn <em>shikantaza</em> - having tried it out a little on my own at home - and that was even before I'd read about the above criteria for choosing a Zen method. </p>
              <p>I think resonance does matter.  You will know for yourself what suits you.</p>
              <p>Only my 2 cents... /\</p>

              There is no restriction of attending teachings from different traditions. It does not mean that you practise Theravada tradition, cannot attend Zen teaching. In fact, I don't think there are contradictions at all because the teachings teaches the same thing : The Four Noble Truth and the Noble Eightfold Path. 
                           
              I have personally explored different traditions before eventually settle down  on a path that resonate best with oneself. You will know when it comes to you. Just have faith in the Triple Gems. Perhaps perhaps it is time for you to attend some retreat! :)

              <p>Thank you all for your replies!<br><br>Metta with Mindfulness: Yes I'm definitely not going to be exclusively follow one tradition.Yes, I'll be seeing if I can attend some retreat in 2012. Now that I've read my post a few times, I realised I wasn't very clear on my topic. What I really should have asked was, for my main practice, which tradition's should I follow. Your, and everyone's advice is true though, no one can do it for me. <br><br>realization: Thanks for the post about your choice of practice, it's interesting that you mentioned discursive thoughts, because the desire to have some form of control over stopping them was what got me re-accquaintant with buddhism. Hmm...<br><br>Also, not sure if this is relevant, but here's a list of practices I've done/ am doing, and my "results". Any advice, guidance, admonishments very welcome:<br><br>Shamatha: Mainly just counting the breath. 150 breaths a day before sleep, takes about 1/2 hour. Still finding it hard to concentrate on the breath without counting, although any state only occur when I don't count and just concentrate on the breath.<br><br>Mantras/Chanting: Gets into concentration decently enough, but I believe doing this wouldn't actually lead to any realisation right? Strange side effect is that my vision started to grey out when I was chanting.</p>
              <p>Koans: Haven't managed to develop that great doubt and persistence yet. "Who am I?" yields "I am what is occuring now". "What is my original face before my parents were born" yields... nothing. As in, can't even answer.</p>
              <p>Actual observing: This is what I do the most nowadays. Whenever I get a chance to not have to interact with people I'll just observe my sensations. Currently, just realised more and more that the body really is in an auto-pilot mode of sorts.

              This is meant for those who are on the journey of â€™â€™discoveringâ€™â€™/ â€™â€™recognisingâ€™â€™ the source of oneâ€™s creation (awakening,nirvana or so on so forth - which are merely labelsn concepts). This entails being a lion, being courageous, willingness to question and examining of beliefs and being open to finding out. This entails seeing, one cannot conclude n how to conclude that which is an existential happening (not to be confused with dictionary meaning).
              
              It is never meant for followers. Following entails being sheep, cos those who follow without questionig or exploring are simply too weak-minded and there is no journeying at all, simply parroting and quoting â€¦. This simply entails looking for â€¦ and one can only look for something already concluded, definitions, concepts and ... and look for it in something to reaffirm and repeat â€¦.
              
              Who is being the â€™â€™lionâ€™â€™ or who is being the â€™â€™sheepâ€™â€™ â€“ oneâ€™s intuitve heart never lies.
               
              Ps - when one gets offended or feels threatend about one's beliefs/traditions, then jolly well it is simply identifying with ... to prop oneself up. One's sense of self is threatened and hence the straw-cluthcing stance of being defensive.

              all isms lead nowhere excepting collecting knowledge and how can one find what is truth, one cannot find it , one can expereince it and of course the latter when it is accumulated it is no longer truth but simply becomes knowledge. When i think of myself as a buddhist, as a Hindu or â€¦ i cease to think. Why do i say that ? cos i am simply will latch onto scriptures and ... to affirm my thinking.  Even when i do think or seek or look for ... all i am going to to do is look for something in the scriptures, sutras to re-affirm. This stance belies fear and the fear is that of one could be wrong, one's belief may not hold up to reality.
              
              
               Why? cos my sense of self is propped up by my leaning on isms n .... and the moment one challenges it or questions it â€“ my sense of self is threatened. I notice this amongst most believers, when one is an atheist one is still belieiving, when one is not being an atheist one still believes. The human mind can only be sustained when something is certain. One can find a Buddhist mind, One can find a Christian mind, can one find a buddhsit heart? can one find a Christian heart. Till the latter is understood, acknowledged one is simply stuck.
              
              PS - To assume that truth can be only be found via of Buddha 's  ...  is to cancel out  the wisdom of others. Stupidity is to assume that there is only Buddhsim wisdom, Christian wisdom or Hindu wisdom. Like i mentioned before, wisdom, truth transcends all isms

              @fugazzi: I have studied other religions before, and have even practiced their methods before. It is not due to blind faith that I made the statement that Buddhism is unique. Buddhism is by far the only religion that teachers dependent origination, anatta (no self) and emptiness - without which there cannot be liberation. I speak of this from my personal experience and progress of insight.
              
              Because you do not understand the importance of right view, you will not be able to appreciate the importance of Buddha's teachings. As I wrote before:
              
              ...Also, a lot of people think 'The Right View is No View' which is true since all metaphysical views pertain to false views of existence and non-existence, however the way they go about resolving the problem is by 'forgetting all concepts'. They think that by suspending all beliefs, by forgetting all concepts and sitting quietly in a state of pure awareness, somehow merely by that, they can overcome false views. Let me offer something for you think about: every day we go into a state of deep sleep where all our beliefs, concepts, views, thoughts are temporarily suspended. But when we wake up, what happens? We are as ignorant as ever. Our framework of viewing self and reality is still the same. We still experience the same problems, the same sufferings, the same afflictions. This analogy should clearly show you that sustaining a state of non-conceptuality or mastering a state of 'forgetting the self' is not going to result in a fundamental change or transformation or effortless seeing, unless true wisdom and insight arises. I shall offer two more analogies which are related: a person deluded as to see a rope as a snake, will live in fear, trying to tame the snake, trying to get rid of the snake, escape from the snake. Maybe he managed a way to distant himself from the snake, yet the belief that the snake is still there is nevertheless going to haunt him.
              
              Even if he managed to master the state of forgetting the snake, he is nonetheless in a state of delusion. He has not seen as it truly is: the snake is simply a rope. In another analogy, the child believes in the existence of santa claus and awaits eagerly for arrival of his presents on Christmas day. One day the parents decide that it's time the child be told the truth about santa claus. To do this, beating the hell out of the child is not going to work. You simply need to tell the child that santa claus doesn't truly exist. In these analogies, I try to showcase how trying to deal with the problem of false views through means of 'forgetting conceptuality, forgetting the self' is as useless or deluded as 'trying to forget the snake, trying to tame the snake, trying to beat the hell out of the child' when the simple, direct and only true solution is only to realize that there is only a rope, and that santa claus isn't real. Only Awakening liberates us from a bondage that is without basis.
              
              Without the right contemplation and instilling of right view, you can 'sit quietly in pure awareness' for an entire lifetime without waking up. I cannot stress this point enough because this is a very prevalent erroneous understanding - even someone at the I AM level of realization will talk about non-conceptuality, non-conceptual Presence-Awareness and think it is final. Same goes for other stages. By overemphasizing on non-conceptuality, they will miss the subtler aspects of insight, they will fail to grasp right view, they will fail to tackle the subtler imprints and mental framework of viewing dualistically and inherently. They will not even see their framework of perceiving self and things as false that is causing some subtle effort and clinging (to a Self or to an actual ground here/now or to an actual world), just like you will never see your dream as a dream until well... you wake up.
              
              As Zen writer and speaker Ted Biringer says, "Accurate understanding is not authentic realization. At the same time, authentic realization can hardly be expected to occur without accurate understanding. And while an absence of "right understanding" almost excludes the possibility of authentic realization, the presence of "wrong understanding" excludes even the slimmest hope of success. If we aspire to realize what Zen practice-enlightenment truly is, then, as Dogen says, "We should inquire into it, and we should experience it." To follow his guidance here we will need to understand his view of what "it" is that needs to be inquired into, and who the "we" is that is to do the inquiring."
              
              Non-conceptuality does not mean non-attachment. For example when you realize the I AM, you cling to that pure non-conceptual beingness and consciousness as your true identity. You cling to that pure non-conceptual thought very tightly â€“ you wish to abide in that purest state of presence 24/7. This clinging prevents us from experiencing Presence AS the Transience. This is a form of clinging to something non-conceptual. So know that going beyond concepts does not mean overcoming the view of inherency and its resultant clinging clinging. Even in the substantial non-dual phase, there is still clinging to a Source, a One Mind â€“ even though experience is non-dual and non-conceptual. But when inherent view is dissolved, we see there is absolutely nothing we can cling to, and this is the beginning of Right View and the Path to Nirvana â€“ the cessation of clinging and craving.
              
              So as you can see, non-conceptual, even non-dual experience does not liberate - so we have to use the intellect to understand right view, and then investigate it in our experience. This is like a fire that in the end burns up the candle it is burning on, consuming itself in the process, leaving no trace even of itself. In other words, conceptual understanding of right view, coupled with investigative practice, results in true realization that dissolves concepts leaving non-conceptual wisdom - but without that process of investigating and trying to understand right view, merely remaining in a state of non-conceptuality isn't going to help you get free. People who fear engaging in thought, trying to understand the right view, challenging their views and understanding of things, are unfortunately going to stick with their own deluded framework of perceiving things.
              
              Now having diverted our attention so much, let us return to the subject at hand....
              
              - http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2011/12/experience-realization-view-practice.html
              
              -------------
              
              If you neglect the importance of right view, you will remain stuck in what Thusness calls "the disease of non-conceptuality" and fail to realize the profound dharma that leads to true liberation.
              
              
              Lastly I like to put a link to the Buddha's own words about the uniqueness of his doctrine - because he says it so well in his own words -

              Cula-sihanada Sutta (MN 11) -- The Shorter Discourse on the Lion's Roar {M i 63} [Ã‘anamoli Thera and Bhikkhu Bodhi, trans.]. The Buddha declares that only through practicing in accord with the Dhamma can Awakening be realized. His teaching is distinguished from those of other religions and philosophies through its unique rejection of all doctrines of self. [BB]

              If there is so-called rite view , there must a wrong view? Is not that causing a split within onself.
              Existence knows no wrong, knows no rite, it is a fiction of the human mind.
              Selective deception or attention is still an ego trip!
              All religions whichever form or how it is practiced are merely pointers and they are pointing to ... something that can only be partaken of with being empty.
              Organized religion is flawed that it has reduced them to dogmas, beliefs, doctrines. 
              What is real can only be expeirenced as ti comes or not come ( a paradox) and to add to reality is distortion!

              @fugazzi: yes, the buddha taught that there is right view (karma, rebirth, four noble truths etc) and there is wrong view.
              
              What is wrong view? The Buddha teaches us that self view (the view that self exists) is wrong view. The view of eternal self is wrong view. The view of an annihilationistic self - that self ceases at death and therefore no rebirth and karma, is also wrong view.
              
              In total there are 62 wrong views that he taught in detail.
              
              If you are able to realize no self and dependent origination, automatically you will be freed from wrong views and your irreversible journey to liberation begins.
              
              Otherwise, if wrong view persists, no end to our suffering will be in sight.
              
              Your notion that there cannot be wrong view is the true ego deception that will prevent your progress.

On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between RÄ�jagaha and NÄ�landÄ� together with a great company of bhikkhus, with about five hundred bhikkhus. At the same time the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling along the highway between RÄ�jagaha and NÄ�landÄ� together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta. Along the way, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. But his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

If they should do so, I might not be able to reply. If I could not reply, that would distress me, and that distress would be an obstacle for me.' Therefore, out of fear and loathing of being cross-examined, he does not declare anything to be wholesome or unwholesome. But, when questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: 'I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that it is neither this nor that.'</p>

              <p>"Herein, bhikkhus, a certain recluse or a brahmin is dull and stupid. Due to his dullness and stupidity, when he is questioned about this or that point, he resorts to evasive statements and to endless equivocation: 'If you ask me whether there is a world beyond — if I thought there is another world, I would declare that there is. But I do not take it thus, nor do I take it in that way, nor do I take it in some other way. I do not say that it is not, nor do I say that is neither this nor that.'</p>
