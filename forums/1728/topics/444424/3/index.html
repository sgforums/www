              Selective deception seems to awash here, read this lah - NOT the dictionay meaning of existence and so was for the labels God, Self and ,..... 
              Intellectual understanding (of the mind) is good for passing exams, collecting certificates and what-not.
              Intelligence is of the heart is useless for passing exams n .... 
              Using logic of the mind (intellect) and looking for logic in something that the human mind cannot grasp is fighting with what is not. 
              
              When one's mirror that is thick with the dust of the past (knowledge, traditions beliefs n ...),  one cannot see clearly what is. One only sees what one wants to see, hence one misses! One cannot respond to what is. One merely reacts and all one does is use the past. Of course, the past is dead, it is only alive in the mind. The wise knows and accepts that the illusion of certainty cannot co-exist with existential uncertainty. At the most, one is clutching at straws of certainty!
              
              
              Hence, I say parking oneâ€™s mind nowhere â€“ there is a â€™â€™possibilityâ€™â€™ of finding out. It it not out there but an inward journey and a journey not to attain or not attain cos there is nothing to be attained. Can two emptinesses meet? Can two beings meet?
              Transformation happens from the inner knowing. Change always from the outside. Change is akin to pruning the leaves and branches of a tree, it is superficial. Transformation is examining the roots and making the change from within. It has depth and there is a difference.
              
              Religion is that of being a spotlight and spirituality is that of being a floodlite.

              does the fish in the sea feel the need to look for the sea, does it feel thirsty?
              Juggling semantics is commendable and to be mired in selective deception/attention and simply parroting and quotining texts to prop oneself is playing mind games.
              Only in Buddhism, this is pious egoism. Hence, I saythis, when what is not experienced and it is not a living reality - it is tantamount to lying

              Can you elaborate further what does your â€œwhat is trueâ€¦.â€� refers specifically to? In your opinion, should we also transcends this â€œWHAT IS TRUE (not truth)â€�? If we are to transcend religion but bind ourselves to the â€œWHAT IS TRUE (not truth)â€�, are we not the same as being bound and confined to religions, dogma, and views?
              
              Can what is true be compressed into a box? what is â€™â€™riteâ€™â€™ now can become a â€™â€™wrongâ€™â€™ the next instant. What is true now may become untrue. Hence I uttered what is true, not truth â€“ what is true â€“ it is a continuous tense, eg My being rude can end , my being polite can end. However when I m labelled as stupid, clever or smart â€“ i am already reduced into a thing, a labelled product is finished. Hence, this word â€™â€™beingâ€™â€™ may appear like another concept â€“ on closer srutiny it is akin to a river flowing (rivering). it is existential and always moving and yet not moving (it is a paradoxical phenomenon). The mind is a pond, being is a river (rivering). Hence I say, when one is present to oneâ€™s â€™â€™selfâ€™â€™â€™ (fictional) one is absent to oneâ€™s being

              I think you are 'too overly intelligent' that you have misunderstood my question. I have no problem with understanding of the distinction you made between 'what is true' and the 'truth' that encapsulated in concepts and expressed in language that are inherently limited. In fact, the buddhists are no stranger to what you have been parroting. These are themes that can be found in all buddhist texts. In fact, many forumers in this buddhist forum like AEN, simpo, thusness etc have talked about all the the stuffs you have been parroting in their post at length.
              
              The 'WHAT IS TRUE.....(not truth)' in my question refer to the 'REALITY' you assume to exist that cannot be commpressed in a box, the non-dictionary meaning of 'Truth' vs the conceptual truth, to use your own words.
              
              Nobody here is talking about the small letter conceptual truth with you here.

              Fugazzi, you have not answer my questions. pls don't beat around the bushes by parroting poetries with the same content in different wordings again and agian.
              
              Let me re-post the question here again.
              
              1) Does the " transcendence" you have been talking about also includes the transcendence of the notion and belief in GOD to attain true liberation? Or do you implicitly make the notion of GOD an exception? [Note: here the label GODnot does  refer to the everyday dictionary meaning]
              
              2) Can you elaborate further what does your "what is true...." refers specifically to? In your opinion, should we also transcends this "WHAT IS TRUE (not truth)"??? If we are to transcend religion but bind ourselves to the "WHAT IS TRUE (not truth)", are we not the same as being bound and confined to religions, dogma, and views?? [Note: I have clarify the usage of 'what is true' in this question in my previous post]
              
              To borrow your words, the GOD and 'WHAT IS TRUE' refer to your meaning of your analogy of the Sun that exists regardless of whether you believe or not.
              
              In other words, should we transcend YOUR SUN as well????????
              
              Hope that this time is clear enough and you will no disapoint me..... hehehehehe......hahaahah

              When one is being empty, there is a chance, however behind the facade is of subtle deception, it is simply bullshitting
              
              One thing that is so palpable is that of constipated with concepts and all discussions seem to emnate from or is premised on this conceptualising stance. If i m afflicted with the disease as some here seem to feel so, it is fine, I m not latching onto some sutra, scripture and copying and pasting and quoting people. 
              
              One is free to spout anything, I dont care much for whether it is accepted, embraced or subscribed.
              This is the fallacy of organized religion, can truth be organized?

              Just like 'YOUR SUN' that exists regardless of whether you believe or not, likewise the REALITY THAT BUDDHISM is the COMPLETE PATH to LIBERATION IS UNDENIABLE, whether you like it or not. 
              
              By the way, what you have been parroting are actually buddhist stuffs, less your attachment to your subtle GOD.
              
              Im sure you are more aware than anyone else where your got your stuffs from.
              
              you should spend more time and reserve  your materials for the ISLAM forum. NOT HERE. you are just wasting everbody time here to have a fruitful discussion of buddhism.

              I watch the TV all the time! Anything that does'nt resonate with me, I can say bullshit or switch channels! There many channels for different taste, but objective to viewer is the same, entertainment!
                  There are so many sutras, embodying the noble truths!  Not everybody are able to extract nuggets of wisdom, but even if only one maybe benefit, it is well worth it! Organized religion exist because a lot people respond well to it. When people congregate, it is then possible to plants seeds of Buddhism even as people go about doing religion the way they always has done. You must want to practise Buddhism; meditation, contemplation, whatever! In the meantime, preaching moral conduct; tolerance to devotees, is not a bad thing either.
                  Donations will help sustain the Sangha, which not a bad thing either!

              @Sushism
              God is an empty word, when one is being kind, that is being godly, Can the latter be conceptualised, Cos any moment, one may start being unkind or ...
              notion and belief in GOD to attain true liberation - are all good for discussion and it is still building conceptual skyscrapers! In actual living as long as one is making references to the ideaor belief or defintions of god, awakening or .....  one is bound to add colour to transparency (one's beliefs, one's traditions, one's concepts distort what is or what is not)
              When one transcends these  .... and one is left nothing to hold on to, one is open to ..... one can define a dead thing, can one define what is existential. 
              One can belong to a church, a monastery or ... can one belong to existence? can one step into the same river twice? the latter is existential, one can taste it , one can experience it. The moment one conceptualizes it is already a dead thing, a past.... Hence I use the word pond for the mind and river for the heart (aka soul, god or whatever resonates with oneslef)
              
              What is a fiction needs maintenance cos it belies fear belies insecurity, what is true does not need any maintenance.

              Ya, Buddhsim as taught by the Buddha is not a religion. It only becomes a religion when one reify and hypostasized it. Just like when Emptiness is reify, it become Allah devoid of all human conceptual descriptions (nonetheless, ironically, it can still be affirm as an existent GOD).
              
              No one in this forum is imposing buddhism as a  religion, dogma, doctrine or view on anyone else. We are just communicating the buddha dharma for the benefits of sentient beings, just like what you have been doing which you think is something noble.

              I think what fugazzi have said are very much concordant with buddhism. So I don't understand the bickering happneing over here. I see there is a parrellel (or at least on the surface) Perhaps, Fugazzi lacks an understanding of Buddhism (or pretend to be lack of it). If he knows Buddhism, i don't think he would have wasting time here in this forum.
              
              With regard to the issue of view, I think there is an agreement here. To quote Nagarjuna:
              
              Ultimate serenity is the coming to rest of all ways of taking things, the repose of named things; no truth has been taught by a Buddha for anyone, anywhere.
               - Nagarjuna
              
              So, in my understanding, the RIGHT VIEW the buddhists and AEN talking about is the an expression of the above insight. It is not any CONCEPTUAL human FABRICATION. It should not be confused with the dictionary meaning of 'view' ( to borrow your words heheheh...).
              
              I guess that is what trigger off your objection to AEN posts
              
              In the same vein, what you have been preaching can be said to constitute a 'view' as well. Of course, you may resist and prefer to resort to words play. If you think that having such a 'view' (as opposed to dictionary view) is an obstacle to realising reality, then you should stop talking for what you said can also be an obstacle. 
              
              Ultimately, the Buddha teaches us to take things with detachment. To take things with detachment is to view the mutitude of things AS IT IS WITHOUT IMPOSING CONCEPTUAL AS WELL AS EMOTIONAL FABRICATIONS. This what the Buddha means by THUSNESS or SUCHNESS. Many has misunderstood THUSNESS as meaning a transcendental reality that can only be described at best in APOPHATIC terms. This is WRONG. In fact the so-called 'transcendent' like GOD is just another kind of mental fabrication.

              Certainly, it is a ''mental fabrication'' if one were to have an idea, i never defined god, it would be ''stupid'' to define existence, one can utter what god is not, one can utter what englightenment is not, one can utter what existence is not; this stance allows one to .... in this stance one cannot conclude, how to conclude, except being aware to where is one parking one's mind or not parking! When the knowing of what I am not is a knowing ''phenomenon'' within me, I am going to find out what I am all about. Of course, it all depends whether I am willing to face and unlearn or sweep it under the carpet and bleat away and ignore it.  The question of whether one is learning or unlearning does make a difference.
              There is no monopoly on wisdom, Jesus was wise, Mohd was wise and there were so many others. To attribute it to being Hindu wisdom, Buddhism wisdom is good , yes , good for vested interests. catch the drift?
