              <p><strong>The First Bardo</strong></p>
              <p>The <a href="http://www.lycaeum.org/books/books/psychedelic_experience/tib21.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">first bardo</span></a> comes at the very moment of death, when there dawns the <a href="http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Clear Light of the Ultimate Reality</span></a>. This is the very content and substance of the state of liberation, if only the soul can recognize it and act in a way to remain in that state. The instructions intended to be read at the moment of the person's death are designed to help him do this. He is told, first of all, to embrace this supreme experience not in a selfish and egoistic way but rather with love and compassion for all sentient beings. This will aid him in the second step, which is to realize that his own mind and self is identical with the Clear Light, implying that he himself IS the Ultimate Reality, "the All-good Buddha", transcending time, eternity, and all creation. If he can recognize this while in this supreme state at the moment of death, he will attain liberation-that is, he will remain in the Clear Light forever. This condition is called the "<a href="http://www.selfknowledge.com/109716.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dharmakaya</span></a>", the highest spiritual body of the Buddha.</p>
              <p>Most souls, however, will fail to do this. They will be pulled down by the weight of their karma into the second stage of the first bardo, called the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sunnytees/afterlife22.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secondary Clear Light</span></a> seen immediately after death.At this point, there are separate instructions to be read according to the spiritual condition of the person while in life. For an individual advanced in meditation and other spiritual practices, there is repeated over and over the same instructions as at the moment of death, enjoining him to recognize himself as the Dharmakaya.For a person who was still at a student-level on the spiritual path, there is the injunction for him to meditate on his "tutelary deity", that is, the particular god for whom he performed devotional practices while alive. Finally,"if the deceased be of the common folk", unpracticed in any spiritual disciplines, the instruction is to "meditate upon the Great Compassionate Lord", which is to say an "Avatar" worshipped by the multitude, equivalent to Jesus as conceived by the average Christian.<br><br><strong>The Second Bardo</strong></p>

              <p>I dun have terminal disease, serious illness or anything like that. Kind of just exploring the option, what one would have if one is suffering due to serious sickness, and the serious sickness cant be cured. Just thinking ahead in case I reach that stage.</p>
              <p>And I was thinking å¾€ç”Ÿ is one of the attactive option to end the suffering. Go straight to pureland, and practice from there. But I just kind of a newbie Buddhist. Thats just my idea. I dun noe whether its right or wrong on this.</p>
              <p>If wat u say is true, that will be a great motivation for Buddhist to stay and practice as long as he/she could. Thanx Bro. Appreciate your sharing of info. Great, learning something from this forum every now and then. æ„Ÿæ�©ã€‚</p>

              <p>Thanx... Although I am not into MJK teaching, I browse it thru anyway, and indirectly learn something... Not that I agree with MJK not seeking doctor advice, I think fang xia (letting it go) is important. 'cause it will make one be clear in his/ her perspective. The more one worry about one's sickness, it might get worse, 'cause the perspective is clouded. Wrong choices might be made.</p>

              It has been speculated that when we die(and born), our pineal gland (somewhere deep  between our eyes)are triggered, releasing DMT, that allows us see our life in a flash.

              <p>This quote comes from the Larger Amitayus Sutra, but is æ–·ç« å�–ç¾©. The complete passage should be,</p>
              <h3><strong>In this world, you should extensively
              plant roots of virtue, be benevolent, give
              generously, abstain from breaking the precepts,
              be patient and diligent, teach people with
              sincerity and wisdom, do virtuous deeds,
              and practice good. If you strictly observe
              the precepts of abstinence with upright thought
              and mindfulness even for a day and a night,
              the merit acquired will surpass that
              of practicing good in the land of Amitayus
              for a hundred years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason is that in
              that Buddha-land of effortless spontaneity
              all the inhabitants do good without committing
              even a hair's breadth of evil.</span> If in this
              world you do good for ten days and nights,
              the merit acquired will surpass that of practicing good
              in the Buddha-land of other quarters for
              a thousand years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason is that in the
              Buddha-land of other quarters many practice good
              and very few commit evil. They are lands
              where everything is naturally provided
              as a result of one's merit and virtue, and
              so no evil is done.</span> But in this world much
              evil is committed, and few are provided for
              naturally; people must work hard to get what
              they want. Since they intend to deceive each
              other, their minds are troubled, their bodies
              exhausted, and they drink bitterness and
              eat hardship. In this way, they are preoccupied
              with their toil no have time for rest.</strong></h3>
              <p>Why should we aspire for birth in the Pure Land?</p>
              <h3>The Buddha tells Maitreya: From time immemorial, you and all the devas
              and humans in the ten quarters and the four groups of followers have been
              floundering in the five realms of Samsara, undergoing indescribable troubles
              and afflictions. Until you were born in this life, you, too, underwent
              endless cycles of birth-and-death. Now you have encountered a Buddha, listened
              to his expositions of the Dharma, and been able to learn about Amitayus.
              What pleasure and joy this is for you and for me to share.<br> "It is time for all to seek deliverance
              from the pains of birth, death, old age,
              and sickness. Outflows of depravity and defilement
              are everywhere, and there is nothing in which
              you can find true joy. You should resolutely
              do worthy deeds with decorum, strive to do
              more good, control and purify yourselves,
              wash off the mind's defilements, be sincere
              in word and deed, and allow no contradiction
              between what you think and what you do. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seek
              your own emancipation and then turn to saving
              others; straightforwardly aspire to be born
              in the Pure Land and accumulate roots of
              virtue. However hard you may practice in
              this life, it can only be for a short while.
              In the life to come you will be born in the
              land of Amitayus and enjoy endless bliss
              there. Being forever in accord with the Way,
              you will no longer be subject to birth-and-death
              and be free of the afflictions caused by
              greed, anger and stupidity. If you wish your
              life to be as long as a kalpa, a hundred
              kalpas, or ten million kalpas, it will be
              just as you please. You will dwell in effortless
              spontaneity and attain Nirvana.</span> You should
              each diligently seek to realize your aspiration.
              Do not entertain any doubt or give up your
              endeavor, lest as a result of that fault
              you should be born into the seven-jewelled
              palace in the border region of the Pure Land
              and be subject to various disadvantages for
              five hundred years.</h3>

(A) was puzzling as both the two masters have already passed on, and the beads to her is for recitation to land of ultimate bliss. I joined in the conversation repeating that beads is for recitation.

              <p>Shayamuni Buddha did not teach Amitabha pureland as a route for escape from our problem in this world. He taught us to face our problem with the Dharma truth. To seek quick rebirth in the Western Amitabha pureland is pessimistic escapism attitude which is unhealthy. </p>
              <p>According to the Amitabha Sutra, "<em>Sariputra, one cannot have few good roots, blessings, virtues, and causal connections to attain birth in that Land</em>." A person must cultivate good meritorous acts as one of the condition to gain rebirth there. In another word, this Saha world is also a place of practice <strong><span style="font-family: MS Song;">é�“åœº</span></strong> , one need to be of service to the society until one life end before one can embark on the journey to pureland.</p>
              <p>Perhaps on the profound level of <strong><span style="font-family: MS Song;">å¿µä½› i</span></strong>s a meditation technique to calm one mind so that one can has the strength and wisdom to handle and overcome one problem. By doing so, one has benefited oneself and others</p>
              <p>Nichiren mentioned in a writing.</p>
              <p><em>"where exactly hell and the Buddha exist, one sutra states that hell exists underground, and another sutra says that the Buddha is in the west. Closer examination, however, reveals that both exist in our five-foot body. This must be true because hell is in the heart of a person who inwardly despises his father and disregards his mother. It is like the lotus seed, which contains both blossom and fruit. In the same way, the Buddha dwells within our hearts. For example, flint has the potential to produce fire, and gems have intrinsic value. ...........Likewise, we do not see that the Buddha exists in our own hearts. You may question how it is that the Buddha can reside within us when our bodies, originating from our parents’ sperm and blood, are the source of the three poisons and the seat of carnal desires. But repeated consideration assures us of the truth of this matter. The pure lotus flower blooms out of the muddy pond......"</em></p>
              <p>Therefore, I think one should not be anxious over how to get to Pureland now instead one should concern what can I do to make this world a better place. As it is mentioned in  <strong>Vimalakirti Sutra</strong>, " when the mind is pure, the land is pure." This world is also a pureland in the eyes of the Shayamuni Buddha.</p>

              <h3>[4] Vaidehi, thus confined, grew emaciated with grief and despair. Facing the Vulture Peak, she worshipped the Buddha from afar and said, "O Tathagata, World-Honored One, you used to send Ananda to comfort me. Now I am in deep sorrow and distress. Since there is no way of my coming to look upon your august countenance, World-Honored One, I pray you send the Venerable Mahamaudgalyayana and the Venerable Ananda here to see me."<br>When she had said these words, tears of sorrow streamed down her cheeks like rain. Then she bowed towards the Buddha in the distance. Even before she raised her head, the World-Honored One, who was then staying on the Vulture Peak, knew Vaidehi's thoughts and immediately ordered Mahamaudgalyayana and Ananda to go to her through the air; he himself disappeared from the mountain and reappeared in the inner chamber of the royal palace.<br>After worshipping him, Vaidehi raised her head and saw Shakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honored One. He was the color of purple gold and was seated upon a lotus-flower of a hundred jewels. He was attended by Mahamaudgalyayana on his left and Ananda on his right. Shakra, Brahma, the guardian gods of the world and other devas were in the air about him. Scattering heavenly blossoms like rain, they paid homage to the Buddha.<br>When she saw the World-Honored One, Vaidehi tore off her ornaments and prostrated herself on the ground. Weeping bitterly, she said to the Buddha, "O World-Honored One, what bad karma did I commit in former lives that I have borne such an evil son? I wonder, World-Honored One, what karmic relations could have made you a relative of Devadatta?<br><br></h3>

I do not wish to live in this defiled and evil world of Jambudvipa where there are hells, realms of hungry spirits, animals and many vile beings. I wish that in the future I shall not hear evil words or see wicked people. World-Honored One, I now kneel down to repent and beg you to take pity on me. I entreat you, O Sun-like Buddha, to teach me how to visualize a land of pure karmic perfection."<br>Then the World-Honored One sent forth from between his eyebrows a flood of light, which was the color of gold and illuminated the innumerable worlds in the ten quarters. Returning to the Buddha, the light settled on his head and transformed itself into a golden platform resembling Mount Sumeru. On the platform appeared the pure and resplendent lands of all the Buddhas in the ten quarters. Some of these lands were made of seven jewels, some solely of lotus-flowers; some resembled the palace in the Heaven of Free Enjoyment of Manifestation by Others, while some were like a crystal mirror in which all the lands in the ten quarters were reflected. Innumerable Buddha-lands like these, glorious and beautiful, were displayed to her.<br>Vaidehi then said to the Buddha, "O World-Honored One, these Buddha-lands are pure and free of defilement, and all of them are resplendent. But I wish to be born in the Land of Utmost Bliss of Amitayus. I beseech you, World-Honored One, to teach [341c] me how to contemplate that land and attain samadhi."<br><br></h3>

              <p>To seek rebirth int the Pure Land is not pessimistic. In fact, it is because the Pure Land = Nirvana itself, and is the Buddha's field of Enlightenment that Sakyamuni Buddha urged us to attain birth there, so that we may swiftly help others.</p>
              <p>According to the Amitabha Sutra, "<em>Sariputra, one cannot have

              <p>This is a most misunderstood passage in the Amitabha Sutra. When the Buddha states this, He means that no other practices can be compared to the merit of the Nembutsu. As recorded by Master Yuan-chao in his commentary on the Amitabha Sutra;</p>
              <p>Master Yüan-chao's 
                            Commentary on the Amida Sutra states:</p>

                            to the Name. First, other good acts are criticized and labeled "small 
                            roots of good." If performed without true trust, all meritorious 
                            acts - including charity, observance of the precepts, temple construction, 
                            making images, worship and chanting, seated meditation, repentance, 
                            and ascetic practices - are only small good acts, even though they 
                            are directed toward birth with aspiration for the Pure Land. They 
                            are not the cause of birth. If one holds steadfast to the Name in 
                            accord with this sutra, one will definitely attain birth. We know 
                            then that saying the Name is possessed of many roots of good and 
                            many merits.</p>
              <p>I formed this understanding long ago, but people hesitated to accept 
                            it because of their doubts. Recently, I have obtained a copy of 
                            the sutra as engraved on a stone monument at Hsiang-yang and find 
                            that this text corresponds perfectly with the truth. Thus people 
                            have begun to embrace a deep faith. The inscribed text states:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong>Good sons and daughters, hearing the teaching of Amida Buddha, 
                              solely say the Name single-heartedly, without being disturbed 
                              by other thoughts. Because one says the Name, all one's evils 
                              are eradicated.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> It is the act of many roots of good, many virtues, 
                              and many merits.</span></strong></p>

              <p>If I sleep 8 hours per day, the rest of the 16 hours, heavy coughing, wheezing and shitting throughout the 15 hours. Left one hour for study and practice. Why not just hasten the process and go pureland and practice from there instead?? U noe, pray and nian fo, asking for Boddhisattva to bring me to Pureland asap. Whats wrong with that? Isn't it Pureland a better choice if one has got serious illness?</p>

              <p>This quote comes from the Larger Amitayus Sutra, but is æ–·ç« å�–ç¾©.
              The complete passage should be,</p>
              <h3><strong>In this world, you should extensively plant roots of
              virtue, be benevolent, give generously, abstain from breaking the
              precepts, be patient and diligent, teach people with sincerity and
              wisdom, do virtuous deeds, and practice good. If you strictly
              observe the precepts of abstinence with upright thought and
              mindfulness even for a day and a night, the merit
              acquired will surpass that of practicing good in the land
              of Amitayus for a hundred years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason is that in that
              Buddha-land of effortless spontaneity all the inhabitants do good
              without committing even a hair's breadth of evil.</span> If in this
              world you do good for ten days and nights, the merit acquired will
              surpass that of practicing good in the Buddha-land of other
              quarters for a thousand years. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The reason is that in the Buddha-land
              of other quarters many practice good and very few commit evil.
              They are lands where everything is naturally provided as a
              result of one's merit and virtue, and so no evil is done.</span> But in this world much evil is committed, and few are provided for
              naturally; people must work hard to get what they want. Since they
              intend to deceive each other, their minds are troubled, their
              bodies exhausted, and they drink bitterness and eat hardship. In
              this way, they are preoccupied with their toil no have time for
              rest.</strong></h3>
              <p>Why should we aspire for birth in the Pure Land?</p>
              <h3>The Buddha tells Maitreya: From time immemorial, you and all
              the devas and humans in the ten quarters and the four groups of
              followers have been floundering in the five realms of Samsara,
              undergoing indescribable troubles and afflictions. Until you were
              born in this life, you, too, underwent endless cycles of
              birth-and-death. Now you have encountered a Buddha, listened to his
              expositions of the Dharma, and been able to learn about Amitayus.
              What pleasure and joy this is for you and for me to share.<br> "It is time for all to seek deliverance from the pains of birth,
              death, old age, and sickness. Outflows of depravity and defilement
              are everywhere, and there is nothing in which you can find true
              joy. You should resolutely do worthy deeds with decorum, strive to
              do more good, control and purify yourselves, wash off the mind's
              defilements, be sincere in word and deed, and allow no
              contradiction between what you think and what you do. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Seek your own emancipation and then
              turn to saving others; straightforwardly aspire to be born in the
              Pure Land and accumulate roots of virtue. However hard you may
              practice in this life, it can only be for a short while. In
              the life to come you will be born in the land of Amitayus and enjoy
              endless bliss there. Being forever in accord with the Way, you will
              no longer be subject to birth-and-death and be free of the
              afflictions caused by greed, anger and stupidity. If you wish your
              life to be as long as a kalpa, a hundred kalpas, or ten million
              kalpas, it will be just as you please. You will dwell in effortless
              spontaneity and attain Nirvana.</span> You should each diligently
              seek to realize your aspiration. Do not entertain any doubt or give
              up your endeavor, lest as a result of that fault you should be born
              into the seven-jewelled palace in the border region of the Pure
              Land and be subject to various disadvantages for five hundred
              years.</h3>
