              <h3>Translator's Introduction</h3>
              <p>The title of this discourse has sparked some controversy, centered on the word "<em>ratta."</em> Modern translators in Asian vernaculars are unanimous in rendering it 
              as "night," a reading seconded by Sanskrit and Tibetan versions of the 
              discourse. Translators working in English have balked at this reading, 
              however, on the grounds that the title it yields — "Auspicious 
              One-Night" — makes no sense. Thus I.B. Horner drops the word "<em>ratta</em>"
               for her translation entirely; Ven Ñanamoli renders it as "attachment," 
              yielding "One Fortunate Attachment"; and Ven. Ñanananda, taking his cue 
              from Ven. Ñanamoli, renders it as "lover," yielding "Ideal Lover of 
              Solitude."</p>
              <p>If we look at idiomatic Pali usage, though, we find that there is 
              good reason to stick with the traditional reading of "night." There is a
               tendency in the Pali canon to speak of a 24-hour period of day and 
              night as a "night." This would be natural for a society that used a 
              lunar calendar — marking the passage of time by the phases of the moon —
               just as it is natural for us, using a solar calendar, to call the same 
              period of time a "day." As the verse that forms the summary of this 
              discourse explicitly mentions one practicing "relentlessly both day and 
              night," the "night" in the title of the discourse would seem to be a 
              24-hour, rather than a 12-hour, night — and so I have chosen to render 
              the Pali idiom into its English equivalent: An Auspicious Day.</p>
              <p>Ven. Ñanamoli is probably right in assuming that "<em>bhaddekaratta</em>"
               was a pre-Buddhist term that the Buddha adopted and re-interpreted in 
              light of his own teaching. The point of the discourse would thus be that
               — instead of the play of cosmic forces, the stars, or the lucky omens —
               one's own development of the mind's attitude to time is what makes a 
              day auspicious.</p>
              <div class="chapter">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>, at Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha" name="anatha">Anathapindika's monastery</a>. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"
              <p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said: "Monks, I will teach you the summary &amp; 
              exposition of one who has had an auspicious day. Listen &amp; pay close 
              attention. I will speak."</p>
              <p>"As you say, lord," the monks replied.</p>
              <p>The Blessed One said:</p>
              <div class="freeverse">You shouldn't chase after the past
              or place expectations on the future.
              What is past
              	is left behind.
              The future
              	is as yet unreached.
              Whatever quality is present
              you clearly see right there,
              	   right there.
              Not taken in,
              unshaken,
              that's how you develop the heart.
              Ardently doing
              what should be done     today,
              for — who knows? —  tomorrow
              	death.
              There is no bargaining
              with Mortality &amp; his mighty horde.
              Whoever lives thus ardently,
              	relentlessly
              	both day &amp; night,
              has truly had an auspicious day:
              so says the Peaceful Sage.</div>
              <p>"And how, monks, does one chase after the past? One gets carried away
               with the delight of 'In the past I had such a form (body)'... 'In the 
              past I had such a feeling'... 'In the past I had such a perception'... 
              'In the past I had such a thought-fabrication'... 'In the past I had 
              such a consciousness.' This is called chasing after the past.</p>
              <p>"And how does one not chase after the past? One does not get carried

              perception'... 'In the past I had such a thought-fabrication'... 'In the
               past I had such a consciousness.' This is called not chasing after the 
              past.</p>
              <p>"And how does one place expectations on the future? One gets carried 
              away with the delight of 'In the future I might have such a form 
              (body)'... 'In the future I might have such a feeling'... 'In the future
               I might have such a perception'... 'In the future I might have such a 
              thought-fabrication'... 'In the future I might have such a 
              consciousness.' This is called placing expectations on the future.</p>
              <p>"And how does one not place expectations on the future? One does not 
              get carried away with the delight of 'In the future I might have such a 
              form (body)'... 'In the future I might have such a feeling'... 'In the 
              future I might have such a perception'... 'In the future I might have 
              such a thought-fabrication'... 'In the future I might have such a 
              consciousness.' This is called not placing expectations on the future.</p>
              <p>"And how is one taken in with regard to present qualities? There is 
              the case where an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person who has not seen 
              the noble ones, is not versed in the teachings of the noble ones, is not
               trained in the teachings of the noble ones, sees form as self, or self 
              as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.</p>
