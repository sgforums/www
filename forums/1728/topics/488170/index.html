              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Environmental degradation and a
                  rapidly changing climate have left populations in the Himalayas vulnerable.
                  Cloudbursts and mudslides have destroyed villages while growing levels of
                  plastic wastes and other kinds of trash pollute rivers, harming the people who
                  drink from them.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>In a journey as spiritual as it
                  was physical, 700 voyagers trekked through the land of 15,000
                  glaciers in 2010 to spread a message of love and ecological compassion. The
                  journey, led by His Holiness Gyalwang Drupka, a Buddhist <a href="http://www.drukpa.org/index.php/en/">spiritual leader</a> in the region,
                  passed through 725 kilometers of some of the world’s most dangerous and
                  most stunning landscapes. Pad Yatras, or pilgrimages on foot, have taken place <a href="http://www.padyatra.org/">annually</a> since 2007 in different parts
                  of the Himalayas and South Asia.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>“Many of the problems in this
                  world are based on selfish and egoistic kinds of fighting,” said His Holiness
                  Gyalwang Drupka. “But the spirituality is the kindness – real kindness – not
                  only just being kind but real, true kindness to not only human beings, but
                  nature. Including the trees and rocks and mountains.”</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The current Gyalwang
                  Drupka, Jigme Pema Wangchen, is believed to be the twelfth reincarnation
                  of the first Drupka, Tsangpa Gyare, who was born in the 12th century.
                  Today’s reincarnation of the Drupka is known for his environmental
                  activism. In 2007, he launched Live to Love, a humanitarian organization that
                  aims to address the environment protection, education, relief aid, medical
                  services and heritage preservation.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>For the Drupka, sharing a message
                  of kindness and compassion is essential for people living in high altitudes who
                  often feel forgotten by their country when faced with natural disasters and
                  uncertainties caused by a warming world. In an interview, he said he wanted
                  people in the Himalayas to feel they played a role in the protecting the world.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The group survived conditions well
                  below freezing, off-season snow storms and came close to starving when weather
                  conditions made it impossible for them to carry some of their supplies through
                  the mountains.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The experience was <a href="http://www.padyatrafilm.com/#trailer">documented</a> by Himalayan monk
                  Ngawang Sodpa, who used solar power to charge his camera, in a film produced by
                  Michelle Yeo. Nearly a third of Sodpa’s footage was lost from weather and
                  physical damage at altitudes higher than 5,000 meters.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Along the path, the voyagers, all
                  followers of the Buddhist Drupka Lineage, encountered hundreds of remote
                  villages, passing on knowledge about the dangers of non-biodegradeable waste
                  and planting trees. Native communities from the Himalayas were accompanied by
                  travelers from around the world. As they walked, they picked up half a ton of
                  waste, which they carried with them to the end of the journey.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>“While modern products have made
                  their way to these areas, they have not come with a sustainable means for
                  disposal,” narrated American actress Darryl Hannah.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>Trekkers planted more than 50,000
                  trees and rescued trapped and hurt animals. To avoid unnecessary suffering in
                  the world, they gently blew ants off the paths they traveled along so the ants
                  would not be crushed under hundreds of feet.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>“A respect for life, no matter
                  how small, is a defining character for this philosophy,” said Hannah. “It is
                  the same philosophy of compassion that motivates this effort to motivate the
                  national environment at large.”</span></p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>The legacy of the Pad Yatra
                  continues from year to year as one of the largest environmental movements the
                  world has ever seen. Numerous villages in the Himalayas have banned plastics in
                  their communities and have undertaken projects to plant trees.</span></p>
