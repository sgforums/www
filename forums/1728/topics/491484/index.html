              one.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 115%;">Our history abounds with stories of individuals
              perpetrating the most destructive and harmful acts: killing and torture,
              bringing misery and untold suffering to large numbers of people. These
              incidents in human history can be seen as reflecting the darker side of our
              common human heritage. These events occur only when there is hatred, anger,
              jealousy, and unbounded greed. World history is a record of the effects of the
              negative and positive thoughts of human beings. This, I think, is quite clear.
              By reflecting on these past occurrences, we can see that if we want to have a
              better and happier future, now is the time to examine the mindset of our
              present generation and to reflect on the way of life that it may bring about in
              the future. The pervasive power of these negative attitudes cannot be
              overstated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Despite being a monk and a
              supposed practitioner of the <em>Bodhicaryavatara</em> [“The Way of the
              Bodhisattva”], I myself still occasionally become irritated and angry and, as a
              result, use harsh words toward others. Then, a few moments later when the anger
              has subsided, I feel embarrassed; the negative words are already spoken, and
              there is truly no way to take them back. Although the words themselves are
              uttered, and the sound of the voice has ceased to exist, their impact still
              lives on. Hence, the only thing I can do is to go to the person and apologize,
              isn’t that right? But in the meantime, one feels quite shy and embarrassed.
              This shows that even a short instance of anger and irritation creates a great
              amount of discomfort and disturbance to the agent, not to mention the harm
              caused to the person who is the target of that anger. So in reality, these
              negative states of mind obscure our intelligence and judgment and, in this way,
              cause great damage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>One of the best human qualities
              is our intelligence, which enables us to judge what is wholesome and what is
              unwholesome, what is beneficial and what is harmful. Negative thoughts, such as
              anger and strong attachment, destroy this special human quality; this is indeed
              very sad. When anger or attachment dominates the mind, a person becomes almost
              crazed, and I am certain that nobody wishes to be crazy. Under their power we
              commit all kinds of acts—often having far-reaching and destructive
              consequences. A person gripped by such states of mind and emotion is like a
              blind person, who cannot see where he is going. Yet we neglect to challenge
              these negative thoughts and emotions that lead to near insanity. On the
              contrary, we often nurture and reinforce them! By doing so we are, in fact,
              making ourselves prey to their destructive power. When you reflect along these
              lines, you will realize that our true enemy is not outside ourselves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Let me give you another example.
              When your mind is trained in self-discipline, even if you are surrounded by
              hostile forces, your peace of mind will hardly be disturbed. On the other hand,
              your mental peace and calm can easily be disrupted by your own negative
              thoughts and emotions. So I repeat, the real enemy is within, not outside.
              Usually we define our enemy as a person, an external agent, whom we believe is
              causing harm to us or to someone we hold dear. But such an enemy is relative
              and impermanent. One moment, the person may act as an enemy; at yet another
              moment, he or she may become your best friend. This is a truth that we often
              experience in our own lives. But negative thoughts and emotions, the inner
              enemy, will always remain the enemy. They are your enemy today, they have been
              your enemy in the past, and they will remain your enemy in the future as long
              as they reside within your mental continuum. Therefore, Shantideva says that
              negative thoughts and emotions are the real enemy, and this enemy is within.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>This inner enemy is extremely
              dangerous. The destructive potential of an external enemy is limited compared
              to that of its inner counterpart. Moreover, it is often possible to create a
              physical defense against an external enemy. In the past, for example, even
              though they had limited material resources and technological capabilities,
              people defended themselves by building fortresses and castles with many tiers
              and layers of walls. In today’s nuclear age, such defenses as castles and
              fortresses are obsolete. In a time when every country is a potential target for
              the nuclear weapons of others, human beings still continue to develop defense
              systems of greater and greater sophistication. The strategic defense project
              initiated by the United States, widely known as “Star Wars,” is a typical
              example of such a defense system. Underlying its development is still the old
              belief that we can eventually create a system that will provide us with the
              “ultimate” protection. I do not know if it will ever be possible to create a
              defense system capable of guaranteeing worldwide protection against all
              external forces of destruction. However, one thing is certain: as long as those
              destructive internal enemies are left to themselves, unchallenged, the threat
              of physical annihilation will always loom over us. In fact, the destructive
              power of an external enemy ultimately derives from the power of these internal
              forces. The inner enemy is the trigger that unleashes the destructive power of
              the external enemy.</span></p>
