              <p>I just attended Ajahn Brahm's talk on creation vs evolution, very inspiring, entertaining and informational, not to mention his witty jokes and comments.</p>
              <p>He said, energy is not created nor can it be destroyed. he said, there are negative and positive energy and when they combined, they even out themselves, thats how the universe came about. he said there must be matter first and then the time will follow, and not vice versa, cant exactly remembered what he said earlier. he then said, we arise due to cravings and desires, ie energies.</p>
              <p>He let on that India and Australia were once enjoined together from evidences presented in techtonic plates, even before the advent of Shakyamuni Buddha, probably even the time of the previous Buddha's appearance, like Buddha Kassapa.</p>

              <p>Dwelling at <a id="savatthi" name="savatthi">Savatthi</a>... "Monks, I will describe &amp; analyze <a id="dependent" name="dependent">dependent co-arising</a> for you.</p>
              <p>"And what is dependent co-arising? From ignorance as a requisite 
              condition come fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition 
              comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes 
              name-&amp;-form. From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the 
              six sense media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes
               contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From 
              feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a 
              requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance 
              as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite 
              condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging 
              &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come 
              into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; 
              suffering.</p>
              <p>"<a id="aging" name="aging">Now what</a> is <em>aging and death?</em> Whatever aging, decrepitude, brokenness, graying, wrinkling, decline of 
              life-force, weakening of the faculties of the various beings in this or 
              that group of beings, that is called aging. Whatever deceasing, passing 
              away, breaking up, disappearance, dying, death, completion of time, 
              break up of the aggregates, casting off of the body, interruption in the
               life faculty of the various beings in this or that group of beings, 
              that is called death.</p>
              <p>"<a id="birth" name="birth">And what</a> is <em>birth?</em> Whatever 
              birth, taking birth, descent, coming-to-be, coming-forth, appearance of 
              aggregates, &amp; acquisition of [sense] media of the various beings in 
              this or that group of beings, that is called birth.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>becoming?</em> <a id="becomings3" name="becomings3">These three</a> are becomings: sensual becoming, form becoming, &amp; formless becoming. This is called becoming.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>clinging/sustenance?</em> <a id="clingings4" name="clingings4">These four</a> are clingings: sensuality clinging, view clinging, precept &amp; 
              practice clinging, and doctrine of self clinging. This is called 
              clinging.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>craving?</em> <a id="cravings6" name="cravings6">These six</a> are classes of craving: craving for forms, craving for sounds, craving 
              for smells, craving for tastes, craving for tactile sensations, craving 
              for ideas. This is called craving.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>feeling?</em> <a id="feelings6" name="feelings6">These six</a> are classes of feeling: feeling born from eye-contact, feeling born 
              from ear-contact, feeling born from nose-contact, feeling born from 
              tongue-contact, feeling born from body-contact, feeling born from 
              intellect-contact. This is called feeling.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>contact?</em> <a id="contacts6" name="contacts6">These six</a> are classes of contact: eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, 
              tongue-contact, body-contact, intellect-contact. This is called contact.</p>
              <p>"And what are <em>the six sense media?</em> <a id="media6" name="media6">These six</a> are sense media: the eye-medium, the ear-medium, the nose-medium, the 
              tongue-medium, the body-medium, the intellect-medium. These are called 
              the six sense media.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>name-&amp;-form?</em> Feeling, perception, intention, 
              contact, &amp; attention: This is called name. The four great elements, 
              and the form dependent on the four great elements: This is called form. 
              This name &amp; this form are called name-&amp;-form.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>consciousness?</em> <a id="consc6" name="consc6">These six</a> are classes of consciousness: eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, 
              nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, 
              intellect-consciousness. This is called consciousness.</p>
              <p>"And what are <em>fabrications?</em> <a id="fab3" name="fab3">These three</a> are fabrications: bodily fabrications, verbal fabrications, mental fabrications. These are called fabrications.</p>
              <p>"And what is <em>ignorance?</em> Not knowing stress, not knowing the 
              origination of stress, not knowing the cessation of stress, not knowing 
              the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: This is called 
              ignorance.</p>
              <p>"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very 
              ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of 
              fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of
               consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form. From the 
              cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.
               From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of 
              contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. 
              From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the 
              cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From 
              the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. 
              From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the 
              cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, 
              distress, &amp; despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire 
              mass of stress &amp; suffering."</p>
