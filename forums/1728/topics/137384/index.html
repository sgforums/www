(CP) - A major earthquake struck Tuesday night off the coast of northern California, briefly prompting a tsunami scare all the way north to British Columbia, but the warning was cancelled soon after.<br><br>Residents of Tofino, on the mid-coast of western Vancouver Island, received the tsunami warning just before 9 p.m. local time, said Mayor Al Anderson. "Our emergency co-ordinator was working to evacuate the low-lying areas," he said, before the warning was cancelled.<br><br>Anderson said such warnings are not frequent but something residents of the island's coast have come to live with.<br><br>The 7.0-magnitude quake struck at about 7:50 p.m., about 130 kilometres southwest of the U.S. coastal community of Crescent City, according to the U.S. Geological Survey website.<br><br>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued the tsunami warning from the California-Mexico border all the way north to Vancouver Island, B.C., but experts said the likelihood of a deadly tsunami was low and the warning was lifted.<br><br>Jim Whyte, manager of operations at the B.C. Provincial Emergency Program said all of the communities along the coast and around the northern tip of Vancouver Island were issued the warning.<br><br>"What we were waiting on was the fact that a wave was generated," he said. "The open ocean buoys were monitored and no action was detected and the warning was cancelled."<br><br>Witnesses felt buildings shaking along the California coast but there were no immediate reports of damage.<br><br>KCBS radio reported that some residents had been evacuated from low-lying areas of Crescent City, which was struck by a tsunami after an earthquake four decades ago.<br><br>Stuart Weinstein, a geologist at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, had said that if a tsunami were generated, it would not be as strong as the Dec. 26 killer wave in the Indian Ocean.<br><br>"We're not expecting anything huge from an event this size," added Charles McCreery, the centre's director.<br><br>Scientists were waiting for signs of any powerful ocean waves to reach tide gauges placed up and down the West Coast, Weinstein said.<br><br>"We're monitoring our sea gauges pretty carefully," he said.<br><br>In the spring of 1964, a magnitude-8.4 quake in Alaska generated tsunamis that caused damage there and in British Columbia, and in the states of Washington, California and Hawaii. More than 120 died.<br><br>Hardest hit was Crescent City, where 11 people were killed after waves reaching as much as 20 feet destroyed half of the waterfront business district.<br><br>------------------<br><br>update: quake was magnitude 7.2<br></div>

But seismologists say clusters of quakes are not unheard of and do not necessarily mean the Big One is coming.<br><br>After several years of relative seismic calm, the recent quakes are a not-so-gentle reminder that the ground here is never as solid as it seems.<br><br>The shaking began Sunday morning with a magnitude-5.2 temblor in the Anza area of Riverside County, about 90 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. That was followed by a magnitude-7.2 quake Tuesday night under the Pacific Ocean off Eureka -- an unrelated incident that prompted a tsunami warning.<br><br>Thursday brought two quakes that were 10 hours and about 700 miles apart: one of magnitude 4.9 in San Bernardino County and another late that night of magnitude 6.6, also centered off the Northern California coast.<br><br>As groups of quakes often do, this week's shaking brought murmurs of the "Big One" -- the kind of quake that moves mountains and levels entire cities.<br><br>"I think we're on our way to the 'Big One,"' said Jacki Breger, 61, executive director of a Los Angeles charter school who plans to overhaul the school's emergency plans by this fall. "It makes me really nervous with so much quake activity."<br><br>Marian Garcia, 24, isn't taking any chances. She stuffed two backpacks with sweaters, shoes and canned food, and her 4-year-old daughter now sleeps with her instead of in the little girl's own bedroom.<br><br>"In case we have to get out there, I want to be close to her," said Garcia, who works at a downtown Los Angeles flower stand.<br><br>Some studies have suggested that the San Andreas fault, which leveled much of San Francisco in 1906 and extends more than 800 miles through California, may be about to release pent-up energy.<br><br>But that's not a consensus opinion -- earthquakes just aren't that predictable, and a few jolts don't necessarily mean a huge quake is imminent.<br><br>"We don't know whether the 'Big One' is coming," said Tom Jordan, director of the Southern California Earthquake Center.<br><br>The last major rupture on the southern portion of the fault happened in 1857, when an estimated 7.9-magnitude quake struck. It severely damaged Fort Tejon, but there was minimal damage statewide because California was sparsely populated at the time and had no high-rise buildings.<br><br>The flurry of quakes typically leads homeowners to buy earthquake insurance, which only about 14 percent of homeowners currently have.<br><br>In the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake in 1994, the number of homeowners who purchased quake insurance policies rose to 29 percent, said Pete Moraga, spokesman for the Insurance Information Network of California, a nonprofit trade association that represents insurers.<br><br>Phillip Mookerdam, co-manager of the Supply Sergeant store in Santa Monica, said customers began arriving soon after the magnitude-4.9 quake rattled the region.<br><br>"They started calling and walking in, asking whether we carry survival kits," he said.<br><br>Sales of those kits -- which include solar-powered radios, dry food, water, flashlights and a first-aid kit -- have been brisk, Mookerdam said.<br><br>Residents have also been stocking up in Crescent City, where the 7.2-magnitude offshore earthquake triggered a tsunami warning.<br><br>Ray's Food Place has seen an increase in sales of canned foods, batteries and water. People were afraid that a major earthquake or tsunami could lead to road closures or shut down water and electrical systems.<br><br>"They want to be able to be more self-sufficient in case roads close and they can't get to the grocery store, or in case the groceries can't get to the stores," manager Jeff Wheelon said.<br><br>Elsewhere in Southern California, some owners took their dogs to the veterinarian for tranquilizer shots.<br><br>"The ones that are frantic are usually the ones with owners that are frantic, too," said Marilyn Lilla, 58, who works at the General Dog and Cat Hospital in San Bernardino.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As this earthquake in California was prophecised some months ago, they have done some major chanting in hope the merits could avert a deadly situation of a catastrophic "Big One" Californian Earthquake.<br><br>They have said that there had already been good signs, so lets hope their right that this would be the case..<br><br><blockquote>&gt; Friends,<br>&gt; I know that this news is pretty shocking....the only<br>&gt; other thing I have<br>&gt; to compare this with was when the Nechung Oracle<br>&gt; (State Oracle of<br>&gt; Tibet) told the Tibetan Gov't in exile led by HH the<br>&gt; Dalai Lama that if<br>&gt; they didn't do something fast and strong there would<br>&gt; be a devastating<br>&gt; earthquake that would destroy Dharmsala. His<br>&gt; Holiness had his Lamas<br>&gt; recommend rites and rituals for the monasterys and<br>&gt; the laity to do and<br>&gt; everyone got very busy. The earthquake when it came<br>&gt; was very mild.<br>&gt; We have never seen Lama Zopa do something like this<br>&gt; before.<br>&gt; May our beautiful California and its people be<br>&gt; protected.<br>&gt; prema </blockquote>and the latest updated was ...<br><br><blockquote>The Kopan monks and nuns in Nepal (over 500 of them) did the recitation last week and that seems to have a good effect already! See the lastest message from Rinpoche. </blockquote>So I believe the situation could have been much worse...</div>
