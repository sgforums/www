"Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the Zen experience is that it has no personal note in it as is observable in Christian mystic experiences."; </blockquote>Well I gave an impersonal tone when I posted luminosity is mind and there are no stories without mind.<br><br><blockquote>7. Feeling of exaltation. "That this feeling inevitably accompanies Satori is due to the fact that it is the breaking-up of the restriction imposed on one as an individual being, and this breaking up is not a mere negative incident but quite a positive one fraught with signification because it means an infinite expansion of the individual." </blockquote>Yeah I felt exhalted thats why I made 2 topics.<br><br><blockquote>8. Momentariness. "Satori comes upon one abruptly and is a momentary experience. In fact, if it is not abrupt and momentary, it is not Satori.</blockquote>That is exactly why I only experience it right when I wake up and so I post it right after I wake up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>3. Authoritativeness. "By this I mean that the knowledge realized by Satori is final, that no amount of logical argument can refute it. Being direct and personal it is sufficient unto itself. All that logic can do here is to explain it, to interpret it in connection to other kinds of knowledge with which our minds are filled. Satori is thus a form of perception, an inner perception, which takes place in the most interior part of consciousness. </blockquote>Guess how many pregnant teens said the same thing?<br><br><blockquote>4. Affirmation. "What is authoritative and final can never be negative. Though the Satori experience is sometimes expressed in negative terms, it is essentially an affirmative attidude towards all things that exist; it accepts them as they come along regardless of their moral values." </blockquote>What?<br><br><blockquote>5. Sense of the Beyond. "...in Satori there is always what we may call a sense of the Beyond; the experience indeed is my own but I feel it to be rooted elsewhere. The individual shell in which my personality is so solidly encased explodes at the moment of Satori. Not, necessarily, that I get unified with a being greater than myself or absorbed in it, but that my individuality, which I found rigidly held together and definitely kept separate from other individual existences, becomes lossened somehow from its tightening grip and melts away into something indescribable, something which is of quite a different order from what I am accustomed to. The feeling that follows is that of complete release or a complete rest---the feeling that one has arrived finally at the destination...As far as the psychology of Satori is considered, a sense of the Beyond is all we can say about it; to call this the Beyond, the Absolute, or God, or a Person is to go further than the experience itself and to plunge into a theology or metaphysics."; See #5 above as well as Turiyatita. </blockquote>Yeah! The other day I was walking my dog and I was thinking what kind of answer I want from buddhism. Then I remembered the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy and then I realised that if there were no question there would be no answer. There is answer only if there is question. (probably because now my dad is really starting to put in effort to change himself so all my frustrations are greatly lessened.)<br></div>

You merge with the Source. You draw from it the vital energy that sustains you for a while when you return to the manifested, the world of separate forms. This energy is much more vital than food: "Man does not live by bread alone." But in dreamless sleep, you don't go into it consciously. Although the bodily functions are still operating, "youÂ” no longer exist in that state. Can you imagine what it would be like to go into dreamless sleep with full consciousness? It is impossible to imagine it, because that state has no content.<br><br>The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it consciously. That's why Jesus did not say the truth will make you free, but rather: "You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." This is not a conceptual truth. It is the truth of eternal life beyond form, which is known directly or not at all. But don' t attempt to stay conscious in dreamless sleep. It is highly unlikely that you will succeed. At most, you may remain conscious during the dream phase, but not beyond that. This is called lucid dreaming, which may be interesting and fascinating, but it is not liberating.<br><br>So use your inner body as a portal through which you enter the Unmanifested, and keep that portal open so that you stay connected with the Source at all times. It makes no difference, as far as the inner body is concerned, whether your outer physical body is old or young, frail or strong. The inner body is timeless. If you are not yet able to feel the inner body, use one of the other portals, although ultimately they are all one. Some I have spoken about at length already, but I'll mention them again briefly here.<br><br>--------<br><br>What Eckhart said here is roughly there. Except that Thusness implies that it is not necessary or impossible to enter dreamless sleep 'consciously' (ironically Eckhart's second paragraph's first sentence contradicts his first paragraph), which I believe would equate to a sense of Witnessing presence. This is not the same as deep dreamless sleep where even the sense of Witnessing presence dissolves into complete non dual absorption.</div>

The other time you were telling me that pure awareness is only correct if I can feel it even in deep dreamless sleep, to which confused me and I said I would need to meditate more to do that. Then shortly after that thusness started saying not to want to be conscious during deep sleep and that you misled jonls by introducing ken wilber to him, otherwise he would have realised emptiness by now.<br><br>You like to assume a lot dont you.</div>
