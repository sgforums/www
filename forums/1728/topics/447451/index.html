              <div><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">NibbÄ�na is a negation. It means extinguishment. 
                                    With the fruition of each of the four paths one knows the termination of the 
                                    fetters which are eliminated by that path. This termination is nibbÄ�na 
                                    appropriate to that path. The Paá¹­isambhidÄ�magga:<br><br>How is it that the 
                                    discernment of the termination of continuance in one who is fully aware is 
                                    gnosis of full extinguishment (parinibbÄ�na ñÄ�á¹‡a)?<br><br>Through the 
                                    stream-entry path he terminates identity view (sakkÄ�yadiá¹­á¹­hi), doubt 
                                    (vicikicchÄ�), and mistaken adherence to rules and duty (sÄ«labbataparÄ�mÄ�sa).... 
                                    This discernment of the termination of continuance in one who is fully aware is 
                                    gnosis of full extinguishment....<br><br>He causes the cessation of identity 
                                    view, doubt, and mistaken adherence to rules and duty through the stream-entry 
                                    path.<br><br><br>And so on for the fetters which are terminated on the remaining 
                                    three paths. The once-returner path terminates the gross fetters of desire for 
                                    sensual pleasure (kÄ�macchanda) and aversion (vyÄ�pÄ�da/byÄ�pÄ�da). The non-returner 
                                    path terminates the secondary fetters of desire for sensual pleasure 
                                    (kÄ�macchanda) and aversion (vyÄ�pÄ�da/byÄ�pÄ�da). The arahant path terminates the 
                                    fetters of passion for form [existence] (rÅ«parÄ�ga), passion for formless 
                                    [existence] (arÅ«parÄ�ga), conceit (mÄ�na), restlessness (uddhacca), and ignorance 
                                    (avijjÄ�).<br><br>All the best,<br><br>Geoff<br><br>...<br><br>Firstly, nibbÄ�na 
                                    isn't a "state." Secondly, nibbÄ�na is the cessation of passion, aggression, and 
                                    delusion. For a learner it is the cessation of the fetters extinguished on each 
                                    path. The waking states where "suddenly all sensations and six senses stop 
                                    functioning" are (1) mundane perceptionless samÄ�dhis, and (2) cessation of 
                                    apperception and feeling. Neither of these are supramundane and neither of these 
                                    are synonymous with experiencing nibbÄ�na.<br><br>All the 
                                    best,<br><br>Geoff</span></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">....</span></div>
              <p><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This type of blackout cessation is experienced by all 
                                    sorts of yogis including those practicing non-Buddhist systems. Thus, it has 
                                    nothing to do with the correct engagement of vipassanÄ�. The cessation of 
                                    unsatisfactoriness (dukkhanirodha) is the cessation of craving (taá¹‡hÄ�), not the 
                                    cessation of phenomena. DN 22:<br><br></span></p>
              <ul>
              <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And what is the noble truth of the cessation of 
                                    stress? The remainderless fading &amp; cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, 
                                    release, &amp; letting go of that very craving.</span><br> 
              </ul>
              <div><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What craving? Craving sensual pleasure 
                                    (kÄ�mataá¹‡hÄ�), craving existence (bhavataá¹‡hÄ�), and craving non-existence 
                                    (vibhavataá¹‡hÄ�). The cessation of unsatisfactoriness is the cessation of very 
                                    specific fetters pertaining to each of the four noble paths. There is no 
                                    canonical support for your interpretation of nibbÄ�na or saupÄ�disesa nibbÄ�nadhÄ�tu 
                                    (nibbÄ�na element with fuel remaining). </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">....</span></div>
              <div><br><br>The suttas define and 
                                describe the goal in sufficient terms. The difficulty in this discussion
                                 relates to whether one accepts what the canon states about the fruition
                                 of the path, or alternatively, accepts much later commentarial 
                                interpretations of the "path-moment" and "fruition-moment" as 
                                re-interpreted by a few 20th century Burmese monks. Without sufficient 
                                common ground for discussion there isn't much possibility of meaningful 
                                dialogue.</div>

              <div>.........</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div><br>I was just paraphrasing the professor's own words. Karunadasa's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dhamma Theory: Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma</span>:<br><br>
              <ul>
              What
               emerges from this Abhidhammic doctrine of dhammas is a critical 
              realism, one which recognizes the distinctness of the world from the 
              experiencing subject yet also distinguishes between those types of 
              entities that truly exist independently of the cognitive act and those 
              that owe their being to the act of cognition itself.<br>
              </ul>
              <br>He goes
               on to say that "a dhamma is a truly existent thing (sabhÄ�vasiddha)." 
              This is a completely realist view. And the inevitable consequence 
              entailed by this realist view, wherein all conditioned dhammas are 
              "truly existing things," is that path cognitions and fruition cognitions
               of each of the four paths and fruits must occur within an utterly void 
              vacuum state cessation, which is considered to be the ultimately 
              existent "unconditioned." This is described by Jack Kornfield:<br><br>
              <ul>
              In
               Mahasi’s model, enlightenment—or at least stream-entry, the first taste
               of nirvana—comes in the form of a cessation of experience, arising out 
              of the deepest state of concentration and attention, when the body and 
              mind are dissolved, the experience of the ordinary senses ceases, and we
               rest in perfect equanimity. We open into that which is unconditioned, 
              timeless, and liberating: nirvana.... But there are a lot of questions 
              around this kind of moment. Sometimes it seems to have enormously 
              transformative effects on people. Other times people have this moment of
               experience and aren’t really changed by it at all. Sometimes they’re 
              not even sure what happened.<br>
              </ul>
              <br>This notion of path and 
              fruition cognitions is not supported by the PÄ�li canon. Moreover, there 
              are now numerous people who've had such experiences sanctioned by 
              "insight meditation" teachers, and who have gone on to proclaim to the 
              world that arahants can still experience lust and the other defiled 
              mental phenomena. Taking all of this into account there is no good 
              reason whatsoever to accept this interpretation of path and fruition 
              cognitions. Void vacuum state cessations are not an adequate nor 
              reliable indication of stream entry or any of the other paths and 
              fruitions. <br><br>All the best,<br><br>Geoff</div>

              Geoff: 
              As do I. When fellows like U Paá¹‡á¸�ita and Kearney understand nibbÄ�na to be a momentary blip of nothingness it's clear that the soteriological significance of nibbÄ�na and the foundational structure of the four noble truths has been misunderstood by this community. It's little wonder then, when someone like Ingram comes along, who has trained in this same MahÄ�si tradition, and claims that the full realization of nibbÄ�na doesn't result in the complete extingishment of lust and anger. Why is this not surprising? Because the soteriological significance of nibbÄ�na and the foundation of the four noble truths has been forgotten by this community.

              <p>Geoff:</p>
              <p><br>I was just paraphrasing the professor's own words. Karunadasa's <span style="font-style: italic;">The Dhamma Theory: Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma</span>:<br></p>
              <ul>
              What
               emerges from this Abhidhammic doctrine of dhammas is a critical 
              realism, one which recognizes the distinctness of the world from the 
              experiencing subject yet also distinguishes between those types of 
              entities that truly exist independently of the cognitive act and those 
              that owe their being to the act of cognition itself.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>He goes
               on to say that "a dhamma is a truly existent thing (sabhÄ�vasiddha)." 
              This is a completely realist view. And the inevitable consequence 
              entailed by this realist view, wherein all conditioned dhammas are 
              "truly existing things," is that path cognitions and fruition cognitions
               of each of the four paths and fruits must occur within an utterly void 
              vacuum state cessation, which is considered to be the ultimately 
              existent "unconditioned." This is described by Jack Kornfield:<br></p>
              <ul>
              In
               Mahasi’s model, enlightenment—or at least stream-entry, the first taste
               of nirvana—comes in the form of a cessation of experience, arising out 
              of the deepest state of concentration and attention, when the body and 
              mind are dissolved, the experience of the ordinary senses ceases, and we
               rest in perfect equanimity. We open into that which is unconditioned, 
              timeless, and liberating: nirvana.... But there are a lot of questions 
              around this kind of moment. Sometimes it seems to have enormously 
              transformative effects on people. Other times people have this moment of
               experience and aren’t really changed by it at all. Sometimes they’re 
              not even sure what happened.<br>
              </ul>
              <p><br>This notion of path and 
              fruition cognitions is not supported by the PÄ�li canon. Moreover, there 
              are now numerous people who've had such experiences sanctioned by 
              "insight meditation" teachers, and who have gone on to proclaim to the 
              world that arahants can still experience lust and the other defiled 
              mental phenomena. Taking all of this into account there is no good 
              reason whatsoever to accept this interpretation of path and fruition 
              cognitions. Void vacuum state cessations are not an adequate nor 
              reliable indication of stream entry or any of the other paths and 
              fruitions. <br><br>All the best,<br><br>Geoff</p>
