              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I recently came across this very interesting article on Tibetan Buddhism and what is 'in' and what is 'out' of Tibetan Buddhism and their view on the traditional samatha methods. Maybe someone with more indepth knowledge in Tibetan Buddhism could comment on it?</p>

              <p>Dzogchen is the main practice of Nyingmas, generally speaking, while for Kagyu it's Mahamudra. In Theravada, anapanasati can be practiced both way: as samatha, and as vipassana, depending on whether they are focusing on the in and out of the breathe or on the pure sensate reality and the 3 characteristics of the breathe. In Tibetan Buddhism however, even in Mahamudra, even if they are taught as the main practice for a beginner, they will at most be treated as a samatha technique to stabilize the mind before moving on to pointing out the nature of Mind. There is also less emphasis in samatha jhana in Tibetan Buddhism, where many teachers only advice their students to reach 1st Jhana and no more, before moving on to Insight. However to put it in perspective, Zen bashes samatha jhana even more than Tibetan Buddhism, sometimes even devaluing it into a state of Makyo (illusion). Anyway you can get a very good look at the Mahamudra meditation system in a book I and Thusness highly recommends: Clarifying the Natural State.</p>
              <p>In my understanding, Theravadin Vipassana (Myanmar and Sri Lanka style -- Thai Forest is a little different) is not exactly similar as Zen koan training or Tibetan Dzogchen or Mahamudra system. Why? Vipassana emphasize the gradual unfolding insights, going through 16 nanas before culminating in a Fruition event which is a form of cessation. This is what I, Kenneth and Thusness calls the Gradual Path practice.</p>
              <p>Then there is the Direct Path teaching, which emphasize pointing out and realising the nature of Mind. Since the nature of Mind is timeless instead of developmental, it is ever present regardless of what states, experiences, nanas you have been through, it can be discovered in the here and now. It is not the result of having progressed through certain experiences or insight stages and thus having achieved certain stage of experience, because it is always this Mind which is the basis of All experiences, that is why it is beyond effort but can only be realised or recognised. The methods of Koan also aim at this. This does not mean that there is just one final insight and that's it -- however, the practitioner of, for example the 'Who am I' koan will first get an initial realisation of the I AM and from there, they can do more koans and move on to Non Dual, etc. That is why Zen is known as é¡¿æ‚Ÿ (Instantaneous Awakening) -- there must be the sudden, intuitive, unshakeable 'eureka!'-sort realisation of the 'I'. Awaken to this ‘I’, the path of spirituality becomes clear; it is simply the unfolding of this ‘I’. The Vipassana practitioner of the Gradual Path (i.e. Mahasi Sayadaw style Vipassana, not Thai Forest style which did teach Direct Path in some way) however, will not realise anything of 'intrinsic luminosity of Mind', 'primordial Awareness', etc, until Anagami. That means the Fruition event in Sotapanna &amp; Sakadagami has nothing to do with the I AM or Non-Duality. But more on that later.</p>
              <p>I should also mention, the practice emphasized in Gradual Path (i.e. noting, observing 3 
                                                      characteristics of phenomena) is also different from the practices 
                                                      emphasized in the Direct Path (depending on tradition: self-inquiry, 
                                                      koan, pointing out nature of mind and sustaining recognition, formless 
                                                      meditation, etc).</p>
              <p>The Theravadin tradition, following the gradual system of samatha-vipassana combined, as I said earlier basically climbs up the 16 nanas, and then reaches the Fruition event and attains Sotapanna.</p>
              <p>What is the difference between realising Mind, and attaining Fruition? It's different. I'll paste some excerpts from Kenneth Folk on the difference at the bottom of the post.</p>
              <p>However where it all converges is: Anagami. An Anagami who followed the traditional Theravadin path may not go through certain stages of experience in the Direct Path, like the I AM, but at the Anagami level the person will realise non-dual awareness beyond subject and object division, even if he follows strictly the Gradual Path, similar to a practitioner who follows Direct Path and eventually lands up in Non Dual insight. That practitioner or Anagami will then be able to apply his insights more and more into daily lives rather than in the cessation event, and be able to perceive emptiness, impermanence, selflessness, non-dual intrinsic luminosity, etc. in real time in his entire sensate universe. The most subtle dualities and attachment to a Self agent in any subtle way/the final knot of the centerpoint is finally removed at Arhantship.</p>
              <p>By the way, I do not think Direct Path is necessarily 'better' than Gradual Path, and it simply depends on the practitioner -- one must guage one's conditions. Kenneth recommends somehow ballancing both (though it is not the same as practicing both at once: you cannot possibly do that -- one is abiding as the Timeless I AM without investigation, whereas the other is investigating the three characteristics of passing phenomena, but you can flip flop between them), however for me right now, I am focusing on the 'Direct Path'. In terms of statistics, I do not have them, but basically I see very successful and highly attained Gradual Path practitioners as well as Direct Path practitioners. No matter what path you practice, you still end up having to practice 10-20 years and more to realise and mature the insights. The initial glimpse is faster but it is not the end.</p>

                                                                   Yes, rigpa and cessation are mutually exclusive. One doesn't happen 
                                                                  from the point of view of the other. But, remember, rigpa is the 
                                                                  recognition of buddha nature in the moment. During that recognition, in 
                                                                  my experience, cessation does not occur. But that does not mean that 
                                                                  cessation does not happen within buddha nature; of course it does. It 
                                                                  just happens at a time when buddha nature is not being recognized.<br> <br> You can learn to access either kind of fruition, whenever you want. In 
                                                                  the case of rigpa, the access is instantaneous, as soon as you remember 
                                                                  to notice it. In the case of cessation, it may take a second or two, or,
                                                                   if you are very distracted, several seconds. Then you can compare rigpa
                                                                   and cessation side by side.<br> <br> One practical detail is that you 
                                                                  can let be in rigpa while you are driving, or eating dinner with the 
                                                                  family, or in a meeting at work, whereas, at least for me, cessation 
                                                                  usually requires closing my eyes. I usually roll my eyes up into my 
                                                                  head, too, and flicker my eyelids, so I have to be discreet so people 
                                                                  around me won't think I'm having a seizure. :-)<br> <br> Back to the 
                                                                  theory: you wrote, "rigpa is not unborn, for it ceases." If by ceasing, 
                                                                  you mean that we aren't always aware of it, the same would apply to 
                                                                  nibbana/cessation. So, I don't think that proves it ceases. Actually, 
                                                                  buddha nature cannot be found to cease; since it is awareness itself, 
                                                                  how would we know if it ceased? You can't be aware of not being aware.</p>

              <p>Something I, Thusness and Daniel Ingram (who is Kenneth's best friend) do not agree with him is that Arhats and Direct Path are totally distinct insights. We also have a very different definition of 'Arhat' compared to Kenneth. However otherwise, he provides a lot of insights on all the systems. I have posted some of his articles at <a href="/forums/1728/topics/378355">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/378355</a></p>
              <p>Sorry to have gone a bit off topic, but I think this should provide a general picture of the different systems of practice and how they relate to the traditions.</p>
              <p>Oh and one more final thing... how about Tibetan Buddhism? Generally as I understand it, there is a balance of gradual and direct path, but for systems like Dzogchen and Mahamudra, especially Dzogchen, is very direct.</p>
