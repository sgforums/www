            <div class='col-md body'>From what I learnt from my dharma teacher... Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will not help you in things that are 'bu ru fa' ... or things that increase your greed etc (such as letting you win toto number bcos of greed). Also a Buddha/Bodhisattva cannot make you gain what is not already karmically yours. In the case of 'apparently' helping you win toto, the Buddhas/Bodhisattvas may just be trying to increase your confidence in dharma, but I'm not sure about the exact reason behind this. If you go gambling and pray for Buddhas to help, the Buddhas may even make you lose all your money to make you learn the lesson, who knows.<br><br>However, in cases such as poverty, bankrupt, or generally being so poor one cannot support oneself or one's family, one may try to pray for some improvements to the situation. And very often it works very well. However there is limits to this. What that 'someone' who helps, whether Buddha, Bodhisattva or whatsoever can do is only allow certain good karmic seeds to ripen quickly/manifest quickly. An analogy (not to be taken literally) is like you have $100 in your bank (8th consciousness). If you pray for help to help improve your situtation, you may be able to manifest that $100. But if your 'bank' don't have $100 (the karmic seed) it cannot manifest.. or if you want $200, your bank have $100, also cannot manifest $200.<br><br>Padmasambhava is definitely a very accomplished and enlightened master, and his insights is truly deep. I have posted a thread discussing about one of his articles before: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=234629" rel="nofollow">Self-Liberation through Seeing with Naked Awareness</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism does not advocate poverty, nor does it teach us to shun money. Like what Ven Fazhao said before: "When used in a right way, money in abundance is a positive thing. Money not gotten from right livelihood, on the other hand, should not be taken."<br><br>Likewise, to ask Buddha or Bodhisattvas for lottery numbers or money to enrich oneself, is totally un- Buddhist. This is greed and ignorance. And if after praying, still never win 4D, then hatred comes. Bingo. you strike all three poisons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And in my view, even if you got such winnigs or money after praying, I don't think is was that Buddha or Bodhisattva hv granted your wish; but it is most probably your results of past karmic causes of Giving has ripen.<br><br>Financial wealth is a direct result of Giving( bu shi) of past or present lives. SO, according to the late Ven Master Ying Sun in<span style="font-style: italic;"> Miao Yun JI</span>: " Wealth comes from the good karmic result of Giving, this is an undisputed truth; but one still needs the right way to make one's good karmic reults to happen. Using unlawful [ or wrong] ways to gain wealth will only plant more bad karma and wasted one's past efforts of accumulating the good karma."<br><br>Yah, so wasteful.<br><br>I think AEN has explain it very well above, and Xprobe completes it  wonderfully!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhists do not pray for favours infact buddhists do not pray but pay respect to the Buddha.To pay respects to the Buddha when entering the monastery, to offer incense, flowers, candle and light to the Buddha are the observances of the Buddhist. The Buddha is the master of our religion, he is the saint who has attained the perfect and ultimate stage by practising from the stage of a worldly being. The great Bodhisattvas are the Buddhas to be. They are our guides and indicators of refuge. We should be polite in showing respect to the Buddha and Bodhisattva just as when we show respect to our parents. When the Buddha was still in this world, there was no problem. One could show oneÂ’s respect to him directly. However, now that the Sakyamuni Buddha has already entered final Nirvana; and the Buddha and Bodhisattva of the other worlds are not in our world, we have no way to pay respects. Thus, we have to use paper to draw, ceramic, wood or stone to carve their images.It is because of the Buddha and Bodhisattvas, merits and images that we are paying our respect to them not because of asking favours.<br><br></div>
