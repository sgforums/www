              <p>That's why you should join a buddhist organisation, so when there is any good opportunity or event, you will get to know it.<br>If there is no 3 step 1 bow event in the near future, you probably can still do it at home, bow to buddha statue, confess regret your wrong deeds in the past. This is a good way to  clear off your bad karma.</p>

              <p>Hi you can try out 3 step 1 bow on vesak day, the atmosphere could be different than the one not carried out in vesak day. Maybe you can try it next year or next next year..</p>
              <p>I think Guang Ming Shan organise this 3 step 1 bow for volunteers becos the volunteers could be busy on vesak day itself so will miss out the ceremonies.</p>
              <p>See if you have the affinity to attend the 3 step 1 bow..</p>
              <p>Amituofo</p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: x-large; color: #ff0000;">What is the 3 step 1 bow Ceremony all about?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Upon every prostration, the Buddha can be visualised standing upon one's open palms which symbolise lotuses (that denote purity). Every prostration is thus paying respects to the Buddha or the countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of every direction. This practice helps to purify the mind, humble the ego, and lessen obstacles along the spiritual path as one repents past unwholesome deeds of body, speech and mind, and aspires towards spiritual improvement. It is also an occasion to express gratitude to the Buddha for His compassion.</p>
              <p>Concentration and calmness can be achieved as one becomes constantly mindful of the processes of the body, speech and mind during the practice. Unanswered spiritual questions are sometimes answered as one enters deep concentration and realises the roots of the problems.</p>
              <p>As the ceremony is lengthy (taking slightly more than two hours) and over undulating land of different surfaces, it reminds one of the long and difficult journey towards Enlightenment. However it also serves to remind us that as long as one has determination, all difficulties can be overcome. Perseverance in completing the journey despite its difficulties also strengthens one's faith in the Triple Gem to lead us towards Enlightenment.</p>
              <p>The break of dawn at the end of the ceremony represents the light of wisdom dispelling the darkness of ignorance as one advances on the spiritual path towards Enlightenment. Participating in this special event, among others, on the holy Vesak Day is considered very meritorious. It is extremely difficult to describe the spiritual joy one feels upon completion of the ceremony, receiving the blessing of cool holy water being sprinkled upon the head by the Sangha. It is an experience that one has to go through to fully appreciate it!</p>

              <p>Guang Ming Shan and Shuang Lim Temple has this 3 step one bow, Guang Ming Shan usually organise this one day before Vesak Day,as Shuang Lim Temple I am not too sure the date they usually held the event.</p>
              <p>As for Guang Ming Shang, if you are their volunteer worker, there is one organise a week before the actual day. Beside doing at temples, you could do this at home, its not the location or the numbers of time you do this 3 step one bow, it is the thought of doing it, you can do it everyday, which means a year you will have complete a cycle of 365 times, of coz doing at temple you will have another kind of feelings.</p>
