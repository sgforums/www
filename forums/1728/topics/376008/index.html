              <p><em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000;"><strong>Nian Chu Jing </strong></span></em><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800000;"><strong>(Sarvastivada)
                    <br> </strong>from Madhya Agama (number 26 in <em>Taisho Revised Tripitaka</em>). <br> Translated by Gautama Sanghadeva from Sanskrit into Chinese, <br> and by Thich Nhat Hanh and Annabel Laity into English.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800080;">Section One</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I heard these words of the Buddha one time when the Lord
                was staying in the town of Kammassadharma in the land of the Kuru people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The Lord addressed the bhikkhus:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"There is a path which can help beings realize
                purification, overcome anxiety and fear, end pain, distress, and grief, and attain the
                right practice. This is the path of dwelling in the Four Grounds of Mindfulness. All the
                Tathagatas of the past have attained the fruit of true awakening, the state of no further
                obstacles, by establishing their minds in the Four Ground s of Mindfulness. Relying on
                these Four Grounds, they have abandoned the Five Hindrances, purged the poisons of the
                mind, been able to transcend the circumstances which obstruct awakened understanding, and,
                practicing according to the Seven Factors of Awakening, have attained the true, right, and
                highest awakening. All Tathagatas of the future will also attain the fruit of true
                awakening, the state of no more obstacles, thanks to establishing their minds in the Four
                Grounds of Mindfulness. Relying on the Four Grounds of Mindfulness, they will be able to
                put an end to the Five Hindrances, purge the poisons of the mind, and overcome whatever
                weakens the ability to understand, practice the Seven Factors of Awakening, and attain the
                true, right, and highest awakening. All Tathagatas of the present (including myself) have
                attained the fruit of true awakening, the state without obstacles, thanks to establishing
                their minds in the Four Grounds of Mindfulness. Relying on the Four Grounds of
                Mindfulness, we have been able to put an end to the Five Hindrances and overcome whatever
                weakens the ability to understand, practice the Seven Factors of Awakening and attain to
                the true, right, and highest awakening.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"What are the Four Grounds of Mindfulness? They are
                the four methods of observing body as body, feelings as feelings, mind as mind, and
                objects of mind as objects of mind.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #800080;">Section Two</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"What is the way to remain established in the
                awareness of body as body?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"When the practitioner walks, he knows he is walking.
                When he stands, he knows he is standing. When he sits, he knows he is sitting. When he
                lies down, he knows he is lying down. When he wakes up, he knows he is waking up. Awake or
                asleep, he knows he is awake or asleep. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as
                body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body
                with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body
                as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, when practicing awareness of the
                body, the practitioner is clearly aware of the positions and movements of the body, such
                as going out and coming in, bending down and standing up, extending limbs, or drawing them
                in. When wearing the sanghati robe, carrying the alms bowl, walking, standing, lying,
                sitting, speaking, or being silent, he knows the skillful way of being aware. This is how
                the practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body
                as body so that whenever an unwholesome state of mind arises, he can immediately apply a
                wholesome state to counterbalance and transform the unwholesome state of mind. Just as a
                carpenter or carpenter's apprentice stretches out a piece of string along the edge of a
                plank of wood and with a plane trims off the edge of the plank, so the practitioner, when
                he feels an unwholesome state of mind arising, immediately uses a wholesome state of mind
                to counterbalance and transform the existing state. This is how the practitioner is aware
                of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in
                the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization This is called being aware
                of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body
                as body when, closing his lips tight, clenching his teeth, pressing his tongue against his
                palate, taking one part of his mind to restrain another part of his mind, he
                counterbalances a thought and transforms it. Just as two strong men might hold onto a weak
                man and easily restrain him, so the practitioner presses his lips together and clenches
                his teeth, presses his tongue against his palate, takes one part of his mind to restrain
                another part of his mind, to counterbalance and transform a thought. This is how the
                practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body
                as body, when, breathing in, he knows that he is breathing in, and breathing out, he knows
                that he is breathing out. When breathing in a long breath, he knows that he is breathing
                in a long breath. When breathing out a long breath, he knows that he is breathing out a
                long breath. When breathing in, he is aware of his whole body. Breathing out, he is aware
                of his whole body. Breathing in, he is aware of the cessation of the activity of his body.
                Breathing in, he is aware of the cessation of the activity of his speech. This is how the
                practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body, with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner is aware of body
                as body, when, thanks to having put aside the Five Desires, a feeling of bliss arises
                during his concentration and saturates every part of his body. This feeling of bliss which
                arises during concentration reaches every part of his body. Like the bath attendant who,
                after putting powdered soap into a basin, mixes it with water until the soap paste has
                water in every part of it, so the practitioner feels the bliss which is born when the
                desires of the sense realms are put aside, saturate every part of his body. This is how
                the practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                body as body, feels the joy which arises during concentration saturate every part of his
                body. There is no part of his body this feeling of joy, born during concentration, does
                not reach. Like a spring within a mountain whose clear water flows out and down all sides
                of that mountain and bubbles up in places where water has not previously entered,
                saturating the entire mountain, in the same way, joy, born during concentration, permeates
                the whole of the practitioner's body; it is present everywhere. This is how the
                practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                body as body, experiences a feeling of happiness which arises with the disappearance of
                the feeling of joy and permeates his whole body. This feeling of happiness which arises
                with the disappearance of the feeling of joy reaches every part of his body. Just as the
                different species of blue, pink, red, and white lotus which grow up from the bottom of a
                pond of clear water and appear on the surface of that pond, have their tap roots,
                subsidiary roots, leaves, and flowers all full of the water of that pond, and there is no
                part of the plant which does not contain the water, so the feeling of happiness which
                arises with the disappearance of joy permeates the whole of the practitioner's body, and
                there is no part which it does not penetrate. This is how the practitioner is aware of
                body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in
                the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization, and that is called being
                aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                body as body, envelops the whole of his body with a clear, calm mind, filled with
                understanding. Just as someone who puts on a very long robe which reaches from his head to
                his feet, and there is no part of his body which is not covered by this robe, so the
                practitioner with a clear, calm mind envelops his whole body in understanding and leaves
                no part of the body untouched. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both
                inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with
                recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as
                body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                body as body, is aware of clear light, knows how to welcome clear light, practice with and
                recall to mind clear light, whether it comes from in front to behind him or from behind to
                in front of him, day and night, above and below him, with a mind which is well-balanced
                and not hindered. He practices 'the one way in' by means of clear light, and finally his
                mind is not obscured in darkness. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body,
                both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with
                recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as
                body. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                body as body, knows how to use the meditational 'sign' skillfully, and knows how to
                maintain the object of meditation skillfully. As someone sitting observes someone lying
                down and someone lying down observes someone sitting, so the practitioner knows how to
                recognize the meditational sign and use it skillfully and knows how skillfully to maintain
                the object of meditation. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both
                inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with
                recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as
                body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                the body, knows very well that this body exists due to the interdependence of the parts of
                the body, from the top of the head to the soles of the feet. He sees that all the parts of
                the body are impure. In his body are the hairs of the head, the hairs of the body, the
                fingernails, teeth, hard skin, soft skin, flesh, sinews, bones, heart, kidneys, liver,
                lungs, large intestine, small intestine, gall bladder, stomach, excrement, brain, tears,
                sweat, sputum, saliva, pus, blood, grease, marrow, bladder, urine. He sees all these
                clearly as someone with good eyesight sees in a cask full of all sorts of grains that this
                is rice, this is millet, this is mustard seed, and so on. The practitioner who takes his
                attention throughout his body knows that it only exists in dependence on the true value of
                the parts out of which it is made, from the top of the head to the soles of the feet, and
                sees that all those parts are impure. This is how the practitioner is aware of body as
                body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body
                with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as
                body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is aware of
                body as body, observes the elements which comprise his body: 'In this very body of mine,
                there is the element earth, the element water, the element fire, the element air, the
                element space, and the cleinent consciousness.' Just as a butcher, after killing the cow
                and skinning it, lays out the meat on the ground in six parts, so the practitioner
                observes the six elements of which the body is comprised: 'Here is the earth element in my
                body, here is the water element, here is the fire element, here is the air element, here
                is the space element, and here is the consciousness element.' This is how the practitioner
                is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes
                mindfulness in the body with understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is
                called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who is meditating
                on body as body visualizes a corpse. It is one to seven days old and has been disemboweled
                by vultures and torn by wolves. It is either distended or rotting, having been thrown onto
                the charnel ground or buried in the earth. When the practitioner visualizes a corpse like
                this, he compares it with his own body: 'This body of mine will also undergo a state such
                as this. In the end, there is no way it can avoid this condition.' This is how the
                practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who meditates on
                body as body visualizes a bluish corpse, decayed and half-gnawed away, lying in a heap on
                the ground. When the practitioner visualizes a corpse like this, he compares it with his
                own body: 'This body of mine will also undergo a state such as this. In the end, there is
                no way it can avoid this condition.' This is how the practitioner is aware of body as
                body, both inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body
                with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as
                body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who meditates on
                body as body visualizes a skeleton which has no skin, flesh, blood, or bloodstains. There
                are only the bones held together by sinews. When the practitioner visualizes a skeleton
                like this, he compares it with his own body: 'This body of mine will also undergo a state
                such as this. In the end, there is no way it can avoid this condition.' This is how the
                practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who meditates on
                body as body visualizes the bones scattered in different directions: foot bone, shin bone,
                thigh bone, clavicle, spinal column, shoulder blade, tarsus, skull - each one in a
                different place. When he visualizes them like this, he compares it with his own body:
                'This body of mine will also undergo a state such as this. In the end, there is no way it
                can avoid this condition.' This is how the practitioner is aware of body as body, both
                inside the body and outside the body, and establishes mindfulness in the body with
                understanding, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of body as
                body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, a practitioner who meditates on
                body as body, visualizes the bones bleached to the color of shells or the color of a dove,
                and the bones which have rotted down to form a powder. When he visualizes them like this,
                he compares it with his own body: 'This body of mine will also undergo a state such as
                this. In the end, there is no way it can avoid this condition.' This is how the
                practitioner is aware of body as body, both inside the body and outside the body, and
                establishes mindfulness in the body with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization.
                This is called being aware of body as body.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"What is the way to remain established in the
                awareness of feelings as feelings?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"When the practitioner has a pleasant feeling, he
                knows immediately that he has a pleasant feeling. When he has an unpleasant feeling, he
                knows immediately that he has an unpleasant feeling. When he has a neutral feeling, he
                knows immediately that he has a neutral feeling. When there is a pleasant feeling, an
                unpleasant feeling, or a neutral feeling in the body; a pleasant feeling, an unpleasant
                feeling, or a neutral feeling in the mind; a pleasant feeling, an unpleasant feeling, or a
                neutral feeling of this world; a pleasant feeling, an unpleasant feeling, or a neutral
                feeling not of this world; a pleasant feeling, an unpleasant feeling, or a neutral feeling
                associated with desire; a pleasant feeling, an unpleasant feeling, or a neutral feeling
                not associated with desire, he is clearly aware of this. This is how the practitioner is
                aware of feelings as feelings, both inside the feelings and outside the feelings, and
                establishes right mindfulness. If there are bhikkhus and bhikkhunis who meditate on
                feelings as feelings, according to these instructions, then they are capable of dwelling
                in the meditation on feelings as feelings.</span></p>

                meditation on mind as mind?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"When the practitioner's mind is attached to
                something, he knows it is attached to something. When the practitioner's mind is not
                attached, he knows it is not attached. When the practitioner's mind hates something, he
                knows that it hates something. When his mind is not hating, he knows it is not hating.
                When his mind is confused, he knows it is confused. When it is not confused, he knows it
                is not confused. When his mind is defiled, he knows it is defiled. When his mind is not
                defiled, he knows it is not defiled. When it is distracted, he knows it is distracted.
                When it is not distracted, he knows it is not distracted. When his mind has obstacles, he
                knows it has obstacles. When it has no obstacles, he knows it has no obstacles. When it is
                tense, he knows it is tense. When it is not tense, he knows it is not tense. When it is
                boundless, he knows it is boundless. When it is bound, he knows it is bound. When his mind
                is concentrating, he knows it is concentrating. When it is not concentrating, he knows it
                is not concentrating. Before his mind is liberated, he knows it is not liberated. When it
                is liberated, he knows it is liberated. That. is how the practitioner is aware of mind as
                mind, both inside the mind and outside the mind, and establishes mindfulness in the mind
                with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization, and that is called being aware of
                mind as mind. If bhikkhus or bhikkhunis meditate on mind as mind according to the details

                meditation on objects of mind as objects of mind?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"When the practitioner realizes that his eyes in
                contact with form give rise to an internal formation, then he knows without any doubt that
                an internal formation is being formed. If there is no internal formation, he knows without
                any doubt that there is no internal formation. If an internal formation which had not
                arisen formerly now arises, he knows this. If an internal formation which had arisen
                formerly now comes to an end and will not arise again, he knows this. The same is true
                with all the other sense-organs: ears, nose, tongue, and body. When these sense organs are
                in contact with an external object and bring about an internal formation then the
                practitioner knows without any doubt that there is an internal formation. If an internal
                formation which had not arisen formerly now arises, he knows this. If an internal
                formation which had arisen formerly now comes to an end and will not arise again, he knows
                this. This is how the practitioner is aware of objects of mind as objects of mind, both
                inside the object and outside the object, and establishes mindfulness in the object of
                mind with recognition, insight, clarity, and realization. This is called being aware of
                objects of mind as objects of mind. If bhikkhus or bhikkhunis meditate on objects of mind
                as objects of mind according to these instructions, then they know how to dwell in the
                practice of observing objects of mind as objects of mind in the six realms of
                consciousness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further, bhikkhus, when the practitioner is
                meditating on objects of mind as objects of mind, if he sees sensual desire in himself, he
                knows without any doubt that sensual desire is there. If he sees no sensual desire in
                himself, he knows without any doubt that no sensual desire is there. If a sensual desire
                which had not arisen formerly now arises, he knows this without any doubt. If a sensual
                desire which had arisen formerly now comes to an end, he also knows this without any
                doubt. The same is true of the four other obstacles: anger, torpor, agitation and doubt.
                If there is doubt in his mind, he knows for certain that there is doubt. If there is no
                doubt in his mind, he knows for certain that there is no doubt. When a formally
                non-existent doubt arises, he knows that for certain. When an already arisen doubt comes
                to an end, he also knows that for certain. That is how the practitioner is aware of
                objects of mind as objects of mind, both inside the object and outside the object, and
                establishes mindfulness in the object of mind with recognition, insight, clarity, and
                realization, and that is called being aware of objects of mind as objects of mind. If
                bhikkhus or bhikkhunis meditate on objects of mind as objects of mind according to the
                details of these instructions, then they know how to dwell in the practice of observing
                objects of mind as objects of mind with regard to The Five Obstacles.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"Further bhikkhus, when the practitioner is
                meditating on objects of mind as objects of mind, if he sees in his mind the Factor of
                Awakening, mindfulness, he knows without any doubt that mindfulness is there. When
                mindfulness is not present, he knows without a doubt that mindfulness is not present. When
                mindfulness which had formerly not been present is now present, the practitioner also
                knows this without any doubt. When mindfulness has arisen and is still present, is not
                lost, does not decline but actually increases, the practitioner is also aware of all this.
                The same is true of all the other Factors of Awakening - the investigation of dharmas,
                energy, joy, ease, concentration, and letting go. When letting go is present in his mind,
                he knows without a doubt that letting go is present. When letting go is not present, he
                knows without a doubt that letting go is not present. When letting go which had formerly
                not been present is now present, the practitioner also knows this without any doubt. When
                letting go has arisen and is still present, is not lost, does not decline, but actually
                increases, the practitioner is also aware of all this. This is how the practitioner is
                aware of objects of mind as objects of mind, both the inside of the object and the outside
                of the object, and establishes mindfulness in the object of mind with understanding,
                insight, clarity, and realization, and that is called being aware of objects of mind as
                objects of mind. If bhikkhus or bhikkhunis meditate on objects of mind as objects of mind
                according to these instructions, then they know how to dwell in the practice of meditating
                on objects of mind as objects of mind with regard to the Seven Factors of Awakening.</span></p>

              <p>"Once a hawk suddenly swooped down on a quail and seized it. Then
              the quail, as it was being carried off by the hawk, lamented, 'O, just
              my bad luck and lack of merit that I was wandering out of my proper
              range and into the territory of others! If only I had kept to my proper
              range today, to my own ancestral territory, this hawk would have been
              no match for me in battle.'</p>
              <p>"'But what is your proper range?' the hawk asked. 'What is your own ancestral territory?'</p>
              <p>"'A newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up.'</p>
              <p>"So the hawk, without bragging about its own strength, without
              mentioning its own strength, let go of the quail. 'Go, quail, but even
              when you have gone there you won't escape me.'</p>
              <p>"Then the quail, having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of
              earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth,
              stood taunting the hawk, 'Now come and get me, you hawk! Now come and
              get me, you hawk!'</p>
              <p>"So the hawk, without bragging about its own strength, without
              mentioning its own strength, folded its two wings and suddenly swooped
              down toward the quail. When the quail knew, 'The hawk is coming at me
              full speed,' it slipped behind the clump of earth, and right there the
              hawk shattered its own breast.</p>
              <p>"This is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others.</p>
              <p>"For this reason, you should not wander into what is not your proper
              range and is the territory of others. In one who wanders into what is
              not his proper range and is the territory of others, <a id="mara" name="mara">Mara</a> gains an opening, Mara gains a foothold. And what, for a monk, is not his proper range and is the territory of others? The <a id="strands5" name="strands5">five strands</a> of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable by the eye — agreeable,
              pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. Sounds
              cognizable by the ear... Aromas cognizable by the nose... Flavors
              cognizable by the tongue... Tactile sensations cognizable by the body —
              agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing.
              These, for a monk, are not his proper range and are the territory of
              others.</p>
              <p>"Wander, monks, in what is your proper range, your own ancestral
              territory. In one who wanders in what is his proper range, his own
              ancestral territory, Mara gains no opening, Mara gains no foothold. And
              what, for a monk, is his proper range, his own ancestral territory? <a id="for4" name="for4">The four</a> frames of reference. Which four? There is the case where a monk remains
              focused on the body in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful —
              putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to the world. He
              remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves... mind in &amp; of
              itself... mental qualities in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert,
              &amp; mindful — putting aside greed &amp; distress with reference to
              the world. This, for a monk, is his proper range, his own ancestral

              <p>The Satipatthana Sutta, a Buddhist scripture which teaches
                                          awareness, uses expressions such as "observing the body in the
                                          body," "observing the feelings in the feelings," "observing the
                                          mind in the mind," "observing the objects of mind in the objects of
                                          mind." Why are the words, body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind
                                          repeated? Some masters of the Abhidhamma say that the purpose of
                                          this repetition is to underline the importance of these words. I
                                          see it otherwise. I think that these words are repeated in order to
                                          remind us not to separate the meditator and the object of
                                          meditation. We must live with the object, identify with it, merge
                                          with it, like a grain of salt entering the sea in order to measure
                                          the saltiness of the sea.</p>

                                          suggests:</p>
              <p><em>From the pine tree</em></p>
              <p><em>Learn of the pine tree</em></p>
              <p><em>And from the bamboo</em></p>
              <p><em>of the bamboo.</em></p>
              <p>Commenting on these lines, the Japanese philosopher Nishitani
                                          (1982) explains that Basho does not mean</p>
              <p><em>That we should ‘observe the pine tree carefully.’ Still less
                                          does he mean for us to ‘study the pine tree scientifically.’ He
                                          means for us to enter the mode of being where the pine tree is the
                                          pine tree itself, and the bamboo is the bamboo itself, and from
                                          there to look at the pine tree and the bamboo. He calls on us to
                                          betake ourselves to the dimension where things become manifest in
                                          their suchness. (p. 128)</em></p>
              <p>In the same vein, Zen Master Dogen advises: “You should not
                                          restrict yourselves to learning to see water from the viewpoints of
                                          human beings alone. Know that you must see water in the way water
                                          sees water” (Izutsu, 1972, p. 140). “Seeing water in the way water
                                          sees water” means recognizing water in its suchness, free of all
                                          concepts that spring from an observing mind standing back from
                                          experience.</p>

              <p>Glossary by Glen Wallis in "Basic Teachings of the
                                      Buddha":</p>
              <p>15.20: <em>in and as</em>: The text has the locative case for each noun, which can indicate either of these prepositions. Most translations give one or the other. I prefer to keep the apparent ambiguity in play. "In" the body sounds funny, but it suggests that the center of awareness has shifted. That is, it is not a case of the thinking organ being aware of some object, "the body." The awareness, rather, is precisely <em>in</em> the body -- body aware of body. But even this "of" is problematic. We could just as easily (and just as misleadingly) say body aware <em>on</em> body, <em>through</em> body, <em>with</em> body. Prepositions are extremely bossy words. They force and reinforce on their users a profoundly dualistic view of the world: I am aware <em>of</em> such and such. In the present instance, though, it is a case of<em> bodyaware</em>, or <em>awarebody</em>, or<em> bodyawarebody</em>, period, no preposition required. The English "as," by contrast, serves the Buddha's meaning well. "Observing the body as the body" means that I regard the body not as "I-me-mine" but just <em>as</em> body. This "as" creates the distance required for me to forgo my (personal pronouns are bossy, too!) deep-seated tendency to personalize and claim ownership of the egoless processes of being.</p>
              <p>15.22. <em>present-moment awareness</em>. The Pali term is sati. This term is normally translated as "mindfulness." It refers to our natural capacity to rest our awareness on some object or event. Present-moment awareness, however, is just aware; that is, it is nonconceptual and nondiscursive in nature. In that sense, we can say that sati is awareness itself. Awareness is the very quality that constitutes human consciousness, just like water is the quality that constitutes a pond.</p>
              <p>Present-moment awareness is the interminable receptivity toward whatever appears within our sensorium (seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, tactile feeling, thinking). Postcanonical literature refers to it as "dry" (sukkha) attentiveness to whatever arises. That is, it is a bare or naked apprehension of things and events. A contemporary teacher, Henapola Gunaratna, somewhere calls it "mirror-thought", in that it merely reflects what appears, without grasping, rejecting, or coloring the arising phenomenon. When, for instance, anger arises, sati is merely aware of the bare process of feelings, thoughts, et cetera, unfolding in the mind-body continuum. Although this process is normally labeled "anger," present-moment awareness, being nonconceptual, does not name, express, or repress the anger: it simply remains present and receptive to it. In so doing, of course, "it" turns out to be no one, stable entity -- anger -- but a complex host of energies, concepts, physiological reactions, and so on. The practitioner who is cultivating present-moment awareness, furthermore, rapidly learns that being <em>just </em>aware of a given sensorial phenomenon tends to decrease the gravitational pull of that phenomenon. Thus, present-moment awareness engenders a less reactive, habituated way of relating to the world around us. During seated meditation, present-moment awareness is cultivated by placing and sustaining attention on the breathing process, as explained in the present sutta.</p>
              <p>15.23. <em>investigation into qualities</em>. The word for this practice is <em>dhammavicaya</em>. When the practitioner is able to maintain awareness fluidly, moment by moment, he or she spontaneously realizes the fundamental qualities (dhamma) of phenomena. These qualities may be specific or generalized. In the preceding note's example, anger is a specific quality (dhamma). Investigation (vicaya) means that when anger has arisen, the practitioner knows -- can see with penetrative insight -- that that quality is marked by three characteristics: impermaennce (Pali: anicca; Sanskrit: anitya), non-substantiality (anatta/anatman), and unease (dukkha/duhkha). More generally, but of most significance for the practitioner, the Buddha identified five qualities that function to prevent success in meditation. In sutta 3, he calls these qualities "hindrances, obstructions, obstacles, coverings, envelopings." The five hindrances are: (1) desire, (2) hostility, (3) heavy lethargy, (4) agitated worry, and (5) debilitating doubt. Whenever the practitioner is overcome by one of these qualities, it is imperative that he or she thoroughly investigate the quality. Investigating tiredness or lethargy, for example, means exploring its nature (heavy, dark, forceful, coercive, and so on) and its function (physically affecting, anesthetizing, all-enveloping). Because of the function of present-moment awareness and energy, the practitioner's investigation will be sharp and clear. So, paradoxically, the practitioner realizes that he or she "is" (what does the verb really mean in this case?) lethargic yet vibrant, sleepy yet alert. Knowing in this manner, one has a weakened tendency to be reactive toward whatever quality is appearing. During meditation practice, being skilled in investigation means that the practitioner has the capacity to see the nature of whatever is arising as being ultimately transparent.</p>
