            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">~ SARIRA ~</span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">"Sarira", sometimes also "Sharira", is a term derived from a Sanskrit root-word which can best be translated as something close to "what is easily dissolved," that is, easily worn away; the idea being something transitory, foam-like, full of holes, as it were. A more general meaning is: a composite body or vehicle of impermanent character in and through which an ethereal entity lives and works. In such a translation the body is likened a sheath, a vehicle, a Upadhi for consciousness. Upadhi is like an appearance, a disguise. Derived from the Sanskrit verb-root dha plus the prepositional prefix upa, meaning in combination "to put on," as in a disguise. In Hindu philosophy an Upadhi is a 'vehicle' or 'base,' that which is the mere appearance of some unseen Reality or consciousness center.<br><br>KARANA SARIRA: Vijnanamayakosha (Causal Body) for the upper levels of the Mental Plane; Manomayakosha (Mental Body) for the lower part of the Mental Plane; Anandamayakosha (Bliss Body) for the Buddhic Plane.<br><br>SUKSHMA SARIRA: (Astral Body)(sometimes, Subtle Body) for the Astral Plane. Denotes the link between the nervous system and the cosmic reservoir.<br><br>LINGA SARIRA: Pranamayakosha for the etheric levels of the Physical Plane, the Etheric Double also being a recepticle for the Vital Force(Prana).<br><br>STHULA SARIRA: Annamayakosha (Gross Body) for the Dense Physical Plane.<br><br>An interesting point about the Sanskrit definition of a body Â“that is easily dissolvedÂ” is that it is also interpreted to mean Â“full of holesÂ”. Science today is teaching that the building block parts of the atoms of which our bodies are composed are relatively more empty than they are full. We are, as bodies, essentially etheric. Our physical world is mostly so-called empty space</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: red;"><span class="large">SACRED RELICS</span></span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">The translation of the Sanskrit Sarira literally means 'body', BUT in Buddhist usage most often refers to the sacred relics found in the cremated remains of the Buddha or of a Buddhist monk. If we are indeed "star stuff" even before death we are cremated, that is, composed of the remains of cremated stars. Witness the Crab Nebula above as the material from the exploded star expands out to be reused somewhere by the Universe again and again. Rebirth in its purest form.<br><br>After the death of Prince Siddhartha Gautama aka The Buddha, Shakyamuni Gotama 2,600 years ago, following tradition, he was cremated. Followers searched through his ashes and found four teeth and some finger bones. His relics were distributed and later redistributed by Emperor Asoka, who built special stupas ( Chinese: "pagoda" ) to house them for worship. Of the finger bones, only one, shown in the graphic above, is known to be in existence today.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Products/finger_bone02.jpg"><br><br>Often in the cremated remains of monks who have led extremely pure lives are found Sarira of various colors and sizes that look like effulgent pearls.<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v244/OCEANOS/Products/buddha-relics-blood_01.jpg"><br><br>Chan Master Hsu-Yun related this experience he had with a relic of the Buddha at Asoka Monastery:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">". . . Everyday when visitors came to have a look at the Sarira, I always followed them. The visitors' opinions about the relic varied greatly. I had seen it many times; at first it looked to me as of the size of a green bean and of a dark purple color. In the middle of the tenth month, after I had paid reverence to the Mahayana and Hinayana tripitakas, I went again to look and it was the same size as before but like a brilliant red pearl. As I was impatient to see how it would transform itself, I again prostrated myself and felt pains all over my body; the Sarira was bigger than a yellow bean, half yellow and half white. I then realized that its size and color varied according to the visitors sense organ and its field. . . ." </span>(Empty Cloud: the Autobiography of Hsu Yun)<br><br>Bones have played an important roll in various ways throughout Buddhist history. It is not known generally, but Aurispacy, the casting of bones, called Divination, has a long, albeit, early, history in the Tao and the beginnings of Buddhism. The Chinese people believed that certain bones were able to answers man's questions and predict the future. Particularly in the Han Dynasty were fortune telling customs utilized by laymen and nobles to fortell everyday concerns as well as more substantial matters and aptly demonstrate numerous beliefs of the people.</span></strong></div>
