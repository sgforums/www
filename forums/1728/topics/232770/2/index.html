A more general meaning is: a composite body or vehicle of impermanent character in and through which an ethereal entity lives and works. In such a translation the body is likened a sheath, a vehicle, a Upadhi for consciousness. Upadhi is like an appearance, a disguise. Derived from the Sanskrit verb-root dha plus the prepositional prefix upa, meaning in combination "to put on," as in a disguise. In Hindu philosophy an Upadhi is a 'vehicle' or 'base,' that which is the mere appearance of some unseen Reality or consciousness center.<br><br>KARANA SARIRA: Vijnanamayakosha (Causal Body) for the upper levels of the Mental Plane; Manomayakosha (Mental Body) for the lower part of the Mental Plane; Anandamayakosha (Bliss Body) for the Buddhic Plane.<br><br>SUKSHMA SARIRA: (Astral Body)(sometimes, Subtle Body) for the Astral Plane. Denotes the link between the nervous system and the cosmic reservoir.<br><br>LINGA SARIRA: Pranamayakosha for the etheric levels of the Physical Plane, the Etheric Double also being a recepticle for the Vital Force(Prana).<br><br>STHULA SARIRA: Annamayakosha (Gross Body) for the Dense Physical Plane.<br><br>An interesting point about the Sanskrit definition of a body Â“that is easily dissolvedÂ” is that it is also interpreted to mean Â“full of holesÂ”. Science today is teaching that the building block parts of the atoms of which our bodies are composed are relatively more empty than they are full. We are, as bodies, essentially etheric. Our physical world is mostly so-called empty space</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote><a href="http://sped2work.tripod.com/sarira.html" rel="nofollow">http://sped2work.tripod.com/sarira.html</a><br><br>next time why dont you post the url of the website that you cut and paste from, it is this pattern of yours that makes me think that you are just trying to make yourself look more grand than you actually are.</div>
