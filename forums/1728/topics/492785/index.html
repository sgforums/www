              Donald S. Lopez, Jr. unpacks what may be the most famous of Buddhist
              scriptures, explaining how it came to be and how its influence has grown over
              centuries. Here, in Chapter 1 from that book, Lopez provides what he calls “The
              Plot Summary” of the<span><strong><span style="color: #8b8589;"> </span></strong></span><em><strong><span style="color: #8b8589;">Lotus Sutra</span></strong></em>, in plain language.
              Whether you’re experienced with the<em><strong><span style="color: #8b8589;">Lotus</span></strong></em><span><strong><span style="color: #8b8589;"> </span></strong></span>or have never endeavored to read
              it, you’ll have a deeper understanding of it.<em></em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>The Lotus SÅ«tra</span></em><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>begins, like so many Buddhist sÅ«tras, with the Buddha seated on
              Vulture Peak. He is surrounded by a huge audience of monks, nuns, and deities,
              many of whom are named; those names include the most famous figures of the
              tradition. Also present is a huge audience of<em>bodhisattvas</em>.
              This immediately indicates that this is a MahÄ�yÄ�na sÅ«tra, where the
              bodhisattva—one who has vowed to follow the long path to buddhahood—is extolled
              over the<span> </span><em>arhat</em>, the ideal of the early
              Buddhist tradition, who follows a much shorter path to nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The Buddha
              delivers a discourse, whose content is not described, and then enters a state
              of deep meditation. He emits a ray of light from between his eyes, illuminating
              all the realms to the east, from the highest heavens to the lowest hells. One
              of the bodhisattvas in the audience—MañjuÅ›rÄ«, the bodhisattva of wisdom—reports
              that he once witnessed the same miracle in the far distant past, after which
              the Buddha of that age taught the<span> </span><em>Lotus SÅ«tra</em>. He thus speculates
              that ÅšÄ�kyamuni, the Buddha of the present age, is about to do the same.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The Buddha now
              speaks, praising the wisdom of the buddhas, which he describes as superior to
              that of those who follow the path of the<span> </span><em>Å›rÄ�vaka</em>(disciple) or<span> </span><em>pratyekabuddha</em><span> </span>(privately enlightened) to become
              arhats. He goes on to say that he has taught the dharma using skillful means (<em>upÄ�ya</em>) in order that the beings of
              the world might overcome attachment. He addresses this statement to one of the
              arhats in the audience, indeed, the wisest of the arhats, the monk ÅšÄ�riputra.
              The Buddha’s statement is disconcerting to ÅšÄ�riputra; as an arhat, he is “one
              who has nothing further to learn.” And yet the Buddha is praising a wisdom
              beyond his comprehension and using a term—skillful means—that he had not heard
              before.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>In the past, the Buddha had taught three paths or “vehicles. […]
              However, those paths were skillful means. In fact, there is only one path, one
              vehicle: the path to buddhahood, the buddha vehicle.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The Buddha
              eventually agrees to explain what he has said, but before he can do so, five
              thousand members of the audience get up and walk out—a remarkable moment in a
              Buddhist text. Describing them as arrogant, the Buddha announces that he is now
              about to teach the “true dharma,” the<em>saddharma</em>,
              which forms the first word in the Sanskrit title of the sÅ«tra. He explains that
              the buddhas appear in the world for one reason: to lead beings to buddhahood.
              In the past, he had taught three paths or “vehicles” (<em>yÄ�na</em>): the path of the Å›rÄ�vaka that
              leads to the nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a of the a</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>rhat, the path of the pratyekabuddha that leads to the nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a of the arhat, and the path of the rare bodhisattva
              that leads to the distant state of buddhahood. However, those paths were
              skillful means. In fact, there is only one path, one vehicle </span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>(<em>ekayÄ�na</em>): the
              path to buddhahood, the buddha vehicle (<em>buddhayÄ�na</em>).
              He explains that if he had revealed this single path from the beginning, many
              would have felt incapable of following it. Therefore, he devised a skillful
              method to accommodate them, teaching a shorter and simpler path, the path to
              the nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a of the arhat. Now, he is
              revealing that there is only one path and that that path is available to all.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>The Lotus SÅ«tra</span></em><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>is famous for its seven parables (or eight in some versions).
              Four will be discussed here. The first and most famous is the parable of the
              burning house in Chapter Three. The house of a kind father catches on fire
              while his children are playing inside. When they ignore their father’s pleas to
              escape, he tells them that outside the house there are three carts awaiting
              them: one pulled by a sheep; one, by a deer; and one, by an ox. This promise
              causes the children to leave the house, where they find a single cart, drawn by
              an ox. The Buddha explains that the burning house is<span> </span><em>sa</em></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹ƒ</span></em><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>sÄ�ra</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>, the realm of rebirth; he is the
              father, and the children are the sentient beings of the universe, so absorbed
              in the world that they ignore its dangers. Knowing the predilections and
              capacities of sentient beings, the Buddha lures them to various paths to escape
              sa</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹ƒ</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>sÄ�r</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>a by offering them something
              that appeals to their limited aspirations. However, this is his skillful
              method. When they have set out on that path, or even reached its final
              destination, he reveals that there is only one path and one goal, far superior
              to what he had taught before: the single vehicle to buddhahood.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>The Buddha explains that the burning house is<em><strong>sa</strong></em></span></em><em><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>á¹ƒ</span></strong></em><em><strong><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>sÄ�ra</span></strong></em><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #a0a0a0;'>, the realm of rebirth; he is the
              father, and the children are the sentient beings of the universe, so absorbed
              in the world that they ignore its dangers.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>This inspiring
              revelation is followed by a grim description of the fate that awaits those who
              reject the<span><em> </em></span><em>Lotus SÅ«tra</em><span> </span>and who disparage those who follow it.
              After they die, they will be reborn in hell, and when they are subsequently
              reborn as humans, they will suffer all manner of maladies.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The Buddha’s
              revelation of the single vehicle causes the great arhats, beginning with
              ÅšÄ�riputra, to request prophecies of their future buddhahood, something that all
              bodhisattvas must receive to proceed on the path to buddhahood. They explain
              that up until this point, they were unaware that they were worthy to follow
              that path, illustrating this with the parable of the prodigal son who leaves
              home, during which time his father amasses great wealth. When the son
              eventually returns, he feels unworthy to claim his birthright, and his father
              must employ a series of stratagems to convince him of his destiny.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The Buddha’s
              skillful means are illustrated yet again with the parable of the conjured city.
              Here a group of travelers set out on a long journey in search of treasure, led
              by a guide. They become discouraged along the way and decide to turn back, but
              the guide tells them that there is a city just ahead. After they have rested in
              the city and regained their resolve, the guide tells them that he had conjured
              the city and that the treasure lies ahead. Here, the Buddha is the guide, and
              the treasure is buddhahood. If the Buddha had explained from the outset how
              long the path to buddhahood was, many would not seek it. He therefore inspires
              beings to seek the nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a of the arhat. Yet, when they
              reach it, he explains that it is an illusion and that the true goal lies ahead.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Woven throughout
              the sÅ«tra are what might be called strategies of legitimation. The Buddha
              recounts numerous stories from the far distant past, before past events
              described in the earlier tradition. These accounts describe the<span> </span><em>Lotus
              SÅ«tra</em><span> </span>being taught
              long ago in distant universes, with the members of the ancient audience, including
              the Buddha while he was a bodhisattva, now appearing in the present. If the<span> </span><em>Lotus
              SÅ«tra</em><span> </span>was taught long
              ago, it cannot be a modern innovation, something that Buddhism has
              traditionally condemned. Also found throughout the sÅ«tra are various prophecies
              and promises of the glories that await the devotees of the Lotus, even if that
              devotion takes such simple forms as reciting a single verse of the sÅ«tra,
              offering flowers to the text, or just joining one’s hands in reverence. Those
              beneficent admonitions are sometimes paired with warnings, and not only of the
              fate that awaits those who fail to acknowledge that the<span> </span><em>Lotus
              SÅ«tra</em>is the word of the Buddha. In Chapter Ten, for example, the
              Buddha warns that devotees of the<span> </span><em>Lotus</em><span> </span>will face mockery and disparagement
              after he has passed into nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>Chapter Eleven
              contains one of the most fantastic (in the original sense of that word) scenes
              in Buddhist literature. The traditional structure that houses the relics of the
              Buddha is the<span> </span><em>stÅ«pa</em><span> </span>(from which the English word<em>tope</em><span> </span>derives), a large mound. According to
              the traditional account of his final days, the Buddha instructed his disciples
              to cremate his body and place his remains in a stÅ«pa. Over the course of the
              history of Buddhism in India, such reliquaries became increasingly elaborate,
              taking the form of the pagoda in East Asia and the<span> </span><em>chedi</em><span> </span>in Thailand.</span></p>

              opens, a massive stÅ«pa, miles high and miles wide, emerges from the earth and
              floats in the air above the assembly. A voice inside is heard praising the<span> </span><em>Lotus
              SÅ«tra</em>. At the request of his disciples, the Buddha rises into the
              air and opens the door of the stÅ«pa to reveal not relics but a living buddha,
              named PrabhÅ«taratna, who explains that he vowed long ago that after his passage

              appear there. He then invites the Buddha to sit beside him. This image of two
              buddhas seated side by side inside a stÅ«pa would be widely depicted in Buddhist
              art over the centuries. Among the doctrinal revelations that this scene
              intimates is that a buddha does not die after he passes into nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a.</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'></span></p>

              roles in the Lotus. Among the many arhats to whom the Buddha offers prophecies
              of future buddhahood are two nuns: his stepmother, MahÄ�prajÄ�patÄ«, and his wife,
              YaÅ›odharÄ�. The most famous scene involving a female occurs in Chapter Twelve,
              in which the bodhisattva MañjuÅ›rÄ« introduces an eight-year-old<span> </span><em>nÄ�ga</em><span> </span>princess (often depicted as half
              human, half snake) and says that she will attain buddhahood. When ÅšÄ�riputra
              disputes this, saying that women have five obstructions that prevent their
              attainment of buddhahood, the nÄ�ga princess instantaneously achieves
              buddhahood, but only after first turning into a male.</span></p>

              bodhisattva had arrived from other universes to witness the stÅ«pa that emerged
              from the earth. At the beginning of Chapter Fifteen, they volunteer to remain
              in this world to preserve and promote the<span> </span><em>Lotus</em><span> </span>after the Buddha has passed into nirvÄ�</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹‡</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";  color: #222222;'>a. The Buddha politely declines, saying that there are
              sufficient bodhisattvas from hi</span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>s own world for the task. At
              that point, another remarkable scene occurs, as billions of golden bodhisattvas
              emerge from beneath the earth. When the bodhisattva Maitreya asks who these
              bodhisattvas are, the Buddha explains that they are his disciples, whom he
              placed on the path to buddhahood aeons ago. Maitreya is puzzled by this because
              he knows that the Buddha only achieved enlightenment forty years ago.</span></p>

              point that the Buddha makes the second great revelation of the<em>Lotus SÅ«tra</em><span> </span>(the first being that there is only
              one vehicle). In the next chapter, the Buddha explains that the world believes
              that he was born as a prince, left the palace in search of enlightenment,
              practiced austerities for six years, and achieved buddhahood near the city of
              GayÄ�. In fact, he achieved buddhahood incalculable aeons ago, and the life
              story that is so well known is yet another case of his skillful means; he was
              enlightened all the time, yet feigned those deeds to inspire the world. Not

              yet another parable, that of the physician father. The sons of a physician have
              taken a poison that has driven them mad, such that they refuse to take the
              antidote that he prepares. He thus leaves the city and has a messenger return
              to tell his sons that he has died. The shock of the news returns them to their
              senses, and they take the antidote. The father then returns home. Here, the
              Buddha is the father. If the beings of the world knew that he would always be
              available to teach the path, there would be no urgency to their practice. By

              world is a buddha field, a pure land. As the Buddha says, “Although my pure
              land never decays, the sentient see it as ravaged by fire and torn with anxiety
              and distress. … To the deluded and unenlightened I say that I have entered

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>The remainder of
              the sÅ«tra is devoted to enumerating the many benefits that await those who
              honor the<span> </span><em>Lotus SÅ«tra</em><span> </span>and the sad fate that awaits those who
              disparage it. Although the sÅ«tra has twenty-eight chapters, it appears to end
              with Chapter Twenty-Two, when the Buddha exhorts his disciples to spread the
              teaching, after which they return to their abodes. As will be discussed in the
              next chapter, scholars speculate that this was the final chapter of an earlier
              version of the<span> </span><em>Lotus</em>, with the last six chapters
              being interpolations.</span></p>

              chapters seem to be designed to promote the worship of bodhisattvas mentioned
              in early chapters, two of whom deserve special mention. The first is<span> </span><em>Bhai</em></span><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Tahoma","sans-serif";  color: #222222;'>á¹£</span></em><em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif";   color: #222222;'>ajyarÄ�ja</span></em><span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'> </span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; color: #222222;'>(Medicine King). The Buddha
              explains that as a bodhisattva in a previous life, he honored a previous buddha
              by ingesting oils, soaking his robes in oil, and setting himself on fire, with
              his body illuminating billions of worlds for twelve hundred years. As we shall
              see in chapter 3, monks in China would follow his example, their bodies burning
              for considerably shorter periods.</span></p>

              Twenty-Five is regarded as an interpolation, it is in many ways the most famous
              chapter in the<span> </span><em>Lotus SÅ«tra</em>, widely memorized and
              circulated independently. It is devoted to the most famous bodhisattva in
              Buddhism, AvalokiteÅ›vara: the “Lord Who Looks Down” in Sanskrit, rendered as
              the “Perceiver of the Sounds of the World” in Chinese, with both versions of
              the name suggesting his compassion in responding to those in need. Here, the
              salvation that he offers is not only spiritual but also physical, rescuing
              those who are drowning, attacked by demons, beset by bandits, and thrown in
              prison. If a woman is childless, he will provide a child. This bodhisattva has
              the power to appear in any form. As we shall see in chapter 3, there are many
              stories of AvalokiteÅ›vara disguising himself to benefit those in need.</span></p>

Frankly, one in billions people ONLY may succeed through self power for supreme enlightenment. This is from Buddha's advice in a sutra for sentient beings at the dharma ending era. In fact, even Buddha's father had taken Buddha advice to rebirth pureland amitabha during that era when Buddha was still present. </p>
