              Western World</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">May 11, 2017 Adam Frank NPR</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">When
              discussions about science and religion turn into debates about science versus
              religion, Buddhism mostly gets a pass.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Thanks
              to the work of the Dalai Lama and others, Buddhism can seem far friendlier to
              modern, scientifically minded sensibilities than the Abrahamic religions. This
              alignment with science is strengthened by the widespread adoption of
              mindfulness techniques — often derived from Buddhist and other contemplative
              practices — in domains like medicine and psychology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              with its supposed empirical emphasis on internal investigation, one might
              wonder if Buddhism is really a religion at all or, at least, in same the sense
              as Western monotheistic traditions. Maybe it's better described as a kind of
              "science of happiness?"</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Robert
              Sharf is a scholar of Buddhist studies at UC Berkeley and he has, apparently,
              heard this kind of question before. I was recently introduced to Sharf's
              insightful writings via discussions about Buddhism and cognitive science with
              philosopher Evan Thompson, who has been doing his own work in these domains.
              For Sharf, the easy identification of Buddhism as a kind of inward-directed
              science of the mind represents a particular reading of its long and diverse
              traditions. Most importantly, what we get in the West is, for Sharf, a kind of
              "Buddhist Modernism." In particular, the affinity Buddhism is supposed
              to have with science is, for Sharf, a very specific consequence of Buddhism's
              historical encounter with the West — and to miss that history would be to miss
              the richer veins of meaning in Buddhism as a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              a 2007 interview with Tricycle magazine, Sharf pointed to the response of
              Buddhists in countries like Japan and Sri Lanka during their encounters with
              Western culture in late 1800s. These nations were already being rocked by
              modernization and/or colonization. At the same time, the West was undergoing
              its own religious transformations. According Sharf, Protestants during this
              period were confronting a "crisis of faith" due to the rise of
              science. This led to new ways of thinking that tried to mesh Christianity more
              smoothly with science and its rational worldview. In this way, a confluence of
              Asian and Western interests began that would help shape a new vision of
              Buddhism. As Sharf puts it:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"...the
              critiques of religion that originated in the West resonated with [Buddhist's]
              own needs as they struggled with cultural upheavals in their homelands. [While]
              for Westerners, Buddhism seemed to provide an attractive spiritual alternative
              to their own seemingly moribund religious traditions. The irony, of course, is
              that the Buddhism to which these Westerners were drawn was one already
              transformed by its contact with the West."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is this transformed tradition with its affinity with science that modern
              Americans are encountering.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sharf
              is not the only one to make this point. In his book The Scientific Buddha
              Donald S. Lopez, Jr., a professor in the department of Asian languages at the
              University of Michigan, also sees a lot of selection in what comprises Western
              Buddhism. In his words:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"For
              the Buddha to be identified as an ancient sage fully attuned to the findings of
              modern science, it was necessary that he first be transformed into a figure who
              differed in many ways from the Buddha who has been revered by Buddhists across
              Asia over the course of many centuries."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Of
              course, by its very nature religion, all religions, are changed by their
              encounters with new cultures. This is particularly true of Buddhism and its
              steady march eastward from its birth in India 2,500 years ago. Religions always
              have a way of outgrowing their own scriptural and ritual basis, while
              simultaneously holding on to them. As author Karen Armstrong has shown,
              practitioners in any age are always selecting out those parts of their
              religions that are meaningful to them while ignoring the parts that seem dated.
              She called the process "creative misreading."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sharf
              has no problem with the creative misreading that allows Buddhist Modernism to
              share space with scientific worldviews. "My concern," he told
              Tricycle, "is not with the selectivity of those who read Buddhism as a
              rationalist and scientific religion — it is perfectly understandable given the
              world in which we live. It is really not a question of misreading. It is a
              question of what gets lost in the process."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Part
              of the problem for Sharf and others is that by focusing only on the domains of
              inner experience (i.e. mindfulness via contemplative practice), Buddhist
              Modernism loses aspects of its function that were central to its history.
              "Look at how suspicious many Western Buddhists are of religious
              ritual," he says in the Tricycle interview, "... when we downplay
              ritual, we risk weakening our bonds to community and tradition. That's a pretty
              major loss."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              just as important for both Sharf and Lopez are the tensions that they think
              should exist between the Buddhist and Western worldviews. As Lopez puts it:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"If
              an ancient religion like Buddhism has anything to offer science, it is not in
              the facile confirmation of [science's] findings ... the Buddha, the old Buddha,
              not the Scientific Buddha, presented a radical challenge to the way we see the
              world, both the world that was seen two millennia ago, and the world that is
              seen today."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Sharf
              is specific in terms of the challenge he thinks Buddhism presents the sciences'
              presumed philosophical basis. "In order to make Buddhism compatible with
              science," Sharf says, "Buddhist Modernism ... accepts a Cartesian
              dualistic understanding of the world." This Cartesian separation would, he
              claims, be pretty weird to most Buddhist teachers throughout its history. As he
              puts it:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">"Traditional
              Buddhist epistemology, for example, simply does not accept the Cartesian notion
              of an insurmountable gap between mind and matter. Most Buddhist philosophies
              hold that mind and object arise interdependently, so there is no easy way to
              separate one's understanding of the world from the world itself."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Keeping
              these differences at the forefront is important for Sharf because, he claims,
              they offer possibilities of generating something more truly original. "In
              discarding everything that doesn't fit with our modern view," he says,
              "we compromise the tradition's capacity to critique this modern
              view."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I'm
              someone interested in how philosophical traditions from India and Asia might
              add new dimensions to some key debates in science. In that sense, I have always
              been sympathetic to Buddhist Modernism and am interested in the Scientific
              Buddha.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But
              I also believe scholars like Sharf, Lopez and Thompson all have a lot to teach
              us with their close reading of Buddhism's philosophy and history. As Sharf
              himself points out, we don't have to "argue for a naive acceptance of
              Buddhist epistemology and cosmology" to be informed about the best ways to
              realistically engage with its philosophical insights. "But," as Sharf
              says, "we won't see what Buddhism has to offer if, at the outset, we twist
              it out of shape to make it conform to contemporary norms."</span></p>
