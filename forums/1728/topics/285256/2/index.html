There is the Sravaka Bodhi, Pratyeka Bodhi, and Samyak Bodhi.<br><br>The very word shravaka, a shravaka arhat, means he is a 'hearer'. It means, he attained enlightenment through hearing, following, practising what a Sammasambuddha (full Buddha like Shakyamuni) has taught. He follows the teachings of such a Sammasam Buddha and attained Arhatship.<br><br>A solitary Buddha, or a Pratyekabuddha, attains enlightenment in his lifetime without learning from any Buddhas or any enlightened ones. He simply saw some signs, maybe some falling leaves, and attained an intuitive insight into the truth of dependent origination. Then, he attains enlightenment. A pratyekabuddha attains enlightenment during a period where there are no Buddhas. He has learned under previous Buddhas, but did not attain enlightenment in that lifetime, so continued to practise until one lifetime he attains Pratyekabuddhahood without the guide of any other enlightened beings. There are many pratyekabuddhas most of whom we probably did not know (since they are known as solitary), though some people say Lao Tzu could be an example of a pratyekabuddha. I will not debate on whether he is a pratyekabuddha here and is beyond the scope of this discussion.<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha is an example of one who attained Anuttarasamyaksambodhi -- perfect, unexcelled enlightenment. He is a Buddha has not only attains Full Enlightenment, but also perfected the Paramitas, and obtained the ability, wisdom and skillful means to lead and guide lots and lots of sentient beings in masses towards enlightenment.<br><br>There can only be 1 Samyaksambodhi at any particular time in history, however, Shakyamuni Buddha was not the first Samyaksam Buddha to exist.. there are previous Samyaksam Buddhas before him, and also more Samyaksam Buddhas to come (the next one will be Maitreya Buddha). However, the previous Buddhas is beyond our written recorded history.<br><br>So, a Pratyekabuddha and a Samyaksam Buddha attains enlightenment by himself without the aid of other enlightened teachers, in that particular lifetime. But this does not mean that the pratyekabuddha has not practised in previous lifetimes --- a pratyekabuddha has also practised in previous lifetimes, and also under previous Buddhas. Similar goes to the Samyaksam Buddha like Shakyamuni Buddha. Especially for such Buddhas, they have to practise as a Bodhisattva for many many lifetimes, perfecting the Paramitas, before finally being able to attain complete Buddhahood.<br><br>So hopefully, that should answer your question.</div>

He has learned under previous Buddhas, but did not attain enlightenment in that lifetime, so continued to practise until one lifetime he attains Pratyekabuddhahood without the guide of any other enlightened beings. There are many pratyekabuddhas most of whom we probably did not know (since they are known as solitary), though some people say Lao Tzu could be an example of a pratyekabuddha. I will not debate on whether he is a pratyekabuddha here and is beyond the scope of this discussion.<br><br>Shakyamuni Buddha is an example of one who attained Anuttarasamyaksambodhi -- perfect, unexcelled enlightenment. He is a Buddha has not only attains Full Enlightenment, but also perfected the Paramitas, and obtained the ability, wisdom and skillful means to lead and guide lots and lots of sentient beings in masses towards enlightenment.<br><br>There can only be 1 Samyaksambodhi at any particular time in history, however, Shakyamuni Buddha was not the first Samyaksam Buddha to exist.. there are previous Samyaksam Buddhas before him, and also more Samyaksam Buddhas to come (the next one will be Maitreya Buddha). However, the previous Buddhas is beyond our written recorded history.<br><br>So, a Pratyekabuddha and a Samyaksam Buddha attains enlightenment by himself without the aid of other enlightened teachers, in that particular lifetime. But this does not mean that the pratyekabuddha has not practised in previous lifetimes --- a pratyekabuddha has also practised in previous lifetimes, and also under previous Buddhas. Similar goes to the Samyaksam Buddha like Shakyamuni Buddha. Especially for such Buddhas, they have to practise as a Bodhisattva for many many lifetimes, perfecting the Paramitas, before finally being able to attain complete Buddhahood.<br><br>So hopefully, that should answer your question.</div></blockquote>Mod going off-topic here, time to break out a new thread.</div>
