            <div class='col-md body'>Translation:<br><br><strong>The Best of the Best must still practice Buddhism</strong><br><br>Q: I'm living without problems with clothes and food, I treat others well, others treat me well, my life is happy, why should I practice Buddhism?<br><br>A: You treat others well, others treat you well, your marriage's relationship is very well, life is happy, but there is something you cannot do and cannot say: "the present is very well, so I will not get sick, I will not die." We should know that to practice Buddhism, most importantly is to liberate from birth and death, seek liberation, open our wisdom, walk the Bodhisattva way, that is why we still have to practice Buddhism, learn (to be like a) Bodhisattva. Though your life is well, but you are now in the human realm, if you want it to be better, you can seek rebirth in heaven, for that you have to practice the 10 virtuous deeds and avoid doing any evil deeds. But to be further, though ascending to the heavens is better, it is not ultimate, for when your celestial blessings have finished, you will still fall, so how? We have to seek liberation, walk the Bodhisattva way, until attaining Buddhahood -- that is the best and most ultimate, that is why all worldly beings must practice Buddhism.</div>

All day long they stayed right beside one<br>another, they were so compatible. In fact, to distinguish him from<br>Ananda. Sundarananda was given the name SundariÂ’s Nanada Â–<br>Sundarananda.<br><br>The day came when the Buddha went to cross Sundarananda<br>over. He took up his bowl and went to SundaranandaÂ’s home to beg<br>for food. When Sundarananda saw the Buddha coming, he<br>withdrew from his wife and said, Â“Wait a bit, I am going to make<br>offerings to the Buddha.Â”<br><br>His wife said, Â“You are going to make offerings to the Buddha?<br>Come back immediately. DonÂ’t go and then not come back.Â” Â“Of<br>course, IÂ’ll come right back,Â” Sundarananda said.<br>Sundari then spit on the dirt floor and said, Â“YouÂ’d better be<br>back before that dries, or I wonÂ’t let you in my bed.Â”<br><br>Sundarananda heeded the command and said, Â“IÂ’ll be back right<br>away, for sure.Â” And he took vegetables and rice to fill the<br>BuddhaÂ’s bowl.<br><br>He went to fill the bowl, but how was he to know that the<br>Buddha would act so strangely? The Buddha used his spiritual<br>power. Every time Sundarananda took a step forward to place the<br>food in the BuddhaÂ’s bowl, the Buddha backed up, so that<br>Sundarananda couldnÂ’t reach the bowl. Sundarananda kept<br>advancing to keep up with the Buddha, and in just a few steps they<br>arrived at the Jeta Grove, despite the fact that it was a long way<br>from SundaranandaÂ’s house. Once they got there, Shakyamuni<br>Buddha said, Â“DonÂ’t go back. You stay here with me and leave the<br>home-life.Â”<br><br>Sundarananda was shocked; he got goose-flesh. Â“Impossible,Â”<br>he said emphatically. Â“I canÂ’t stay. Sundari is waiting for me. I canÂ’t<br>remain here and leave home.Â”<br><br>The Buddha said, Â“You canÂ’t leave home? Let me show you<br>some things and see what you think.Â” He took Sundarananda to a<br>place where there were hordes of monkeys. Â“Which is more<br>beautiful,Â” the Buddha asked him, Â“these monkeys or your wife<br>Sundari?Â”<br><br>Â“Obviously Sundari is more beautiful,Â” replied Sundarananda.<br>Â“How could Sundari be compared to a monkey?Â”<br><br>Â“Quite right,Â” the Buddha agreed, and took him to the heavens.<br>As they strolled among they noticed one particular palace was<br>bustling with activity as servants scrubbed and polished. There<br>were also 500 heavenly maidens in that palace, each one exquisite<br>beyond compare.<br><br>Â“Why are you doing all this cleaning?Â” Sundaranda asked one<br>of the servants.<br><br>Â“WeÂ’re getting this palace ready for the BuddhaÂ’s cousin<br>Sundarananda,Â” they replied. Â“After he cultivates heÂ’ll come to<br>heaven to enjoy his blessings. These 500 heavenly maidens will be<br>his wives.Â”<br><br>Sundarananda was ecstatic.<br><br>Â“Tell me, Nanada,Â” the Buddha said to him, Â“which would you<br>say is more beautiful, Sundari or these heavenly maidens?Â”<br>Â“These maidens, obviously,Â” Sundarananda replied. Â“Why,<br>compared to these maidens, Sundari is as ugly as a monkey.Â”<br><br>Â“Fine,Â” said the Buddha, Â“this place is being readied for you.Â”<br><br>After they finished touring the place the Buddha took his cousin<br>down to the hells. There they saw two ghosts heating a cauldron of<br>oil. One of the ghosts was sound asleep and although the other one<br>was awake, he didnÂ’t have his eyes open. Nanda sized up the<br>situation and thought to himself, Â“these ghosts are suppose to be<br>tending the fire under that cauldron, but theyÂ’re not doing their job<br>at all. Boy, are ghosts lazy!Â” Then he meddled a bit and nudged one,<br>saying, Â“What are you doing this for?Â”<br><br>The little oneÂ’s droopy eyes popped open and glared at him.<br>Â“WhatÂ’s it to you?Â” he snapped.<br><br>Â“I just wondered,Â” said Sundarananda.<br><br>Â“You gotta know, huh? Okay, IÂ’ll tell you. The BuddhaÂ’s got a<br>cousin whoÂ’s cultivating the blessings of people and gods. HeÂ’s<br>going to get born in the heavens and enjoy 500 years of heavenly<br>blessings before he falls. Once he topples, however, heÂ’ll come all<br>the way down to hell and when he gets here, weÂ’re supposed to<br>have this pot hot. HeÂ’s to be deep-fried alive.Â”<br><br>Sundarananda was horrified and his hair stood on end. He<br>suddenly understood the whole picture and thought, Â“Those<br>heavenly maidens are ravishing, but 500 years of bliss with them<br>isnÂ’t worth it if IÂ’m eventually going to end up in a pot of boiling<br>oil. IÂ’d better follow the Buddha, leave home, and be a monk.Â” So<br>he forget about Sundari and left home.<br><br>In order to rescue Sundarananda, the Buddha had to accompany<br>him to the heavens and the hells...</span><br><br>~ The Shurangama Sutra, commentary by Ven Hsuan Hua<br><br>Sundarananda later attained the goal of Arhatship, liberation, Nirvana.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Buddha said to Ananda</strong>, Â“Ananda, donÂ’t be nervous.<br>Ananda, donÂ’t be upset.

The mind that investigates is not your<br>self nature; it is not your true mind. It is merely a more subtle form<br>of false thinking which makes distinctions.
