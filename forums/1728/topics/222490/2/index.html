Such indulgence diminish our original blissful nature, increase craving and dependency, and can lead to further bad consequences for oneself - disease, death, and for drinking, can make you do things you wouldn't want to be doing when you are sober, and even lead to accidents, family problems, death. These consequences are far reaching, a person with wisdom should look deeply into the matter.<br><br>Especially in Buddhism, such consequences may carry on to further lifetimes. For example pornography seems innocent in the sense that "it's my business, I won't rape others". But such seeds of lust and images are planted in the 8th consciousness, making our mind impure, and in future lifetimes may ripen and we may commit worse kinds of adulteries. So instead of clearing our fetters, we strengthen our fetter of sensual craving.. as a pracittioner we would not act in this way. In Buddhism we should clear all these things, these cravings are rooted in ignorance. If we are sincere practitioners and want to uncover our fundamental ignorance and live in the blissfulness of dharma, we would get rid of such defilements. Furthermore we seek to uncover our ignorance, uproot them, and discover our primordial bright nature which is blissful, eternal, and pure.<br><br>So these things are not really just a matter of whether "sin" or "evil"... the choice ultimately is ours, free from condemn even if you made the choice of smoking. The advice is out of total good will and well wishing intention, Buddha accepts us even if we made and continue to make choices that are not in accordance with the Buddha's teachings.</div>

We have not given up our attachment to worldly things.. not like monks and nuns. Thus it is very normal.<br><br>AEN has given u some very good info.. it is really up to u to decide what u want to incorporate into your life. Anyway, he did said that some highly-realised masters haven't give up smoking yet. When they have reached the non-returner stage, will one have given up all the sensual craving and this require alot of cultivation, practise and realization.<br><br>I think by then they will not  reborn back into the human realm already.<br>AEN-&gt; correct me if im wrong.<br><br>You can have a balance between reality and buddhist teachings.

Those who knows the dharma knows that indulgence is only temporary means of getting away from pain to pleasure, away from the mind, but it is not the ultimate solution, which is dharma. Buddhism, buddhadharma, is the culture of bliss (a quote by my master). A person who is truly enlightened is completely liberated and living in the highest bliss of nirvana: he is not caught in the dualism of samsara - the cycles of pleasure and pain, good emotions and bad emotions.<br><br><blockquote>...Humans have been in the grip of pain for eons, ever since they fell from the state of grace, entered the realm of time and mind, and lost awareness of Being. At that point, they started to perceive themselves as meaningless fragments in an alien universe, unconnected to the Source and to each other.<br><br>Pain is inevitable as long as you are identified with your mind, which is to say as long as you are unconscious, spiritually speaking. I am talking here primarily of emotional pain, which is also the main cause of physical pain and physical disease. Resentment, hatred, self-pity, guilt, anger, depression, jealousy, and so on, even the slightest irritation, are all forms of pain. And every pleasure or emotional high contains within itself the seed of pain: its inseparable opposite, which will manifest in time.<br><br>Anybody who has ever taken drugs to get "high" will know that the high eventually turns into a low, that the pleasure turns into some form of pain. Many people also know from their own experience how easily and quickly an intimate relationship can turn from a source of pleasure to a source of pain. Seen from a higher perspective, both the negative and the positive polarities are faces of the same coin, are both part of the underlying pain that is inseparable from the mind-identified egoic state of consciousness. ~ Eckhart Tolle</blockquote>Having sex won't shorten your lifespan or other people's life span though... unless you have casual sex with others, then of course, you risk STDs. As a Buddhist, there are 5 precepts, one of them is refrain from sexual misconduct, means, keep to your faithful partner, no adulteries. No intoxicants (i.e wine, intoxicating drugs, etc) are also one of the precepts, so Buddhists should try not to use alcohol for the purpose of intoxication/indulgence unless is really unavoidable purpose. Intoxicants not only causes one to do things one would not want to do, like crimes, and cause diseases, social/family problems, they can diminish one's samadhi and wisdom. It distrupts one's mental clarity. If you practise the dharma, at some point, you will naturally want to avoid such intoxicants or keep them to minimum. My dharma teacher drank by accident, mistaking ginseng wine for non-alcoholic drink, and my master tested alcohol only in small amount and realised one's wisdom (not just intelligence) is greatly impeded. See: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=162852" rel="nofollow">The Harm of Alcohol &amp; Intoxication</a><br><br>So what are the 5 precepts? No killing, no stealing, no false speech (lying etc..), no sexual misconduct, no intoxicants (wine, drugs, etc). As a Buddhist I do not feel forced at all to comply with these rules, like I mentioned earlier these are sincere advises and are not Buddha's commandments. "Commandment" is a strange and foreign word to a non-theist.<br><br><blockquote><a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no1d.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol4no1d.htm</a><br><br><strong>2. Precepts are the basis of safeguarding blessings</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">When we are ignorant we lament over observing the Five Precepts. But, if we cannot abstain from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct and being intoxicated, then we would have problems as human beings. Observing the precepts actually takes on a more advanced meaning in that it safeguards our blessings; breaking them means depleting our blessings. It is a simple rule of cause and effect.</span><br><br>SOME PEOPLE are afraid of taking refuge in the Three Treasures because they are afraid of having to observe the precepts. These people should be encouraged to take refuge first, and we then gradually inspire them to observe the precepts.<br><br>Jen Chen Buddhism advocates that everyone observes the Five Precepts (abstention from killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct and consumption of intoxicants). When we are encouraging others to take refuge and meet with those who rebut that because their work requires them to entertain and therefore they cannot observe the precept of not consuming alcoholic drinks, then it is permissible that he observes the other four precepts. It does not matter even if he observes just one precept. Even if one just take refuge without observing the precepts, it does not matter too. Having taken refuge to become a Buddhist, and with gradual guidance, there will come a day when he understands the importance of observing the precepts.<br><br>We promote Jen Chen Buddhism and encourage the masses to observe the precepts. However, at times we do not use the term "observe the precepts", instead we call it "means of safeguarding blessings". Everyone has his own blessings and although they differ in degree and nature, nobody likes their blessings to be reduced. The best way to safeguard blessings is to observe the precepts. Jen Chen Buddhism advocates that everyone observe the Five Precepts. If the Five Precepts are not observed, then one will commit wrong deeds that can then reduce oneÂ’s blessings.<br><br>LetÂ’s use a teacup as an example. If you put the teacup at the edge of the table, it has a higher probability of falling and shattering. If the teacup is placed in the middle of the table, then it is safe. Placing the teacup at the edge of the table is like we are at the brink of breaking the precepts; shattering the teacup is like destroying our blessings. Putting the teacup at the centre of the table is like observing the precepts. And, when the teacup is not broken, then it is like our blessings are assured. Innocent children, often put teacups along the edge of the table. Thus, adults will always teach them to put them at the centre. In the same way, the innumerable sentient beings are ignorant of the terror of cause and effect. They are always at the fringe of danger - by not observing the precepts, and committing various evil karma such as killing, theft, sexual misconduct and lying. That is why the compassionate Buddha and Bodhisattvas teach sentient beings to observe the precepts and enable them to distance from the danger and to safeguard their own blessings. Therefore, to safeguard our own bliss and at the same time not disturb others bliss, we need to cultivate the way of safeguarding our blessings.</blockquote></div>
