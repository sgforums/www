The smoke affect others to various extent no matter how careful you are to avoid smoking near them.<br><br>And also affecting yourself also not so responsible la... ur body is given by your parents, dont destroy it and die a terrible death. You know.. suicide also have bad karma. Doesn't mean if I don't affect others I won't have bad karma. And anyway if you die you will affect your family also.. so... think deeper.<br><br>Also.. Buddhists believe in rebirth, and our habits deep latent in our consciousness will be brought forward to future lifetimes. So not only will you shorten your current life you might shorten your future lifetimes (by smoking again) It is better to clear whatever habits we have in this lifetime.<br><br>But that's still not the crux of the matter. Smoking involves deep craving, and in Buddhism, craving is dukkha. This form of addiction, craving, is what Buddhists want to get rid off through practise. So even if you smoke now... eventually you will have to learn to let go of such addictions, and in fact, all addictions. There are some teachers who are highly enlightened.. highly realised and haven't really stopped smoking, but eventually one has to learn to let go of them, because it's really a fetter. So in terms of stages of enlightenment, the Arhat path (stream enterer, once returner, non-returner, arhat), by the time one reaches the 'Once-returner' (still a bit left) or 'Non-returner' stage he would have cleared all sensual cravings. That is even before one reaches the stage of Arhat. That is... one experiences the highest bliss of Nirvana at all times and has no fetters remaining. Also as we said.. as Buddha said.. buddhism can be summarise as, "do good, avoid evil, purify the mind". Purify the mind is the most important part, we must cleanse it, eliminate until nothingness, not a single bit of defilements, habitual energy, ignorance is left.</div>

Cigarettes, opium and such things pollute the chakras and the wind, which is the vehicle of the mind, and thus cause many disturbing thoughts to arise. Smoking causes anger and attachment to arise very easily; it damages the mind, making it very dissatisfied and impatient. Smoking makes it very difficult to develop your mind, and it especially interferes with the practice of tantra.<br><br>Cigarette smoke enters the mouths and noses of surrounding peopleÂ—even those who do not smokeÂ—when they breathe in, then causes harm to their bodies and minds. Even though the person smoking may be a long way away from me, in another room, the smoke comes through the windows and goes into my lungs. I feel a pain in my heart.<br><br>When there is a lot of smoke, the mind becomes unclear and very, very sleepy. This proves that cigarette smoke pollutes the body and the mind. This is talking only about the problems you experience in this lifeÂ—not in the life after this. As explained in the sutra teachings, what you will experience in the life after this will be much heavier.<br><br>You may spend a lot of money every day on cigarettes, alcohol or other drugs. If you are a Buddhist, besides giving this money to others, you could accumulate much good karma by offering it to the Triple Gem. You use all that money, which comes from your parents or other people, on alcoholÂ—for just one or two minutes of pleasure. You could give all that money to charity. There are many people dying of starvation in the world. In Africa and many other places, there are famines. There are a lot of poor people and people in homes for the aged and hospices who need help. In the East there are Tibetan refugee camps. With all that money you could benefit hundreds of thousands of living beings. There is so much you could do with it. If you do not use the money in this way, but use it only for your own happiness, you are actually destroying your own life. Not only are you destroying yourself, but you are preventing yourself from benefiting all living beings. This is very important. Choose which you want to do: Do you want to benefit others? Or do you want to destroy yourself?</span><br><br>-- Lama Zopa Rinpoche</div>
