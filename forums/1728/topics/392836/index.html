              <p>it seems that sila(morality) isn't of such importance in the path.</p>
              <p>imagine this,one landed on a isolated island(there are dramas 'bout this,but in this senario,one is alone),feeding on plants alone,not eating meat.</p>
              <p>what's the place of virtue then,in such situation?morality arises out of social(including animals,leave aside the more extreme view that 'plants feel pain') connection,and therefore,my conclusion is that for the average,"non-extreme"(killers,rapers etc) person,it's more fruitful to go directly to meditative practices and quickly attain enlightenment,then morality becomes "perfect",for whatever action the person takes,it will be without a self,and therefore,cannot be selfish,therefore harmful/detrimental(towards others).</p>

              <p>I agree with what you said. It's not that morality can be ignored, since prior to insights we have to follow precepts etc to prevent further suffering/karma/bad rebirths.</p>
              <p>But after the arising of insight, morality becomes more natural (rather than as a set of rules to follow) as actions, speech, thoughts, behaviors spring spontaneously from a deeper source of wisdom untainted by dualistic grasping/desires or a sense of self.</p>
              <p>As long as we truly observe and experience reality as it is, unwholesome actions cannot arise. It is because we do not know reality that unwholesome actions spring from greed, hatred, ignorance (i.e. dualistic attraction, aversion, ignorance)</p>

              <p>Just my personal opinion; when one's outlook is filled with loving kindness and compassion, morality towards other beings naturally flows.  We do not live in a void. Everything is contextual. </p>
              <p>Milarepa, when offered cloths by his sister for clothing, cut them into sheaths covering only his extremities because that's where the coldness is felt where he lived in the caves as a hermit. He did not deemed it immoral as compared to what others had done in outside society.</p>
              <p>Terms of morality varies, I remembered having read somewhere, there was an incident in Britain about a family of highwaymen who fed on their victims. Their children were brought up from young as cannibals knowing no different. However, when they finally caught, the children were hanged just the same.  </p>

And it is only such a mind that can come upon this extraordinary immensity which is not your own invention, nor that of some philosopher or guru.<br></span></em></p>

              <p>Just my personal opinion; when one's outlook is filled with loving kindness and compassion, morality towards other beings naturally flows.  We do not live in a void. Everything is contextual. </p>
              <p>Milarepa, when offered cloths by his sister for clothing, cut them into sheaths covering only his extremities because that's where the coldness is felt where he lived in the caves as a hermit. He did not deemed it immoral as compared to what others had done in outside society.</p>
              <p>Terms of morality varies, I remembered having read somewhere, there was an incident in Britain about a family of highwaymen who fed on their victims. Their children were brought up from young as cannibals knowing no different. However, when they finally caught, the children were hanged just the same.  </p>

              <p><br>I agree with you that if and when one's outlook is truly filled with loving kindness and compassion, morality would become something as natural as breathing.</p>
              <p>What would happen to these children if they have been caught in modern times? I can't help but think it may not necessarily end up being any different...</p>
              <p>Can our modern society truly accept cannibalism? Are we so sure we can wean these children off a lifestyle of cannibalism; years of eating raw human flesh since they were born? How many of us are able to go vegan or vegetarian completely and permanently even when we feel like trying? How long did it take for some of us to achieve that?</p>

              <p>This one I have to disagree. Without pure sila, it is difficult to have pure samadhi.</p>
              <p>In Mahayana Buddhism, we are supposed to grow our bodhicitta and use various methods to reduce our constant clinging to worldly desire. For majority of people including myself, one of the most effective ways is still by taking precepts.</p>

              <p>some sharing based on personal observation</p>
              <p>the noble eightfold path can be understood and applied on seemingly two platforms.</p>
              <p>first is on the conditional platform which involves our daily life, activities, actions, intentions, aspirations and all of these stuff. it is conditional based on the environment, our preferences, interpretations, and is guided by explicit rules. the understanding is largely conceptual and practicing requires much effort in most cases. logical reasoning and personal beliefs come into play when integrating the teachings to our life at this platform. of cos the actual practice is dualistic in nature with a tinge of 'i am practicing morality to be a good person, i should be a faithful person to be moral, i should not be doing this' etc.</p>
              <p>second is on the reflective platform and is not so much involved in the content of the path but in the process of taking notice. although much of this is also tied to the everyday happenings around us, the way the practicing of the path has a different 'feel' to it. everything happens at the 'awareness' level, initially with the mind observing all the thoughts and intentions ( subject/object ), gradually as one gets used to this the entire experience is seen as a sequence or process of thoughts. the eightfold path becomes a sort of a mish mash operating under the directive of mindfulness (something like right mindfulness is the operating system while the rest are the important softwares that runs together or at the background or waiting to be installed).</p>
              <p>to quote Ajahn Sumedho in his writing The Eightfold Path as a Reflective Teaching taken from <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm">http://www.buddhanet.net/4noble.htm</a></p>
              <p>an excerpt:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>In this Eightfold Path, the eight elements work like eight legs supporting you. It is not like: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 on a linear scale; it is more of a working together. It is not that you develop panna first and then when you have panna, you can develop your sila; and once your sila is developed, then you will have samadhi. That is how we think, isn’t it: ‘You have to have one, then two and then three.’ As an actual realisation, developing the Eightfold Path is an experience in a moment, it is all one. All the parts are working as one strong development; it is not a linear process - we might think that way because we can only have one thought at a time.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><em>Everything I have said about the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths is only a reflection. What is really important is for you to realise what I am actually doing as I reflect rather than to grasp the things that I am saying. It is a process of bringing the Eightfold Path into your mind, using it as a reflective teaching so that you can consider what it really means. Don’t just think you know it because you can say, ‘Samma ditthi means Right Understanding and Samma sankappa means Right Thought.’ This is intellectual understanding. Someone might say, ‘No, I think samma sankappa means....’ And you answer, ‘No, in the book it says Right Thought. You’ve got it wrong.’ This is not reflection.</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when im pondering on the question posed in this thread, the direction pointed to is that of the conditional platform whereby morality is a condition that can/cannot be ignored. sensing deeper, the entire eightfold path is an 'internal' process happening automatically and most obvious with the practice of mindfulness. As Jon Kabat Zinn wrote in his book &lt; Coming to our Senses&gt; with 'mindfulness everything else will come along'.</p>

              <p>i don't think morality can be ignored.  We tend to associate morality with a set of laws to follow. In Buddhism, morality (sila) is simply doing the things that help others and oneself and avoiding the things that harm others and oneself.  I think we tend to try to do that quite automatically right? </p>
              <p>The only difference is that Buddha with his far-ranging wisdom can see that certain actions, for instance, sexual misconduct or divisive speech is not good in the long run and so he 'advises' us to avoid such things.  We, as just people with limited understanding, can't see far into the consequences of actions so due to our faith in Buddha's wisdom, we try to follow his guidance.</p>
              <p>For one to progress on the path, it has always been advised to proceed first with a good moral basis then build up concentration, then wisdom can arise.</p>
              <p>The reason is simple. Without moral basis, we face the repercussions of karma which can obstruct our peace of mind.  No peace of mind, can you meditate well?   If our choices of actions creates harm for others, then it follows logically that we will be harmed, constantly under anxiety , fear and hope.  Then when your world is constantly under threat, can u meditate well?</p>
              <p>That is why "Do unto others what you wish for yourself"  always works.</p>
              <p>Also, if you do not care for others, or care about what impact your actions has on others and try to minimise harm to others, then can you honestly say that your practice is about benefitting others? </p>
              <p>If you say that your practice is only about yourself attaining realisation, then look at the emphasis of the Thai traditions and other Hinayana traditions, how they place great emphasis on morality in order to simplify their lives and concentrate wholeheartedly on practice.</p>
              <p>Even worldly people cannot survive without ethics, not to say spiritual people. We are not a lone island. We need to respect ourselves and others. </p>

              <p>Law, rules, precepts has to be enforced if one does not have mindfulness and wisdom and self control, like Jit Kiat say - think of Tiger Woods and Jack Neo. Basically, we have to follow the precepts. But we should practice and develope mindfulness and wisdom to the point where morality becomes natural and spontaneous as a result of continuous awareness, and rules become arbitrary.</p>
