            <div class='col-md body'>Hi cool,<br><br>Compassion should come with wisdom.<br><br>If you allow others to take advantage of you, this is like giving them opportunities to do bad karma. For their own good, pls stop this.<br><br>Second, even if it is good to do other people's work (depends on what work), make sure it won't make your life miserable. Otherwise, it will create a conflict between compassion and happiness in your mind. Gradually and subconciously, you will begin to think that compassion is against happiness. So, to maintain your compassion over long period, pls take note of this.<br><br>But since you already made a precedent of doing their work, if you suddendly stop doing so, they will make a lot of noise, be prepared how to deal with it.<br><br>If you still encounter any problem, feel free to share with us here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the Buddhist approach to life the value of work is deeply embedded. The Buddha taught that <strong>actions bring results</strong>, <strong>whether for good or ill</strong>. He also taught that nothing just happens by itself - all things are conditioned and each thing as a cause. To work hard and conscientiously has beneficial consequences, whether this is working on spiritual practices or cleaning the streets. Idleness, lethargy, dissolute behavior are decried by the Buddha as unwholesome.<br><br>Agan and again, the Buddha urges us to act - to meditate, to do good deeds, to build good relationships with others. Indeed, it is notable that the Buddha's last words were <strong><span class="large">'strive on with diligence!'.</span></strong><br><br><img src="http://ai.pricegrabber.com/muze_images/books/0/08/1569753008_150x150.jpg"><br><br>the book oso available at the Libraries  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Hi coolbluewater,<br><br>Going through all these problems is actually a great way to learn and an opportunity for cultivation.<br><br>From what i see, you are playing matyr here and being softhearted  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It is important to learn to be assertive once in awhile.<br>Practise the middle-way.<br><br>I don't know if this is what you are thinking. If you are thinking that practising compassionate in helping others or by giving...well, i think it is important to practise compassionate with wisdom too. You are encouraging others to be lazy.<br><br>unless you have made a vow as a pusa in the past and has been cultivating for aeons.. you will not be affected emotionally and mentally.. In other words, it is definitely take some time and efforts to cultivate to there level. So till now, if you still feeling abit unease with your action, i suggest to take small steps.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I decided to add on this thread to maybe mention something that I've observed so far from the few organisations that I'm affiliated with.<br><br>I realised that politics does exists in these organisations, where the committess basically wanted the policies to benefit themselves rather than the organisation.  One instances that I came across was that this committee decided to that all activities organised by the volunteers must obtain the approval of the committees, despite the venerables's have agreed to go ahead, and when it comes to big events such as venerables visited Singapore, the committees are always absent, citing busy work schedules etc.<br><br>Another example is another committee even set high entry level for the volunteers, citing that they must be of certain tradition etc, despite knowing the volunteers number are dwindling fast.<br><br>From these few examples, I noticed that sometimes, people join the management committee of a religious organisation, or any voluntary organisations because they want to gain control and ensure the events work towards their advantage.<br><br>Citing the incidence that I've encountered in the two different committees, I have nothing but disappointments, but I stayed on because I do have friends inside who kinda "suffered" under the hands of these committee unknowingly.<br><br>This makes me ponder on the qualities of these so call committee members who preaches dharma, but doesn't seems to be practicing it.   Of course, I have met good committee members who are dedicated to serve for unconditionally for the work of dharma propagation.  However this will have a long term adverse impact on the progress of Buddhism in this society.  Pretty much disappointed, but luckily my advising venerable is constantly encouraging me, and teaching me on different ways to handle it.  If not, I'll probably ended up in IMH sooner that I expect.</div>
