It was obvious he trying to pass himself off as a Buddhist monk. Except he wasn't but just an impostor soliciting donations from an unsuspecting public.<br><br>He whipped out a card with the image of the Goddess of Mercy and a rope knot, reciting some 'auspicious' words. He explained in a strong Chinese accent that he was helping to raise funds for his temple.<br><br>When asked which temple he was from, he replied that he was from 'Fo Guang Shan' and that he lived in Waterloo Street. First, Fo Guang Shan is in Paya Lebar and second, this temple has only nuns. When I subsequently called Fo Guang Shan to check, they confirmed they have no visiting monks nor do they have anyone conducting door-to-door donation solicitation.<br><br>I offered to take a picture of him with my cellphone which made him most uncomfortable. I then told him that soliciting funds in this manner is not legal in Singapore and such conduct gives Buddhism a bad name and he should not continue to do so. He thanked me and quickly walked away.<br><br>It is important for the public to be aware that Buddhist organisations do not send their monks or nuns to solicit funds in the public. Therefore, anyone wishing to offer support should place their donation in a temple box or mail a cheque payable to a Buddhist organisation.<br><br>Alms bowls used by monks or nuns are meant only to accept food and medicine offered to them. Food offerings are to be made only in the morning before midday. Monks in brown or saffron robes (of the Theravadan tradition) are not allowed to eat any food after midday.<br><br>In fact, forest tradition monks and nuns adhere strictly to the Monastic Code of Discipline ('Vinaya') laid down by the Buddha, to the extent that they do not handle cash at all.<br><br>The Buddhist Fellowship urges the public not to give money to these bogus monks and nuns so as not to perpetuate the problem.<br><br>Angie Chew Monksfield (Mrs)<br><br>President<br><br>Buddhist Fellowship, Singapore</div>
