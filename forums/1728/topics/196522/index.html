            <div class='col-md body'>Monks should have cert to prove to he is a certified monk, not simply by what he's wearing. But the public cant rely on this to tell, cos most of us dont know if the certificate is real or fake.<br><br>The most obvious point and the thread starter also mentioned, the bowl <span style="color: blue;">"were meant to be containers for food and not money"</span>, if he's accepting money, he is conning money from public.<br><br>And in Singapore, the law does not allow us to accept money from public by begging or performing. Unless you are licensed to do so, like the blind man in Yishun MRT underpass that i always see(used to), he has a licence and he put in right there.</div>
