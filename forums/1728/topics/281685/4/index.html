It is directly related to conditioned arising and dependent origination. I also wrote previously about Chaos Theory:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyway Chaos Theory is really good. It really corresponds with Buddhism's interdependent co-arising teaching of Emptiness. Regarding this see recent thread, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=214669" rel="nofollow">Net of Indra IS Dependent Origination?</a><br><br>Thusness says, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaos theory breaks determinism, breaks boundary, yet does not deny order... a higher order that is too complex to be determined. Initial cause does not result into a predetermined action.  From a spiritual perspective,<br>the rigidity of Â‘IÂ’ as a fixed pattern order must be broken down for life to be experienced in its full dynamics as wondrous manifestation.</span></div></blockquote></div>
