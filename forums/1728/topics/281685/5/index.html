            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Herzog_Zwei:</div><div class="quote_body">It confirms the order there is by having no order.</div></blockquote>When I talk about conditioned arising or dependent origination, it doesn't have to be a perceivable order. And furthermore conditioned arising works non-locally as well, for example <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=178391" rel="nofollow">the Aspect's experiment that proves that subatomic particles can communicate with each other instantaneously regardless of distance, whether 10 metres or 10 billion miles away</a>.<br><br>An excerpt from the <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=262408" rel="nofollow">transcript of Informal discussions of Lankavatara Sutra by Thusness on Skype</a>:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">...Because, you see, in Buddhism when we talk about Non-Duality, we are saying something like the Dependent Origination. Because of This, That Is. This arises, That arises. This ceases, That ceases. We look at the entire formation, there is no Â“Who?Â” Where is the Â“Who?Â” When we ask Â“Where?Â”, there is no Â“Where?Â”. When we ask Â“When?Â”, there is no Â“When?Â” It can be 10 million miles away. It can be in another planet. The teaching is consistent. It does not require a Â“WhoÂ”, a Â“WhereÂ”, a Â“WhenÂ”. Condition arises, it is there. It is not stored in any place, or anywhere. This is the teaching...<br><br>...When I say that things happen, it is not like those people that subscribe to think that anything is just taking by itself, itÂ’s nature. Mainly what is important is conditions. You must have the conditions, then things can surface. When the conditions is there, they just surfaces, and manifest. If there is cause in ten million miles away or ten million light years away, or whatever it is, or in other realms, as long as there is conditions, it WILL surface, it is not travelling {inaudible}. Can you understand this part? Condition is there, they just manifest. This is one thing...<br><br>...That is there is no I, there is no Where, and there is no When. This is very important. Do not hold anything at all, then you can experience it. <strong>You see, when we talk about cause and effect, the philosopherÂ’s cause and effect is different from what the Buddha taught.</strong> Cause and effect always involve an entity taking place at a certain date some time later... means, there is an entity, or a first cause, or something, taking a process. Means there is changing Â‘thingsÂ’ going through a process and after certain time interval, takes place. This seeing things as entities. Now, to experience Reality you must not see things this way...</span><br><br>BTW, though karma has an order, it is too complex to ponder for an ordinary being like us, therefore being one of the 4 imponderables (for ordinary ppl). Karma is also not a predeterministic system -- conditioned arising/dependent origination is not a predeterministic teaching --<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">Anyway Chaos Theory is really good. It really corresponds with Buddhism's interdependent co-arising teaching of Emptiness. Regarding this see recent thread, <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=214669" rel="nofollow">Net of Indra IS Dependent Origination?</a><br><br>Thusness says, <span style="font-style: italic;">Chaos theory breaks determinism, breaks boundary, yet does not deny order... a higher order that is too complex to be determined. Initial cause does not result into a predetermined action.  From a spiritual perspective,<br>the rigidity of Â‘IÂ’ as a fixed pattern order must be broken down for life to be experienced in its full dynamics as wondrous manifestation.</span></div></blockquote></div>
