When a person lost his mind, such unsatisfactory would still have happened. The main reason for Dukha to have exist is the very underlying principal of impermanance. And that the average Joe like you and I cannot live to accept the changes that occurring fast and unknowingly to us.<br><br>So I'm not quite sure when you said 'his suffering cannot be relieved', when in the first place if anyone would have expressed some kind of uncomfortable to a change of state that he/she is going through, that would be Dukha taking place already.
