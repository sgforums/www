              has start to creep into the Buddhist faith, no least from a lay person against
              a religious leader of the faith. One starts to wonder, how such individual as </span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;">Padma Choling</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 1.231;"> has become more
              knowledgeable and authoritative then the Dalai Lama himself on such an issue.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The Office of the Dalai Lama was start by Gedun Drub,
              the 1<sup>st</sup> Dalai Lama to promote the smooth transition of spiritual
              leaders from one generation to the next. This is a tradition of the Gelugpa
              sect although the belief in reincarnation is followed in all Tibetan Buddhism. It </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">is the prerogative of the Office of the
              Dalai Lama</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> to decide whether there is a
              need to </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">follow strict historical conventions and
              required religious rituals in such selection, and certainly not that of the
              Chinese government.</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;"> The present Dalai Lama
              should know that pretty well for himself. After all, he is the one who will be
              deciding where he wishes to be reborn. He certainly does not need to seek the
              approval of the Chinese government on when to die and where/when he will be
              reincarnated.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">Has Padma Choling and the Chinese government
              forgotten, that Tibetan Buddhism is now practice not just by the Tibetan people
              alone but by people of many races throughout the world? That the Dalai Lama is
              not a piece of property of the Communist China, but a religious leader to many
              others not connect with Tibet or Tibetans?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">It would be more palatable if the Chinese government
              would come out in all honesty that they need the next Dalai Lama to be born in
              Tibet, i.e. a Chinese citizen so that they can make use of him as a mouth piece
              to control the Tibetan population and fulfill their agenda in Tibet in as
              smooth and as fast a way as possible.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">The present deadlock that we see between the Dalai
              Lama and Chinese government is not doing the religion any good. One can see
              that whatever the Dalai Lama says, whether he is going to be the last Dalai
              Lama, or he is going to be born out of the China, the Chinese government will
              ultimately and eventually select their own Dalai Lama  irregardless of whether the Tibetan people
              accept such appointment or not. The likelihood is that, the majority would not
              care or respect such an appointee. A situation of this nature would erode the
              importance of Buddhism to the Tibetan people. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;">It may be best that the Dalai Lama give his now ‘famous
              smile’ to the Chinese government and said ‘I will reincarnate myself in Tibet’
              and be done with the whole reincarnation system. After all, in the present
              modern context, the system does not serve any more useful purpose. If the whole
              issue continues to drag, the eventual ultimate loser will be Buddhism itself. It
              will then be a sad day indeed.</span></p>

              <p>Let the tibetan people living in China have a vote on whether or not the reincarnation system should be continued or not. I don't think the Dalai lama can decide on this issue alone. If he says that there will be no more Dalai lamas after his death, it might split the population of Tibet. Some may accept the decision of the current Dalai lama, others may not and insist that there must be a spiritual leader for tibetans.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">Yes, ideally it
                  would be good for the Tibetan Buddhists peoples to decide for themselves on
                  this issue. But such a situation will never happen there, it is a communist
                  controlled country. If such a situation can happen, the country would be a
                  multi-parties political system elected by the people by now.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">The government had
                  passed laws that require the next Dalai Lama to be a Tibetan born in China. His
                  appointment and that of all other reincarnated high Lamas will need to be
                  approved by them as well. It is to counter such laws that the Dalai Lama had
                  made other suggestion such as the possibility of him being reincarnated outside
                  of China, away from the control of the Chinese authorities. His latest
                  suggestion of not getting reincarnated is also because of the same reason. The
                  Chinese are worry, as what is spoken by him would carry considerable weight and
                  authority to the Tibetans in China. The Chinese know it, and that is why they are
                  trying to neutralized what he said by stating that it is a blasphemous act on
                  the part of the Dalai Lama. Whatever the situation is or will developed into
                  later ultimately the Chinese government will get their way and appoint a Dalai
                  Lama when he passed away. The Dalai Lama latest statement is that, he is going
                  to live to the reap old age of 100. He is 80 this year.</p>
              <p><span style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.231;">In any case, it does
                  not matter to the Chinese, no do they care if their appointing of a new Dalai
                  Lama would lead to the eventually spit in the Buddhist followers there into two
                  opposing camps. It suits them fine as well, as it would weaken the Tibetans’
                  unity, thus making it easier to control them.</span></p>
