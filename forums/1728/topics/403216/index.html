              <p>Hi, just a sharing from a book 'The Light Behind Consciousness' by John Wheeler.</p>
              <p>I'm also interested to hear comments from Thusness and Longchen on these articles. And what is the defining characteristic/difference between the experience of 'Consciousness/Impersonal Witness/I Am' and the 'Absolute/Awareness/Awareness-Unaware-Of-Itself' that John Wheeler (and Nisargadatta Maharaj whom John traces his lineage from) talked about? All I 'know' is that I am undeniably present and aware and this presence-awareness is ever-present, whether it is called Consciousness, or Awareness or I Am, I can't see the difference.</p>
              <p>update: on hindsight, during deep sleep it does seem that any types of consciousness has faded into oblivion... sometimes when I woke up I wonder 'where has my consciousness gone to while I slept' even though presence-awareness can never be lost since it is ever-present... so this is the 'awareness unaware of itself' since it does not have any objects to reflect it's presence? Hence, consciousness does indeed come and go on the screen of awareness. Presence-Awareness cannot say it is present (become self-conscious) or create a sense of being or self without reflecting upon itself via the body-mind instrument/object, and being so is prior to consciousness... and is utterly incomprehensible (since comprehension = consciousness)... we can only dissolve into It by letting go/disidentifying from all 'knowing' and 'self-consciousness'. (?)</p>
              <p>Another question: some practitioners are able to maintain Pure Witnessing 24/7 into dream and deep sleep... and as Ken Wilber (who himself is able to achieve this) himself said, this will come only after about 20 years of meditative practice. But if the above perspective is correct, then that is not necessary since grasping onto any form of self-consciousness is still not 'accessing' the Absolute, right? Why not just let go into awareness unaware of itself?</p>
              <p>Speaking of this, it just reminded me of what Thusness told me 4 years ago:</p>
              <p><em>"There is nothing wrong with the experience 
                                          of Presence, but it
                                                                  is the attachment (that hinders). It is the 
                                          subtle attachment that
                                                                  prevents us from deep sleep because we are 
                                          unwilling to let go of
                                                                  that experience (even into sleep). Though one 
                                          will not feel
                                                                  anything wrong or it does not disturb one much, 
                                          it is not a form of
                                                                  achievement as described. It is a retrogression 
                                          instead. When one
                                                                  is able to let go and let everything subside, 
                                          even the loss of
                                                                  consciousness, it is a more profound state 
                                          instead. It has to be a
                                                                  natural momentum that is being built up, until 
                                          the propensities is
                                                                  gone, the letting go is complete, it is 
                                          illuminated
                                                                  everywhere."</em></p>
              <p>and his reply and comment on my non-dual experience in <a href="/forums/1728/topics/310956">Death, Consciousness, Nondual Perception</a><em>:</em></p>
              <p><em><br> Kok ur head! Ur mind is full of attainments and

              <p><em>I am merely telling you that it is too early

              </blockquote>
              <p><em><br>  Associating 'death of I' with vivid luminosity 
                  of your
                                          experience is far too early.  This will lead you
                   into
                                          erroneous views because there is also the 
                  experience of
                                          practitioners by way of complete surrendering or
                   elimination
                                          (dropping) like Taoist practitioners.  An 
                  experience of deep
                                          bliss that is beyond that of what you 
                  experienced can occur. 
                                          But the focus is not on luminosity but 
                  effortlessness, naturalness
                                          and spontaneity.  In complete giving up, there 
                  is no 'I' ; it
                                          is also needless to know anything; in fact 
                  'knowledge' is
                                          considered a stumbling block.  The practitioner 
                  drops away
                                          mind, body, knowledge...everything.  There is no
                   insight,
                                          there is no luminosity there is only total 
                  allowing of whatever
                                          that happens, happen in its own accord.  All 
                  senses including
                                          consciousness are shut and fully absorbed.  
                  Awareness of
                                          'anything' is only after emerging from that 
                  state.<br>  <br> One is the experience of vivid luminosity while 
                  the other is a
                                          state of oblivious.  It is therefore not 
                  appropriate to relate
                                          the complete dissolving of 'I' with what u 
                  experienced alone.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Furthermore Nisargadatta Maharaj said:</p>
              <p class="content2"><em>"Awareness is primordial; it is the original state, 
                              beginningless, endless, uncaused, unsupported,
                              without parts, without change. Consciousness is on contact, a reflection
                               against a surface, a state of duality. There
                              can be no consciousness without awareness, but there can be awareness 
                              without consciousness, as in deep sleep. Awareness
                              is absolute, consciousness is relative to its content; consciousness is 
                              always of something. Consciousness is partial
                              and changeful, awareness is total, changeless, calm and silent. And it 
                              is the common matrix of every experience."</em></p>

              <p><strong>Reality Beyond Consciousness</strong></p>
              <p><br>Reality is beyond all characteristics, even of being, consciousness,<br>emptiness or any other designation. To ‘awaken’ to your<br>identity as being, consciousness, oneness, presence, emptiness<br>or what have you is still moving in the realm of phenomena<br>as an imagined entity. Your essential nature is prior to the<br>sense of consciousness and being. There is something in you<br>that knows the sense of being conscious and present. That is<br>your real nature. It is forever unknowable as an object. It is<br>beyond being and non-being, consciousness and unconsciousness.<br>There is a temptation to take reality to be the sense of<br>being, presence, consciousness, aliveness or even something<br>more objective, such as stillness or a peaceful state. But all<br>those things are objective. You know them. What you are is<br>evidently beyond them all.</p>
              <p><br>At some point, there may arise a resonance with the<br>pointer that there is something prior to consciousness, prior<br>to being, prior to peace, prior to oneness, prior to emptiness.<br>Why? Because all of those, however subtle, are conditioned<br>states. They are experiences that can be grasped, understood<br>or recognized. Even the sense of ‘I am’ is an appearance. It has<br>appeared upon your true nature. It is the primary concept or</p>
              <p>experience, which is the basis of all other experiences. Without<br>the sense of ‘I am’, there can be no other experiences. You<br>are beyond all experience, even the experience of ‘I am’.</p>
              <p><br>At the core of the mind is an empty space, a void through<br>which the primordial, non-conceptual reality shines forth as<br>consciousness. The whole world appears in the light of consciousness.<br>Consciousness itself is a time-bound, phenomenal<br>state, an appearance on that unconditioned source which is<br>prior to consciousness. Reality is non-conceptual awareness<br>that does not even know that it is. Simply put, you are the<br>one who is aware of being and of being conscious. That ‘you’<br>is entirely beyond the body, senses, mind, consciousness and<br>anything else that can be perceived or conceived. It cannot be<br>grasped or even be understood, because it is what you are.</p>
              <p><strong>Prior to Consciousness</strong></p>
              <p><br>When you awake in the morning, consciousness dawns.<br>In this state of being conscious, you perceive a body, mind<br>and world. These are appearances only, not what you are in<br>essence. To identify oneself with any of these appearances<br>gives rise to the notion of being a separate person, self or<br>individual entity. This is the cause of all seeking, suffering<br>and doubts. Consciousness is a state that comes and goes.<br>In sleep, unconsciousness or under anesthesia, the experience<br>of being conscious subsides. So it is clearly a transitory<br>state. However, before you awoke and became conscious<br>of anything else, including the fact of being conscious, you<br>existed. Consciousness happened to you who were there to<br>experience it.</p>
              <p><br>Your fundamental position is prior to consciousness. From<br>this non-conceptual source, which is what you are, arises initially<br>the sense of conscious presence. This is also the sense of<br>being, the experience that ‘I am’, or the bare fact of knowing<br>that you are. This is the first appearance upon your original<br>state. Little can be said about your essential nature because it<br>is clearly beyond all concepts and even prior to consciousness.<br>Some pointers that have been used are: non-conceptual awareness,<br>awareness unaware of itself, pure being (beyond being<br>and non-being), the absolute, the unmanifest, noumenon,<br>cognizing emptiness, no-thing-ness—to name a few.</p>
              <p><br>This non-conceptual essence is pure non-duality or unicity<br>in which the notions of both subject and object are merged.<br>Just as the sun does not know light because it is light, so you<br>do not know your original nature (as an object) because you<br>are that. It is forever beyond the grasp of concepts and subject-<br>object knowledge. Yet it is entirely evident and inescapable<br>as that which allows you to say with utter certitude ‘I<br>am’ and ‘I know that I am’. Even when those words subside,<br>you are. Even when the consciousness that knows those words</p>
              <p>subsides, you are. Consciousness is the light of creation. But<br>you are the primordial non-conceptual awareness, being or<br>‘no-thing-ness’ in which consciousness and all subsequent<br>appearances come and go.</p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Analogy of the Sun</strong></p>
              <p><br>To understand your true nature, consider the sun. Imagine<br>you are the sun shining in space with no other objects<br>present. You are present and shining, and yet you see nothing—<br>neither light, other objects, nor yourself. Why? Because<br>you are singular and there are no objects available to reflect<br>your light and confirm your presence objectively. Should an<br>object appear, you perceive your light reflected in that object<br>and become conscious of something that appears as other or<br>apart. In truth, you are only perceiving your own light, nothing<br>else. The object is the means for you to perceive yourself<br>indirectly. The reflected light takes the apparent form and<br>location of the object. The reflected light may in turn light up<br>other objects. The perception of light is time bound because<br>it lasts only so long as the objects are present. Without any<br>object, you (as the sun) revert back to your unmanifested,<br>original condition (that is, the shining sun that sees nothing<br>at all, including its own light).</p>
              <p><br>This analogy is parallel to your own original state or true<br>nature. Your essence is pure non-duality, one without a second,<br>which we might point to as non-conceptual awareness<br>or pure being that is unaware of its awareness and without a<br>sense of its own existence. When the mind, body and objects<br>appear, they are perceived as objects in consciousness, which<br>is the objective manifestation of your innate, aware presence.<br>Consciousness is like the reflected sunlight. The state<br>of being conscious arises along with the body-mind and<br>appears limited to the time, place and presence of the bodymind.<br>The body-mind ‘gives birth’ to consciousness. When<br>the body-mind subsides, the consciousness of objects also<br>subsides. Consciousness appears as a transient state on your<br>original condition. It is intimately tied to the presence of the<br>body-mind, which reflects the light of awareness, allowing<br>consciousness to manifest in a tangible way. With the rising</p>
              <p>of the body-mind in our experience, you have the instruments<br>to say, ‘I am’, ‘I am present’, ‘I know’, ‘I am conscious’.</p>
              <p><br>So the presence of the body-mind is a necessary requirement<br>for consciousness to manifest and for awareness to<br>become aware that it is. Just as sunlight and reflected sunlight<br>are really not two separate things, neither are non-dual awareness<br>and manifested consciousness actually different. With the<br>appearance of the body-mind, we become conscious, we know<br>‘we are’. And with the rise of the sense of being conscious, all<br>other objects are then known. Consciousness itself is really<br>an object or experience, since it is a state that appears to you.<br>With the subsidence of the experience of the body-mind, consciousness<br>also departs. It ‘returns’ to its source of non-dual<br>awareness or being. But nothing happens to you at all. In none<br>of this have you ever left your original condition. You were,<br>are and ever must be the timeless, unconditioned, non-dual<br>being-awareness beyond body, mind and consciousness.</p>

              <p><strong>Back to the Sperm and the Egg</strong></p>
              <p><br>Take it back to the sperm and the egg. When they came<br>together,
                                                                                                                                                                                           life-energy infused the fetus and consciousness<br>began to manifest in
                                                                                                                                                                                           that body. Following birth, the sense of<br>consciousness gradually 
                                                                                                                                                                                          matured. The world of experience<br>appeared within consciousness, when 
                                                                                                                                                                                          you came to know<br>‘I am’. Without consciousness, there is no world. 
                                                                                                                                                                                          Clearly,<br>all things appearing in the field of consciousness,

              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Non-Conceptual Awareness</strong></p>
              <p><br>Your true nature is non-conceptual awareness. This is the<br>necessary ground of all experiences, even the presence and<br>absence of being conscious (as in waking and dreaming) or<br>unconscious (as in deep sleep). You are not the appearances<br>or even the states of consciousness that come and go. You<br>are to whom they appear. Seeing this, you can drop all the<br>labels and just be what you are. The term ‘presence-awareness’<br>is another pointer to your natural state prior to consciousness.<br>Consciousness is sometimes referred to as the ‘I<br>am’ or witness. Presence-awareness equates with non-conceptual<br>awareness itself, the absolute, which is what you are.<br>This is the basis of all appearances, including the sense of<br>‘I am’. After all, you do not have the sense or thought of ‘I<br>am’ in sleep. So the sense of ‘I am’ comes and goes. But you<br>are there in sleep and all states as the basic aware-presence<br>itself. ‘I am’ and the ego are not the same. Ego is the notion<br>of being a separate person, which is based on identifying<br>oneself as the body, mind and/or personality. When you see<br>that you are not that concept (the separate person), you see<br>yourself as the impersonal consciousness or witness in which<br>all experiences rise and set. But actually, your fundamental<br>identity lies beyond (or prior to) this. You are the non-conceptual<br>presence-awareness in which even the witness and<br>the world of experiences come and go. That is the absolute or<br>ultimate state. That is your natural condition even now, for<br>you are aware not only of appearances, but the fact of being<br>conscious or witnessing also. So you must be the awareness<br>beyond all states, experiences and concepts.</p>
              <p><strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Absolute, Unconditioned Reality</strong></p>
              <p><br>The world of our everyday experience consists of the various<br>things we sense and interact with, including external objects<br>and our own bodies. We also experience an internal world<br>of thoughts and feelings. To experience any of these things<br>requires the presence of consciousness. How many thoughts,<br>feelings or experiences could we have apart from consciousness?<br>This is a simple point that is usually overlooked. In<br>non-duality, primacy is given to consciousness as the basic<br>fact of experience. In fact, at the level of appearances, consciousness<br>is what you are, because it is the only continuously<br>present factor in our experience. The world, mind and<br>body appear as objects within consciousness. They have no<br>independent existence apart from being perceived in consciousness.<br>To overlook one’s real position as the conscious<br>knowing presence and identify oneself with the body is due<br>to a basic misunderstanding, a conceptual error. The body<br>is an object that appears in consciousness. You are the one<br>to whom it appears. Essentially, the body, mind and world<br>are fleeting and insubstantial appearances coming and going<br>within consciousness. Relatively speaking, consciousness is<br>more enduring, more substantial and more ‘real’ than the<br>appearances. Because most of us are ignorantly identified as<br>the body and mind, a first step in clarifying our identity is<br>to see our identity as consciousness rather than any of the<br>objects of consciousness.</p>
              <p><br>Because objects only exist in consciousness and have no<br>independent reality, we can view them as manifestations or<br>appearances of consciousness, much as waves have no independent<br>reality but are only appearances of the underlying<br>water which is their substratum. In the wave analogy, all that<br>is present is water. The wave is just a label for something that<br>appears but has no independent existence as a thing apart<br>from its source. In terms of consciousness, this means that</p>
              <p>the objects (body, mind and world) do not exist as independent<br>realities as such. It is consciousness alone that exists. This<br>means that there has never been an actual independent body,<br>mind or world at all. All of those things are only appearances<br>of consciousness. All that is truly present in and through all<br>experiencing is consciousness alone.</p>
              <p><br>Consciousness itself is not a continuous or unchanging<br>experience in and of itself. In waking and dreaming, consciousness<br>is present, but in deep sleep we do not experience the<br>fact of being conscious. It is not that we disappear, for some<br>presence or essence continues as the backdrop of sleep, and<br>that something subsequently experiences the re-emergence<br>of consciousness and its objects. From this perspective, we<br>can view consciousness itself as an experience that comes and<br>goes. It is only after the appearance of consciousness that we<br>experience the body, mind and world. These are experienced<br>within consciousness.</p>
              <p><br>Who or what experiences the arising and setting of<br>consciousness? Consider the moment before consciousness<br>emerges. No objects are present. There is no time, space or<br>duality at all. It is entirely unconditioned, non-dual, without<br>distinctions. There is no separation, no lack, no suffering. And<br>yet that state is, because it is what consciousness arises from.<br>Consciousness is a momentary flicker that arises out of the<br>timeless, absolute source. The body, mind and world appear<br>within that flicker of consciousness. Consciousness is like a<br>light flashing on and off within the unconditioned absolute<br>state. In a certain sense, we might say that the absolute is<br>what cognizes the coming and going of consciousness. Just as<br>the world is registered in consciousness, so is consciousness<br>itself registered in the primal space of reality. That is why the<br>absolute is sometimes referred to as the pure awareness that<br>knows consciousness. It is the light behind consciousness. It<br>is the source from which consciousness derives its substance<br>and energy. This source is what the most radical and penetrating<br>presentations of spirituality are pointing to as our fundamental<br>and essential nature. It is not a state or experience,<br>because states and experiences only occur after consciousness</p>
              <p>appears. Our fundamental identity is prior to consciousness.<br>That underlying and ever-present reality is the source which<br>enables consciousness to be conscious and for being to be, so<br>to speak.</p>
              <p><br>What is the relationship of consciousness to that prior<br>source, the absolute? When we looked at the relationship of<br>consciousness to its objects, we saw that there really were<br>no separate objects, only consciousness. We can also see<br>that consciousness cannot stand apart from its source as a<br>separate independent reality. This means that consciousness<br>is an expression or modification of the absolute, whatever we<br>may choose to call that. Consciousness, which contains all<br>that appears in dualistic experience, is itself a ripple arising<br>and setting on the timeless, unconditioned, non-dual state,<br>which is our true reality. If consciousness is only a modification<br>of the absolute, non-dual reality, then consciousness as<br>such does not truly exist, since it has no actual independent<br>nature. Consciousness appears but it has never truly existed<br>as an independent reality. All there is, is the unconditioned,<br>absolute, non-dual source. That absolute reality is all there<br>is, and it is all that we have ever been. There has never been<br>anything else except this.</p>
              <p><br>To speak poetically, consciousness is a fleeting ripple on the<br>fathomless ocean of the unconditioned, absolute reality. Consciousness<br>simply arises and sets as a vibration or pulsation of<br>the uncreated and eternal non-dual awareness. In that apparent<br>ripple of consciousness appear universes, worlds, living<br>beings and everything within the domain of time and space.<br>Yet no thing has ever really come to be, because objects have<br>never existed apart from consciousness and consciousness has<br>never existed apart from the absolute. That absolute is beyond<br>time, space, body, mind, world, being and consciousness. This<br>is what your true nature is at this very moment—the absolute,<br>unconditioned reality prior to consciousness.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>The article is too long. I didn't read in entirety.</p>
              <p>I can only share from own experience... please read with a pint of salt :)</p>
              <p>For one who is abiding in presence practice, he/she will not be really concerned about describing or putting 'how things works' into a framework. He/she will have already recognised the incompleteness and inaccuracy of any form of description.</p>
              <p>As for 'No "I" ' experience, it is not the same as the experience of complete mental formation shut down. AEN, I don't think you have that experience of complete consciousness blank-out yet.... It will be a very distinctive experience. In my case, the initial experience happened during a meditation which led me to the misassumption of 'I AM'. The experience is pure, but the latter interpretation of it was wrong.</p>
              <p>In 'No-I' experience, one simply realised that there is no self in any experience even when consciousness is rolling own. There can be thinking, but there is no thinker.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, in complete consciousness blank-out, yet awareness persists, there is not a single thought or any form of mental formation. Basically, there is no thinking, no mental image or any form of consciousness that we normally have. It will be distinctive because it is this experience that will allow one to see for the first time the difference between mental-mixed consciousness and pure presence.</p>
              <p>Complete mental formation shut down and yet awareness still exist, it is not the same as sleep.</p>
              <p>Personally, I don't see a point in maintaining witnessing even into sleep. It is really a desire to have that expereince of Presence.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I have experienced Presence and a complete certainty of Being in a state of thoughtlessness... not a single thought as you said, however I do not know if it is the 'consciousness blank out' you mentioned... because I do not have a distinct feeling that if someone were to come and talk to me at that moment, I would be unaware of it or unable to hear it. However at that moment all I experienced is pure empty Presence and nothing else, no thought, no sound, etc. It is what remains after every thought and everything subsides... as I wrote in <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="390582">Certainty of Being</a>, "As the
                                      thoughts subside, an intense and palpable sense 
              of beingness and
                                      presence, the only 'thing' that remains that I 
              feel to be my
                                      innermost essence."</p>
              <p>I do agree though that probably an initial experience of Presence Awareness led on to an image of I Am... as a form of reflection of itself because otherwise it has no way to account for its existence on the mental level. Presence Awareness by itself would not be able to reflect upon itself this way and create a sense of Self (aka Consciousness). Presence Awareness would remain un-selfaware without the body-mind instrument to become self-conscious. However just because Presence Awareness is unable to reflect upon itself in states like deep sleep, does not mean it does not exist, it simply returns to its natural state of 'Awareness-Unaware-Of-Itself'... a state of potentiality where consciousness can return at any moment on the screen of Awareness. Everything depends on Presence-Awareness as the Source of all.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It took me years 
                                                              to figure this much out. Each realization builds on and

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1. First I realize I am not all this other stuff that 
                                                              people usually think

                                                               habits, 
                                                                and other false identies: "Mr. So- and-so." So I dispense with that. I
                                                               can see

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2. Then I realize I am not even the more intimate stuff 
                                                              that people usually 
                                                                think they are. I am not the body (that is the toughest one, as 
                                                              Nisargadatta

                                                               I am 
                                                                not the chemistry of all this either. One could spend an entire 
                                                              lifetime and

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3. Then I realize that if I subtract all the above, <strong>what
                                                               is left?</strong> Only my sense of existing itself, my sense of presence, my sense of

                                                              the 
                                                                feeling of existing. I must be THAT. What IS that? It is very subtle. 
                                                              But now 
                                                                I am coming closer. This is the realization of the mystical phrase <strong>"I

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I have experienced Presence and a complete certainty of Being in a state of thoughtlessness... not a single thought as you said, however I do not know if it is the 'consciousness blank out' you mentioned... because I do not have a distinct feeling that if someone were to come and talk to me at that moment, I would be unaware of it or unable to hear it. However at that moment all I experienced is pure empty Presence and nothing else, no thought, no sound, etc.</p>

              <p>There is no sense of vastness or spacious at that time. There is only Self.. not a mental identification but a sense of presence prior to all thoughts, a very palpable and undeniable sense of Presence-Awareness that is prior to, behind, everything. I intuitively understood this to be 'Who I Am' (I was practicing the koan 'Before birth, who am I?' at that point) even without thought-reflection, a non-conceptual certainty and conviction because this actually goes beyond all doubts... it is impersonal and yet it feels more 'Me' than anything else. There is just this certainty of Being.</p>

              <p>I had sense of vastness or spaciousness many times even before (and subsequently after) that experience, but that was something distinct from all the previous experiences... a conviction grew on what I am, a certainty of 'I am'.

              <p>Yes... I think, when the mind tries to understand Presence... at the same time it localizes it in the form of 'I AM'.</p>
              <p>The Source is totally ungraspable... non-local, centerless, infinite, all-pervading, unknowable as an object yet IS, and as such the mind in its attempt to 'know' Presence has made a closest substitute. This self-reflexive consciousness arises naturally right after deep sleep... but later gradually evolved into grosser identifications like 'I am this, I am that'.</p>
              <p>When Pure Awareness is experienced, it is non-local, centerless, borderless, but later gets mixed up with the first thought/sense that arose from Pure Awareness which is the sense of 'I Am', because it is the first act of 'self-consciousness', the closest 'thing' to pure awareness that can be cognized. Before that is just 'awareness unaware of itself'.</p>

              <p><em>To know any experience, there must 
                                  be a knowing that "I
                                                          am". That is just the basic conscious knowing of
                                   being present.
                                                          That is what first appears out of deep sleep. It
                                   is not a personal
                                                          "I" or any other notion. Call it impersonal 
                                  knowing. Subsequently,
                                                          the mind begins operating and the separate "I" 
                                  notion is created in
                                                          thought.</em></p>

              <p><em>Pure awareness, or non-conceptual 
                                  reality, is non-dual.
                                                          Upon or within this arises self-consciousness, 
                                  which is the pure
                                                          sense of "I am", but not yet individualized. 
                                  Then follows the "I"
                                                          concept, or the notion of separate 
                                  individuality. Lastly,
                                                          there appear notions such as I am this or that 
                                  (body, mind,
                                                          personality, etc.). </em></p>

              <p><em>All phenomena appear in 
                                  consciousness. That
                                                          consciousness is NOT personal. It is the

                                                          experience in duality. It is the pure sense of

                                                          content, just knowing "I am" without words, or
