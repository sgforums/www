That is a given. Everybody tries their best. Your best may not result in the effect that you desired due to the influence of karma.<br><br>For example, you give to a begger. The begger can take your help and use your charity to start a new life or he might end up begging his whole life because you gave to him when he begged.<br><br>In his head, he thinks, "hey begging is easy... I begged and he gave to me."<br><br>or he might think, "good, with this help I am able to make a decent start with my life."<br><br>You do not on  purpose do bad deeds but your good deeds might have bad consequences...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people maintain that all the pleasant and unpleasant feelings that we experience are due to our good and bad karma that we have done during our previous birth. <strong>This is only true to a certain extent</strong>, because it would mean that we are totally powerless to change our fate because everything is determined by our past actions. <strong>Buddhism maintains that while we are the result of the past, we have the power to determine the future</strong>. According to the Buddha, good and bad deeds are done by ourselves and we are responsible for the purity or the impurity of our own mind. Others can influence us but we either purify or pollute the mind with the deeds that we have committed.</div>
