              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>Lies, all lies, they say.</span></p>

                  conflict, not over what is but what was. The past proves to be as inflammatory
                  as the present. "The past is never dead, it’s not even past,"
                  observed William Faulkner. In grade school, we learned history was composed of
                  accepted facts and dates that neatly yielded to true-and-false quizzes. As
                  adults, we discover history to be utterly fluid, a changeling that spurns hard
                  facts and cold truths. Far from the calm reflecting pool presented to us in
                  youth, we now see it as a caldron of resentment and recrimination. History does
                  not resolve. It festers.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>But these days I am left to wonder what remains of
                  history, and what can be trusted of a past that is forever at the beck and call
                  of a self-serving present. Is anything indisputable? The corpses, the
                  annexations, the genocides are all now punctuated by question marks and
                  asterisks, entangled in the dialectics of nationalism and identity politics.
                  Does historical fact even exist, or is it simply a relativistic construct?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>History has always been suspect. More than 2,000
                  years ago, Herodotus became known as both "The Father of History" and
                  "The Father of Lies." More recently, Henry Ford declared that
                  "history is more or less bunk." But today, more than ever, it seems
                  history has hijacked the headlines, become the fault line between friends and
                  foes, and a frontline in the culture wars. It’s not as if we don’t already have
                  enough discord to occupy us without having to dip into the past. But there it
                  is. Today’s lesson: There is no "was," only "is."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>Now I confess, I am no scholar. I am but a
                  journalist — a myopic creature of deadlines and foreshortened horizons. But I
                  have always been drawn to history, first as a classics major, then as the
                  author of three books that delved into the past. I have no overarching theory
                  of history, but I am left to wonder whether our relationship with the past has
                  itself undergone a sea change.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>Society appears to be in the midst of some sort of
                  tectonic shift, from a culture that identified certain bedrock facts — the
                  historical canon — to one rooted in evidence, which is to say those renderings
                  of the past that support an argument, be it religious, ideological, scholarly,
                  or nationalistic. Even the word "facts" is cushioned by quotation
                  marks or air quotes. The abdication of a fact-based study (or its evolution
                  into a nuanced and inquiring discipline) is lauded as a step toward
                  enlightenment and universal enfranchisement. Those who still speak longingly of
                  facts as sacrosanct risk being seen as parochial, shortsighted, and naïve —
                  throwbacks to an earlier and discredited regime. History is now a cafeteria:
                  Take what you like, leave the rest.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>Teachers of history have both documented the shift
                  and promoted it. In a 2011 article in The Journal of American History, Joel M.
                  Sipress and David J. Voelker </span><a href="http://jah.oxfordjournals.org/content/97/4/1050.full"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>chronicle</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>d the transition
                  from broad historical survey courses, laden with facts and chronologies, to a
                  new model. "Put simply," they wrote, "present-day reformers
                  insist that facts do not and cannot come first. … With the facts-first
                  assumption exposed as a fallacious lay theory of student learning, the entire
                  edifice of the coverage model simply collapses."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>In its place, we now have "argument-based
                  courses … organized around significant historical questions — questions about
                  which historians disagree. Students are systematically exposed to rival
                  positions about which they must make informed judgments, and they are asked to
                  develop their own positions for which they must argue on the basis of
                  historical evidence."</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>In such a scheme, historians and students become not
                  merely scholars but litigants, and history the stuff of advocacy in which point
                  of view and identity — racial, ethnic, nationalistic, gender, or sexual
                  orientation — are all equal partners. History becomes more personalized, more
                  tribal, but less communal. What matters is the presentation, not the verdict.
                  In the face of such change, the trick is to preserve logic and evidence, and
                  not have history descend into one grand he-said-she-said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>But increasingly there are those who gainsay the
                  past to advance their narratives, and disregard whatever contradicts them — be
                  it the fossil record, the core samples and global warming, or the abandoned
                  shoes at Auschwitz. For them, an inconvenient truth is no truth at all. Their
                  objective? To seed the clouds with doubt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span class="dropcap"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>A</span></span><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>cross the globe we
                  war against history. Denial of the past takes many forms. In Japan and Turkey,
                  it is left to the diplomats. In the Middle East, it takes a more virulent form.
                  The Taliban dynamited the 1,500-year-old Buddhist sculptures of Bamiyan. ISIS
                  blew up the ancient walls of Nineveh. The futility of such desecration serves
                  only to remind the world that history does not reside in artifacts but in
                  culture. Toppling the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in
                  2003 did not end deadly rivalries but rather came to symbolize our inability to
                  grasp history’s sway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>History is a canvas upon which the paint never
                  dries. It is the stage upon which proxy wars are waged between those in power
                  and those who are oppressed. Nowhere is this more evident than in China, whose
                  long history is rightly perceived by the Communist Party to threaten the
                  regime. It is why the party is not fooled when its critics cloak criticism in
                  ancient anecdotes, or why, upon the party’s 90th anniversary, in 2011, the
                  government banned TV and film depictions of time travel — lest, observers </span><a style="line-height: 20pt;" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/china-bans-time-travel-films-177801"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>said,</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'> it make happiness
                  seem like a thing of the past. Mao Zedong’s epic war on China’s past during the
                  Cultural Revolution merely reaffirmed that a country can neither erase nor
                  defang history. That has not stopped it from trying.

                  that will shape not the past but the future.</span></p>

                  culture has its historical blind spots. America condemns Iran for denying the
                  Holocaust, but refuses to release an official history of U.S. covert actions in
                  Iran, though they were undertaken more than half a century ago.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 20.0pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'>In 1994, I visited Hiroshima’s Peace Memorial
                  Museum. The then-director spoke of the controversy at the Smithsonian Air and
                  Space Museum surrounding a coming exhibition of the Enola Gay to mark the end
                  of World War II. He accused the Smithsonian of sanitizing history, giving short
                  shrift to Hiroshima’s civilian deaths out of deference to U.S. veterans. As
                  compelling as his point was, I was thinking of my own search within the
                  Hiroshima museum for mention of Pearl Harbor. I failed to find it.</span></p>

                  want to return to a history that is linear and scripted, populated by heroic
                  stick figures in moralistic parables of dubious origin. I see that today’s take
                  on yesterday is more honest. Still, something has been lost. I am all for
                  intellectual honesty, but tolerance and ambiguity have their limits. Beauty may
                  be solely in the eye of the beholder, but history isn’t. I cannot respect a
                  history that does not recognize some kernels of hard fact, some core that
                  resists manipulation.</span></p>

                  it may sound, is no more honest than the old survey courses. The Poles may have
                  a point, but allowing Turkey and Japan to pretend that atrocities did not
                  happen is an affront both to those who suffered and to our own moral and
                  intellectual integrity. Japan’s press secretary at the Ministry of Foreign
                  Affairs </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/opinion/a-spotlight-on-japans-wartime-past.html"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";  '>writes</span></a><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";   color: #3a3a3a;'> that "we

                  historical reality before self-interest.</span></p>

                  self-evident, that the truth is less unbending than we might wish. The European

                  Be Forgotten," a measure allowing individuals to scrub their past from the
                  Internet and opening the door for despots and rogue states to do the same.</span></p>

                  may be, that is worthy of conservation, shielded from those who would distort
                  or erase it. Would that we could set portions of the past aside like national
                  parks that would be off limits to mining and the degradations that beset the
                  present, circumscribing some narrow set of sacred facts, rising like great
                  redwoods, that would inspire us to honor what we know to be true even when we
                  wish it were not. There, on common ground, would be a fit place for our
                  arguments to take shape.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3a3a3a; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20pt; text-align: justify;">But today’s headlines make that seem less and less
                  likely. For now, the narratives of nationalism, political correctness,
                  self-interest, all converge upon the past, claiming it as their own. It is
                  destined to be contested ground. That does not make it any the less worth
                  fighting for.</span></p>
