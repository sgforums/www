            <div class='col-md body'>mostly those religions focuses on one god or many gods, not really that different from one another, then maybe got rebirth and kamma in their teachings, but their concept are not the same with Buddhism's rebirth and kamma.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Buddhism is like a fresh breath of air in that it is different from religions centering on god and its power.<br><br>Self liberation rather than relying on external liberation and kamma and rebirth explains a lot of occurences in this world rather than using god to explain everything.<br><br>The teachings in Buddhism really appeal to the intellect and does not need blind faith and submission of oneself to god, which emphasises reliance on an external being rather than onself.<br><br></div>

ThatÂ’s possible; be careful. In your mind thereÂ’s no connection between Buddha, or God, and yourself. TheyÂ’re completely separate things: youÂ’re completely down here; Buddha, or God, is completely up there. ThereÂ’s no connection whatsoever. ItÂ’s not realistic to think that way. ItÂ’s too extreme.

True religion should be the pursuit of self-realization, not an exercise in the accumulation of facts.<br><br>In Buddhism, we are not particularly interested in the quest for intellectual knowledge alone. We are much more interested in understanding whatÂ’s happening here and now, in comprehending our present experiences, what we are at this very moment, our fundamental nature.

Clouds come and go, but the blue sky is always there; clouds donÂ’t alter the fundamental nature of the sky. Similarly, the human mind is fundamentally pure, not one with the ego.

We want to know how to find satisfaction, how to find happiness and joy instead of depression and misery, how to overcome the feeling that our nature is totally negative.<br><br>Lord Buddha himself taught that basically, human nature is pure, egoless, just as the sky is by nature clear, not cloudy. Clouds come and go, but the blue sky is always there; clouds donÂ’t alter the fundamental nature of the sky. Similarly, the human mind is fundamentally pure, not one with the ego. Anyway, whether you are a religious person or not, if you canÂ’t separate yourself from your ego, youÂ’re completely misguided; youÂ’ve created for yourself a totally unrealistic philosophy of life that has nothing whatsoever to do with reality.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>i just sense....... something........ not quite right here..........<br></div>
