              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13pt; line-height: 20.95pt;">Why do we humans insist on locking our dead bodies in boxes and putting
              them in the ground forever? The rest of nature is content getting eaten by
              vultures and contributing their nutrients to the soil after they pass on, but
              not humans. No, we have to get all fancy with our dead people and put them in
              special places called graveyards. In this feature, we'll travel the world and
              visit 10 of the most over-the-top and weird repositories for human remains,
              from live-in mansions to an underwater paradise made from human ashes.</span></p>

              That is, aside from keeping them away from raccoons or whatever. In some parts
              of China, corpses are<span> </span><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2408886/The-hanging-coffins-Sichuan-400-year-old-wooden-tombs-suspended-Chinese-cliff-face.html"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">hung out to dry</span></a><span> </span>-- literally -- in coffins tenuously
              lashed to the faces of cliffs. In the Sichuan province, the Bo people who lived
              there several centuries ago left behind one of the most perplexing graveyards
              ever. Attached to the steep sides of several mountains are a number of coffins,
              each carved from a hollowed-out tree trunk. Some archaeologists believe the Bo
              thought that this weird form of burial would make it easier for the gods to
              collect their spirits.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Khalid Nabi</span></strong><br>The Middle East's attitudes towards sex and sexuality are notoriously
              restrictive, which is why it's deeply weird that the cemetery of<span> </span><a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/khalid-nabi-cemetery"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Khalid Nabi</span><span><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"> </span></span></a>exists.
              Located in the Golestan province of northern Iran, Khalid Nabi has become a
              tourist attraction due to the curious shape of its tombstones. About 600 of the
              site's grave markers resemble nothing more than erect human penises jutting
              forth from the soil, and others look like the outline of women with huge
              breasts. Some archeologists pooh-pooh that theory, claiming that they're
              actually designed in the shape of men wearing turbans, but they really look
              like dicks to us. Many tourists visit the graveyard every year, much to the
              chagrin of the Iranian government who are a bit embarrassed by it.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Dargavs City Of The Dead</span></strong><br>Sometimes a simple cemetery isn't enough to satisfy the dead. Sometimes they
              need a whole city. The odd little village of Dargavs in the North Ossetia
              region of Russia looks pretty charming from a distance, a smattering of<span> </span><a href="http://www.ancient-origins.net/ancient-places-europe/city-dead-mysterious-village-dargavs-russia-003436"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">99 stone huts and
              houses</span></a><span> </span>on a grassy
              hillside over the Fiagdon River. But nobody lives in those houses -- they're
              mausoleums, built by the native people in the 17th century. Legend has it that
              a plague ravaged the area back then and the residents had to build the houses
              to quarantine their relatives. When they died inside them, they simply walled
              up the doors and turned them into makeshift crypts rather than take the risk of
              burying them and exposing themselves to the plague.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Shirokorechenskoe
              Cemetery</span></strong><br>After the collapse of communism, the next natural step for Russia was the rise
              of organized crime. We've all heard stories about the brutal ways of the Moscow
              mafia, but if you want to see where they wind up, take a trip to the town of
              Yekaterinburg. Located in the Ural Mountains, it's the fourth-largest city in
              Russia and is known for metal processing and machine work. It's also known for
              crime, as the<a href="http://dustyroadseconomics.blogspot.com/2012/11/yekaterinburgs-mafia-cemeteries.html"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Shirokorechenskoe
              Cemetery</span></a><span> </span>aptly
              illustrates. Some of the region's most notorious Mafia bosses are buried in an
              alley here, with massive black marble tombstones laser-etched with
              photorealistic portraits of the gangsters in their prime. Beneath them are
              descriptions of their skills like "expert in knife-throwing."<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Neptune Memorial Reef</span></strong><br>Burial at sea is a common practice for sailors far from home (and Osama Bin
              Laden), but this is a little ridiculous. The<span> </span><a href="http://www.neptunesociety.com/memorial-reef"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Neptune Memorial Reef</span></a><span> </span>located off the coast of Florida is a
              unique way to dispose of your mortal remains. The structures of this massive
              man-made complex are made of concrete mixed with human ashes. Memorial plaques
              with the names of "residents" are affixed to the objects, and the grand
              design is of an underwater city with roads and benches that divers can relax
              on. The project has fallen on hard times in recent years, and it's unknown as
              to whether it will ever expand to its proposed final size of 16 undersea acres.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Eklutna Graveyard</span></strong><br>Religious traditions play a big part in how people get buried, but what happens
              when those traditions get weird? Take a trip up to remote Eklutna, Alaska, for
              a pretty amazing example. This region was inhabited by the native Danaina
              people, but when Russian Orthodox migrants settled there in the 1800s their two
              cultures merged in an interesting way. One of the best examples is in the<span> </span><a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/burial-spirit-houses"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">graveyard of St. Nicholas Orthodox
              Church</span></a>. When a local dies, their body is placed in an unmarked grave
              and covered with a blanket. Forty days later, their family constructs a
              "spirit house," a brightly colored wooden structure that looks like a
              Barbie doghouse, and puts it over the plot. Over the next few decades, the
              spirit houses rot away and are absorbed into the earth.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Merry Cemetery Of
              Sapanta</span></strong><br>Typically gravestones are pretty sedate affairs -- a slab of stone, maybe a few
              lines carved on it, and we call it a day. But at one unusual cemetery in
              Romania, the dead get a little more style. The<span> </span><a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/gravestones-romania-share-deceased-life-stories-dirty-secrets-article-1.1429640"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Merry Cemetery of
              Sapanta</span></a><span> </span>is famous
              worldwide for its ostentatiously decorated grave markers, courtesy of one nosy
              man. Stan Ion Patras was a local woodcarver who loved gossip, and when a town
              resident died he would carve them a wooden cross for their grave that depicted
              their life in all its glory, from triumph to tragedy. Patras passed on in 1977
              but his apprentice is carrying on the bizarre tradition.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Manila Chinese Cemetery</span></strong><br>Known as the "Beverly Hills Of The Dead," the notorious<span> </span><a href="http://www.messynessychic.com/2016/04/05/beverley-hills-of-the-dead-luxury-tombs-complete-with-kitchens-air-conditioning/"><span style="color: #ed1c24; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Chinese Cemetery</span></a><span> </span>in the capital of the Philippines is
              the place for that country's super wealthy to retire in style. The cemetery was
              built during the Spanish colonial period when non-Catholic Chinese were
              forbidden from being buried, and it not only contains the island's oldest
              Buddhist temple but many other monuments to the famous dead. The weirdest
              residents, though, are still alive. Mausoleums are common for burial due to the
              humid climate, and rich Filipinos have built enormous burial structures for
              their dead family members. In keeping with Chinese tradition, the mausoleums
              are equipped with beds, bathrooms and other conveniences for the dead person to
              use. These buildings are so big that in some cases living relatives have also
              moved into them to save money.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Sedlec Ossuary</span></strong><br>Not all cemeteries bury their residents in the ground. Sometimes, they use them
              for construction.

              the Czech Republic town of Kutna Hora shows exactly how much mileage you can
              get out of a bunch of old bones. Somewhere between 40,000 and 70,000 dead
              people are represented in the chapel and its grounds. Pretty much everywhere
              you look there's furniture made from human bones, including a huge chandelier
              that contains at least one of every bone in the body and the coat of arms of
              the Schwarzenberg family who commissioned the ossuary's decoration.<br> <br> <strong><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>New Lucky Restaurant</span></strong><br>The problem with burying people in the ground is that you can't really do

              Muslim cemetery with about a dozen graves in it and decided to just roll with
              it and open a cafe where you can eat with corpses. Each of the grave areas is
              blocked off with waist-high iron fencing, and tables fill the rest of the floor
              space. Every morning, Kutti and his staff honor the original occupants by
              wiping down their graves and replacing the flowers on them, then they open for
              business. He says he's doing well financially, and patrons don't seem to mind
