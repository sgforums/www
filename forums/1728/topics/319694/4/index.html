              <p>Thank you for the offer.</p>
              <p>It's not about me wanting to talk to bohi or not, it's just that, if we're discussing a particular topic on a thread, we should stay focus.</p>
              <p>You can try to search some past posts, whenever I started to contribute, bohi would bring in the part about me criticising pureland and vajrayana which is totally out of the discussion.</p>
              <p>I am only concerned about this part and not about whether bohi likes me or not.</p>
              <p>That's why I am seeking clarification from the moderator(s), whether is it that me being not agreeing totally with pureland and vajrayana would render me a lesser right to comment in this forum. If it is so, I will gladly leave the forum; if it is not, I hope the moderator(s) would do something to bohi's comments on me.</p>
              <p>That simple =)</p>
              <p>By the way, I don't lose anything if I cannot contribute in this forum.</p>

              <p>I am not doing my job well enough as a moderator.</p>
              <p>This is because this forum has been quite peaceful for some time and I didn't need to take any actions as a moderator (and I may not have edited or closed a topic since last year)... so kinda got used to just reading the posts.</p>

              <p>It appears that the "I AM" experience is what Mr. Xiao and his apostles are attempting to refute;what they termå¸¸ä½�ä¸�å��çš„ç¦»å¿µç�µçŸ¥ã€�æ„�è¯†è§‰çŸ¥å¿ƒ.They say this falls into the eternalism trap,and is not Dharma.But like you(AEN)said,they themselves seem to fall into the same trap by maintaining that the 8th Consciousness truly exists.Hence, they may not agree that the Dharmakaya is one and the same with Tathagatagarba,"ru lai zang".</p>
              <p>   Are Dharmakaya and Tathagatagarba one and the same?And how can the element of sentient beings be the Dharmakaya,something that Yong Jia Zen Master also asserts in his "Song of Enlightenment"?</p>
              <p>   They also cite the Lanka to support their stand.Could both sides be arguing over mere words and not the realities behind those words?</p>

              <p>   Like a university debate,don't get personal, if one

              the opposite camp isn't,why the need for vexations?Instead,you
              should have more compassion if you think they are

              <p>It appears that the "I AM" experience is what Mr. Xiao and
                              his apostles are attempting to refute;what they

                              trap,and is not Dharma.But like you(AEN)said,they themselves seem
                              to fall into the same trap by maintaining that the 8th
                              Consciousness truly exists.Hence, they may not agree that the
                              Dharmakaya is one and the same with Tathagatagarba,"ru lai
                              zang".</p>
              <p>   Are Dharmakaya and Tathagatagarba one and the
                              same?And how can the element of sentient beings be the
                              Dharmakaya,something that Yong Jia Zen Master also asserts in his
                              "Song of Enlightenment"?</p>

              <p>The æ„�è¯†è§‰çŸ¥å¿ƒ he is talking about is our transient thoughts and personality. This can hardly be called the I AM. He is saying that we should not mistake these transient thoughts and personality as eternal.</p>
              <p>But the problem is he thinks that beyond our transient thoughts and personality, there is something totally real, something that is formless and permanent -- he calls it Alaya. It looks as if it is a boundless container where all experience arise and subsides from It. This real has always been unmoved and unchanging. Thoughts and personality changes over time, while this Alaya is unchanging and everpresent. This unchanging container is the I AM. So he clearly sees a duality.</p>
              <p>Next, Tathagathagarbha is generally known as a potential, to transform into Dharmakaya. When full enlightenment is achieved, Tathagathagarbha transforms into Dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>As for the Song of Enlightenment, I think it is more like a potential. If we all truly manifest Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya already then we are already Buddhas and there is no need to practice, which doesn't make sense. We have to practice a long time in the Bodhisattva path in order to manifest all the 3 bodies. And simply a realisation of ultimate reality is not enough, even Arhats can realise ultimate reality.</p>
              <p>As Nirvana Sutra says,</p>
              <p><br> <em>"Child of the lineage, I have said that ‘curd exists in milk’,
                                                      because curd is produced from milk, it is called ‘curd’.<br> <br> Child of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there
                                                      is no butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the curd arises from milk
                                                      with the conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have
                                                      the ‘curd-nature’."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, there is no doubts that Mr Xiao Pingshi from the works I have quoted are speaking from the understanding and experience of the I AM. This is not at all the meanings of the sutras, and if you have read carefully, I have given a few examples of how he twisted the words and make it skewed to his MISunderstandings. I also showed how the true meaning of One Mind is being mistaken.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">That saá¹�sÄ�ra is nirvÄ�á¹‡a is a major tenet 
                                      of MahÄ�yÄ�na philosophy. "Nothing of saá¹�sÄ�ra is different from nirvÄ�á¹‡a, 
                                      nothing of nirvÄ�á¹‡a is different from saá¹�sÄ�ra. That which is the limit of 
                                      nirvÄ�á¹‡a is also the limit of saá¹�sÄ�ra; there is not the slightest difference 
                                      between the two." <a name="%5B1%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#1">[1]</a> And yet there must be some difference between them, 
                                      for otherwise no distinction would have been made and there would be no need 
                                      for two words to describe the same state. So NÄ�gÄ�rjuna also distinguishes 
                                      them: "That which, taken as causal or dependent, is the process of being 
                                      born and passing on, is, taken noncausally and beyond all dependence, declared 
                                      to be nirvÄ�á¹‡a." <a name="%5B2%5D" href="http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/david.htm#2">[2]</a> There is only one reality -- this world, right here -- but this world
                                    may be experienced in two different ways. Saá¹�sÄ�ra is the "relative"
                                    world as usually experienced, in which "I" dualistically perceive "it"
                                    as a collection of objects which interact causally in space and time.
                                    NirvÄ�á¹‡a is the world as it is in itself, nondualistic in that it
                                    incorporates both subject and object into a whole which, MÄ�dhyamika
                                    insists, cannot be characterized (ChandrakÄ«rti: "NirvÄ�á¹‡a or Reality is
                                    that which is absolved of all thought-construction"), but which
                                    YogÄ�cÄ�ra nevertheless sometimes calls "Mind" or "Buddhanature," and so

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111;"> The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality
                                                            (dharmadhatu) and the essence of all phases of existence in their
                                                            totality. That which is called "the essential nature of the Mind"
                                                            is unborn and is imperishable. It is only through illusions that
                                                            all things come to be differentiated. If one is freed from
                                                            illusions, then to him there will be no appearances (lakshana) of
                                                            objects regarded as absolutely independent existences; therefore
                                                            all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization,
                                                            description, and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis,
                                                            undifferentiated, free from alteration, and indestructible. They
                                                            are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111;"> All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for
                                                            they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable
                                                            of denoting Suchness. The term Suchness likewise has no attributes
                                                            which can be verbally specified. The term Suchness is, so to speak,
                                                            the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to
                                                            words. But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to,
                                                            for all things in their Absolute aspect are real; nor is there
                                                            anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are
                                                            equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood that all
                                                            things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of;
                                                            hence the name Suchness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111;"> Question: If such is the meaning of the principle of Mahayana, how
                                                            is it possible for men to conform themselves to and enter into
                                                            it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111;"> Answer: If they understand that, concerning all things, though they
                                                            are spoken of, there is neither that which speaks, nor that which
                                                            can be spoken of, and though they are thought of, there is neither
                                                            that which thinks, nor that which can be thought of, then they are
                                                            said to have conformed to it. And when they are freed from their
                                                            thoughts, they are said to have entered into it. Next, Suchness has
                                                            two aspects if predicated in words. One is that it is truly empty
                                                            (sunya), for this aspect can, in the final sense, reveal what is
                                                            real. The other is that it is truly nonempty (a-sunya), for its
                                                            essence itself is endowed with undefiled and excellent
                                                            qualities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111;"> 1. Truly Empty</span></p>

                                                            with thoughts conceived by a deluded mind. It should be understood
                                                            that the essential nature of Suchness is neither with marks nor
                                                            without marks; neither not with marks nor not without marks; nor is

                                                            "empty"; but once they are free from their deluded minds, they will

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111;"> Since it has been made clear that the essence of all things is

              <p>25. The term unity refers to a homogeneous spiritual brilliance
                                                            which separates into six harmoniously blended 'elements'. The
                                                            homogeneous spiritual brilliance is the One Mind, while the six
                                                            harmoniously blended 'elements' are the six sense organs. These six
                                                            sense organs beome severally united with objects that defile them
                                                            -- the eyes with form, the ear with sound, the nose with smell, the
                                                            tongue with taste, the body with touch, and the thinking mind with
                                                            entities. Between these organs and their objects arise the six
                                                            sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all. If you
                                                            understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence,
                                                            you will bind the six harmoniously blended 'elements' into a single
                                                            spiritual brilliance -- a single spiritual brilliance which is the
                                                            One Mind. All students of the way know this, but they cannot avoid
                                                            forming concepts of 'a single spiritual brilliance' and 'the six
                                                            harmoniously blended elements'. Accordingly they are chained to
                                                            entities and fail to achieve a tacit understanding of original

              <p>Oh, it seems the guy is quoting from Lankavatara Sutra. This sutra is the major propenent of the teaching of All is Mind. This also happens to be our moderator Thusness's favourite sutra.</p>
              <p>Thusness, in a 2.5 hours discussion on Lankavatara Sutra in January 2007, transcript typed by me:</p>
              <p><a href="/forums/1728/topics/262408">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/262408</a></p>
              <p><br>...Now, the entire thing about Lankavatara Sutra can be summarised
                                                                    into something like Reality is only Mind. That is, when we talk
                                                                    about Reality is only Mind, those who study Buddhism will know that
                                                                    there is the Cittamatra and then there is the Vijnaptimatra. We
                                                                    have to be very very careful about this thing. It is not going to
                                                                    be very scientific because you will sound stupid, you see. How can
                                                                    the external objects, the external reality, the objective reality
                                                                    that is so clearly outside, out there, be said to be the Mind? The
                                                                    manifestation of the Mind? How can you say that? ArenÂ’t you talking
                                                                    something that is not scientific? How is it possible? When you hear
                                                                    the sound, it is very obvious it is out there. When you touch the
                                                                    table, it is very clear that it is out there. The objective world
                                                                    exists with or without your intervention. Now, this casts many
                                                                    doubts of how do we account for these experiences, for experience
                                                                    the Lankavatara Sutra is stating all these. And I am only
                                                                    interested in this. And we have to differentiate this experience
                                                                    with another experience by what we call the Realists, by saying
                                                                    that everything is Perception. By saying No, it is actually your
                                                                    thoughts that is important, your perception, they are just
                                                                    perception of what you are thinking. Lankavatara Sutra is Not
                                                                    talking about this. DonÂ’t misunderstand. These are the concepts of
                                                                    philosophers. These are not the real experiences of one that has
                                                                    entered Non-Duality.<br> <br> So it comes to the first chapter, of what the Lankavatara Sutra
                                                                    said. The chapter is about discriminations. Ok, in Lankavatara
                                                                    Sutra, they talk about the Five Dharmas. Mainly the names, the
                                                                    appearances, the discriminations, right knowledge, and then
                                                                    reality. I think this is very very important. What is appearance?
                                                                    Appearance is only phenomena that arises when the five senses come
                                                                    into contact. This is what is appearance. But it is before the
                                                                    formation of perception. This means whenever you sense something,
                                                                    before the formation of perception, that means before you identify
                                                                    it with object, that is what I call appearance. Then it comes to
                                                                    identification with an object, and that is perception, and this is
                                                                    the layer of what I call the symbolic world. And these are names.
                                                                    How I see Lankavatara Sutra. Then you can discriminate, that is
                                                                    discrimination, and that is duality. And then comes the right
                                                                    knowledge of what is it? And how do we experience reality.</p>
              <p>First of all we have to understand that what is meant by All is
                                                                    Mind is different from what is meant by All is Perception.
                                                                    Wei-Xin-Lun (Mind-Only Doctrine) is not the same as Wei-Shi-Lun
                                                                    (Consciousness-Only Doctrine). When we say that you are young till
                                                                    now. LetÂ’s say you are an old person. Everything that you
                                                                    experience, and everything that you touch, feel, or experience from
                                                                    an experiential point of view is the Mind. This means every single
                                                                    thoughts, every single things, including when you scoop the sand,
                                                                    when you touch the sand, and when you feel the texture of the sand,
                                                                    is the Mind. This is the kind of experience that Lankavatara Sutra
                                                                    is talking about. So do not confuse that hey, it is a thought in
                                                                    your mind. No it is not talking about this. Many people
                                                                    misunderstand this. It is not talking about this. So first, we must
                                                                    be very clear that it is this experience that they are talking
                                                                    about. It is the experience that is Non-Duality.<br> <br> A person when first enters into meditation.. the first things that
                                                                    come to mind are thoughts. Streams of thoughts, never-ending
                                                                    thoughts. It never stops, never cease. Now, how are we going to
                                                                    understand what reality is all about, when we are covered by this
                                                                    layer of thoughts? And why going beyond this layer of thoughts is
                                                                    important to feel and to see what Reality is? The question that the
                                                                    objective world is so real outside you is mainly due to an
                                                                    attachment. Why do I say that? Many of us are unable to go beyond
                                                                    what I call the body. That is, your body. Because of this body, we
                                                                    acquire all our knowledge through the Five Senses and we make
                                                                    interpretations. It creates what I call a sense of boundary, that
                                                                    there is some restrictions, and therefore beyond this restriction
                                                                    it is outside, and within this restriction it is me, this is
                                                                    mental. But this is not actually the case when someone experiences
                                                                    what I call a moment of Presence. There are many people who had
                                                                    experienced Presence before. It is a state of clear luminosity and
                                                                    clarity. What is this experience all about? This experience is the
                                                                    first experience when one engages in a spiritual life that
                                                                    something is very very real. Something that is alive, and yet there
                                                                    is no thoughts. Something very very real. Something is extremely
                                                                    alive, you know that you are not a machine, you are not a body.
                                                                    Very real. So we ask, what is this? Now, it is this experience that
                                                                    serves as the condition that led many people to continue searching
                                                                    in the spiritual path. It is this experience that is misunderstood
                                                                    by many people as what they call the Eternal Witness, or they call
                                                                    the I AM.</p>
              <p>Now a person must come to this awareness first, of the Presence,
                                                                    this Reality, this Presence, what is it? Before they can proceed to
                                                                    the next step. This is important, because this is the first time
                                                                    you do not understand anything by knowledge. You do not understand
                                                                    anything by thoughts. You do not understand anything by the process
                                                                    of thinking. Everything just stops, and yet, there is Existence. So
                                                                    this is a moment, this is a form of touch, of what they call the
                                                                    Transcendental. This is important. But very soon, this experience
                                                                    is being distorted, completely distorted, by something that is very
                                                                    strong. This is what I call the momentum. This momentum is often
                                                                    overlooked by many practitioners. This momentum is very strong. To
                                                                    the objective world, it might not be. But to consciousness, it is
                                                                    very very strong. And it is so strong that we cannot identify what
                                                                    is real. And it is so strong that it bonds us life after life. How
                                                                    strong is it? It prevents us from knowing what that we touch, what
                                                                    that we feel, what that we sense and what that we see. This is how
                                                                    strong it is. The very moment when a person experience Presence and
                                                                    straight away they think that they are the I AM. This is the
                                                                    Eternal Soul. This is the Spirit. And this is what in Lankavatara
                                                                    Sutra states: It is the propensities, the habit energy. But it is
                                                                    so fast that even after you experience the Presence, you cannot go
                                                                    beyond it. You are still affected by it. And the world that you
                                                                    perceive suddenly becomes, still dualistic. But it becomes
                                                                    spiritual, but it is dualistic. This means that there is a subject
                                                                    and there is an objective world and there is a subjective world.
                                                                    This Ultimate Subject is God. This Ultimate Subject is the One that
                                                                    is behind, and everything is taking place, it is the Observer. This
                                                                    Subject that all is experiencing is actually an illusion. Why do I

              <p>BTW when we talk about emptiness of alaya, the point is not that Alaya, or Buddha-Nature, or Mind, or whatever you want to call it; does not exist, as we all know that existence, non-existence, both existence and non-existence, and neither existence nor non-existence, are all the <strong>4 extremes</strong>, are all false views. Emptiness means empty of these extremes. The luminosity and presence is not denied, what is necessary however is to see the bond of Self, how it distorts our experience..</p>
              <p>What is being pointed out is not to deny any experience, but rather that we musn't categorise and separate form and formless, permanence and impermanence. When we attribute 'formlessness', 'permanence', into an entity and make it the void background reality, it becomes dualistic. And Mr Xiao Pingshi (unfortunately) refutes anyone who doesn't agree with his dualistic framework of understanding.</p>

              <p>    I think he is influenced by the Surangama Sutra,which describes different degrees of deep,inner peace during meditation,but admonishes meditators not to become unwittingly and subtlely attached to them,as they are demonic states(50 of them).However if all is ultimately empty,these states must be empty too,so there is really nothing demonic?</p>

              <p>No, this is not the realisation of the Ajahns. And this is not the I Am that I'm talking about, and I doubt this is the sort of realisation of the Masters that Mr. Xiao Pingshi is criticising on. On the other hand Mr. Xiao Pingshi's description of Alaya is clearly the I AM that I am talking about. As for what is the I AM that I am talking about, you have to read this article, this is the clearest: <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html</a></p>
              <p>For the Ajahns, their understanding/experience is that there is an eternal luminous unborn Citta... the unchanging background substance and the witness of all phenomena. In the case of the Ajahns they seem to have non-dual (of knower and known) experiences but still, more like the Advaita kind of experience and understanding. He still sees the unborn, undying Citta as an essential knowing separate from all skhandas. Therefore it is not the understanding of One Mind, and not the understanding of the empty nature and the inseparability of presence and conditions.</p>
              <p>A quote from one of the Ajahns...</p>
              <p><em>OF FOREMOST IMPORTANCE IS THE CITTA, the mind’s essential knowing<br>nature. It consists of pure and simple awareness: the citta simply<br>knows. Awareness of good and evil, and the critical judgements<br>that result, are merely activities of the citta. At times, these activities<br>may manifest as mindfulness; at other times, wisdom. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But the<br>true citta does not exhibit any activities or manifest any conditions<br>at all. It only knows.</strong></span> Those activities that arise in the citta, such as<br>awareness of good and evil, or happiness and suffering, or praise<br>and blame, are all conditions of the consciousness that flows out<br>from the citta. Since it represents activities and conditions of the<br>citta that are, by their very nature, constantly arising and ceasing,<br>this sort of consciousness is always unstable and unreliable.</em></p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p><em>The citta forms the very foundation of saÿsãra; it is the essence<br>of being that wanders from birth to birth. It is the instigator of the<br>cycle of existence and the prime mover in the round of repeated<br>birth and death. Saÿsãra is said to be a cycle because death and<br>rebirth recur regularly according to the immutable law of kamma.<br>The citta is governed by kamma, so it is obliged to revolve perpetually<br>in this cycle following kamma’s dictates. As long as the citta<br>remains under the jurisdiction of kamma, this will always be the<br>case. The citta of the Arahant is the sole exception, for his citta<br>has completely transcended kamma’s domain. Since he has also<br>transcended all conventional connections, not a single aspect of<br>relative, conventional reality can possibly become involved with<br>the Arahant’s citta. At the level of Arahant, the citta has absolutely<br>no involvement with anything.</em></p>

The citta is conditioned by<br>anicca, dukkha, and anattã only because things that are subject to<br>these laws come spinning in to become involved with the citta and<br>so cause it to spin along with them. However, though it spins in<br>unison with conditioned phenomena, the citta never disintegrates<br>or falls apart.

              <p>They become demons only when you objectify them and make them an object of attachment. Actually they [projection of externality/objectivity] are all mentally created illusions. In reality, all is (One) Mind. Scenery, bird chirping, touching the keyboard, even suffering, all is It. When bird chirps, there is no I and no bird, only chirping. The world seen as it is, as One Mind, is itself Nirvana. 'Demons' only arise in duality.</p>
              <p>When we discriminate, perceive and objectify what we experience into 'things' separate from ourselves ('Self'). This is the subject/object dichotomy/duality. If duality is true, there cannot be only One Mind. But all along, there is no duality, there is only One Mind.</p>

              <p>25. The term unity refers to a homogeneous spiritual brilliance which separates into six harmoniously blended 'elements'. The homogeneous spiritual brilliance is the One Mind, while the six harmoniously blended 'elements' are the six sense organs. These six sense organs beome severally united with objects that defile them -- the eyes with form, the ear with sound, the nose with smell, the tongue with taste, the body with touch, and the thinking mind with entities. Between these organs and their objects arise the six sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If you understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence, you will bind the six harmoniously blended 'elements' into a single spiritual brilliance -- a single spiritual brilliance which is the One Mind.</strong></span> All students of the way know this, but they cannot avoid forming concepts of 'a single spiritual brilliance' and 'the six harmoniously blended elements'. Accordingly they are chained to entities and fail to achieve a tacit understanding of original Mind.</p>

              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">A. Mind in Terms of the Absolute</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality (dharmadhatu) and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality. That which is called "the essential nature of the Mind" is unborn and is imperishable. It is only through illusions that all things come to be differentiated. If one is freed from illusions, then to him there will be no appearances (lakshana) of objects regarded as absolutely independent existences; therefore all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization, description, and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis, undifferentiated, free from alteration, and indestructible. They are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable of denoting Suchness. The term Suchness likewise has no attributes which can be verbally specified. The term Suchness is, so to speak, the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to words. But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to, for all things in their Absolute aspect are real; nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; hence the name Suchness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">Question: If such is the meaning of the principle of Mahayana, how is it possible for men to conform themselves to and enter into it?</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">Answer: If they understand that, concerning all things, though they are spoken of, there is neither that which speaks, nor that which can be spoken of, and though they are thought of, there is neither that which thinks, nor that which can be thought of, then they are said to have conformed to it. And when they are freed from their thoughts, they are said to have entered into it. Next, Suchness has two aspects if predicated in words. One is that it is truly empty (sunya), for this aspect can, in the final sense, reveal what is real. The other is that it is truly nonempty (a-sunya), for its essence itself is endowed with undefiled and excellent qualities.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">1. Truly Empty</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">Suchness is empty because from the beginning it has never been related to any defiled states of existence, it is free from all marks of individual distinction of things, and it has nothing to do with thoughts conceived by a deluded mind. It should be understood that the essential nature of Suchness is neither with marks nor without marks; neither not with marks nor not without marks; nor is it both with and without marks simultaneously; it is neither with a single mark nor with different marks; neither not with a single mark nor not with different marks; nor is it both with a single and with different marks simultaneously. In short, since all unenlightened men discriminate with their deluded minds from moment to moment, they are alienated from Suchness; hence, the definition "empty"; but once they are free from their deluded minds, they will find that there is nothing to be negated.</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">2. Truly Nonempty</span></p>
              <p><span style="COLOR: #111111; FONT-FAMILY: verdana,arial,helvetica">Since it has been made clear that the essence of all things is empty, i.e., devoid of illusions, the true Mind is eternal, permanent, immutable, pure, and self-sufficient; therefore, it is called "nonempty". And also there is no trace of particular marks to be noted in it, as it is the sphere that transcends thoughts and is in harmony with enlightenment alone.</span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mentioned this "luminosity" and "Presence".Are they eternal?Could this be what he is trying to expound?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Sometimes the word 'permanent' or 'eternal' is used, but it is a very very confusing term. There must be the correct understanding. But Presence is abiding, unmoving. But this abiding/unmoving is not in separation from change and impermanence, and IS Impermanence. Without the understanding of non-duality, it can very easily become the view of the Eternalist, such as those who experienced the pure I AMness.</p>
              <p>As our moderator Thusness said, and I posted (with slight editing) in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html</a> ,</p>

In Buddhism, there is no eternality, only timeless continuity (timeless as in vividness in present moment but change and continue like a wave pattern).

              <p><br><span style="font-family: arial;"><em>Thoughts, feelings and perceptions come and go; they are not ‘me’; they are transient in nature. Isn’t it clear that if I am aware of these passing thoughts, feelings and perceptions, then it proves some entity is immutable and unchanging?

It gives rise to the insight that isness never exists in an undifferentiated state but as transient manifestation; each moment of manifestation is an entirely new reality, complete in its own.</span></em></p>

The witness/watcher is really not separated from the rest of the world .

              <p><span style="COLOR: #000000; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">During deep meditative states, an all-pervading Presence is detectable.

              <p>So what causes the impression of the Witness?</p>
              <p>From deep meditative observation, the witness is realised to be just an impression that is caused by subtle knowingness and sequential observation. Moment to moment arises in lightning fast speed. The second moment got a subtle imprint of the recently preceded one. This sequential change causes the sense of Subtle Witnessing known as the Eternal Witness.</p>
              <p>There is no permanent unchanging Witness, but ever changing moment to moment witnessing. In another word, no permanent 'Eternal Witness' exist.</p>

              <p>BTW there is something equally important as the understanding of our Luminosity. It is the understanding of our Karmic Propensities. It is the reason why we make luminosity into an eternally abiding entity or a Self. As our moderators Thusness and Longchen previously said, it's the working of the imprints and subtle recalling that makes us sink back to the illusion of a permanent background Source, Witness, Self... and thus fail to see that the Appearance is the Source.</p>
              <p>As I wrote in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html</a></p>
              <h3><a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/spell-of-karmic-propensities.html">The Spell of Karmic Propensities</a></h3>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: arial;">The following article is a summary (by me) of some of the conversations Thusness had with me on the topic of Karmic Propensities/Karmic Momentum/Deep Conditionings and how it blinds us and completely affects the way we see phenomena.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Karmic Propensities is what blinded us from seeing the ultimate reality. Our entire mind is affected by karmic propensities such that our entire system of enquiry, even when we want to inquire on reality, we cannot know beyond "Who", "When", "What", "Where". Our mind is always thinking dualistically, in terms of subject and object (an I and a Not-I/an Observer apart from the Object of Observation, which cannot be found in reality). It is a momentum that cannot be located, yet it can be directly felt and experienced, and the momentum arises every moment and affect the entire way we see things. When we are affected by momentum the mind cannot know the ultimate reality (Emptiness).</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">Because our momentum is at work, we will always assume a subject-object duality. That is, there is a Self, an Agent, and observer, doer, thinker of thoughts. A self that persists in time in a connected way... experiencing things... It blinds us into seeing self and objective world as 'entities', as 'things' with inherent existence, as a separate and permanent 'me'.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">So when momentum is in action, we cannot help but react with our karmic patterns. If we were to ask, "If you lost your shoe, are you still you?" or "If you lost your hands, do you still exist?". It almost seems certain to say "Yes, of course I am still I." because we always assumed there is a truly existing "Self" experiencing changes. This momentum can continue even after experiences of transcendental Presence, and distorting the experience.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">Dharma Dan calls the karmic propensities of seeing subject/object division, or a separate Agent that is the observer, the "fundamental knot of perception". (See: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/07/non-duality-models-of-enlightenment-by.html">The Non-Duality Models of Enlightenment by Dharma Dan</a>)</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">Because it is our habit energy that made us think that way, we are so used to thinking in terms of subject object duality that it has become so deeply part of us, deeply imprinted into our consciousness.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">If we were to eliminate this bond, then we can begin to realise, there is no "Self". In reality, there is only Self1, Self2, Self3, moment to moment our mental and karmic factors arise spontaneously but not in a connected way. We are not a permanent self, we are momentary selves and nothing stays, everything is ever flowing. (Also see <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2008/01/what-is-self.html">What is Self?</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.springwatercenter.org/teachers/packer/articles/whatisme/">What Is The "Me"?</a>)</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">Without seeing things as 'entities', we can begin to realise the nature of Dependent Co-Arising, Conditionality, Interdependence, etc, i.e Emptiness. The nature is always so, but our karmic propensities obscure us from seeing the truth, distorting the way we see things, enquire things, and perceive things. It is this bond that bonds us life after life in Samsara.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">To eliminate the bond we have to feel it, feel the power of the bond, experience it. To eliminate the bond is a matter of insights, the insight into our true nature, the insight into self-liberation, etc. Not only must we eliminate the bond, we must be able to see how "Propensities" blinds us, and that is through naked awareness.</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">How can naked awareness lead to the insight of our "Propensities"?</p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">Space, time, life, death, in and out are all ‘deeply held’ impressions. We are seldom aware of the “deeply held” until we are able to rest adequately in naked awareness. The nakedness creates the big contrast that provides us the condition for the arising of the insight of the 'deeply held'. The insight into the full power of our ‘propensities’ and resting in naked awareness are both equally crucial in our understanding of our non-dual (no subject-object duality, no separate permanently existing self) and non-local (emptiness of locality) nature.<span><br></span></p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: arial;">To consciousness 'propensities' (deep conditioning or imprints) are all that matters. It is the only 'force' that blinds, bonds and prevents a liberating experience. Once formed it remains latent and only surface when conditions are riped for fruition. We are unable to get rid of it by will. Therefore to know consciousness, it is also to know the impact of deep conditioning, how it is formed and how it subsides. There is really no 'why', it is just how consciousness works.<br><br>If we drop our body, we experience astral body.<br>If we drop our thoughts, we experience “I AM”.<br>If we drop ‘I’, we experience non-duality.<br><br>Every major dropping results in a totally new experiential reality. Perhaps that is why Lao Tze teaches us to eliminate until none to experience Tao.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial;">To drop the bondage/deep conditionings, the mind MUST realise that another way of 'knowing' is possible; an effortless, total sensing and experience of wholeness. Next the experiences of the joy, bliss and clarity of wholeness. Without the insight into the possiblity and the experience of the positive factors, the mind will not release itself from holding.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Even open pure and innocent inquiry is a deep conditioning. Makes the mind chatters incessantly. Every what, when, where and why by itself is a distancing from start. Freeing itself from such mode of inquiry aka 'knowing', the mind rests. The joy of this resting must be experienced for the 'willingness' to arise. :)<br><br>P.S. there are different types of meditative bliss/joy/rapture.<br></span><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Like samatha meditation, each jhana state represents a stage of bliss associated with certain level of concentration; the bliss experienced from insight into our nature differs.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">The happiness and pleasure experience by a dualistic mind is different from that experienced by a practitioner. “I AMness” is a higher form of happiness as compared to a dualistic mind that continuously chatters. It is a level of bliss associated with a state of ‘transcendence’ – a state of bliss resulting from the experience of “formlessness, odorless, colorless, attributeless and thoughtlessness’.<br><br></span></p>
              <div style="font-family: arial;">No-self or non-dual is higher form of bliss resulted from the direct experience of Oneness and no-separation. It is related to the dropping of the ‘I’. When non-dual is free from perceptions, that bliss is a form transcendence-oneness. It is what Thusness called transparency of non-duality.</div>
