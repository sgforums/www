              <p>Pardon my following words...we should not even give critics to anyone...look at the mirror..how well are we.....as we have not explore enough facts like the aurthor..or we have been blind by perception...cultivation also voice down not to give critics...even it is very very wrong...he might has his points..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As tibetan ..i am not sure if you said debating...i find that you might only see or hear some of it...we must truly into the door of tibetan practise then we can justified..though i learned Mi Fa from a shifu...at times also has some debating topics..because i practise pureland and CHAN..so there is some spark at times..but must learn how to accept and think about the reasoning..and not immediately come to assumption that "I' am always right...there is no right or wrong...as again both are same entity at the first place...</p>

              <p>yes ,i think most of the english buddhism sutra translate from the chinese text,not the oringinal text,which is written inæ¢µæ–‡,which difficult for ppl to understand ,among all the world ,i think there r not many who can interprete it ,in china only the maste å­£ç¾¡æž—,and his discples,in fact the the chinese r quite different from english written text,it think chinese is more literal ,and english easier to catch the meaning. In fact someone claim that learning chinese by reading sutras,good luck for u</p>

              <p>I composed one very long comment just now,clicked on"Save Reply",but it did not appear.</p>
              <p> Reply to AEN's"Can you pls elaborate what the mulling is about",it seems that Mr.Xiao stresses on</p>
              <p>"realising,or attaining the 8th consciousness",what he calls"zheng ru lai zang."All other things other than this Alaya consciousness,it seems,arise dependently.</p>
              <p>   Hence,what he is trying to say?The Alaya consciousness does not arise dependently?He further asserts that"realising or attaining the 8th consciousness" is of paramount importance,what all Buddhas want us to do.</p>
              <p>  So,what he strives to do is help us "zheng ru lai zang" through his written works and his practices.</p>
              <p>   Hmmmmm..........I'm still reading his works as he is able to cite canonical texts such as the Avatamsaka Suta to support his assertions..........</p>

              <p>Hi Uncreated,</p>
              <p>The Alaya-consciousness is being attributed as the Tathagathagarbha. [Dharmakaya with defilements. After Buddhahood is attained, Tathagathagarbha transforms into Dharmakaya.]</p>
              <p>However first of all we have to have a proper understanding of the Tathagathagarbha. Tathagathagarbha cannot be understood apart from Emptiness [dependent origination] otherwise it will only end up with the eternalistic understanding, no different from the Hindus who sees atman as identical to an all-pervasive Brahman.</p>
              <p>In Buddhism there is no independent atman, or an all-pervasive atman, or any sort of essence at all, while without denying our luminous nature. Luminosity and emptiness is inseparable, luminosity cannot be separated from conditions. The problem is if we treat Alaya as a REAL background substance behind phenomena, it becomes eternalistic and dualistic. By positing luminosity as a formless uncreated substance, one will fail to see their inseparability [of luminosity and form], and one will fail to see that consciousness is inseparable from conditions, and empty.</p>
              <p>For example, the Dark Zen unorthodox school mistaken Buddha Nature as the Hindu sort of atman, which is really unfortunate. Those proponents have a very convincing experience of the I AM and refuse to look into its true nature, thinking they understood, and worse, distorting the true meanings of the scriptures.</p>
              <p>Let me quote some from Loppon Namdrol, who in my and moderator Thusness's opinion, is a truly experienced/enlightened and knowledgeable practitioner/teacher.</p>
              <p>----------------<br><br>Were the Buddha to teach such a doctrine, it might be so. However, in the Nirvana sutra is states quite plainly the following:<br><br><em>That
                                                          is called ‘Buddha-nature’ because all sentient beings are to be
                                                          unsurpassedly, perfectly, completely enlightened at a future time.
                                                          Because afflictions exist in all sentient beings at present, because of
                                                          that, the thirty two perfect marks and the eighty excellent exemplary
                                                          signs do not exist”. </em><br><br>Here, the Nirvana sutra clearly and
                                                          precisely states that buddha-svabhaava, the "nature of a Buddha" refers
                                                          not to an actual nature but a potential. Why, it continues:<br><br><em>"Child of the lineage, I have said that ‘curd exists in milk’, because curd is produced from milk, it is called ‘curd’. <br><br>Child
                                                          of lineage, at the time of milk, there is no curd, also there is no
                                                          butter, ghee or ma.n.da, because the curd arises from milk with the
                                                          conditions of heat, impurities, etc., milk is said to have the
                                                          ‘curd-nature’." </em><br><br>So one must be quite careful not to make
                                                          an error. The Lanka states unequivocably that the tathagatagarbha
                                                          doctrine is merely a device to lead those who grasp at a true self the
                                                          inner meaning of the Dharma, non-arising, the two selflessnesses and so
                                                          on, and explains the meaning of the literal examples some people
                                                          constantly err about:<br><br><em>"Similarly, that tathaagatagarbha
                                                          taught in the suutras spoken by the Bhagavan, since the completely pure
                                                          luminous clear nature is completely pure from the beginning, possessing

                                                          of sentient beings.<br> <br>When the Bhagavan described that– like an

                                                          becoming impure by the conceptuality of the thorough conceptuality
                                                          suppressed by the passion, anger and ignorance – as permanent, stable
                                                          and eternal, how is the Bhagavan’s teaching this as the
                                                          tathaagatagarbha is not similar with as the assertion of self of the

                                                          for example, a potter, makes one mass of atoms of clay into various

                                                          similarly, although Tathaagatas avoid the nature of conceptual
                                                          selflessness in dharmas, they also appropriately demonstrate

                                                          they demonstrate with various enumerations of words and letters. As
                                                          such, because of that, <br><br>Mahaamati, the demonstration of Tathaagatagarbha is not similar with the Self demonstrated by the non-Buddhists. <br><br>Mahaamati,
                                                          the Tathaagatas as such, in order to guide those grasping to assertions
                                                          of the Self of the Non-Buddhists, will demonstrate tathaagatagarbha
                                                          with the demonstration of tathaagatagarbha. How else will the sentient
                                                          beings who have fallen into a conceptual view of a True Self, possess

                                                          one must, since it is identified as such other sutras state:<br><br><em>"`Saariputra, the element of sentient beings denotes the word tathaagatagarbha. <br>`Saariputra, that word ‘tathaagatagarbha’ denotes Dharmakaaya.</em><br><br>And:<br><br><em>`Saariputra,

                                                          somehow imagine that something conditioned somehow becomes conditioned.

                                                          is called ‘tathaagatagarbha’.</em><br><br>So, one must understand that
                                                          these sutras are provisional and definitive, each giving different
                                                          accounts of the tathaagatagarbha for different students, but they are
                                                          not defintive. Understood improperly, they lead one into a non-Buddhist
                                                          extremes. Understood and explained properly, they lead those afraid of

              a river flowing into the ocean, the self dissolves into nothingness.
              When a practitioner becomes thoroughly clear about the illusionary
              nature of the individuality, subject-object division does not take
              place. A person experiencing “AMness” will find “AMness in everything”.
              What is it like?<br><br>Being freed from individuality -- coming and
              going, life and death, all phenomenon merely pop in and out from the
              background of the AMness. The AMness is not experienced as an ‘entity’
              residing anywhere, neither within nor without; rather it is experienced
              as the ground reality for all phenomenon to take place. Even the moment
              of subsiding (death), the yogi is thoroughly authenticated with that
              reality; experiencing the ‘Real’ as clear as it can be. We cannot lose
              that AMness; rather all things can only dissolve and re-emerges from
              it. The AMness has not moved, there is no coming and going.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Practitioners should never mistaken this as the true Buddha Mind! </span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">"I
              AMness" is the pristine awareness. That is why it is so overwhelming.
              Just that there is no 'insight' into its emptiness nature. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><strong>Nothing stays and nothing to hold on to. What is real, is pristine and flows, what stays is illusion. </strong></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">The sinking back to a background or Source is due to being blinded by strong karmic propensities of a 'Self'. </span><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">It
              is a layer of ‘bond’ that prevents us from ‘seeing’ something…it is
              very subtle, very thin, very fine…it goes almost undetected. What this
              ‘bond’ does is it prevents us from ‘seeing’ what “WITNESS” really is
              and <strong>makes us constantly fall back to the Witness, to the Source, to the Center </strong>.
              Every moment we want to sink back to Witness, to the Center, to this
              Beingness, this is an illusion. It is habitual and almost hypnotic.<br><br>But what exactly is this “witness” we are talking about? It is the <strong>manifestation </strong>itself! It is the <strong>appearance </strong>itself! There is no Source to fall back, <strong>the Appearance is the Source! </strong>Including the moment to moment of thoughts. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The problem is we choose, but all is really it.</span> There is nothing to choose. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br></span></span><strong style="font-family: arial;"><br> There is no mirror reflecting<br> Manifestation alone IS.<br></strong><br><span style="font-family: arial;"> There is no invisible witness hiding anywhere. Whenever we attempt to
              fall back to an invisible transparent image, it is again the mind game
              of thought. It is the ‘bond’ at work. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="color: #000000;">See <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">Thusness's Six Stages of Experience</a>.</span><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><br>Very
              often it is understood that beingness is in the experience of "I AM",
              even without the words and label of "I AM", the 'pure sense of
              existence', the presence still IS. It is a state of resting in
              Beingness. <span style="font-weight: bold;">But in Buddhism, it is also possible to experience everything, every moment the unmanifested.</span><br><br>The
              key also lies in 'You' but it is to "see" that there is no 'You'
              instead. It is to 'see' that there is never any do-er standing in the
              midst of phenomenal arising. There is just mere happening due to
              emptiness nature, never an 'I' doing anything. When the 'I' subsides,
              symbols, labels and the entire layer of conceptual realm goes with it.
              What is left without a 'doer' is a mere happening.<br><br>And seeing,
              hearing, feeling, tasting and smelling and not only that, everything
              appears as purely spontaneous manifestation. A whole Presence of the
              manifold.</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">Since
              appearance is all there is and appearance is really the source, what
              gives rise to the diversities of appearances? “Sweetness” of sugar
              isn’t the “blueness” color of the sky. Same applies to “AMness”… all
              are equally pure, no one state is purer than the other, only condition
              differs. Conditions are factors that give appearances their ‘forms’. In
              Buddhism, pristine awareness and conditions are inseparable. </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">Although
              there is non-duality in Advaita Vedanta, and no-self in Buddhism,
              Advaita Vedanta rest in an “Ultimate Background” (making it dualistic),
              whereas Buddhism eliminates the background completely and rest in the
              emptiness nature of phenomena; arising and ceasing is where pristine
              awareness is. In Buddhism, there is no eternality, only timeless
              continuity (timeless as in vividness in present moment but change and
              continue like a wave pattern). There is no changing thing, only change.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial;">The
              mind likes to categorize and is quick to identify. When we think that
              awareness is permanent, we fail to 'see' the impermanence aspect of it.
              When we see it as formless, we missed the vividness of the fabric and
              texture of awareness as forms. When we are attached to ocean, we seek a
              waveless ocean, not knowing that both ocean and wave are one and the
              same. Manifestations are not dust on the mirror, the dust is the
              mirror. All along there is no dust, it becomes dust when we identify
              with a particular speck and the rest becomes dust.<br><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;">Unmanifested is the manifestation,<br>The no-thing of everything,<br>Completely still yet ever flowing,<br>This is the spontaneous arising nature of the source.<br>Simply Self-So.<br>Use self-so to overcome conceptualization.<br>Dwell completely into the incredible realness of the phenomenal world.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">-------------- </span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">Update: 15/5/2008</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">An elaboration on Emptiness:</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Like
              a red flower that is so vivid, clear and right in front of an observer,
              the “redness” only appears to “belong” to the flower, it is in
              actuality not so. Vision of red does not arise in all animal species
              (dogs cannot perceive colours) nor is the “redness” an attribute of the
              mind. If given a “quantum eyesight” to look into the atomic structure,
              there is similarly no attribute “redness” anywhere found, only almost
              complete space/void with no perceivable shapes and forms. Whatever
              appearances are dependently arisen, and hence is empty of any inherent
              existence or fixed attributes, shapes, form, or “redness” -- merely
              luminous yet empty, mere Appearances without inherent/objective
              existence. What gives rise to the differences of colours and
              experiences in each of us? Dependent arising... hence empty of inherent
              existence. This is the nature of all phenomena.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">As you've seen, there is no ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">'The Flowerness'</span>’
              seen by a dog, an insect or us, or beings from other realms (which
              really may have a completely different mode of perception). ‘<span style="font-style: italic;">'The Flowerness'</span> is an illusion that does not stay even for a moment, merely an
              aggregate of causes and conditions. Analogous to the example of
              ‘flowerness’, there is no ‘selfness’ serving as a background witnessing
              either -- pristine awareness is not the witnessing background. Rather,
              the entire whole of the moment of manifestation is our pristine
              awareness; lucidly clear, yet empty of inherent existence. This the way
              of ‘seeing’ the one as many, the observer and the observed are one and
              the same. This is also the meaning of formlessness and attribute-less
              of our nature.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Because
              the karmic propensity of perceiving subject/object duality is so
              strong, pristine awareness is quickly attributed to 'I', Atman, the
              ultimate Subject, Witness, background, eternal, formless, odorless,
              colorless, thoughtless and void of any attributes, and we unknowingly
              objectified these attributes into an ‘entity’ and make it an eternal
              background or an emptiness void. When this is done, it prevents us from
              experiencing the color, texture, fabric and manifesting nature of
              awareness. Suddenly thoughts are being grouped into another category
              and disowned. In actual case, thoughts think and sound hears. The
              observer has always been the observed. </span><span style="font-family: arial;">No watcher needed, the process itself knows and rolls as Venerable Buddhaghosa writes in the Visuddhi Magga.<br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial;">In
              naked awareness, there is no splitting of attributes and
              objectification of these attributes into different groups of the same
              experience. So thoughts and sense perceptions are not disowned and
              “impermanence nature” taken in wholeheartedly in the experience of
              no-self. ‘Impermanence’ is never what it seems to be, never what that
              is understood in conceptual thoughts. ‘Impermanence’ is not what the
              mind has conceptualized it to be. In non-dual experience, the true face
              of impermanence nature is experienced as happening without movement,
              change without going anywhere. This is the <span style="font-style: italic;">“what is” </span>of impermanence. It is just so.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: arial;">Zen Master Dogen: "Impermanence is Buddha-Nature."</span><br><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(The above are paraphrasing my friend, Thusness's words with a little editing.)<br><br>------------------</span><span><br><br>The following from another forummer posting at another forum:<br><a style="font-family: arial;" href="http://now-for-you.com/viewtopic.php?p=34809&amp;highlight=#34809"><br>http://now-for-you.com/viewtopic.php?p=34809&amp;highlight=#34809</a><br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: arial;">As
              I walked away from the computer, into the kitchen, and then the
              bathroom, I noticed that I can't make a distinction between the air out
              here, and me or the air and the sink. Where does one end and the other
              begin? I'm not being silly here. No, I'm saying, do you see the
              interplay. How could one be without the other? </span><br> <br><span style="font-family: arial;"> I'm taking air into my lungs right now, and noticing the interplay.
              This keyboard is just at the end of my fingertips, like an extension of
              me. My mind says "No, that is a keyboard, and these are your fingers.
              Very different things, " but the awareness doesn't make that
              distinction so cut and dry. Sure, there is a seeing that my fingers
              look this way, and the keyboard looks different. But again, the
              interplay. </span><br> <br><span style="font-family: arial;">Why does
              the mind make such a distinction between silence and sound. Are we sure
              these are separate? I just said "yes" into the air. I noticed that
              there was silence, then the word came into the air, then silence again.
              These two "things" are married aren't they. How can one be without the
              other? And so are they separate? Sure, the mind says "yes" they are
              separate. It might even say something the teachers have said which is
              "you are awareness." But am I? What about these words, what about this
              desk. Is that awareness? Where is the distinction. </span><br> <br><span style="font-family: arial;"> We make this stuff up as we go don't we? Whatever we want to believe.
              "it's all one." "I am awareness." "Jesus Christ is my savior." "Peanut
              butter and jelly is gross." I'm being silly now. But how would I know
              if these things are separate, form and formlessness if I don't look
              here now, at this relationship, at how they interact. Again, this feels
              like an open question. I could say "it's all One" or whatever as I said
              above and miss the chance to look again at this interplay, and see how
              my fingers, the keyboard, the air, the space in front of the screen,
              and the screen play together.</span><span style="font-family: arial; font-size: 100%;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><br></span></span></span></p>

              <p>I think this passage summarises very nicely.</p>
              <p>The problem with the I AM experience is that it makes a person
                                          assume that there is a part of him/her (that is beyond the
                                          personality) that will go on forever. And more often then not,
                                          either this "I AM" or the alaya is mistaken as a permanent
                                          soul.</p>
              <p>However, to a person who experiences non-duality (and
                                          emptiness), he understands that 'this is it!' and there is nothing
                                          beyond this. There is no self-existing soul that is apart from the
                                          personality. All are just changes according to the condition at
                                          that precise moment. To a non-dual person, there is no preference
                                          towards an assumed permanent part that is beyond the thoughts and
                                          personality. It is non-dual (not two), there is no seeing in terms
                                          of separate parts. That also means, there is no seeing 'any body'
                                          as a person out there. All are just perceptions and the amazing
                                          power of cognition discriminates and see many things, persons and
                                          object outside of the self.</p>
              <p>This truth of no-self and non-separation may sound very scary or
                                          disturbing to a person who only understand it mentally or
                                          conceptually. But the actual experience is not so. To the non-dual
                                          person, permanent or impermanence, things and objects are just
                                          concepts... if one don't get bothered by it... it is not an issue

              <p>The following paragraph sent to me by a forummer, written by Mr. Xiao Pingshi clearly shows that his understanding and experience is clearly of the formless, Permanent I AM level.</p>

              <p>Here's what Zen Master Huang Po said:</p>
              <p>25. The term unity refers to a homogeneous spiritual brilliance which separates into six harmoniously blended 'elements'. The homogeneous spiritual brilliance is the One Mind, while the six harmoniously blended 'elements' are the six sense organs. These six sense organs beome severally united with objects that defile them -- the eyes with form, the ear with sound, the nose with smell, the tongue with taste, the body with touch, and the thinking mind with entities. Between these organs and their objects arise the six sensory perceptions, making eighteen sense-realms in all. If you understand that these eighteen realms have no objective existence, you will bind the six harmoniously blended 'elements' into a single spiritual brilliance -- a single spiritual brilliance which is the One Mind. All students of the way know this, but they cannot avoid forming concepts of 'a single spiritual brilliance' and 'the six harmoniously blended elements'. Accordingly they are chained to entities and fail to achieve a tacit understanding of original Mind.</p>

              <p>What Zen Master Huang Po said is clearly explaining that all dependently arisen phenomena are empty of inherent existence and objective reality, are all only One Mind.</p>
              <p>Thusness: ...This is also the understanding of why Everything is the One Reality
                                              incorporating causes, conditions and luminosity of our Empty nature as
                                              One and inseparable. <strong>Everything as the One Reality should
                                              never be understood from a dualistic/inherent standpoint...</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But Mr. Xiao Pingshi's understanding is that beyond phenomena there is an underlying unchanging substance. He sees a duality here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can see now that Mr. Xiao Pingshi has a tendency of distorting and misunderstanding the scriptures and then attacking the true masters due to his ignorance. Just like the <em>Dark Zen fools</em>.</p>
              <p>Fools who misunderstood the teachings, and on account of this wrong understanding, attack others, misrepresent buddha-dharma, and destroy himself and accumulate much demerits.</p>
              <p>There's so much he has distorted that I'm not going to waste my effort correcting them. Just given this as an example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddha to Sati:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Foolish man, to whom do you know me having taught the Dhamma
                                                                      like this. Haven’t I taught, in various ways that consciousness is
                                                                      dependently arisen. Without a cause, there is no arising of
                                                                      consciousness. Yet you, foolish man, on account of your wrong view,
                                                                      you misrepresent me, as well as destroy yourself and accumulate
                                                                      much demerit, for which you will suffer for a long time."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, what do
                                                      you think, has this this bhikkhu Sati, son of a fisherman, learned
                                                      anything from this dispensation?" "No, venerable sir."</p>
