              <p>Hi Uncreated, the traditional Chinese is giving me a headache... I come from a generation that isn't used to traditional chinese... (i'm 18 right now) so I have some problems with that.</p>
              <p>Regarding Mr Xiao Pingshi's criticism of the master in the article, I really don't know the master and don't know the teachings, so I cannot make any comments at all... it could be entirely possible that Mr Xiao Pingshi completely mistaken the master's teachings.</p>
              <p>You know, there are a couple of understandings of Alaya Consciousness... even among the sutras... so by seeing this we can know that the teachings are expedient means and is spoken <strong>depending on the audience's level of understanding</strong>, to take one view as right and another wrong is to miss the essence.</p>
              <p>But, when he said that the master holds an eternalist view of the Mind... it reminds me that a few famous Ajahns in the Thai Forest Tradition also holds an eternalist view of the Mind. Please understand that I'm not refering to the master that Mr. Xiao Pingshi is talking about, it's a completely different thing I just remembered.</p>
              <p>These Ajahns have certain meditative experience of the <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">pure I AMness</a>, and mistaken Mind as the Upanishadic [hindu scriptures] understanding of the Atman... holding a subtle eternalist view. They see it that Citta is an unborn and undying entity that experiences reincarnation, it's like the view of an Eternal Witness... It is very subtle... there is a moderator, a Theravada monk, in E-Sangha who is criticising these masters' teachings. He also compared with the Upanishads and provided quotes from the Suttas to support his statements and the Buddhist view of the matter.</p>
              <p>Of course it received lots of counter-attacks and unhappiness... but the monk has his points... btw the Ajahns in question are very very famous... I actually read their teachings and find them to be quite good (apart from the problem I mentioned).</p>
              <p>The thing about the forest tradition is that they overemphasized the personal experience of the master over the scriptures teachings... so they emphasize more on the master's authority as an enlightened being, but the sutras contains many teachings that helps clarify the subtleties of our nature that will be missed and misunderstood without a grasp of the teachings.</p>
              <p><strong>Update: Please understand I am making an over-generalized statement about the Thai Forest Tradition and have no intention of criticizing it as a whole... the tradition has come out with many highly-enlightened meditators and practitioners.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Also, there is a recent development in the Thai Forest Tradition that sees the importance of understanding Buddha's teachings as well (and I mean </strong><strong>reading and understanding </strong><strong>the teachings of the Suttas...)<br></strong></p>

              <p>Now mulling over his"zheng ru lai zang" and his comments on the</p>
              <p>differences between "jie tuo dao" and "pu ti dao".</p>
              <p>There seems to be a great deal of animosity in other forums</p>
              <p>when it comes to him,especially after he he appeared to</p>
              <p>"attack" Venearable Yin Shun.Is he really "attacking" him?</p>
              <p>We should not get so easily agitated over seemingly pseudo-</p>
              <p>Buddhist matters,but read them calmly and objectively,then</p>
              <p>refute them(if they are erroneous)with evidence from the Canon.</p>
              <p>No attacks on the person,but critical assessment on his/her views.</p>

              <p><br>What is 'zheng ru lai zhang'? What is ' jie tuo dao' ? What is 'pu ti tao'?</p>
              <p>Except the rare few, most of us don't really understand. So we are in actual fact can't really differentiate what is right or wrong, or which is of higher level than the other, or who is more versed in Dharma etc. We must admit this point before we can go any futher. As for Mr Xiao, no comments.</p>
              <p>I think we must not forget to always go back to the right track ie. The Four Noble Truths, The Eight Fold Paths, then practise, pratise, and practise. When we have diligently practised the path, we will reach the stage where we don't even have to come to this point of assessing Mr Xiao comments or works anymore. So in this regard i agree with Display Name, ie there are so many orthodox dharma books around, start from there. Time is precious.</p>
              <p> This is indeed Dharma Ending age, there are many theories, comments, arguments, challenges whatsoever everywhere you turn. How many are right views? How much can we digest? How wise are we to have proper discernment? Once we admit that we are no good in any, then we can improve as we will be careful...and we will remind ourselves to stick to the the path, then practise, practise, and practise.</p>

              <p>Good advise!</p>
              <p>Dharma is not found in debating, in words, or in concepts.</p>
              <p>Rest fully and mindful and see for yourself... dharma is exhibited in every moment.</p>
