              <p>...<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><em><strong>v.</strong></em> If we happen to pass by an abattoir, a place where pigs, 
                    cows or other animals are slaughtered, and since we understand that the 
                    effect of the karma of killing is rebirth in the realm of hell, and we make 
                    a verbal comment to that effect, is it appropriate? While we do not know 
                    whether the person who is committing the killing will be reborn in hell, 
                    <strong>but when we speak of hell, we immediately strike a resonance with hell. 
                    Because suffering and darkness prevail in hell, at the mention of the word, 
                    we have already struck an accord with suffering and darkness. If we say 
                    "Amitabha Buddha" instead, then brightness spontaneously illumines 
                    in our mind and the image of the abattoir will not take root in our mind</strong>....</span></p>

              <p>Hi Uncreated,</p>
              <p>May I know what books of Mr Xiao are you reading?</p>
              <p>I am currently reading his ç‹‚å¯†ä¸ŽçœŸå¯† series, however still stuck at book one (of four).</p>
              <p>So far my impression of him from the book is that he brought up academic point views, the contraversial ones of course, in relation to practical cultivation issue.</p>
              <p>I don't remember him claming to be a realised teacher. However, on the preface, one of his students did honour him as a realised teacher. But I see that more from a courteous way in addressing one's teacher and I don't take it literally that Mr Xiao is realised per se.</p>
              <p>In modern times, who's to judge who has realised and who hasn't? Is the person who judge a realised person himself? Then if so, who verifies his realisation then?</p>
              <p>However, we can think for ourselves the interesting and contraversial points that Mr Xiao had brought up and examine on our whether or not do they make sense.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do think that many of the points (so far that I had read) that Mr Xiao had brought up do make sense. I don't agree his points on Ven Yinshun though, that to me is a bit out of context.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I see no harm in reading his materials in fact, any other materials (I read Satanic Bible before, a very cool book) as long as you keep an open mind.</p>
              <p>Surely there must be some issues worth discussing that caused him to write book(s) about it. Not easy to write books you know?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AEN,</p>
              <p>I also came from an era that doesn't use traditional chinese writing. It's up to individual whether or not we going to learn about it. All along, I am not comfortable in writing English, which explain my poor command in it, but what to do?</p>
              <p>If you really need it, you will learn how to adapt to it. =)</p>

              <p>Hi Yamizi, I am not at all against non-mainstream thinking. If you read my first post, I actually agreed with Mr Xiao Pingshi on an important point (which I misunderstood), because it was written in traditional Chinese, and I sort of misunderstood what Mr Xiao Pingshi written.</p>
              <p><br>But as more postings unfold and someone sent me a link to his writings, I could clearly see that its in contradiction in dharma.</p>
              <p>Who cares about mainstream or nonmainstream, Dharma is Dharma, if you see my first post you'll see that I was saying that even some famous Ajahns in Thai Forest Tradition didn't quite get it, and have the same sort of misunderstandings. They are pretty mainstream. They're very famous, and it's not only the ones that the monk criticized. I don't wish to name names. Even Ajahn Brahmavamso, himself from Thai Forest Tradition, admitted this problem.</p>

              <p>I want to add on to Zen Master Huang Po's 'Yi Xin' (One Mind). Even though he is already very clear that One Mind is non-dual [not in opposition to phenomena] and non-inherent, this post will hopefully clarify it further.</p>
              <p>This is from the Awakening of Faith in Mahayana (å¤§ä¹˜èµ·ä¿¡è«–), by Asvaghaso,</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awakening_of_Faith_in_the_Mahayana">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awakening_of_Faith_in_the_Mahayana</a><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Written from the perspective of essence and function (</em><em><a class="new" title="Tiyong (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tiyong&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">tiyong</a>) é«”ç”¨, this text sought to harmonize the two <a title="Soteriology" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soteriology">soteriological</a> <a title="Philosophy" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">philosophies</a> of the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Tathagatagarbha" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathagatagarbha">tathÄ�gatagarbha</a> (or <a class="mw-redirect" title="Buddha nature" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha_nature">Buddha nature</a>) and <a title="Store consciousness" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Store_consciousness">Ä�layavijñÄ�na</a> (or <a title="Yogacara" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogacara">yogacara</a>) into a synthetic vision based on the <strong>One Mind in Two Aspects</strong>.</em></p>
              <p>You can see here that One Mind described here is totally non-dual and non-inherent. It is totally unlike what Mr Xiao Pingshi sees as Mind.</p>
              <p>Even though terms like 'eternal', 'immutable' is used, it has nothing to do with the sort of the dualistic and inherent kind of understandings, or a permanent substance/void background behind phenomena. In a thread discussing on Impermanence and the Tathagathagarbha in 2006, <a href="/forums/1728/topics/184819">http://buddhism.sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/184819</a>, Thusness posted: <em>...There truly exists a reality beyond conceptual fabrication.

              <p>Anyway, below the verse I'm talking about, from Awakening of Faith in Mahayana. Those reading Mr Xiao Pingshi's work will see the difference between his writings and the following explanation.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality (dharmadhatu) 
                                              and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality. That which 
                                              is called "the essential nature of the Mind" is unborn and is imperishable. 
                                              It is only through illusions that all things come to be differentiated. 
                                              If one is freed from illusions, then to him there will be no appearances 
                                              (lakshana) of objects regarded as absolutely independent existences; therefore 
                                              all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization, description, 
                                              and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis, undifferentiated, 
                                              free from alteration, and indestructible. They are only of the One Mind; 
                                              hence the name Suchness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for they 
                                              are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable of denoting 
                                              Suchness. The term Suchness likewise has no attributes which can be verbally 
                                              specified. The term Suchness is, so to speak, the limit of verbalization 
                                              wherein a word is used to put an end to words. But the essence of Suchness 
                                              itself cannot be put an end to, for all things in their Absolute aspect 
                                              are real; nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, 
                                              for all things are equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood 
                                              that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; 
                                              hence the name Suchness. </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">Question: If such is the meaning of the principle of Mahayana, how is 
                                              it possible for men to conform themselves to and enter into it?</span></p>

                                              to it. And when they are freed from their thoughts, they are said to have 
                                              entered into it. Next, Suchness has two aspects if predicated in words. 
                                              One is that it is truly empty (sunya), for this aspect can, in the final 
                                              sense, reveal what is real. The other is that it is truly nonempty (a-sunya), 
                                              for its essence itself is endowed with undefiled and excellent qualities. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">1. Truly Empty </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">Suchness is empty because from the beginning it has never been related 
                                              to any defiled states of existence, it is free from all marks of individual 
                                              distinction of things, and it has nothing to do with thoughts conceived 
                                              by a deluded mind. It should be understood that the essential nature of 
                                              Suchness is neither with marks nor without marks; neither not with marks 
                                              nor not without marks; nor is it both with and without marks simultaneously; 
                                              it is neither with a single mark nor with different marks; neither not 
                                              with a single mark nor not with different marks; nor is it both with a 
                                              single and with different marks simultaneously. In short, since all unenlightened 
                                              men discriminate with their deluded minds from moment to moment, they 
                                              are alienated from Suchness; hence, the definition "empty"; but once they 
                                              are free from their deluded minds, they will find that there is nothing 
                                              to be negated. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">2. Truly Nonempty </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: verdana,arial,helvetica; color: #111111; font-size: normal;">Since it has been made clear that the essence of all things is empty, 
                                              i.e., devoid of illusions, the true Mind is eternal, permanent, immutable, 
                                              pure, and self-sufficient; therefore, it is called "nonempty". And also 
                                              there is no trace of particular marks to be noted in it, as it is the 
                                              sphere that transcends thoughts and is in harmony with enlightenment alone. </span></p>

              <p>Anyone who can't get it usually say they choose to leave one lah, only you yourself know it best whether you belong to this lot or not.</p>
              <p>I'm only curious that, does it mean that everyone has to agree with <em>your </em>belief totally?</p>
              <p>So are <em>you</em> trying to imply that if  I do not agree with Pureland and Vajrayana teachings I cannot discuss in this forum?</p>
              <p>And really, stop diverting away, this thread is about Mr Xiao, probably your inner anger that is built up due to your prejudice against me had blinded your perception on my posts. Since which entry in this thread am I "standing high up on a pedestal to criticise other"?</p>
              <p>When we are discussing on a certain issue, we stick to that, I do not understand why almost everytime when I contribute, you have to bring up that I criticise/disagree with Pureland and Vajrayana.</p>
              <p>Hereby, I like to ask the moderator(s), does me not fullly agreeing with the above two schools render me a lesser right to discuss in this forum? Here it is an obvious issue that anyone with a rationale and calm mind can see for themselves:--</p>
              <p>-we talking about Mr Xiao's issue</p>
              <p>-bohiruci ranting on me for not agreeing with Pureland and Vajrayana</p>
              <p>-what is the relation?</p>
              <p>I think there is little to no relation to the whole issue at all. We are here discussing about the credentials of Mr Xiao. And I just ran through my posts, I did not say I am his hardcore fan/follower. I merely mentioned that it's not exactly bad to read about contraversial issues. And this is what I get from bohiruci.</p>
              <p>Now, back to the question that I post to the moderator(s), if me, being not agree with Pureland and Vajrayana teachings do render me a lesser right to discuss freely, in such a sense that not receiving flaming from the likes of bohiruci, please make it official in your forum. Then people like me, will have the choice to either:-</p>
              <p>a) leave and ignore this forum completely and probably share this little information with other buddhists out there that in order to join this forum, one has to <em>fully</em> agree with bohiruci's "gold" standard.</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>b) have the mental preparation to take the chance of braving the flaming from the likes of bohiruci.</p>
              <p>I would gladly choose option (a) because I have better things to do if it turns out that the moderator(s) intend to have rules like this.</p>
              <p>However, if the moderator(s) believe in respecting individual's take on the Dhamma, such as one need not subscribe to the idea of Pureland and Vajrayana (probably you may be surprised that there are <strong><em>many</em></strong> buddhists who <em>don't believe</em> in Pureland and Vajrayana in the real world out there); and that in the spirit of discussion to agree to disagree, I do hope the moderator(s) should start to take note or take some actions for bohiruci's behaviour.</p>
              <p>I'm an <em>old bird </em>and I know bohiruci in real life, so I know how's he like. However, such behaviour by him, may deter the many other budding or aspiring buddhists to come forth to share and discuss the Dhamma. I do hope that the moderator(s) do take necessary precaution against over-dominating characters.</p>
              <p>Do hope to hear from the moderator(s) soon and soon revert this discussion back on Mr Xiao. </p>
