              Yes.  There is nothing that can arise without necessary supporting conditions and that includes 'nirvana'.  No transcendental 'unconditioned' being or 'state' exists by itself and of itself.  The 'unconditioned' in Buddhism is the spontaneous perfection of all necessary conditions in the natural state.  This is only realized after the direct insights of the 2 fold emptiness. :)

              <p>Wisdom is eternal but changing. To realize that in reality there is only change without experiencer is wisdom, and in the change no trace of self, enlightenment or wisdom remains, and this traceless enlightenment continues forever. But if one says one attains wisdom, one is fabricating something ('attainment', 'wisdom', 'attainer', etc) that cannot be established. No inherent wisdom can be found anywhere. Wisdom is the direct cognition of reality without distortion, which arises dependent on our practice and insights.

              <p><em><span style="font-family: verdana; font-size: normal;">If we analyze both the Hindu 
                                      Sankaràcàrya’s and the Buddhist ÅšÄ�ntaraká¹£ita’s, we find that both agree 
                                      that the view of the Hindu Advaita Vedànta is that the ultimate reality 
                                      (âtmà) is an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition. The Buddhists as a 
                                      whole do not agree that the ultimate reality is an eternal, unchanging 
                                      non-dual cognition, but rather a changing eternal non-dual cognition. 
                                      These statements found in the 6th century Hindu text and the refutations
                                       of the Hindu view found in the 9th century Buddhist texts (both of 
                                      which were after the Uttara Tantra and Asanga), show that the Hindu view
                                       of the ultimate reality as an unchanging, eternal non-dual cognition is
                                       non-existent amongst the Buddhists of India. Not only was such a view 
                                      non-existent amongst Buddhists of India, but it was also refuted as a 
                                      wrong view by scholars like ÅšÄ�ntaraká¹£ita. He even writes that if and 
                                      when Buddhists use the word ‘eternal’ (nitya), it means ‘parinàmi 
                                      nitya’, i.e., changing eternal, and not the Hindu kind of eternal, which
                                       always remains unchanged. </span></em></p>

              <p>Nice article... however, I think he seems to mistaken the I AM/Eternal Witness as enlightenment, and treat non-dual as a passing state.</p>

                          			As we let go of clinging, we feel the tentative

                          traffic.'</em></p>
              <p>This is seeing non-dual as an experience that you can enter and leave, and not as being what is already always so (which requires realization). In actuality, you can never separate yourself from the plum, because there is simply always just the experience 'plum' (or whatever you are experiencing at the moment) without an experiencer.</p>

              <p>Jack Kornfield has some good books and I have looked through them... but in terms of non dual insight, wasn't too impressed.</p>
              <p>Some of the Thai forest masters (and Jack Kornfield follows them quite closely I think, as well as being influenced by Advaita teachers) are also quite dualistic... don't really like to comment too much, but quite a number of the Thai forest tradition teachers have a tendency to cling to the I AM, or reify the non-dual into substantialist non-dualism. There is a monk/moderator in e-sangha who once criticized Thai Forest Tradition for having a tendency to lead towards eternalism, while some other teachers have a tendency to lead towards nihilism. Actually he was quite right but of course came under heavy criticisms from each side of the camp. Of course this doesn't apply to every teacher in the Thai Forest Tradition. But even Ajahn Brahmavamso commented that even high monks (probably referring to his tradition) have a tendency to reify the Poo Roo ('The One Who Knows') as an ultimate self or refuge where in reality even that is a conditional arising without self.</p>

              <p>Questions 'bout self-inquiry and right view - their connections..</p>
              <p>In the case of someone striving hard to awakened/experience to the 'watcher',the 'One Mind' , the view he's having(or must have) at this stage seems *not* to be no-self,on the contrary,he must hold on to the perspective that "consciousness is all there is ". How is it possible the experience(for those haven't got/experience it)of oneness be achieved if one is believing otherwise?It's impossible!</p>
              <p>As Thusness said in   <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html">http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/thusnesss-six-stages-of-experience.html</a>   :</p>
              <p>' when I spoke to a Buddhist friend, he told me about the doctrine of no-self, about no ‘I’. I rejected such doctrine outright as it is in direct contradiction with what I experienced. I was deeply confused for some time and could not appreciate why Buddha has taught this doctrine and worst still make it a Dharma Seal. '</p>
              <p>(In his case,the experience he *already had* was in contradiction with anatta ; my question ,though, concerns those haven't got the experience -)</p>
              <p>Am i right to say that at the beginning stage of inquiry,not only the view of no-self not to be hold on to,one must cling hard to the view of Self ?</p>

              <p>As Thusness puts it: <em>Yes. There is nothing that can arise without necessary supporting

                                      'unconditioned' being or 'state' exists by itself and of itself.
                                      The 'unconditioned' in Buddhism is the spontaneous perfection of
                                      all necessary conditions in the natural state. This is only
                                      realized after the direct insights of the 2 fold emptiness. :)</em></p>
              <p>Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche puts it:</p>

               for Buddhism, the rope stands for interdependent origination 
              (pratityasamutpada) for which it is a good example being itself 
              interdependently arisen from pieces of jute etc., and the snake imputed 
              upon it stands for real existence, which is imposed on the 
              interdependently existing rope appearance. Here it is the rope that is 
              the true mode of existence of Samsara (unlike the snake representing 
              Samsara in Vedanta) and the snake is our ignorance imputing Samsara as 
              really existing instead of experiencing it as interdependently arisen. 
              This interdependence or emptiness is ‘parinami nitya’ i.e. an eternal 
              continuum and this is applicable to all phenomena. Of course, this 
              interdependence is the Conventional Truth whereas nisvabhavata which is 
              synonymous to emptiness is the Ultimate Truth in Madhyamika. <strong>Although 
              interdependence is itself conditioned, in reality it is unborn and 
              empty; its true nature is unconditioned. But this is not an 
              unconditioned reality like Brahma but an unconditioned truth i.e. the 
              fact that all things are in reality empty, unborn, uncreated. </strong>Likewise 
              the mirror reflection analogy is used to show that just like images 
              which have no existence at all appear and disappear on the permanent 
              surface of the mirror so too Samsara which is an illusory reflection on 
              the mirror of Brahma appears on the surface of the Brahma and disappears
               there. In Buddhism this metaphor is used to show that Samsara is 
              interdependently arisen like the reflection on the mirror. The mirror is
               only one of the causes and conditions and no more real than the other 
              causes and conditions for the appearance of the reflection of Samsara. 
              Here too the mirror is a very poor metaphor for the Brahma, being itself
               interdependently arisen like the reflection on it. Actually such 
              analogies are good examples for interdependent origination (Skt. 
              pratityasamutpada) and not for some eternal Brahma. The mirror Brahma 
              metaphor is only a forced one. The same can be said of the moon on the 
              pond analogy and the rainbow in the sky analogy...</span></em></p>

               of all, to the Buddha and Nagarjuna, Samsara is not an illusion but 
              like an illusion. There is a quantum leap in the meaning of these two 
              statements. Secondly, because it is only ‘like an illusion’ i.e. 
              interdependently arisen like all illusions, it does not and cannot 
              vanish, so Nirvana is not when Samsara vanishes like mist and the Brahma
               arises like the sun out of the mist but rather when seeing that the 
              true nature of Samsara is itself Nirvana. So whereas Brahma and Samsara 
              are two different entities, one real and the other unreal, one existing 
              and the other non-existing, <strong>Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism are one and 
              not two. Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in Nagarjuna’s words

               in knowledge not of another thing beyond Samsara but of the way Samsara
               itself actually exists (Skt. vastusthiti), knowledge of Tathata (as 
              it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it really is) of Samsara itself. It is 
              this knowledge that liberates from wrong conceptual experience of 
              Samsara to the unconditioned experience of Samsara itself. That is what 
              is meant by the indivisibility of Samsara and Nirvana (Skt. Samsara 
              nirvana abhinnata, Tib: Khor de yer me). The mind being Samsara in the 
              context of DzogChen, Mahamudra and Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be 
              substituted by dualistic mind. The Hindu paradigm is world denying, 
              affirming the Brahma. The Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it 
              only rectifies our wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. It 
              does not give a dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara. </strong>Because such a dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to present

              metaphor is used to show that Samsara is interdependently arisen
              like the reflection on the mirror. The mirror is only one of the
              causes and conditions and no more real than the other causes and
              conditions for the appearance of the reflection of Samsara. Here
              too the mirror is a very poor metaphor for the Brahma, being itself
              interdependently arisen like the reflection on it. Actually such
              analogies are good examples for interdependent origination (Skt.
              pratityasamutpada) and not for some eternal Brahma. The mirror
              Brahma metaphor is only a forced one. The same can be said of the
              moon on the pond analogy and the rainbow in the sky
              analogy...</span></em></p>

              i.e. interdependently arisen like all illusions, it does not and
              cannot vanish, so Nirvana is not when Samsara vanishes like mist
              and the Brahma arises like the sun out of the mist but rather when
              seeing that the true nature of Samsara is itself Nirvana. So
              whereas Brahma and Samsara are two different entities, one real and
              the other unreal, one existing and the other non-existing,
              <strong>Samsara and Nirvana in Buddhism are one and not two.
              Nirvana is the nature of Samsara or in Nagarjuna’s words shunyata
              is the nature of Samsara. It is the realization of the nature of
              Samsara as empty which cuts at the very root of ignorance and
              results in knowledge not of another thing beyond Samsara but of the
              way Samsara itself actually exists (Skt. vastusthiti), knowledge of
              Tathata (as it-is-ness) the Yathabhuta (as it really is) of Samsara
              itself. It is this knowledge that liberates from wrong conceptual
              experience of Samsara to the unconditioned experience of Samsara
              itself. That is what is meant by the indivisibility of Samsara and
              Nirvana (Skt. Samsara nirvana abhinnata, Tib: Khor de yer me). The
              mind being Samsara in the context of DzogChen, Mahamudra and
              Anuttara Tantra. Samsara would be substituted by dualistic mind.
              The Hindu paradigm is world denying, affirming the Brahma. The
              Buddhist paradigm does not deny the world; it only rectifies our
              wrong vision (Skt. mithya drsti) of the world. It does not give a
              dream beyond or separate transcendence from Samsara.</strong> Because such a dream is part of the dynamics of ignorance, to
              present such a dream would be only to perpetuate

              <p>it is the dualistic self view that makes the wrongly perceived separation between conditioned and unconditioned apparent. </p>
              <p>to really come to an understanding, first the view of no-self has to be sustained from the conceptual level all the way until it is realized.</p>

              <p>I do not agree that the unconditioned transcends conditional, everyday existence.</p>
              <p>As Thusness puts it: <em>Yes. There is nothing that can arise without necessary supporting conditions and that includes 'nirvana'. No transcendental 'unconditioned' being or 'state' exists by itself and of itself. The 'unconditioned' in Buddhism is the spontaneous perfection of all necessary conditions in the natural state.

              <p><em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica;">...As for Buddhism, the rope stands for interdependent origination (pratityasamutpada) for which it is a good example being itself interdependently arisen from pieces of jute etc., and the snake imputed upon it stands for real existence, which is imposed on the interdependently existing rope appearance. Here it is the rope that is the true mode of existence of Samsara (unlike the snake representing Samsara in Vedanta) and the snake is our ignorance imputing Samsara as really existing instead of experiencing it as interdependently arisen. This interdependence or emptiness is ‘parinami nitya’ i.e. an eternal continuum and this is applicable to all phenomena. Of course, this interdependence is the Conventional Truth whereas nisvabhavata which is synonymous to emptiness is the Ultimate Truth in Madhyamika. <strong>Although interdependence is itself conditioned, in reality it is unborn and empty; its true nature is unconditioned. But this is not an unconditioned reality like Brahma but an unconditioned truth i.e. the fact that all things are in reality empty, unborn, uncreated.</strong> Likewise the mirror reflection analogy is used to show that just like images which have no existence at all appear and disappear on the permanent surface of the mirror so too Samsara which is an illusory reflection on the mirror of Brahma appears on the surface of the Brahma and disappears there. In Buddhism this metaphor is used to show that Samsara is interdependently arisen like the reflection on the mirror. The mirror is only one of the causes and conditions and no more real than the other causes and conditions for the appearance of the reflection of Samsara. Here too the mirror is a very poor metaphor for the Brahma, being itself interdependently arisen like the reflection on it.

Samsara is conditional existence, a conventional truth that cannot be denied.<span>  </span>As the Buddha and Nagajuna have so aptly pointed out in your above write-up, ‘<em><span style='font-family: "Calibri","sans-serif";    '>Samsara is not an illusion but like an illusion’.</span></em> Realising the unconditional does not imply the separation of Samsara and Nirvana as two and not one. The term 'unconditioned’ here refer to basically that, it is non-relative, non-comparative, or without relation to anything else, something that is beyond conceptual thoughts. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Your above essay has also clearly stated that all things are dependent originated and have no reality of its own. Of course taken on its own, it is just words and a doctrine trying to point us on to a direction we should take. It is only when we have gone beyond this intellectual concept, and our intuition has taken over, that we will begin to reach a higher plane and realised why ‘form is emptiness and emptiness in no other than form’ - a state of the Unconditioned, which in normal conventional reasoning would said that the whole statement is meaningless. </span></span></p>
