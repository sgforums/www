                  when directly under AEN’s article. Here is the content.</span></p>

                  the ‘unconditioned’ ultimate reality here is made in reference to
                  all things in the empirical world itself. Samsara is conditional
                  existence, a conventional truth that cannot be denied.<span> </span> As the Buddha and Nagajuna have so aptly pointed
                  out in your above write-up, ‘<em><span>Samsara is not an
                  illusion but like an illusion’.</span></em> Realising the
                  unconditional does not imply the separation of Samsara and Nirvana
                  as two and not one. The term 'unconditioned’ here refer to
                  basically that, it is non-relative, non-comparative, or without
                  relation to anything else, something that is beyond conceptual
                  thoughts.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Your above
                  essay has also clearly stated that all things are dependent
                  originated and have no reality of its own. Of course taken on its
                  own, it is just words and a doctrine trying to point us on to a
                  direction we should take. It is only when we have gone beyond this
                  intellectual concept, and our intuition has taken over, that we
                  will begin to reach a higher plane and realised why ‘form is
                  emptiness and emptiness in no other than form’ - a state of the
                  Unconditioned, which in normal conventional reasoning would said
                  that the whole statement is meaningless.</span></span></p>

              <p>there is a difference in taking the unconditioned as a plane or a state, rather than intuiting that it is just the nature of all conditioned phenomena.</p>
              <p>in the former, there is still a goal of attainment, stemming from the workings of the process of the ego self. there is arising of resistance, for the differentiation of the unconditioned from the conditioned is a mirage.</p>
              <p>in the latter, it is intuited that every phenomena is conditionally arisen and this is the nature of all things. intuiting this, sense of self arises, with the aggregates as the conditions, appearing as a mirage of our thoughts, there is yet no resistance as the sense of self is already seen to be anatta in nature.</p>
              <p>any experience of being in a higher plane is also supported by conditions, seeing through and staying with this is to touch the unconditioned nature.</p>

                              :</p>
              <p>' when I spoke to a Buddhist friend, he told me about the
                              doctrine of no-self, about no ‘I’. I rejected such doctrine
                              outright as it is in direct contradiction with what I experienced.
                              I was deeply confused for some time and could not appreciate why
                              Buddha has taught this doctrine and worst still make it a Dharma
                              Seal. '</p>
              <p>(In his case,the experience he *already had* was in
                              contradiction with anatta ; my question ,though, concerns
                              those haven't got the experience -)</p>
              <p>Am i right to say that at the beginning stage of inquiry,not
                              only the view of no-self not to be hold on to,one must cling hard
                              to the view of Self ?</p>

              <p>There is no need to develop a view of self. You simply need to discover what you are. This is a non-conceptual insight into an undeniable fact of Being. You don't need a concept of self or no-self to see that an undeniable fact of existence is present right where you are. Without a thought of 'I am' or 'I am not', what is present and shining?</p>
              <p>By asking 'Who am I', you are finding out what the word 'I' refers to even in the absence of concepts and names. It leads to a non-conceptual realization of Presence, Beingness. There will be utter certainty about it. As there is no duality and separation in pure beingness, you will make statements like 'I am That'. This experience will be initially be treated as a purest identity due to the lack of insights into non-dual and emptiness. When non-dual insight arise, one finds non-dual Presence in every manifestation and no longer clings to a formless state of Presence as one's purest identity (all states and experiences are equally IT).</p>
              <p>But no need to worry about that part yet, just start with the question 'Who am I?'</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It is not so much an experience of being on a higher plane. It is a heightened awareness of the true nature of all conditioned phenomena. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 6pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The Heart Sutra’s description of conventional truths as no different from ultimate truth, by a process of negation of the conditioned to arrive at the Unconditioned, Emptiness itself, is of course well known to most Buddhists. Negation of a doctrine, in this case, the teaching of the Abhidharmika, does not mean that its teachings are wrong, nor does it beget another set of opposing theory. It is a critical consciousness of the doctrine itself.</span></span></p>

              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">1. This is my first post. First of all, thank you for sharing ideas. And for the book. You are very helpful. Thank you indeed.</div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">2. I think, that the idea of "eternal unchanging atman" in Vedanta is oversimplification. I myself encounted the statement like this in one of my first buddhist book very many years ago and was naive to believe that it was really so, which prevented me from accessing (for all these many years) the wisdom of Maharshi and Maharaj, whose revelations are much more closer to the buddhist teaching (especially Yogachara and, quite surprisingly, to Madhyamika), than I would have ever expected. Of course, the books of these two yogins should be read very carefully, as the words (like Self, God or "I am") can and do have different meaning in their contexts... but I am speaking with An Eternal Now who is not afraid (or is he?) of eternalism, so it's OK.</div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">3) "Unchanged" in Vedanta has a negative meaning, as the Truth itself can be discribed (on the level of the mind) only in negative terms. Maharaj says "Ultimately even the observer you are not." I think we buddhists too often create our own vedanta straw man, accusing them of eternalism, which is just not there, at least in the mind of their best minds. "Affirming the Brahma"?! But that's just not fair. There is much more affirmation in Dzogchen than in Advaita Vedanta (neti-neti!)!</div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">4) As Nagarjuna pointed out in MMK, "change" is not a very good word. At all. For "change" you might need an unchanging background, fixed points, jumps, identifications, non-identifications and all that stuff which would make you a substantialist much more than you would prefer. Recently, I have been feeling much comfortable with "unchanged" in Advaita Vedanta, than with uncritical use of "change". You call it "changing" and it's OK, it's fixed and we are authentic buddhists. What's changing? I look at an animated mandala, I can see the world unfolding, but where is "change"? I look at the world, where is change? Cannot find it.</div>
              <div class="quote_from" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><br></div>
              <blockquote style="border-bottom: #aaaaaa 1px dotted; padding-bottom: 0.3em; margin: 0.8em 2em 0.8em 0.8em; padding-left: 0px; padding-right: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 20px; border-top: #aaaaaa 1px dotted; padding-top: 0.3em;">

There is a quantum leap in the meaning of these two statements</span></em></span></blockquote>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">It may sound like a heresy, but I would not put the Buddha and Nagarjuna together on this matter. Well, it is a heresy. I am not sure, that I will be able to defend it now... so, just a remark... unimportant.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">What is important is that "like an illusion" is redundant. If you analyse "illusion" you will find a quite sufficient amount of "likes" inside. "Illusion" is a difficult word and should be treated carefully. "Illusion" is enough. Do not be so much afraid of it. It is just an illusion but it is an illusion and not nothing. "Like an illusion" seems to be a fear of emptiness, of reality.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Words are deceitful. In the same article phrases like "<span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 14px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px;"><em style="font-style: italic; font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica; font-size: 14px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">the way Samsara itself actually exists" </strong></span></em></span>are used and I am not sure that Nagarjuna would be very happy to hear that. </p>

              <p>Basically, all Advaita teachers including Maharshi and Maharaj teach that there is an unchanging Awareness that is the substratum or ground of all things. This is very obviously the case and the Buddhists are not making any vedanta straw man.</p>
              <p>This is the eternalist view of Consicousness/Awareness (I'm using these terms synonymously here). Once Anatta is realized, you no longer entertain or believe in any view of an unchanging consciousness/awareness, and it has become impossible for me to hold on to a view of an unchanging consciousness because it is seen through. I am not afraid of eternalism, I simply see it for what it is - an illusion.</p>
              <p>The negation of 'neti neti' already implies there is a positive unchanging truth underlying the not-Self. In Buddhism, we do not use 'neti neti'. 'Neti neti' denies thoughts, experiences, phenomena as the eternal truth. In Buddhism, we do not deny thought and phenomena - in fact there is always only phenomena, manifestation, and Truth is exhibited completely in each moment of manifestation. The eternal truth is change.</p>
              <p>Manifestation is like an illusion, but not an illusion because manifestation precisely<strong> is the undeniable and actual Consciousness/Awareness/Aliveness/Luminosity</strong> itself. It is like an illusion because even though self-luminous/aware/alive, it is without an inherent locatable existence. It is like a magician's trick or the mirage off the horizon - vividly present, and yet ungraspable.</p>
              <p>There is change, but no changing thing (as thoroughgoing change breaks down the view of solidity and entities). The notion that you need an unchanging background for change is simply a logical deducation, it is not the truth. As Thusness pointed out in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2007/03/mistaken-reality-of-amness.html">Buddha Nature is NOT "I Am"</a>:</p>

              <p>Thank you for answering. I would appreciate if you could answer some following questions. I need it to decide what to do next. Can you, please, be honest. Some questions need just "yes" or "no" reply. I won't tell anybody, I promise. </p>
              <p>1. On “unchanging Awareness that is the substratum or ground of all things” and “'neti neti' already implies there is a positive unchanging truth” in Advaita Vedanta</p>
              <p>Have you ever read “I Am That” by Maharaj? I mean the book itself, at least first 10 pages, and not just interpretations by others? </p>
              <p>2. On “The notion that you need an unchanging background for change is simply a logical deduction, it is not the truth”.</p>
              <p>Have you ever read Mulamadhyamakakarika? If yes, then which translation? </p>
              <p>3. I will not argue on Dzogchen, I am not an expert. I have read an article, where Dzogchen was compared with Madhyamika by a Dzogchen master. He (the master) will not agree with you, but that is too much for me. BTW, I was talking about “affirmation” and not “establishing”. Not the same for me, but again I am miles away from Dzogchen. Sorry for bringing it here.  </p>
              <p>4. On “Enlightenment is conditional”.</p>
              <p>It is conditional in divided mind. </p>
              <p>What do you mean by conditional? Having causes? Arising from causes? But nothing arises from causes (as was pointed out by Nagarjuna and a good common sense). If “conditional” does not mean “caused”, “arising from causes”, then what do you mean by “conditional”? </p>
              <p>5. “Anyway I'm curious... how did you find this forum and my e-book?”</p>
              <p>Aha!! </p>
              <p>I am Russian and work for KGB.</p>
              <p>It's a joke.</p>
              <p>I am Russian and do not work for KGB.</p>
              <p>I will be as honest as you in your answers. I’ve set up a Google Alert on “Madhyamika Buddhism”.</p>
              <p>So it is KGB, G for Google, B for Buddhism, K …. might be for Kremlin or for kisses, I am neti-neti sure.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Thank you for answering. I would appreciate if you could answer
                                  some following questions. I need it to decide what to do next. Can
                                  you, please, be honest. Some questions need just "yes" or "no"
                                  reply. I won't tell anybody, I promise. </p>
              <p>1. On “unchanging Awareness that is the substratum or ground of
                                  all things” and “'neti neti' already implies there is a positive
                                  unchanging truth” in Advaita Vedanta</p>
              <p>Have you ever read “I Am That” by Maharaj? I mean the book
                                  itself, at least first 10 pages, and not just interpretations by
                                  others? </p>
              <p>2. On “The notion that you need an unchanging background for
                                  change is simply a logical deduction, it is not the truth”.</p>
              <p>Have you ever read Mulamadhyamakakarika? If yes, then which
                                  translation? </p>
              <p>3. I will not argue on Dzogchen, I am not an expert. I have read
                                  an article, where Dzogchen was compared with Madhyamika by a
                                  Dzogchen master. He (the master) will not agree with you, but that
                                  is too much for me. BTW, I was talking about “affirmation” and not
                                  “establishing”. Not the same for me, but again I am miles away from
                                  Dzogchen. Sorry for bringing it here.  </p>
              <p>4. On “Enlightenment is conditional”.</p>
              <p>It is conditional in divided mind. </p>
              <p>What do you mean by conditional? Having causes? Arising from
                                  causes? But nothing arises from causes (as was pointed out by
                                  Nagarjuna and a good common sense). If “conditional” does not mean
                                  “caused”, “arising from causes”, then what do you mean by
                                  “conditional”? </p>
              <p>5. “Anyway I'm curious... how did you find this forum and my
                                  e-book?”</p>
              <p>Aha!! </p>
              <p>I am Russian and work for KGB.</p>
              <p>It's a joke.</p>
              <p>I am Russian and do not work for KGB.</p>
              <p>I will be as honest as you in your answers. I’ve set up a Google
                                  Alert on “Madhyamika Buddhism”.</p>
              <p>So it is KGB, G for Google, B for Buddhism, K …. might be for
                                  Kremlin or for kisses, I am neti-neti sure.</p>

              <p>1. I have read at least half of I Am That. I have that book on my bookshelf.</p>
              <p>2. I have read a few texts by Nagarjuna, but maybe not the one you mentioned.</p>
              <p>3. It's ok. I can highly recommend Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche's books to you if you are interested in Dzogchen.</p>
              <p>4. Nagarjuna is not denying causes and conditions nor appearance, but rejecting the notion that things come from somewhere.<strong> Because everything arises dependently, there is nothing that arises from a cause or a source. To see that something has an origin or cause is to see things with inherent existence.<br></strong></p>
              <p>Let's say... a sound of bell ringing being heard.</p>
              <p>Does the sound originate from the ear? Does it originate from
                                                          the bell? No! Actually... it is much more complex than that.</p>
              <p>The sound of bell ringing being perceived actually has various
                                                          supporting conditions... the stick, the bell, the vibration of the
                                                          air, the ears, the hand hitting the stick, and so on. These
                                                          supporting conditions all come together and in that instantaneous
                                                          moment a completely new phenomenon/arising of sound-consciousness appears. It is not the case that an existing thing called 'sound' came from a location or source or cause to you - that is to see things as having inherent existence, birth, death, location, etc, i.e. failing to see the dependently originated and empty nature of appearance.</p>
              <p>Does sound-consciousness have an origin? It cannot be said to
                                                          have a source, cause, agent, or origin. It does not come from the
                                                          ears, it does not come from the air, the stick, the bell, and so
                                                          on. It does not come from somewhere, it does not abide somewhere, and it does not go somewhere. 'It' (the appearance) is entirely dependently arisen and hence without core and essence!</p>
              <p>So, it is with the combination of these various supporting
                                                          conditions, a new and complete phenomenon arises. This is thus
                                                          called Interdependent Origination.</p>
              <p><strong>Relatively, everything is conditional - i.e. arisen dependently on conditions and factors, and ultimately speaking because everything arises dependently, they are empty, unborn, uncreated - they are without an inherent, independent, and locatable essence or core.</strong> Thus, he is pointing out that what dependently originates, is empty, and as such is unconditioned. The appearance and the causes and conditions are all empty (dependently originated, without inherent existence). As Archaya Mahayogi Shridhar Rana Rinpoche puts it in his article<a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/02/madhyamika-buddhism-vis-vis-hindu.html"> Madhyamika Buddhism Vis-a-vis Hindu Vedanta</a>, <em><span style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica; font-size: 100%;"><strong>Although
                                                          interdependence is itself conditioned, in reality it is unborn and
                                                          empty; its true nature is unconditioned. But this is not an
                                                          unconditioned reality like Brahma but an unconditioned truth i.e.
                                                          the fact that all things are in reality empty, unborn,
                                                          uncreated.</strong></span></em></p>

              <blockquote>
              <p>Whatever is dependently co-arisen<br> That is explained to be emptiness. <br> That, being a dependent designation <br> Is itself the middle way.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>5. Cool! I think I need to look more closely into Nagarjuna's stuff...</p>

              <p>By the way also wanted to add... there is impermanence, but there is no movement. Something I wrote quite recently:</p>
              <p><em><span><span class="text_exposed_show"><br>...Every moment 
              the universe stands still. Complete. Whole. Yet not permanent. It is 
              impermanence without movement. It is a process without the continuity of
               an entity. Past, present and future do not apply to This. Ever just 
              this one thought, this one sound, this one sight, this one breathe. 
              Certain and undeniable. Non-arising and non-ceasing.<br><br>There is no 
              ‘non-arising and non-ceasing Awareness reflecting the comings and goings
               of arising and ceasing phenomena’, there is just This, non-arising, 
              non-ceasing, transient phenomena.<br><br>There are no two moments... and
               yet there is also no one unchanging moment, which would imply an 
              unchanging 'awareness' behind all phenomena (this is seen through)...</span></span></em></p>
