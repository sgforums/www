                  A division of the sÅ«trapiá¹­aka containing avadÄ�nas, i.e. comparisons, metaphors, 
                  parables, and stories illustrating the doctrines.</p>
              <p>The Dharma-Ending Age is the last of the Three Ages of Dharma, during which 
                  the understanding and practice of the Buddha-dharma gradually declines and 
                  finally disappears. The Three Ages are 1) the Orthodox Dharma Age, 2) The Dharma 
                  Image/Semblance Age, and 3) the Dharma-Ending Age.</p>
              <p>"The era when the Buddha dwelled in the world was called the Orthodox Dharma 
                  Age. At that time the Buddha taught the Dharma, and there were genuine Arhats 
                  and great Bodhisattvas; the sages were dwelling in the world. The Orthodox 
                  Dharma Age lasted for one thousand years. The Dharma-Image Age followed--after 
                  the Buddha entered nirvana. During this period, people who cultivated the Way 
                  were few; those who were attached to external appearances were many. People 
                  stressed the creation of Buddha-images and many were made, but genuine 
                  cultivators were few.</p>
              <p>"After the Dharma-Image Age came the Dharma-Ending age. The Orthodox Dharma 
                  Age lasted for one thousand years. The DharmaÄ Image Age lasted another one 
                  thousand years. That is two thousand years in all. The Dharma-Ending age 
                  continues for ten thousand years. We are now living in the Dharma-Ending Age. 
                  What does the phrase 'Dharma-ending' mean? It means that the Dharma has nearly 
                  come to an end and is about to disappear. The 'disappearance' of the 
                  Buddhadharma involves disappearance of faith in the Buddha. In the Dharma-Ending 
                  Age living beings' faith in the Buddha is not firm. When the Buddha dwelled in 
                  the world,peoples' faith was so firm that if you held a person at knife-point 
                  and threatened his life saying, 'Renounce your belief in the Buddha or I'll 
                  murder you,' he would rather die than surrender his belief. . . .</p>
              <p>"In the Dharma-Image Age things were different. If a person believed in the 
                  Buddha and someone said, 'If you believe in the Buddha, I'll kill you,' he would 
                  say, 'Fine, I won't believe in the Buddha.' People would change their minds 
                  because their faith was not firm.</p>
              <p>"Now, in the Dharma-Ending Age, you don't even have to threaten a person with 
                  death. You merely have to say, 'Don't believe in the Buddha,' and they quickly 
                  reply, 'Fine'. . . . It is very difficult to promote faith. Figure it out for 
                  yourself. How many people are there in the world? Among the entire human race, 
                  how many believe in the Buddha? You can lecture the Sutras to those believers 
                  every day and they will still waver between doubt and faith. You can conduct a 
                  small experiment. Try this. Invite a person out to a movie. He'll accept on the 
                  spot and away you go. Then try asking him to a Sutra lecture. He will say, 'Ohhh 
                  . . . sitting there for two hours is nothing but suffering and tedium. It's not 
                  half as much fun as a movie!' That is the Dharma-Ending Age for you." (BRF

              <p>The Dharma-Ending Age is the last of the Three Ages of Dharma, during which the understanding and practice of the Buddha-dharma gradually declines and finally disappears. The Three Ages are 1) the Orthodox Dharma Age, 2) The Dharma Image/Semblance Age, and 3) the Dharma-Ending Age.</p>
              <p>"The era when the Buddha dwelled in the world was called the Orthodox Dharma Age. At that time the Buddha taught the Dharma, and there were genuine Arhats and great Bodhisattvas; the sages were dwelling in the world. The Orthodox Dharma Age lasted for one thousand years. The Dharma-Image Age followed--after the Buddha entered nirvana. During this period, people who cultivated the Way were few; those who were attached to external appearances were many. People stressed the creation of Buddha-images and many were made, but genuine cultivators were few.</p>
              <p>"After the Dharma-Image Age came the Dharma-Ending age. The Orthodox Dharma Age lasted for one thousand years. The DharmaÄ Image Age lasted another one thousand years. That is two thousand years in all. The Dharma-Ending age continues for ten thousand years. We are now living in the Dharma-Ending Age. What does the phrase 'Dharma-ending' mean? It means that the Dharma has nearly come to an end and is about to disappear. The 'disappearance' of the Buddhadharma involves disappearance of faith in the Buddha. In the Dharma-Ending Age living beings' faith in the Buddha is not firm. When the Buddha dwelled in the world,peoples' faith was so firm that if you held a person at knife-point and threatened his life saying, 'Renounce your belief in the Buddha or I'll murder you,' he would rather die than surrender his belief. . . .</p>
              <p>"In the Dharma-Image Age things were different. If a person believed in the Buddha and someone said, 'If you believe in the Buddha, I'll kill you,' he would say, 'Fine, I won't believe in the Buddha.' People would change their minds because their faith was not firm.</p>
              <p>"Now, in the Dharma-Ending Age, you don't even have to threaten a person with death. You merely have to say, 'Don't believe in the Buddha,' and they quickly reply, 'Fine'. . . . It is very difficult to promote faith. Figure it out for yourself. How many people are there in the world? Among the entire human race, how many believe in the Buddha? You can lecture the Sutras to those believers every day and they will still waver between doubt and faith. You can conduct a small experiment. Try this. Invite a person out to a movie. He'll accept on the spot and away you go. Then try asking him to a Sutra lecture. He will say, 'Ohhh . . . sitting there for two hours is nothing but suffering and tedium. It's not half as much fun as a movie!' That is the Dharma-Ending Age for you." (BRF 17-18)</p>

              <p>Here's the sutta I promised.</p>
              <p><strong>The First Six Recollections</strong><br>§ 12. I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among<br>the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Park. Now at that time Mah›n›ma…<br>went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As<br>he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: “I have heard that many monks<br>are at work making robes for the Blessed One, (thinking,) ‘When the robes are<br>finished, at the end of the three months, the Blessed One will set out wandering.’<br>For those of us living by means of various dwelling places [for the mind], by<br>means of which dwelling place should we live?”<br>“Excellent, Mah›n›ma, excellent! It is fitting for clansmen like you to<br>approach the Tath›gata and ask, ‘For those of us living by means of various<br>dwelling places [for the mind], by means of which dwelling place should we<br>live?’<br>“One who is aroused to practice is one of conviction, not without<br>conviction… is one with persistence aroused, not lazy… is one of established<br>mindfulness, not muddled mindfulness… is centered in concentration, not<br>uncentered. One aroused to practice is discerning, not undiscerning.<br>“Established in these five qualities, you should further develop six qualities:<br>[1] “There is the case where you recollect the Tath›gata: ‘Indeed, the Blessed<br>One is pure and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge &amp; conduct,<br>well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those<br>people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine &amp; human beings, awakened,<br>blessed.’ At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the<br>Tath›gata, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion,<br>not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the Tath›gata.<br>And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a<br>sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the<br>Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body<br>grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure,<br>the mind becomes concentrated.<br>“Mah›n›ma, you should develop this recollection of the Buddha while you<br>are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying<br>down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded<br>with children.<br>[2] “Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect the Dhamma: ‘The<br>Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless,<br>inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.’ At any<br>time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Dhamma, his mind is<br>not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with</p>
              <p>delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the Dhamma. And when the mind is<br>headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a<br>sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is<br>joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose<br>body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes<br>concentrated.<br>“Mah›n›ma, you should develop this recollection of the Dhamma while you<br>are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying<br>down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded<br>with children.<br>[3] “Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect the Sangha: ‘The<br>Sangha of the Blessed One’s disciples who have practiced well… who have<br>practiced straight-forwardly… who have practiced methodically… who have<br>practiced masterfully—in other words, the four types of noble disciples when<br>taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types—they are the Sangha of<br>the Blessed One’s disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of<br>offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.’ At<br>any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the Sangha, his mind is<br>not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with<br>delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the Sangha. And when the mind is<br>headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a<br>sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is<br>joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose<br>body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes<br>concentrated.<br>“Mah›n›ma, you should develop this recollection of the Sangha while you<br>are walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying<br>down, while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded<br>with children.<br>[4] “Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect your own virtues:<br>‘(They are) untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the<br>wise, untarnished, conducive to concentration.’ At any time when a disciple of<br>the noble ones is recollecting virtue, his mind is not overcome with passion, not<br>overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight,<br>based on virtue. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble<br>ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected<br>with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous,<br>the body grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing<br>pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated.<br>“Mah›n›ma, you should develop this recollection of virtue while you are<br>walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down,<br>while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with<br>children.<br>[5] “Furthermore, there is the case where you recollect your own generosity:<br>‘It is a gain, a great gain for me, that—among people overcome with the stain of<br>possessiveness—I live at home, my awareness cleansed of the stain of<br>possessiveness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in being magnanimous,<br>responsive to requests, delighting in the distribution of alms.’ At any time when<br>a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting generosity, his mind is not overcome</p>
              <p>with passion, not overcome with aversion, not overcome with delusion. His<br>mind heads straight, based on generosity. And when the mind is headed<br>straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains a sense of the goal, gains a sense of<br>the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. In one who is joyful,<br>rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body grows calm. One whose body<br>is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure, the mind becomes<br>concentrated.<br>“Mah›n›ma, you should develop this recollection of generosity while you are<br>walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down,<br>while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with<br>children.<br>[6] “Furthermore, you should recollect the devas: ‘There are the devas of the<br>Four Great Kings, the devas of the Thirty-three, the devas of the Hours, the<br>Contented Devas, the devas who delight in creation, the devas who have power<br>over the creations of others, the devas of Brahma’s retinue, the devas beyond<br>them. Whatever conviction they were endowed with that—when falling away<br>from this life—they re-arose there, the same sort of conviction is present in me<br>as well. Whatever virtue they were endowed with that—when falling away from<br>this life—they re-arose there, the same sort of virtue is present in me as well.<br>Whatever learning they were endowed with that—when falling away from this<br>life—they re-arose there, the same sort of learning is present in me as well.<br>Whatever generosity they were endowed with that—when falling away from this<br>life—they re-arose there, the same sort of generosity is present in me as well.<br>Whatever discernment they were endowed with that—when falling away from<br>this life—they re-arose there, the same sort of discernment is present in me as<br>well.’ At any time when a disciple of the noble ones is recollecting the conviction,<br>virtue, learning, generosity, and discernment found both in himself and the<br>devas, his mind is not overcome with passion, not overcome with aversion, not<br>overcome with delusion. His mind heads straight, based on the (qualities of the)<br>devas. And when the mind is headed straight, the disciple of the noble ones gains<br>a sense of the goal, gains a sense of the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the<br>Dhamma. In one who is joyful, rapture arises. In one who is rapturous, the body<br>grows calm. One whose body is calmed senses pleasure. In one sensing pleasure,<br>the mind becomes concentrated.<br>“Mah›n›ma, you should develop this recollection of the devas while you are<br>walking, while you are standing, while you are sitting, while you are lying down,<br>while you are busy at work, while you are resting in your home crowded with<br>children.”<br>AN 11:13<strong><br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Ten Recollections</strong><br>§ 1. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of the Buddha. This is<br>one thing that—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to disenchantment, to<br>dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to<br>Unbinding.”<br>§ 2. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of the Dhamma….”<br>§ 3. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of the Sangha….”<br>§ 4. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of virtue….”<br>§ 5. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of generosity….”<br>§ 6. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of the devas….”<br>§ 7. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Mindfulness of in-&amp;-out<br>breathing….”<br>§ 8. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Mindfulness of death….”<br>§ 9. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Mindfulness immersed in the<br>body….”<br>§ 10. “One thing—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to<br>disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to<br>self-awakening, to Unbinding. Which one thing? Recollection of stilling. This is one<br>thing that—when developed &amp; pursued—leads solely to disenchantment, to<br>dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to<br>Unbinding.”</p>
