              many teachings. Only study one. What is it? It is great compassion. Whoever has
              great compassion has all Buddha's qualities in his hand." —Lord</span></em><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '> <em>Buddha</em><br> <br> <strong>In
              the undeluded purity</strong> of self-appearance, there are no
              names for love and faith.... But since all sentient beings grasp at the
              uncatchable display of appearance, all our phenomena become heavy and
              substantial, and we create the duality of self and other, the conceptions of
              ordinary mind, and the karmic delusion of habit. Since all habit belongs to
              either the deluded panic of samsara or the noble path of enlightenment, it is
              best to develop the positive habit of the path of enlightenment that always
              creates the positive energy of love and faith, until we attain the selfless
              appearance of the buddhas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Love and faith share the same essence of deep caring. The only
              difference is that love is aimed toward sentient beings, including those who
              are less fortunate than we are, while faith is aimed toward sublime beings,
              including all buddhas and enlightened guides. The nature of love is to give
              positive energy to others in order to benefit them and to release them from suffering.
              The nature of faith is to trust in sublime beings in order to receive the
              blessings of wisdom energy that benefit oneself and others. True faith creates
              the vast love of compassion that benefits countless beings.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If we rely on ordinary, dualistic mind, we cannot have deep and lasting
              love either for our equals or for less fortunate beings, because ordinary,
              dualistic mind depends on the uncertainty of temporary circumstances. This
              uncertainty easily causes disinterest, hatred, or betrayal. If we do not
              believe in the unending continuity of mind, we will only consider the
              immediate, tangible circumstances of our connections to others, rejecting or
              accepting them as these circumstances change according to what is the most
              expedient for us. Ordinary love that arises from the karmic results of habit
              can seem to have the qualities of being genuine, loyal, and stable, but these
              qualities only mask the potential for the opposite qualities of insincerity,
              disloyalty, and instability to arise if circumstances change. Because ordinary
              love has no depth, it is automatically limited. If it becomes unpleasant, we
              stop feeling it. When we only react to circumstances, we are really just
              considering ourselves and our own reactions without respecting or caring deeply
              about others. When we feel isolated and want to be loved, we show love to
              others in order to receive love from them in return, but when we are satisfied,
              we forget about others. This is not enduring and continuous love. It does not
              cause the impartial compassion of bodhisattvas because it depends on our
              personal, selfish desire.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If we do not believe in anything beyond what can be experienced directly
              with the obscured perception of dualistic mind, we will not recognize that our
              awareness is limited and we will only care about our immediate experiences. Our
              main interest will be in our own temporary benefit, even though this benefit is
              easily lost since it depends on unreliable, temporary circumstances<br> <br> <strong>If
              we only react</strong> with self-interest to whatever circumstances
              appear, we will make choices based on trying to find temporary satisfaction.
              But this effort is always ultimately hopeless, since everything within samsara
              is uncertain because it is changing. Through the shortsightedness of our habit,
              we do not even notice that we are missing what is meaningful, like someone who
              eagerly chooses to eat a cow's red meat instead of continuously drinking its
              white milk.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If we believe that mind is continuous, our love for others becomes
              continuous. If we recognize this continuity, we do not trust temporary,
              tangible circumstances or take them too seriously. Since it is tiring to switch
              between changing uncertainties, which are inherently impermanent and
              unimportant, we become less easily influenced by any circumstance. This creates
              the habit of stability so that our minds are less erratic, our lives are less
              chaotic, and our feelings for others are less changeable, which causes love to
              become increasingly deep and loyal.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If we believe in the continuity of mind, then love inconspicuously
              connects us to the ones we love with continuous positive energy, so that even
              tangible separations between people who love each other do not reduce the
              intangible power of love. This love is automatically enduring since it is not
              easily affected by circumstances.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>If we can keep from grasping at others with the selfish fear of losing
              them or the hope of possessing them through the unawareness of our ordinary,
              dualistic mind, then the energy of love increases and its quality of giving
              energy to others opens and expands. The positive habit of continuity is created
              by not depending on what occurs each moment as though it were the only moment.
              By believing in the continuity of mind, we acknowledge the continuity of all
              circumstances, including our experiences of love, which are not just for one
              moment or for one life. We can understand that it is useless to try to escape
              from momentary dissatisfaction or to pursue momentary benefit by abandoning old
              circumstances and chasing after new circumstances, since nothing really changes
              unless we are released from all circumstances to enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 11.2pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>Through our nihilist habit, we may superficially judge the relationships
              between parents and children, friends and companions, or teachers and students,
              deciding that they are inharmonious or unsuitable. If we do not believe in
              continuous mind and continuing karmic connections but only believe in
              coincidental circumstances, we may think that it is better to discard difficult
              relationships in order to rid ourselves of problems, and we may easily turn
              away from others.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style=" margin-bottom: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 18.7pt;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; font-family: "Georgia","serif"; '>But if we believe in continuous mind and karma, we
              know that momentary phenomena always change. Unless change is connected with
              practice leading to enlightenment, it is unnecessary to try to change our
              useless, worldly phenomena, which only take us from being miserable to being
              miserable again. We will not take temporary negativity so seriously if we know
              that all circumstances within gross and subtle substantial conceptualization
              are impermanent. We will also not want to hold on to negative feelings that
              increase negative habits, since we will recognize that there is no benefit in
              doing this. By believing that we can actually change our karmic circumstances,
              we can pray for others, purify negativity, and create positive karma with the
              intention of attaining enlightenment. Instead of trying to change our outer
              circumstances, we will understand that it is more meaningful to change our own
              phenomena.</span></p>
