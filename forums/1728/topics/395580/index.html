              Dakinis<br>by H.H. Dungse Thinley Norbu Rinpoche<br><br>:: When you read
               this, please remember that the dakini is in your mind :: <br><br>~~~ 
              Five Wisdom Sisters, <br>If we do not complement you, <br>you become 
              five witches, <br>making us ill and bringing us suffering. <br>Because 
              we cannot banish you, <br>always our fate depends on you.<br><br>~~~ 
              Five Wisdom Sisters,<br>If we do complement you, <br>you become five 
              angels, <br>making us healthy and bringing us happiness. <br><br><a class="postlink" href="http://www.facebook.com/board.php?uid=135479311144">http://www.facebook.com/board.php?uid=135479311144</a><br>Because
               we cannot separate from you, <br>always our fate depends on you.<br><br>~~~
               Five Wisdome Sisters,<br>Nothing can be done without depending on your 
              mood. <br>Farmers cannot grow their crops, <br>politicians cannot rule 
              their countries, <br>engineers cannot work their machines, <br>doctors 
              cannot heal their patients, <br>scientists cannot do their research, <br>philosophers
               cannot make their logic, <br>artists cannot create their art, <br>without
               depending on your mood.<br><br>~~~ Five Wisdom Sisters, <br>Nothing can
               be known without depending on your grace. <br>Tibetan lamas cannot 
              chant with cool highland habit,<br>Indian gurus cannot sing with warm 
              lowland habit, <br>Japanese roshis cannot sit with dark cushion habit, <br>Muslim
               sheikhs cannot dance with bright robed habit, <br>Jewish rabbis cannot 
              pray with soft-voiced habit <br>Without depending on your grace. <br><br>~~~
               Five Wisdom Sisters, <br>Even the most mysterious miracles cannot occur
               without complementing your purity. <br>Buddha Shakyamuni cannot rest 
              with tranquil gaze of his lotus eyes <br>underneath the Bodhi tree, <br>Guru
               Padmasambhava cannot play magically with countless sky-walking dakinis,
               <br>Lord Jesus cannot walk weightlessly across the water, <br>Prophet 
              Moses cannot see the radiantly burning bush, <br>Brahmin Saraha-pa 
              cannot straighten arrows, <br>singing wisdom hymns with his arrow-maker 
              girl, <br>Crazy saint Tilopa cannot eat fish and torture Naropa, <br>Greatest
               yogi Milarepa cannot remain in his cave, singing and accepting 
              hardships <br>Without complementing your purity. <br><br>You are so 
              patient. <br>Whoever wants to stay, If you don't exist, Cannot stay. <br>Whoever
               wants to go, If you don't exist, Cannot go. <br>Whoever wants to taste 
              or touch, If you don't exist, Cannot taste or touch.<br>Whatever our 
              actions, You are always supporting Patiently without complaining. <br>But
               we ignorant beings are always ungrateful, Stepping on you, <br><br>Calling
               you Earth. You are so constant. <br>Whoever wants to be purified, If 
              you don't exist, Cannot be purified. <br>Whoever wants to quench their 
              thirst, If you don't exist, Cannot quench their thirst. <br>Whoever 
              wants to hear, If you don't exist, Cannot hear Whatever our actions, You
               are always flowing Ceaselessly without complaining. <br>But we desiring
               beings Are always ungrateful, Splashing you, <br><br>Calling you Water.
               You are so clear. <br>Whoever wants to fight, If you don't exist, 
              Cannot fight. <br>Whoever wants to love, If you don't exist, Cannot 
              love. <br>Whoever wants to see, If you don't exist, Cannot see. <br>Whatever
               our actions, You are always glowing Un-obscuredly without complaining. <br>But
               we proud beings Are always ungrateful Smothering you, <br><br>Calling 
              you Fire. You are so light. <br>Whoever wants to rise, If you don't 
              exist, Cannot rise. <br>Whoever wants to move, If you don't exist, 
              Cannot move. <br>Whoever wants to smell, If you don't exist, Cannot 
              smell. <br>Whatever our actions, You are always moving Weightlessly 
              without complaining. <br>But we envious beings Are always ungrateful, 
              Fanning you, <br><br>Calling you Air. You are so open. <br>Whoever wants
               to exist, If you don't exist, Cannot exist. <br>Whoever doesn't want to
               exist, If you don't exist, Cannot cease to exist. <br>Whoever wants to 
              know phenomena, If you don't exist, Cannot know phenomena. <br>Whatever 
              our actions, You are always welcoming Spaciously without complaining. 
              But we ignorant beings Are always ungrateful, Emptying you, <br><br>Calling
               you Space. <br>You are our undemanding slave, Tirelessly serving us, 
              From ordinary beings to sublime beings to fulfill our worldly wishes. <br><br>You
               are our powerful queen, Seductively conquering us, From ordinary beings
               to sublime beings, Into desirable qualities. <br><br>You are our Wisdom
               Dakini, Effortlessly guiding us with your magic dance, From ordinary 
              beings to sublime beings, Into desireless qualities. And so, I want to 
              introduce you.</div>
