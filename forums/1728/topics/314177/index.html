              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">While you are engaging in the practice of giving, you should do so with great happiness and radiance on your face. One should practice giving with a smile and with mental uprightness. If a person has never encountered love towards himself or herself from any quarter, it is very sad. But if that person can meet even one person who will show unconditional love – Simply acceptance, affection and love, it is bound to have an impact, and this will be appreciated. Because there is a seed in himself, this act of love will start to catalyze or ripen that seed. “Ordinary compassion and love give rise to a very closing feeling, but it is essentially attachment. As long as the other person appears to you as beautiful or good, love remains, but as soon as he or she appears to you as less beautiful or good, your love completely changes. Even though your dear friend is the same person, he feels more like an enemy. Instead of love, you now feel hostility. With genuine love and compassion, another person’s appearance or behavior has not effect on your attitude. Real compassion comes from seeing the other’s suffering. You feel a sense of responsibility, and you want to do something for him or her” – Dalai lama</span></span></p>

              <p>Some of his teachings can be found here: <a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/index.shtml">http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/index.shtml</a></p>
              <p>I have personally not read much of his teachings, but there is an article which I showed Thusness. He was particularly impressed by HHDL's explanation on the nature of mind. In this article both the relative nature (which is the experience of 'I AM') and ultimate nature (emptiness) of Mind is explained.</p>

              <p>Many billions of years elapsed between the origin of this 
                                      world and the first appearance of living beings upon its surface. 
                                      Thereafter it took an immense time for living creatures to 
                                      become mature in thought—in the development and perfection 
                                      of their intellectual faculties; and even from the time men 
                                      attained maturity up to the present many thousands of years 
                                      have passed. Through all these vast periods of time the world 
                                      has undergone constant changes, for it is in a continual state 
                                      of flux. Even now, many comparatively recent occurrences which 
                                      appeared for a little while to remain static are seen to have 
                                      been undergoing changes from moment to moment. One may wonder 
                                      what it is that remains immutable when every sort of material 
                                      and mental phenomenon seems to be invariably subject to the 
                                      process of change, of mutability. All of them are forever 
                                      arising, developing and passing away. In the vortex of all 
                                      these changes it is Truth alone which remains constant and 
                                      unalterable—in other words, the truth of righteousness 
                                      (Dharma) and its accompanying beneficial results, and the 
                                      truth of evil action and its accompanying harmful results. 
                                      A good cause produces a good result, a bad cause a bad result. 
                                      Good or bad, beneficial or harmful, every result necessarily 
                                      has a cause. This principle alone is abiding, immutable and 
                                      constant. It was so before man entered the world, in the early 
                                      period of his existence, in the present age, and it will be 
                                      so in all ages to come.</p>
              <p>All of us desire happiness and the avoidance of suffering 
                                      and of everything else that is unpleasant. Pleasure and pain 
                                      arise from a cause, as we all know. Whether certain consequences 
                                      are due to a single cause or to a group of causes is determined 
                                      by the nature of those consequences. In some cases, even if 
                                      the cause factors are neither powerful nor numerous, it is 
                                      still possible for the effect factors to occur. Whatever the 
                                      quality of the result factors, whether they are good or bad, 
                                      their magnitude and intensity directly correspond to the quantity 
                                      and strength of the cause factors. Therefore, for success 
                                      in avoiding unwished- for pains and in acquiring desired pleasures, 
                                      which is in itself no small matter, the relinquishment of 
                                      a great number of collective cause factors is required.</p>
              <p>In analyzing the nature and state of happiness, it will 
                                      he apparent that it has two aspects. One is immediate joy 
                                      (temporary); the other is future joy (ultimate). Temporary 
                                      pleasures comprise the comforts and enjoyments which people 
                                      crave, such as good dwellings, lovely furniture, delicious 
                                      food, good company, pleasant conversation and so on. In other 
                                      words, temporary pleasures are what man enjoys in this life. 
                                      The question as to whether the enjoyment of these pleasures 
                                      and satisfactions derives purely from external factors needs 
                                      to be examined in the light of clear logic. If external factors 
                                      were alone responsible for giving rise to such pleasures a 
                                      person would be happy when these were present and, conversely, 
                                      unhappy in their absence. However, this is not so. For, even 
                                      in the absence of external conditions leading to pleasure, 
                                      a man can still be happy and at peace. This demonstrates that 
                                      external factors are not alone responsible for stimulating 
                                      man's happiness. Were it true that external factors were solely 
                                      responsible for, or that they wholly conditioned the arising 
                                      of, pleasure and happiness, a person possessing an abundance 
                                      of these factors would have illimitable joy, which is by no 
                                      means always so. It is true that these external factors do 
                                      make partial contribution to the creation of pleasure in a 
                                      man's lifetime. However, to state that the external factors 
                                      are all that is needed and therefore the exclusive cause of 
                                      happiness in a man's span of life is an obtuse and illogical 
                                      proposition. It is by no means sure that the presence of such 
                                      external factors will beget joy. On the contrary, factual 
                                      happenings such as the experiencing of inner beatitude and 
                                      happiness despite the total absence of such pleasure-causing 
                                      external factors, and the frequent absence of joy despite 
                                      their presence, clearly show the cause of happiness to depend 
                                      upon a different set of conditioning factors.</p>
              <p>If one were to be misled by the argument that the above-mentioned 
                                      conditioning factors constitute the sole cause of happiness 
                                      to the preclusion of any other conditioning causes, that would 
                                      imply that (resulting) happiness is inseparably bound to external 
                                      causal factors, its presence or absence being exclusively 
                                      determined by them. The fact that this is obviously not so 
                                      is a sufficient proof that external causal factors are not 
                                      necessarily or wholly responsible for the effect phenomena 
                                      of happiness.</p>
              <p>Now what is that other internal set of causes? How are they 
                                      to be explained? As Buddhists, we all believe in the Law of 
                                      Karma—the natural law of cause and effect. Whatever external 
                                      causal conditions someone comes across in subsequent lives 
                                      result from the accumulation of that individual's actions 
                                      in previous lives. When the karmic force of past deeds reaches 
                                      maturity a person experiences pleasurable and unpleasurable 
                                      mental states. They are but a natural sequence of his own 
                                      previous actions. The most important thing to understand is 
                                      that, when suitable (karmic) conditions resulting from the 
                                      totality of past actions are there, one's external factors 
                                      are bound to be favourable. The coming into contact of conditions 
                                      due to (karmic) action and external causal factors will produce 
                                      a pleasurable mental state. If the requisite causal conditions 
                                      for experiencing interior joy are lacking there will be no 
                                      opportunity for the occurrence of suitable external conditioning 
                                      factors or, even if these external conditioning factors are 
                                      present, it will not be possible for the person to experience 
                                      the joy that would otherwise be his. This shows that inner 
                                      causal conditions are essential in that these are what principally 
                                      determine the realization of happiness (and its opposite). 
                                      Therefore, in order to achieve the desired results it is imperative 
                                      for us to accumulate both the cause-creating external factors 
                                      and the cause-creating internal (karmic) conditioning factors 
                                      at the same time.</p>
              <p>To state the matter in simple terms, for the accrual of 
                                      good inner (karmic) conditioning factors, what are principally 
                                      needed are such qualities as having few wants, contentment, 
                                      humility, simplicity and other noble qualities. Practice of 
                                      these inner causal conditions will even facilitate changes 
                                      in the aforementioned external conditioning factors that will 
                                      convert them into characteristics conducive to the arising 
                                      of happiness. The absence of suitable inner causal conditions, 
                                      such as having few wants contentment, patience, forgiveness 
                                      and so on, will prevent one from enjoying pleasure even if 
                                      all the right external conditioning factors are present. Besides 
                                      this, one must have to one's credit the force of merits and 
                                      virtues accumulated in past lives. Otherwise, the seeds of 
                                      happiness will not bear fruit.</p>
              <p>The matter can be put in another way. The pleasures and 
                                      frustrations, the happiness and suffering experienced by each 
                                      individual are the inevitable fruits of beneficial and evil 
                                      actions he has perpetrated, thus adding to his store. If at 
                                      a particular moment in this present life the fruits of a person's 
                                      good actions ripen he will recognize, if he is a wise man, 
                                      that they are the fruits of (past) meritorious deeds. This 
                                      will gratify him and encourage him to achieve more merits. 
                                      Similarly, when a person happens to experience pain and dissatisfaction, 
                                      he will be able to bear them calmly if he maintains an unshakable 
                                      conviction that, whether he wishes it or not, he must suffer 
                                      and bear the consequences of his own (past) deeds, notwithstanding 
                                      the fact that normally he will often find the intensity and 
                                      extent of his frustration hard to bear. Besides, the realization 
                                      that they are nothing but the fruits of unskilled action in 
                                      the past will make him wise enough to desist from unskilled 
                                      deeds henceforth. Likewise, the satisfying thought that, with 
                                      the ripening of past (evil) karma, a certain part of the evil 
                                      fruit accrued by former unskilled action has been worked off 
                                      will be a source of immense relief to him.</p>
              <p>A proper appreciation of this wisdom will contribute to 
                                      grasping the essentials for achieving peace of mind and body. 
                                      For instance, suppose a person is suddenly afflicted with 
                                      critical physical suffering due to certain external factors. 
                                      If, by the force of sheer will power (based on the conviction 
                                      that he is himself responsible for his present misery and 
                                      sufferings), he can neutralize the extent of his suffering 
                                      then his mind will be much comforted and at peace.</p>
              <p>Now let me explain this at a rather higher level. This concerns 
                                      the strivings and efforts that can be made for the systematic 
                                      destruction of dissatisfaction and its causes.</p>
              <p>As stated before, pleasure and pain, happiness and dissatisfaction 
                                      are the effects of one's own good and bad, skilled and unskilled 
                                      actions. Skillful and unskillful (karmic) actions are not 
                                      external phenomena. They belong essentially to the realm of 
                                      mind. Making strenuous efforts to build up every possible 
                                      kind of skillful karma and to put every vestige of unskillful 
                                      karma away from us is the path to creating happiness and avoiding 
                                      the creation of pain and suffering. For it is inevitable that 
                                      a happy result follows a skillful cause and that the consequence 
                                      of building up unskillful causes is suffering.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that we strive 
                                      by every possible means to increase the quality and quantity 
                                      of skillful actions and to make a corresponding paring down 
                                      of our unskillful actions.</p>
              <p>How is this to be accomplished? Meritorious and unmeritorious 
                                      causes which result in pleasure and pain do not resemble external 
                                      objects. For instance, in the human bodily system different 
                                      parts such as lungs, heart and other organs can be replaced 
                                      with new ones. But this is not so in the case of karmic actions, 
                                      which are purely of the mind. The earning of fresh merits 
                                      and the eradicating of bad causes are purely mental processes. 
                                      They cannot be achieved with outside help of any kind. The 
                                      only way to accomplish them is by controlling and disciplining 
                                      the hitherto untamed mind. For this, we require a fuller comprehension 
                                      of the element called mind.</p>
              <p>Through the gates of the five sense organs a being sees,
                                      
                                      hears, smells, tastes and comes into contact with a host
                                      of 
                                      external forms, objects and impressions. Let the form, sound,
                                      
                                      smell, taste, touch and mental events which are the relations
                                      
                                      of the six senses be shut off. When this is done the recollection
                                      
                                      of past events on which the mind tends to dwell will be completely
                                      
                                      discontinued and the flow of memory cut off. Similarly, plans
                                      
                                      for the future and contemplation of future action must not
                                      
                                      be allowed to arise. It is necessary to create a space in
                                      
                                      place of all such processes of thought if one is to empty
                                      
                                      the mind of all such processes of thought. Freed from all
                                      
                                      these processes there will remain a pure, clean, distinct
                                      
                                      and quiescent mind. Now let us examine what sort of characteristics
                                      
                                      constitute the mind when it has attained this stage. We surely
                                      
                                      do possess some thing called mind, but how are we to recognize
                                      
                                      its existence? The real and essential mind is what is to
                                      be 
                                      found when the entire load of gross obstructions and aberrations
                                      
                                      (i.e. sense impressions, memories, etc.) has been cleared
                                      
                                      away. Discerning this aspect of real mind, we shall discover
                                      
                                      that, unlike external objects, its true nature is devoid
                                      of 
                                      form or color; nor can we find any basis of truth for such
                                      
                                      false and deceptive notions as that mind originated from
                                      this 
                                      or that, or that it will move from here to there, or that
                                      
                                      it is located in such-and-such a place. When it comes into
                                      
                                      contact with no object mind is like a vast, boundless void,
                                      
                                      or like a serene, illimitable ocean. When it encounters an
                                      
                                      object it at once has cognizance of it, like a mirror instantly
                                      
                                      reflecting a person who stands in front of it. The true nature
                                      
                                      of mind consists not only in taking clear cognizance of the
                                      
                                      object but also in communicating a concrete experience of
                                      
                                      that object to the one experiencing it.<a href="http://www.lamayeshe.com/otherteachers/hhdl/happinesskarma.shtml#note">*</a> Normally, our forms of sense cognition, such as eye-consciousness,
                                      
                                      ear-consciousness, etc., perform their functions on external
                                      
                                      phenomena in a manner involving gross distortion. Knowledge
                                      
                                      resulting from sense cognition, being based on gross external
                                      
                                      phenomena, is also of a gross nature. When this type of gross
                                      
                                      stimulation is shut out, and when concrete experiences and
                                      
                                      clear cognizance arise from within, mind assumes the characteristics
                                      
                                      of infinite void similar to the infinitude of space. But
                                      this 
                                      void is not to be taken as the true nature of mind. We have
                                      
                                      become so habituated to consciousness of the form and color
                                      
                                      of gross objects that, when we make concentrated introspection
                                      
                                      into the nature of mind, it is, as I have said, found to
                                      be 
                                      a vast, limitless void free from any gross obscurity or other
                                      
                                      hindrances. Nevertheless, this does not mean that we have
                                      
                                      discerned the subtle, true nature of the mind. What has been
                                      
                                      explained above concerns the state of mind in relation to
                                      
                                      the concrete experience and clear cognizance by the mind
                                      which 
                                      are its function, but it describes only the relative nature
                                      
                                      of mind.</p>
              <p>There are in addition several other aspects and states of 
                                      mind. In other words, taking mind as the supreme basis, there 
                                      are many attributes related to it. Just as an onion consists 
                                      of layer upon layer that can be peeled away, so does every 
                                      sort of object have a number of layers; and this is no less 
                                      true of the nature of mind as explained here; it, too, has 
                                      layer within layer, slate within state.</p>
              <p>All compounded things are subject to disintegration. Since 
                                      experience and knowledge are impermanent and subject to disintegration, 
                                      the mind, of which they are functions (nature), is not something 
                                      that remains constant and eternal. From moment to moment it 
                                      undergoes change and disintegration. This transience of mind 
                                      is one aspect of its nature. However, as we have observed, 
                                      its true nature has many aspects, including consciousness 
                                      of concrete experience and cognizance of objects. Now let 
                                      us make a further examination in order to grasp the meaning 
                                      of the subtle essence of such a mind. Mind came into existence 
                                      because of its own cause. To deny that the origination of 
                                      mind is dependent on a cause, or to say that it is a designation 
                                      given as a means of recognizing the nature of mind aggregates, 
                                      is not correct. With our superficial observance, mind, which 
                                      has concrete experience and clear cognizance as its nature, 
                                      appears to be a powerful, independent, subjective, completely 
                                      ruling entity. However, deeper analysis will reveal that this 
                                      mind, possessing as it does the function of experience and 
                                      cognizance, is not a self-created entity but Is dependent 
                                      on other factors for its existence. Hence it depends on something 
                                      other than itself. This non-independent quality of the mind 
                                      substance is its true nature which in turn is the ultimate 
                                      reality of the self.</p>
              <p>Of these two aspects, viz. the ultimate true nature of mind 
                                      and a knowledge of that ultimate true nature, the former is 
                                      the base, the latter an attribute. Mind (self) is the basis 
                                      and all its different states are attributes. However, the 
                                      basis and its attributes have from the first pertained to 
                                      the same single essence. The non-self-created (depending on 
                                      a cause other than itself) mind entity (basis) and its essence, 
                                      <em>sunyata</em>, have unceasingly existed as the one, same, 
                                      inseparable essence from beginningless beginning. The nature 
                                      of <em>sunyata</em> pervades all elements. As we are now and 
                                      since we cannot grasp or comprehend the indestructible, natural, 
                                      ultimate reality (<em>sunyata</em>) of our own minds, we continue 
                                      to commit errors and our defects persist.</p>
              <p>Taking mind as the subject and mind's ultimate reality as 
                                      its object, one will arrive at a proper comprehension of the 
                                      true essence of mind, i.e. its ultimate reality. And when, 
                                      after prolonged patient meditation, one comes to perceive 
                                      and grasp at the knowledge of mind's ultimate reality which 
                                      is devoid of dual characteristics, one will gradually be able 
                                      to exhaust the delusions and defects of the central and secondary 
                                      minds such as wrath, love of ostentation, jealousy, envy and 
                                      so on.</p>
              <p>Failure to identify the true nature of mind will be overcome 
                                      through acquisition of the power to comprehend its ultimate 
                                      reality. This will in turn eradicate lust and hatred and all 
                                      other secondary delusions emanating from the basic ones. Consequently, 
                                      there will be no occasion for accumulating demeritorious karma. 
                                      By this means the creation of (evil) karma affecting future 
                                      lives will be eliminated; one will be able to increase the 
                                      quality and quantity of meritorious causal conditioning and 
                                      to eradicate the creation of harmful causal conditioning affecting 
                                      future lives—apart from the bad karma accumulated earlier.</p>
              <p>In the practice of gaining a perfect knowledge of the true 
                                      nature of mind, strenuous and concentrated mental efforts 
                                      are required for comprehending the object. In our normal condition 
                                      as it is at present, when our mind comes into contact with 
                                      something it is immediately drawn to it. This makes comprehension 
                                      impossible. Therefore. in order to acquire great dynamic mental 
                                      power, the very maximum exertion is the first imperative. 
                                      For example, a big river flowing over a wide expanse of shallows 
                                      will have very little force, but when it passes through a 
                                      steep gorge all the water is concentrated in a narrow space 
                                      and therefore flows with great force. For a similar reason 
                                      all the mental distractions which draw the mind away from 
                                      the object of contemplation are to be avoided and the mind 
                                      kept steadily fixed upon it. Unless this is done, the practice 
                                      for gaining a proper understanding of the true nature of mind 
                                      will be a total failure.</p>
              <p>To make the mind docile, it is essential for us to discipline 
                                      and control it well. Speech and bodily activities which accompany 
                                      mental processes, must not be allowed to run on in an indiscreet, 
                                      unbridled, random way. Just as a trainer disciplines and calms 
                                      a wild and willful steed by subjecting it to skillful and 
                                      prolonged training, so must the wild, wandering, random activities 
                                      of body and speech be tamed to make them docile, righteous 
                                      and skillful. Therefore the Teachings of the Lord Buddha comprise 
                                      three graded categories, that is <em>sila</em> (training in 
                                      higher conduct), <em>samadhi</em> (training in higher meditation) 
                                      and <em>prajna</em> (training in higher wisdom), all of them 
                                      for disciplining the mind.</p>
              <p>By studying, meditating and practising the three grades 
                                      of <em>trisiksa</em> in this way, one accomplishes progressive 
                                      realization. A person so trained will be endowed with the 
                                      wonderful quality of being able to bear patiently the miseries 
                                      and suffering which are the fruit of his past karma. He will 
                                      regard his misfortunes as blessings in disguise, for they 
                                      will enlighten him as to the meaning of nemesis (karma) and 
                                      convince him of the need to concentrate on performing only 
                                      meritorious deeds. If his past (evil) karma has not as yet 
                                      borne fruit, it will still be possible for him to obliterate 
                                      this unripe karma by utilizing the strength of the four powers, 
                                      namely: determination to attain the status of Buddhahood; 
                                      determination to eschew demeritorious deeds, even at the cost 
                                      of one's life; the performance of meritorious deeds; repentance.</p>
              <p>Such is the way to attain immediate happiness, to pave the 
                                      way for attaining liberation in future and to help avoid the 
                                      accumulation of further demerits.</p>
