He told me that it is very unhealthy to always eat those mock meat kind of food. In fact, if a person eats those everyday, he will even grow more unhealthier than meat eating people!! Or some of them eat very very oily food even though vegetarian, like everyday eat vegetarian bee hoon? (sorry cant remember isit bee hoon, i tink it is) and cause many health problems.<br><br>However, if a person knows the right balanced diet, vegetarianism will definitely be beneficial to health, and in the long run. I know of many monks and vegetarians who live till a very old age.<br><br>Vegetarianism, if you ask me, is vital if you wish to practise as a Bodhisattva because by eating meat it prevents you from cultivating Great Compassion. If you are from the Mahayana tradition you would be advised to take up vegetarianism.<br><br>If there are any vegetarians viewing this forum, could pls offer advise on vegetarian diet. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Does a vegetarian diet contribute to high uric acid?<br><br>Q. I am a 63 year old, fit person. My height is 6.9 and weight around 79 kgs. I go for 6-8 kms brisk walk 4 times a week. I am a vegetarian and avoid fried/oily/fast food and drink lots of water. However, for the last 5-6 years I am suffering from high uric acid, gout and stone formation in the body. My gallbladder and one of the salivary glands have already been surgically removed due to stones. Stone was also seen in one kidney 3 years ago but fortunately it got washed out by drinking lots of water. My uric acid level is mostly moderately high (around 7.5 at worst) but my big toe or ankle gets swollen/inflammed quite frequently. I have started taking 1 zyloric tablet (100mg) daily which helps partly. Are there some vegetarian items (vegetable or pulses) which could create this problem? Could taking red wine even in moderation aggravate uric acid/gout and stone formation? Is taking 1 Zyloric tablet/day harmful in the long run?<br><br>A. Actually most people with hyperuricemia (increased uric acid) do not develop gout. Therefore it is not necessarily the high level of uric acid causing gout but perhaps a rapid change in its level. Gout attacks can be precipitated by dehydration, injury, fever, heavy eating, moderate to heavy drinking of alcohol, and recent surgery. Other contributory factors include obesity, weight gain, high blood pressure, abnormal kidney function, and drugs. Please ask your doctor if our kidney function has recently been checked and if it is normal. Since you are vegetarian, you already consume diet which is not high in purine but for more detailed listing please see below. Prevention of acute gout involves: maintaining adequate fluid intake; weight reduction; dietary changes (given below); reduction in alcohol consumption; medications to reduce hyperuricemia. According to the American Medical Association (AMA), purine-containing foods include: Beer, other alcoholic beverages. Anchovies, sardines in oil, fish roes, herring. Yeast. Organ meat (liver, kidneys, sweetbreads) Legumes (dried beans, peas) Meat extracts, consomme, gravies. Mushrooms, spinach, asparagus, auliflower.<br><br>Foods which may be beneficial to people with gout include: Dark berries (that may contain chemicals that lower uric acid and reduce inflammation). Tofu which is made from soybeans may be a better choice than meats. Certain fatty acids found in certain fish such as salmon, flax or<br><br>olive oil, or nuts may possess some anti-inflammatory benefits. As per the AMA, a balanced diet for people with gout include foods: High in complex carbohydrates (whole grains, fruits, vegetables), low in protein (15% of calories and sources should be soy, lean meats, poultry), No more than 30%<br><br>of calories from fat (10% animal fat).<br><br>NATURAL TREATMENTS FOR GOUT<br><br>Check your medications to see if they are having any effect on your gout attack. Discuss them with your doctor. For pain relief rely on ibuprofen (Nuprin, Advil, etc.) but not aspirin (which can worsen symptoms) or acetaminophen (which is less effective). If you need a stronger, anti-inflammatory, consult your doctor. Adopt a low-purine diet, that is, one that eliminates foods that promote the production of uric add, including anchovies, shellfish, smoked meat, meat extracts, mincemeat that contains real meat, kidneys, liver, brains, sweetbreads, sardines, mackerel, yeast (bakers and brewers), asparagus, mushrooms, and dried peas. Increase your fruit and vegetable consumption. Eliminate alcohol from your diet: Be sure to drink adequate fluids: 3 quarts liquid daily. Adopt stress-reducing techniques. Eat one-half pound of cherries each day, either canned, frozen, or fresh, If you dont notice reduction of symptoms in a week or two, discontinue. Eliminate or reduce niacin; don't take more than 100 mg. daily. Don't take more than 5,000 I.U. of vitamin A daily, and if attacks continue, eliminate vitamin A intake entirely..<br><br>17 May, 2004<br>Answered by<br>Dr. Naveen Atray<br>Asst.

            <div class='col-md body'>to be vegetarian yet greedily attached to delicious aromas, flavours, tasty looking dishes only serves to arouse and deepen one's cravings. pure practice of buddhism is based on renunciation, thus a true cultivator who practices vegetarianism does not eagerly seek delightful cuisine, rather he / she takes only enough to fill one's stomach, the more bland plain and simple the dish the better. This is the viewpoint according to Mahayana sutra teachings, which utilizes prajna or wisdom to generate the neccessary level of renunciation.<br><br>For the karuna or compassion aspect of being a vegetarian, one may think of the terrible sufferings inherent in the animal kingdom, such as their fear of being killed, fear of starvation, being subject to the mercy of hunters and being reared in abject conditions. In addition, one may also think of the way the animals are processed and killed in our abattoirs and kitchens, such as frogs being skinned alive, monkeys having their brains eaten whilst still struggling in their tiny cages, crabs being cleaved in two, prawns being boiled alive, pigs and cattle being killed in pools of blood despite tears of sorrow seeking the butcher's mercy etc. Thinking of the millions of animals and insects being killed daily simply for our eating pleasures, one should thus abstain from eating their flesh and bodies out of compassion for their sufferings.<br><br>For Vajrayana practitioners, it is the motivation behind one's thoughts, speech and actions that matter. Provided one has sufficient spiritual attainment eg. pure bodhicitta, the sentient beings whose meat are being eaten can actually be liberated though contact with the tantric practitioner. However this can only be done by bodhisattvas and high realized tantrikas. Ordinary lay followers must not assume they have the same spiritual power. Otherwise it becomes another excuse to feast on meat and fall into lower realms.</div>

The Chinese words I Kuan Tao can be roughly translated as the Religion of One Unity. It is a religious doctrine that draws upon both traditional Chinese teachings and each of the world's major religions. This religion attempts to identify common principles underlying Taoism, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Hinduism. Tian Tao believes that by uncovering a single set of universal truths, the "increasing chaos" of modern times can be defeated and the world can live peacefully in harmony. They believe in a God beyond all other gods, called Ming-ming Shang-ti (the God of Clarity).<br><br>It may have its roots with the Bai Lian Jiao (White Lotus Sect) which created several political unrests for both the Qing court (1644 - 1911) and foreign powers, such as the British, French and so forth who have seized the lands from the hands of the Qing court since the Opium War. Bai Lian Jiao is closely related to the Chinese Christian cult, Tai Ping Tian Guo, founded by Hong Xiu Quan, in the late Qing dynasty. Hong Xiu Quan believed himself as Jesus Christ's heavenly brother, which was sent to Earth by Lord God to liberate Chinese people from imperial oppression. Lands were belonged by Lord God and not the Qing court, hence poor and uneducated peasants in ten of thousands accepted his teachings. Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching, the Minister of State for Tai Ping Tian Guo, tried to seize the power and authority of Emperor Hong Xiu Quan. To legitimize his authority, he occasionally lapsed into trances in which his voice supposedly became that of the Lord's. In one of his trances, Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching claimed that the Lord demanded Hong Xiu Quan be whipped for kicking one of his concubines. Emperor Hong Xiu Quan had Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching murdered by Wei Chang Hui, a Tai Ping Tian Guo general. The followers of Heavenly King Yang Xiu Ching later formed the Bai Lian Jiao.<br><br>Another source stated that Tian Tao was evolved from Xian Tian Tao which was founded by 9th Patriarch Huang De Hui of the Shun Zhi period of Qing Dynasty. Huang De Hui combined the three main belief systems of China with a belief in the Wu Sheng Lao Mu (Great Mother) to form Xian Tian Tao. Bodhidharma is credited as the 1st Patriarch, the first five Chinese Chan Patriarchs are credited as 2nd to 6th Patriarchs. Bai Ma became the 7th Patriarch and the 8th Patriarch is Luo Wei Qun. The lines of patriarch of Xian Tian Tao continue into the present I Kuan Tao. The 15th Patriarch had made some major changes in the formulas and goals of Xian Tian Tao. And it is the 16th Patriarch Liu Ching Xu renamed the group as I Kuan Tao. The 18th Patriarch is the last in line of the patriarchs.<br><br>The followers of I Kuan Tao claimed that it is a distinguished lineage back over 2000 years when it begins from the ancient Chinese astrolgers, emperors, Confucius, and so forth. From 18th Ancient Patriarch Mencius, the lineage travels to the west, the lineage began from Shakyamuni Buddha, Mahakashyapa to 28th Indian Patriarch Bodhidharma. But the modern practice of Tian Tao, as we know it today, was established about 70 years ago. In the 1930, Shi Zueng Zhang Tian Ran and Shi Mu Sun Hui Ming, became the 18th Patriarch and started their practice I Kuan Tao in Chi Nan City, Shang Dong Province of China. Their work spread by word of mouth, and by 1946 I Kuan Tao became prevalent among 36 provinces of China. At the end of the Civil War in 1949, many followers in China found their beliefs incompatible with Communist doctrines. This and other reasons compelled large numbers of them to emigrate to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Tian Tao quickly took root in these new lands, spreading with its teachings Chinese culture and traditional family values. By increasing the number of I Kuan Tao temples, they believed that they are bringing the Buddhist "Western Paradise" to earth and creating a world of brotherhood and universal love as envisioned by Confucian teachings.<br><br>Today, they have about 4,500,000 followers in Taiwan, Korea and Japan; about 2,000,000 followers in South East Asian countries; and a growing number of adherents in countries like Canada, USA, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Paraguay, Italy, France, Germany, Holland and United Kingdom. In Taiwan alone, there are over 200 large and medium-sized temples and over 30,000 family shrines.<br><br>Presently, they claimed that the founder, 17th Patriarch Lu Zhong Yi, was an incarnation of Maitreya. He has major influence and impact on the present form of I Kuan Tao. The central teaching of Tian Tao, is based on the initiation ceremony - a new formula on the Triple Gem, namely: 1. Opening of Heavenly Eye (Dian Xuan Dao), 2. Oral Transmission of the Maitreya prayer (Chuan Ko Jue), and 3. Hand Gestures (Jie He Tong). They believe that the recipient has obtained the Tao and that his name has been reserved in the heaven and erased from the lists in hell. Upon death, the recipient will ascend straight to heaven without having to endure the cycles of rebirth.<br><br>The followers of this organization must be a strict vegetarian. It is said that they will not teach and liberate three groups of people: they are butchers, fishermen and prostitutes.<br><br>Usually, their temples are painted in pure white. And they have large followers in Asia. Their selection for potential followers are very strict. Non-members of this organization are not allowed to step into their temple compound. They can only enter the temple compound through the invitation from the senior members. On the day itself, the new recruit will make to vow to keep secrets on what he/she has learnt from the temple. Why? Without asking of consert, he/she is sent to receive the "secret" formula, so-called "Triple Gem". If he/she has failed to keep the secrets, and leaked out these secrets to non-members, he/she will be killed by the 5 heavenly thunders (Wu Lei Hong Ding).</blockquote></div>

There are few popular ones. For example:<br><br>1. "Maitreya Sutra" (Chinese: Mi Le Zhen Jing) is their own version of Maitreyavyakarana Sutra. It is said that this scripture was spoken by the Buddha. It talks about the benefit on having faith on Maitreya Buddha. The retinue of protectors are non-Buddhist ones, most of them are from the Chinese folk religions and not to mention the main character, Lao Mu who is Wu Sheng Lao Mu in short.<br><br>2. "The Travelogue for the Hell" (Chinese: Ti Yu You Ji) revealed by Ji Gong, a Chinese folk religion deity whose origin is unknown. This work explains about hell.<br><br>These books can be found in the free book distribution corners in the Chinese folk religion temples.<br><br>"The group is known as Ee Kwang Tao. I was invited to attend the opening of one of their 'Holy Houses'. It was one of the strangest rituals that i have ever witnessed. Following the ritual we were invited to go before the 'Master' to receive initiation. I declined on the grounds that I had been invited to attend the opening but not to join anything. After a while they approached me again and they said that the 'Master' was waiting for me and I MUST go before the 'Master'. I replied that I must not do anything of the sort as I am a traditional Buddhist and had no wish to join their organisation. I thanked them for their hospitality and said that I was leaving. As each person arrived they took their name. As I left they asked me for my name as they said that the names were being sent to heaven and, as I refused initiation, my name would have to be struck off the list. I consulted a Chinese friend about my experience and he immediately identified it as the Ee Kwang Tao cult which, as was said, is proliferating in Australia. The initiates are sworn to secrecy with the threat of harm to themselves and their family if the secrets are revealed. This dangerous cult bears no relation to Buddhism so beware of them."<br>Graeme Lyall (Australia), 1999.<br><br>At times, their activities are not restricted in the temple compounds. In Singapore, the very senior members who hold the posts of "Tang Zhu", can convert the new comers in their own houses. The main Singapore centre is located at Bukit Merah Central, and it is known as "Chong Hua Tong Tou Teck Hwee Building". You can see the name of the building at the main gate. It is also stated that it is "strictly for members". Their first centre was located at Upper Serangoon Road, and was demolished recently. And there are many smaller temples or community welfare centres scattered around Singapore. They are registered with Registry of Society as "Xin Jia Bo Zhong Hua Tang Dao De Hui" (Sing Gah Ball Chong Hua Tong Tou Teck Hwee) and they also work hand-in-hand with "De Jiao" founded by Thye Hua Kwan Moral Society and also with Chee Hoon Kog Moral Promotion Society for those community welfare services.<br><br>The other schools which are evolved from Xian Tian Tao, are Tung Shan She, Tien De Sheng Jiao, Tao Yuan and Tzu Hui Tang. They are independent groups and do not share the same leadership. 1 </blockquote></div>

I seldom hear about this... </div></blockquote>I was telling a friend here in sgforums, hopefully that friend is not offended by what I said...<br><br>Buddhism and I Kuan Dao is very different. Buddhism asks its disciples to make Bodhisattva vows of great compassion to liberate both himself and other sentient beings and eventually attain Buddhahood... whereas I Kuan Dao makes very different kind of 'swearings'. (swearing by their god for their lives/else get struck by lightning etc)<br><br>There are some ex-i kuan dao in my dharma centre who were a little scared initially because of the swearings they made.. but they're fine now, nothing has happened to them. One of them turned to Buddhism after he was 'chosen' to be the one choosing who to go to heaven (certain higher ranked ppl in i kuan dao can initiate a person so that he will be destined to go to heaven). He found it strange because he had no powers whatsoever, just an ordinary person, yet how can he have the power to destine someone to heaven? That is how he came into Buddhism. I personally believe a religion should not use fear to control their followers...<br><br>Plus their version of Maitreya is not orthodox. According Buddhist scriptures Maitreya Buddha will only come down after 5,670,000,000 years. At such a time lifespan will be uncountable (i.e 84000), human height will be 160 feet tall, there will be high technologies, no crimes, no wars, and four planets will unite under one rule. That is the time when Maitreya Buddha arrives - a time when Pure Land in the human world is established.<br><br>Regarding Maitreya, please read <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no3a.htm" rel="nofollow">The Next Buddha</a></div>
