Bo bian. Unless you find ways to siam army. If not the fundamental of any army is to kill what.<br><br>Second thing, probably there are some constraints into removing the bees' habitat and that 'killing each bee on sight' turns out to be the most <strong>practical</strong> solution to your company.<br><br>Everyone sees things from different perspective and from a norm people point of view, there is no way that you could convince them into not killing the bees as they may pose a certain risk to their lives!<br><br>However if you're really uncomfortable in the killing, you can sound out to your instructor and then the rest is up to your own call.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well. all i can say is, if u really have to kill, then just pray that it gets reborn ASAP, in a higher realm.<br><br>My parents often kill those cockroaches, lizards and other insects then got into the house, i can't do much as me too, is scared of them. But after they've been killed, i'd pray for them, wish them all the best and to be reborn in a higher realm.</div>
