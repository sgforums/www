              <p><strong>May all these blessed Buddhas and all others dwelling in</strong> <br><strong>       the ten directions of the world
              of existence, the</strong> <br><strong>       Tathagatas, Arhats, perfectly
              and fully enlightened</strong> <br><strong>       Buddhas give heed to me.</strong> <br><strong>In this life, and in all my lives without beginning and end,</strong> <br><strong>Whatever unwholesomeness I did in each of these worldly lives</strong> <br><strong>       in samsara,</strong> <br><strong>Whatever I caused others to do,</strong> <br><strong>Or rejoiced in their doing.</strong> <br><strong>I extorted offerings for stupas,</strong> <br><strong>Offerings for the Sangha,</strong> <br><strong>Offerings for the Sangha of the ten directions,</strong> <br><strong>Caused others to extort,</strong> <br><strong>Or rejoiced in others' extortion.</strong> <br><strong>I committed the actions of the five irredeemable sins,</strong> <br><strong>Caused others to commit them,</strong> <br><strong>Or rejoiced in others committing them.</strong> <br><strong>I completely engaged in the path of the ten unwholesome actions,</strong> <br><strong>Caused others to be engaged,</strong> <br><strong>Or rejoiced in others' engagement.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Obscured by these obscuring actions,</strong> <br><strong>I and living beings will fall into hell,</strong> <br><strong>Fall into the birthplace of animals,</strong> <br><strong>Fall into the realm of hungry ghosts,</strong> <br><strong>Be born in the land of barbarians,</strong> <br><strong>Be born as savages,</strong> <br><strong>Be born as long-lived gods,</strong> <br><strong>Become one with defective senses,</strong> <br><strong>Become one who holds wrong views,</strong> <br><strong>Or become one whose obscuring actions displease the Buddha</strong> <br><strong>       when He appears.</strong> <br><strong>I confess these and all others before the Blessed Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>Who are transcendent wisdom,</strong> <br><strong>Who are eyes, who are witnesses,</strong> <br><strong>Who are perfect,</strong> <br><strong>Knowers,</strong> <br><strong>Seers,</strong> <br><strong>Without hiding, or concealing,</strong> <br><strong>Henceforth I will cease and refrain.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May all these blessed Buddhas give heed to me.</strong> <br><strong>In this life, and in all my lives without beginning and end,</strong> <br><strong>In each of these worldly lives in samsara.</strong> <br><strong>Whatever roots of virtue arise from my gift of even a mouthful</strong> <br><strong>       of food to an animal,</strong> <br><strong>Whatever roots of virtue arise from my preserving morality,</strong> <br><strong>Whatever roots of virtue arise from my completely maturing</strong> <br><strong>       beings,</strong> <br><strong>Whatever roots of virtue arise from my generating supreme</strong> <br><strong>       enlightenment thought,</strong> <br><strong>All of these, gathered, combined, and added,</strong> <br><strong>I completely dedicate to the highest,</strong> <br><strong>Supreme,</strong> <br><strong>Supremest of the supreme,</strong> <br><strong>Highest of the high,</strong> <br><strong>Unsurpassable, perfect, and full enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>However the blessed Buddhas of the past dedicated,</strong> <br><strong>However the blessed Buddhas of the future will dedicate,</strong> <br><strong>However the blessed Buddhas of the present are dedicating,</strong> <br><strong>So do I completely dedicate.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I confess each and every sin.</strong> <br><strong>I rejoice in all virtues.</strong> <br><strong>I request and beseech all the Buddhas.</strong> <br><strong>May I attain the unsurpassable transcendent wisdom which</strong> <br><strong>       is holy and supreme.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I fold my hands and reverently take refuge</strong> <br><strong>In all those victorious supreme beings of the present,</strong> <br><strong>Those who have passed, and those who have yet to come,</strong> <br><strong>Whose good qualities are praised as a boundless ocean.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All Bodhisattvas who possess the power of compassion,</strong> <br><strong>Heroes who benefit and protect living beings,</strong> <br><strong>Protect me who is protectorless and full of sin.</strong> <br><strong>All Bodhisattvas, grant me refuge.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The three forms of action of the body,</strong> <br><strong>Four forms of the voice,</strong> <br><strong>Three forms of the mind,</strong> <br><strong>I confess each of these ten non-virtues.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From beginningless time until now,</strong> <br><strong>With mind governed by negative emotions,</strong> <br><strong>I have committed the ten non-virtues and five heinous crimes.</strong> <br><strong>I confess all and each of these non-virtues.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All of whatever slight virtues that I may have gathered</strong> <br><strong>     through prostrating, offering, confessing,
              rejoicing,</strong> <br><strong>     requesting, and beseeching,</strong> <br><strong>I dedicate to the attainment of enlightenment perfect and great.</strong>  </p>

              on the</strong> <strong>auspicious day of the Great Sakya Pandita, 1993, in Washington D.C.
              By this merit</strong> <strong>may all living beings purify negativity, accumulate virtue, and

              <img src="http://vajrasana.org/00075_8.jpg" alt=""> <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Sutra of the Heart of Perfection Wisdom</span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Bhagavati Prajnaparamita Hridaya</span></strong>
              <p><br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Invocation</span></strong> <br><br> <strong>Salutions to the mother of the Buddhas of the threefold time, the Wisdom
              Gone Beyond,</strong> <strong>inconceivable and inexpressible, like space its nature is unborn
              and unstopped.</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Heart Sutra</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Thus I have heard. Once the Blessed One was dwelling in the Royal
              Domain of the</strong> <strong>Vulture Peak Mountain together with a great assembly of monks and
              a great assembly</strong> <strong>of Bodhisattvas. At that time the Blessed One entered into the samadhi
              which examines</strong> <strong>Dharma known as the "Profound Illumination".</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Also at the time the Holy Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva Mahasattva,
              looked upon</strong> <strong>the profound course of the Perfection of Wisdom and beheld that
              the five aggregates</strong> <strong>were empty by their own nature.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then through the power of the Buddha, the elder Shariputra thus said
              to Holy</strong> <br><strong>Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, "How should those sons
              and</strong> <br><strong>daughters of good lineage who wish to practice the profound course
              of the</strong> <br><strong>Perfection of Wisdom train?"</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And the Holy Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva replied
              thus to elder</strong> <strong>Shariputra. "Shariputra, those sons and daughters of good lineage
              who wish to</strong> <strong>practice the profound course of the Perfection of Wisdom should
              look upon it like</strong> <strong>this: (they must) rightly see the five aggregates to be empty by
              their own nature.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Form is emptiness, emptiness is also form; emptiness is not different
              from form,</strong> <strong>and form is also not different from emptiness; in the same way,
              feeling, perception,</strong> <strong>predispositions and consciousness are empty.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Shariputra, likewise all Dharmas are empty without characteristics,
              unborn,</strong> <br><strong>unceasing, not impure, devoid of purity, not deficient, and not
              complete.</strong> <br><strong>Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling,
              no perception,</strong> <br><strong>no predispositions, no consciousness, no eye, no ear, no nose, no
              tongue, no</strong> <br><strong>body, no mind; no form, no sounds, no smells, no tastes, no touchables
              and</strong> <br><strong>no objects of mind; from no eye-sphere to no mind sphere, until
              (arriving at)</strong> <br><strong>no mind-consciousness element.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>There is no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance, no extinction
              of ignorance,</strong> <br><strong>and so forth up to no old age and death, no extinction of old age
              and death.</strong> <br><strong>Similarly, there is no suffering, origination, cessation and path;
              no transcendental</strong> <br><strong>knowledge, no attainment and also no non-attainment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Therefore, Shariputra, since there is no attainment, Bodhisattvas
              - by relying</strong> <br><strong>on the Perfection of Wisdom - are fearless through lacking obscurations
              of</strong> <br><strong>mind; they have passed well beyond the false and have achieved Nirvana.
              All</strong> <br><strong>the Buddhas of the three times also, having relied upon the Perfection
              of Wisdom,</strong> <strong>fully awake to the unsurpassable, right and complete Enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Therefore, the Mantra of the Perfection of Wisdom, the mantra of
              great knowledge,</strong> <strong>the unsurpassable mantra, the unequalled mantra, the mantra which
              pacifies all</strong> <strong>suffering, should be known as the Truth - for there is no deception.
              The mantra of</strong> <strong>the Perfection of Wisdom is pronounced thus:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>TADYATHA OM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATA BODHI SVAHA</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Shariputra, the profound Perfection of Wisdom should be learned in
              this way by the</strong> <strong>Bodhisattva-Mahasattva."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Then the Blessed One, having arisen from that samadhi, praised the
              Holy</strong> <br><strong>Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, saying, "Good, good
              son</strong> <br><strong>of good lineage, it is like that, like that; practicing the Profound
              Perfection</strong> <br><strong>of Wisdom just as you have shown makes the Tathagatas rejoice."</strong></p>
              <p><strong>When the Blessed One said this, the elder Shariputra, the Holy Avalokiteshvara,</strong> <strong>the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva, the entire assembly of gods, men, asuras
              and</strong> <strong>gandhavas rejoiced and praised the Blessed One.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>This completes the Sutra of the Perfection of Wisdom, the Holy!</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mantra Recitation</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>TADYATHA OM GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SVAHA</strong> <br><strong>(Recite 3 times)</strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Repelling Verses</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Namo</strong> <br><strong>Prostrations to the Guru,</strong> <br><strong>Prostrations to the Buddha,</strong> <br><strong>Prostrations to the Dharma,</strong> <br><strong>Prostrations to the Sangha,</strong> <br><strong>Prostrations to the Great Mother, the Perfection of wisdom.</strong> <br><strong>Relying upon the power and effectiveness of prostrating to you,</strong> <br><strong>May we accomplish this recitation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Just as the Lord of the gods, Shakra, previously relied upon the
              power and effectiveness</strong> <strong>of reciting and reflecting upon the profound meaning of the Great
              Mother, the Perfection</strong> <strong>of Wisdom, and so repelled maras and the like, likewise, I also
              rely upon the power and</strong> <strong>effectiveness of reciting and reflecting upon the profound meaning
              of the Perfection of</strong> <strong>Wisdom, and so may all unfavourable conditions for myself and my
              associates which</strong> <strong>should be abandon be repelled <em>(clap hands)</em>; may they be destroyed
              <em>(clap hands)</em>; may</strong> 
              <strong>they be allayed <em>(clap hands)</em>; may they be thoroughly allayed.</strong> <br><strong>(Recite three times from "Namo" to "thoroughly allayed")</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Through method, refuge and purification of the pure Mahayana,</strong> <br><strong>May the activities of Mara which completely deceive sentient beings
              be repelled.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Salutions to the ever-youthful Arya Manjushri!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>      With clarity of body, speech, and mind,</strong> <br><strong>       I bow without exception to
              all the lions among men</strong> <br><strong>      Of the past, present, and future,</strong> <br><strong>       In every world in all the ten

              <p><strong>       By the power of this Aspiration to Noble Deeds,</strong> <br><strong>       I manifest bodies as numerous

              of numberless victorious Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>       And I prostrate to all of them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>        I conceive the entire realm of truth</strong> <br><strong>       To be completely filled with
              enlightened ones.</strong> <br><strong>       There are as many Buddhas as
              atoms present in each atom,</strong> <br><strong>       Each Buddha surrounded by many

              <p><strong>       By the power of my faith in noble deeds</strong> <br><strong>       I prostrate and present</strong> <br><strong>       Vast and unequaled offerings</strong> <br><strong>       To each of the victorious Buddhas.</strong></p>

              the ten directions</strong> <br><strong>       To turn the peerless wheel
              of Dharma.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       With hands folded, I beseech</strong> <br><strong>       Those who intend to manifest
              the final nirvana</strong> <br><strong>       To remain for as many eons
              as there are atoms in all theBuddha lands,</strong> <br><strong>       To gladden and benefit all
              living beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May whatever little virtue I may have gained</strong> <br><strong>       From prostrating, offering,
              confessing,</strong> <br><strong>       Rejoicing, requesting, and
              beseeching,</strong> <br><strong>       Be dedicated to attain perfect
              enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I worship the Buddhas of the past, and those now present</strong> <br><strong>       In the worlds of the ten directions.</strong> <br><strong>       May those to come quickly fulfill
              their aspirations,</strong> <br><strong>       And reach Buddhahood by traversing
              the stages of enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May all the worlds of the ten directions</strong> <br><strong>       Become spacious, pure,</strong> <br><strong>       And filled with victorious
              Buddhas and Bodhisattvas,</strong> <br><strong>       Who proceed to the royal tree
              of enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><strong>        May all beings in the ten directions</strong> <br><strong>       Always be happy and free of
              sickness.</strong> <br><strong>       May their aspirations be in
              harmony with the dharma,</strong> <br><strong>       And may they fulfill their
              hopes.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>      May I perform all the deeds of enlightenment,</strong> <br><strong>       And remember my lives in all
              states of existence.</strong> <br><strong>       In all my lives, after death,
              migration, and rebirth,</strong> <br><strong>       May I always renounce the world.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I follow all the victorious Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>       And completely perfect all
              noble deeds.</strong> <br><strong>       Pure in the immaculate deeds
              of morality,</strong> <br><strong>       May my conduct always be flawless
              and without lapses.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I teach the Dharma in every tongue,</strong> <br><strong>       In whatever sounds are understood
              by living beings,</strong> <br><strong>       In the language of the gods,</strong> <br><strong>       Nagas, yakshas, spirits, and
              human beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I always diligently and patiently perform the perfections.</strong> <br><strong>       May I never forget enlightenment
              mind,</strong> <br><strong>       And completely remove</strong> <br><strong>       Whatever negativities may obscure
              it.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Freed from karma, defilements, and actions of demons,</strong> <br><strong>       As unsoiled by the mire,</strong> <br><strong>       So in every rebirth in the
              world, may I proceed unhindered,</strong> <br><strong>       Like the sun and moon in the
              sky.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Throughout all the lands in all the directions,</strong> <br><strong>       May the sufferings of the lower
              realms be completely relieved.</strong> <br><strong>       Establishing all beings in
              happiness,</strong> <br><strong>       May I work for the benefit
              of all living beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I fully accomplish the deeds of enlightenment,</strong> <br><strong>       Work in harmony with the deeds
              of all beings,</strong> <br><strong>       Thoroughly demostrate noble
              deeds,</strong> <br><strong>       And perform them through all
              future eons.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I always associate with those</strong> <br><strong>       Whose deeds are similar to
              mine.</strong> <br><strong>       May we act alike in thought,
              word, and deed,</strong> <br><strong>       And may our aspirations be
              as one.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May those friends who wish to help me,</strong> <br><strong>       And thoroughly demostrate noble
              deeds,</strong> <br><strong>       Always meet me again,</strong> <br><strong>       And may I never disappoint
              them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>      May I always personally behold the victorious Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>       Those guardians surrounded
              by Bodhisattvas,</strong> <br><strong>       And without tiring in all future
              eons,</strong> <br><strong>       May I always present them magnificent
              offerings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I always uphold the Buddhas' holy Dharma</strong> <br><strong>       And illuminate the deeds of
              enlightenment.</strong> <br><strong>       May I thoroughly train in noble
              deeds</strong> <br><strong>       In the future eons.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Through rebirth in all the states of existence,</strong> <br><strong>       May I gather endless stores
              of merit and wisdom.</strong> <br><strong>       May I become an inexhaustible
              treasure of</strong> <br><strong>       All virtues of method, wisdom,
              concentration, and freedom.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I always behold as many lands</strong> <br><strong>       As there are atoms present
              in each atom.</strong> <br><strong>       In each land countless Buddhas
              sitting in the midst of their Bodhisattvas,</strong> <br><strong>       And performing the deeds of
              enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       In this way may I be able to perform everywhere,</strong> <br><strong>       Even on every mote of dust,</strong> <br><strong>       The deeds of oceans of Buddhas
              of the past, present, and future,</strong> <br><strong>       In oceans of pure lands, and
              oceans of eons.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I always heed the pure speech of the victorious Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>       Which holds withtin each word
              the totality of the perfect Dharma,</strong> <br><strong>       An ocean of words and languages</strong> <br><strong>       Precisely suited to the needs
              of all beings.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I possess perfect intelligence</strong> <br><strong>       So as to heed the endless melody
              of speech,</strong> <br><strong>       When the victorious Buddhas
              of the past, present, and future</strong> <br><strong>       Turn the wheels of Dharma.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I enter all the past, present, and future eons</strong> <br><strong>       In a fraction of a second.</strong> <br><strong>       May I enter all future eons</strong> <br><strong>       In a single instant.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I behold all Lions among Men</strong> <br><strong>       Of the past, present, and future
              in a single instant.</strong> <br><strong>       May I always perform their
              activities</strong> <br><strong>       Through the power of liberation
              from illusion.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I perceive upon a single atom the perfect design</strong> <br><strong>       Of the pure realms of the past,
              present, and future.</strong> <br><strong>       Thus may I enter into the realms</strong> <br><strong>       Of the victorious Buddhas in
              all directions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I always be in the presence of the future illuminators
              of the worlds,</strong> <br><strong>       When they gradually reach the
              stages of Buddhahood,</strong> <br><strong>       Turn the wheel of Dharma,</strong> <br><strong>       And manifest the profound peace
              of nirvana.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I acquire the perfectly accomplished powers of enlightenment</strong> <br><strong>       The power of miraculous swiftness,</strong> <br><strong>       The power of the door to every
              spiritual path,</strong> <br><strong>       The power to manifest all virtuous
              qualities.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       The power of all-pervasive love,</strong> <br><strong>       The power of the merit of every
              virtue,</strong> <br><strong>       The power of wisdom which transcends
              all attachment,</strong> <br><strong>       And the powers of wisdom, method,
              and concentration.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May the power of action be utterly purified,</strong> <br><strong>       The power of defilements be
              utterly subdued,</strong> <br><strong>       The power of demons be utterly
              destroyed,</strong> <br><strong>       And the power of noble deeds
              be perfected.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May the ocean of lands be completely purified,</strong> <br><strong>       The ocean of beings completely
              liberated,</strong> <br><strong>       The ocean of Dharma fully understood,</strong> <br><strong>       And the ocean of wisdom fully
              attained.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May the ocean of deeds be completely purified,</strong> <br><strong>       The ocean of aspirations entirely
              accomplished,</strong> <br><strong>       The ocean of Buddhas ceaselessly
              worshipped,</strong> <br><strong>       And noble deeds tirelessly
              performed through oceans of eons.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       The victorious Buddhas of the past, present, and future</strong> <br><strong>       Attained enlightened Buddhahood</strong> <br><strong>       Through aspiration to the noble
              deeds of enlightenment.</strong> <br><strong>       May I accomplish all of those
              deeds without exception.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       The eldest son of all the victorious Buddhas</strong> <br><strong>       Is called Samantabhadra.</strong> <br><strong>       I dedicate all of these merits</strong> <br><strong>       That my deeds may be like those
              of that wise one.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Just as that noble wise one dedicated</strong> <br><strong>       His completely pure body, speech,
              mind,</strong> <br><strong>       Deeds, and realms,</strong> <br><strong>       Likewise, may I become equal
              to that.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       To perform every noble virtue,</strong> <br><strong>       I will practice the aspiration
              of Manjushri.</strong> <br><strong>       May I tirelessly accomplish
              all of his deeds</strong> <br><strong>       In every future eon.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May there be no limit to my activities.</strong> <br><strong>       May there be no limit to my
              good qualities.</strong> <br><strong>       Through persevering in limitless
              deeds,</strong> <br><strong>       May I accomplish all miraculous
              deeds.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       The limit of living beings</strong> <br><strong>       Is as the limit of open space.</strong> <br><strong>       May the limit of my aspirations
              be equal</strong> <br><strong>       To the limit of their activities
              and passions.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>    Whoever offers to the victorious Buddhas</strong> <br><strong>    All the realms of the ten directions
              adorned with jewels,</strong> <br><strong>    And all the excellent joys
              of gods and men</strong> <br><strong>    For as many eons as there are
              atoms in those realms shall gain great merit.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>        But whoever hears this greatest dedication prayer,</strong> <br><strong>       Greatly aspires to perfect
              enlightenment,</strong> <br><strong>       And even once generates faith,</strong> <br><strong>       Shall gain even higher and
              holier merit.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Whoever utters this Aspiration to Noble Deeds</strong> <br><strong>       Will never again endure lower
              rebirth,</strong> <br><strong>       Will abandon all evil friends,</strong> <br><strong>       And soon behold the Buddha
              of boundless light.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       They will find that which is sought</strong> <br><strong>       And live in happiness,</strong> <br><strong>       Find joy also in this life,</strong> <br><strong>       And soon become like Samantabhadra
              himself.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Even though they may have, in ignorance,</strong> <br><strong>       Committed the five irredeemable
              sins,</strong> <br><strong>       They will soon be completely
              purified</strong> <br><strong>       Through uttering this Aspiration
              to Noble Deeds.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       They will achieve perfect wisdom, a radiant countenance,</strong> <br><strong>       Ethereal form, auspicious physical
              marks, and a noble birth.</strong> <br><strong>       Profane and devilish beings
              will not trouble them,</strong> <br><strong>       And they will be honored in
              the three realms.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       They will quickly reach the royal tree of enlightenment,</strong> <br><strong>       Residing there to benefit all
              beings.</strong> <br><strong>       As enlightened Buddhas, they
              will turn the wheel of Dharma,</strong> <br><strong>       Taming the demonic hosts.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Whoever knows, teaches, or recites</strong> <br><strong>       This Aspiration to Noble Deeds</strong> <br><strong>       Shall ultimately attain perfect
              Buddhahood.</strong> <br><strong>       May none despair of complete
              enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       In whatever way valiant Manjushri and Samantabhadra</strong> <br><strong>       Know how to transfer merit,</strong> <br><strong>       So do I dedicate all of my
              own virtues</strong> <br><strong>       That I might train to be like
              them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Through this dedication, praised as supreme</strong> <br><strong>       By the victorious Buddhas of
              the past, present, and future,</strong> <br><strong>       I dedicate all of these roots
              of virtue</strong> <br><strong>       To accomplishing noble deeds.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       At the moment of my death,</strong> <br><strong>       All obscurations will be removed,</strong> <br><strong>       I will behold the Buddha of
              boundless light,</strong> <br><strong>       And go to the pure land of
              perfect bliss.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       In that blissful land,</strong> <br><strong>       May I completely manifest all
              of these aspirations,</strong> <br><strong>       And benefit all beings</strong> <br><strong>       As long as the universe remains.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Joyful there, in that blessed pure realm of the Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>       May I be reborn in the beautiful,
              perfect body of a lotus,</strong> <br><strong>       And the Buddha Amitabha Himself</strong> <br><strong>       Foretell my own enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May I thereafter accomplish countless benefits</strong> <br><strong>       For living beings in all the
              ten directions</strong> <br><strong>       By the power of perfect wisdom</strong> <br><strong>       In its myriad incarnations.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Through whatever small virtue I have gathered</strong> <br><strong>       By uttering this Aspiration
              to Noble Deeds,</strong> <br><strong>       May all virtuous aspirations
              of living beings</strong> <br><strong>       Be accomplished in a single
              instant.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       Through the boundless merit gained by so dedicating</strong> <br><strong>       This Aspiration to Noble Deeds,</strong> <br><strong>       May the countless beings drowning
              in the torrent of suffering</strong> <br><strong>       Reach the stage of Amitabha.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>       May this greatest of dedication prayers</strong> <br><strong>       Benefit countless living beings.</strong> <br><strong>       May uttering this ornament
              of Samantabhadra</strong> <br><strong>       Release all beings from the
              suffering of the lower realms.</strong></p>

              <img src="http://vajrasana.org/maitreya.jpg" alt=""> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small;">Arya Maitreya's Aspiration</span></span></strong>
              <p><br> <strong>Prostrations to all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas!</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ananda, in previous times when the Bodhisattva, the great sattva
              Arya Maitreya,</strong> <strong>performed the deeds of a Bodhisattva, he placed his Dharma robe
              upon one shoulder,</strong> <strong>and three times each day and three times each night, bent his right
              knee to the</strong> <strong>ground, and folding his hands, made this aspiration prayer:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Prostrations to all the Buddhas.</strong> <br><strong>Prostrations to those rishis who possess the divine eye.</strong> <br><strong>And to all the Bodhisattvas,</strong> <br><strong>And also to the Shravakas.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Prostrations to bodhicitta,</strong> <br><strong>Which repels the action of the lower realms,</strong> <br><strong>Thoroughly demostrates the path of higher rebirth,</strong> <br><strong>And leads to deathlessness and agelessness.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Whatever unwholesome deeds I committed,</strong> <br><strong>Acting under the power of the mind,</strong> <br><strong>I confess all these</strong> <br><strong>In the presence of the Buddhas.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Through the accumulation of merit</strong> <br><strong>Which I developed from the three sources,</strong> <br><strong>Which are the seeds of my omniscience,</strong> <br><strong>May my enlightenment never be exhausted.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I, too, rejoice in the merit of</strong> <br><strong>Any offering made to the Buddhas</strong> <br><strong>In the pure realms of the ten directions</strong> <br><strong>And rejoiced by the Buddha's wisdom.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I confess all negative deeds</strong> <br><strong>And rejoice in all meritorious deeds.</strong> <br><strong>I prostrate to all the Buddhas.</strong> <br><strong>May I achieve exalted primordial wisdom.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>To the exalted enlightened Bodhisattvas,</strong> <br><strong>Who abide on the tenth stage</strong> <br><strong>Throughout the ten directions,</strong> <br><strong>I request that they become fully enlightened.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Having attained the noble enlightenment of Buddhahood,</strong> <br><strong>And conquered maras and their hosts,</strong> <br><strong>May they turn the wheel of Dharma</strong> <br><strong>For the benefit of every sentient being.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May the sound of the great drum of Dharma</strong> <br><strong>End the suffering of sentient beings.</strong> <br><strong>May they remain,</strong> <br><strong>Teaching the holy Dharma for countless eons.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>For those beings who are sunk in the quicksand of desire,</strong> <br><strong>And tightly bound by the fetters of attachment,</strong> <br><strong>And completely tied by every form of bondage,</strong> <br><strong>May the Supreme Among Men gaze upon them.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Beings of stained mind</strong> <br><strong>Are not scorned by the Buddhas,</strong> <br><strong>Who possess the mind of compassion toward sentient beings,</strong> <br><strong>May you liberate beings from the ocean of existence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I follow those fully enlightened beings who abide in the present,</strong> <br><strong>Those who have existed in the past,</strong> <br><strong>And those who are yet to appear,</strong> <br><strong>And perform enlightened conduct.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Having accomplished the six perfections,</strong> <br><strong>May I liberate all sentient beings of the six realms.</strong> <br><strong>And by actualizing the six types of clairvoyance,</strong> <br><strong>May I place them in unsurpassable enlightenment.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I realize the Dharma of emptiness</strong> <br><strong>Which was unborn and will not arise,</strong> <br><strong>Has no nature and no place,</strong> <br><strong>No consciousness and no substance.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Like the great sage, the Buddha,</strong> <br><strong>May I realized the Dharma of selflessness,</strong> <br><strong>The non-existence of beings and the non-existence of their life,</strong> <br><strong>The non-existence of persons and the non-existence of things.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I be able to give unstintingly</strong> <br><strong>For the benefit of every sentient being,</strong> <br><strong>Without ego or clinging</strong> <br><strong>Toward any material thing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I acquire all my wealth spontaneously</strong> <br><strong>Through realizing the non-material view of all matter,</strong> <br><strong>And may I accomplish the perfection of giving</strong> <br><strong>Through which clinging to material vanishes.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I accomplish the perfection of morality</strong> <br><strong>Through ethics lacking pride,</strong> <br><strong>And by possessing pure moral conduct</strong> <br><strong>Without lapses in ethical rules.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I accomplish the perfection of patience</strong> <br><strong>Which harbors no anger,</strong> <br><strong>And is non-abiding, like the elements of air,</strong> <br><strong>Earth, water, and fire.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I accomplish the perfection of diligence</strong> <br><strong>Through possessing strength of body and mind</strong> <br><strong>By exerting diligence,</strong> <br><strong>Stable, blissful, and without laziness.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I accomplish the perfection of concentration</strong> <br><strong>Through illusion-like concentration,</strong> <br><strong>Through heroic traveler-like concentration,</strong> <br><strong>And through diamond-like concentration.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I accomplish the perfection of wisdom</strong> <br><strong>Through actualizing the three types,</strong> <br><strong>And equalizing the three times,</strong> <br><strong>And the three doors of liberation.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>May I accomplish my aspiration</strong> <br><strong>Through a Bodhisattva's diligence,</strong> <br><strong>Which blazes with dignity and light</strong> <br><strong>And is praised by all the Buddhas.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Performing this conduct,</strong> <br><strong>Becoming renowned for kindness,</strong> <br><strong>And accomplishing the six types of paramitas,</strong> <br><strong>May I thoroughly abide on the peak of the tenth bhumi.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Soon after departing this life</strong> <br><strong>And having been born into the realm of joy,</strong> <br><strong>With blissful mind may I swiftly please the Lord Maitreya Bodhisattva,</strong> <br><strong>And may I obtain a prophecy to enlightenment.</strong></p>

              <p><strong>The Purpose and Benefits of doing Full Prostration  
              <br>By Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen</strong></p>
              <p>NAMO GURUBAE. The recitation of one mantra is transformed into 1,000 prostrations.</p>
              <p>OM NAMO MANJUSHRI YE.</p>
              <p>To Lord Manjushri I prostrate, NAMO SUSHRIYA.</p>
              <p>To the incomparable glory I prostrate.</p>
              <p>NAMO UDA DHARMA SHRIYE SVAHA.</p>
              <p>To the most excellent glory I prostrate.</p>
              <p>By prostrating to the most superior Triple Gems, defilements and obscurations of sentient beings and  
              myself are purified.</p>
              <p>By clasping the 2 palms, may method and wisdom be attained.</p>
              <p>Resting the clasped hands on the top of the crown, may one enter the celestial land of Akanishta.</p>
              <p>Resting the clasped hands on the forehead between the eyebrows, may the defilements and obscurations of the body are purified.</p>
              <p>Resting the clasped hands at the throat, may the defilements and obscurations of the voice be purified.</p>
              <p>Putting the clasped hands at the heart, may the defilements and obscurations of the mind be purified.</p>
              <p>Each time for unfolding the two hands, for the sake of all sentient beings may the two bodies be obtained.</p>
              <p>When the two knees touch the ground, may the damnation of samsara be free.</p>
              <p>When the ten fingers of the two hands touch the ground, may the ten bhumis and five stages be reached.</p>
              <p>When the forehead touches the ground, may the eleven radiant rays shine everywhere.</p>
              <p>By straightening and the bending of the arms and legs, may the four activities be all at once accomplished.</p>
              <p>By straightening and bending the veins and sinews, all the knots at the veins are loosened without  
              exception.</p>
              <p>By bending the spine and central artery, may all the wind enter the central vein without exception.</p>
              <p>To touch the ground and later to rise up, may liberation from samsara be attained.</p>
              <p>After prostrating many times, may one become the guide of all sentient beings without attaching to  
              personal calmness.</p>
              <p>By the meritorious power of offering full prostration by oneself and others, may the conditions in this  
              life be freed from sickness and blessed with three auspiciousness.</p>
              <p>During the time of dying, one is reborn in the state of bliss and quickly attains the state of a Fully  
              Enlightened Buddha.</p>
              <p>This is a preparation of Lord Sakya Pandita. After doing these
              full prostrations, if one reflects the reasons and purposes,
              immeasurables benefits and results will be received.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Homage to Guru Rinpoche, the Lord of Orgyen,
              the incomparable object of Refuge!</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">This unique, free and well-favoured human form
              is so difficult to obtain.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Since we have actually attained it this time,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Let us endearvour to unfold the realization
              of its full potential,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">And not leave it to rot.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">The root of all dharmas is one's mind.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">If unexamined, it rushes after experiences
              and is ingenious in the games of deception.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">If you look right into it, it is free from
              any ground or origin,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In essence free from any coming, staying or
              going.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">All the dharmas of Samsara and Nirvana are
              one's own mind,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Only determined by its display our perception,
              pure or impure </span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In reality, neither exists.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Pure from the beginning, free and simple,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Not falling into extremes,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Instead, in the luminosity of its self-existing
              energy, it is fully accomplished.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">This is the very ground for the manifestation
              of compassion's intelligence Rigpa </span><span style="color: #cc0000;">.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Rigpa is beyond designation and verbalization.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Out of it arises, as its display, the variety
              of appearances of Samsara and Nirvana.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Manifestation and manifester are not two </span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In this state of oneness, naturally abide,</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">BODY        free from walking, sitting, movements</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">SPEECH  natural to the flow
              of breath</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">MIND        
              free from afterthoughts</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In the toally free state of mind: open, spacious,
              restfully content, carefree - abide.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">This unborn Dharmakaya's Rigpa</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Uncreated by cause and circumstances naturally
              arose </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Raw, fresh, nakedly naked.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Unstained by thoughts of 'I' and 'mine', 'this'
              or 'that'</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Unspoiled by understanding, mental fabrication</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In the silence of its natural simplicity 
              abide</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">'Abide' is only an expression </span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In reality it is totally free from that which
              abides and abiding itself.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">This Rigpa Emptiness the Dharmakaya's actual
              face</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Dwell, at all times, in this recognition, undistracted.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">There is no end to the activity and delusions
              of Samsara;</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">The more you do, the more you they increase.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Animosity and attachment just grow more and
              more,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Gradually working towards your own downfall.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Therefore, instead, turn your mind towards
              the Dharma.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Here you will find the first glimpse  enlightenment
              and liberation,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">You won't be ashamed at the moment of death,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">And in this life and others you will go from
              happiness to happiness  there is no doubt.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">The one who has been most gracious to you -</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Your Lama, and Orgyen Chenpo, inseparable
              -</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Visualize on top of your head,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">And offer your 'heart and soul' in fervent
              and one-pointed devotion.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Whatever arises, good or bad, happiness or
              sorrow,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Rely on your only father Lama and pray to
              him,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Mix your mind one with him.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">At the moment of death, abandon thoughts of
              attachment and aversion,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Visualize Orgyen Guru, your Lama, on your
              head.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Your consciousness in the form of light symbolised
              by HRIH,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Transfer it into the wisdom of the Lama Orgyen
              Chenpo.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">If you always meditate and practice in this
              manner,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">At the moment of death, it will come easier.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">Recite the prayer of Zangdok Palri </span><span style="color: #cc0000;">.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">In conclusion, Dharma practice is to cut attachment
              to Samsara,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">To generate love and compassion for all beings
              of the six realms,</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">To tame this minds of ours again and again.</span></strong> <br><strong><span style="color: #cc0000;">This, I plead, take to heart and practise
              all the time please do!</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong>                          Song To Inspire Myself By Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen
              <br>                                          edited by Acharya Migmar Tseten</strong></p>
              <p>I prostrate to Manjughosa.</p>
              <p>I am gripped by defilement, faithful to samsaric Dharma,
              <br>enjoy talking, diligent in speaking of the faults of others,
              <br>without comprehending my own faults, I compete with the inferior,
              <br>turn away from this conduct which is opposed to benefit!</p>
              <p>Be diligent in recalling the faults of the dharmas of samsara,
              <br>always remember going for refuge
              <br>to the Three Jewels day and night;
              <br>be diligent in any of the vows of individual liberation that have been obtained.</p>
              <p>In order to hold the lineage of the Bodhisattvas,
              <br>be very faithful to bodhicitta,
              <br>recite the Seven Limb Prayer,
              <br>and the Sutra of the Three Heaps during the three times.</p>
              <p>Without sleeping, practice yoga of sadhana diligently
              <br>in the first and last parts of the night.
              <br>After arising from the meditation sessions,
              <br>practice the path of conduct as it occurs in the sutras and treatises.</p>
              <p>Persevere in the root and branch samayas,
              <br>be diligent in offering to the Holy Guru,
              <br>protect the minds of all sentient beings.</p>
              <p>When waves of negative conceptually occur,
              <br>abandon them by developing the antidotes well.
              <br>If you do not inspire yourself,
              <br>where will there be someone else who will give you inspiration?</p>
              <p>In this way you will be well inspired!
              <br>It is very rare to practice according to the texts,
              <br>if one has not avowed from this non spiritual conduct,
              <br>one will not obtain a positive result.</p>
              <p>Composing this inspiration to myself,
              <br>I request the Gurus to tolerate any contradictions.</p>
              <p>This 'Inspiration to Myself', written by the Shakya Upasaka Dragpa Gyaltsen is well accomplished.</p>

              <p><strong>A Gift of Dharma to Kublai Khan  
              <br>(As spoken by the Sakya-pa Chogyal Pagpa)</strong></p>
              <p>To the incomparable Enlightened One, who is endowed with the
              splendour of fame in name and the splendour of wondrous virtues in
              actual fact, I offer homage.</p>
              <p>Although you, mighty emperor, know already the discourses on
              worldly and spiritual science, still, as with the songs and music of
              musicians to which you listen again and again even when you have heard
              them all before, why shouldn't a poet repeat wise words?</p>
              <p>All of the countless teachings of Dharma taught by the Sage for
              the sake of countless disciples indeed are meant to be practised. But
              how may this be done?</p>
              <p>Just as a man bound by fear and shame would not disobey his
              king's command but dwell in right conduct without harming others and,
              as a result, would ever grow in good fortune and even earn the praises
              of his king, so, too, with a person who accepts, in accordance with his
              ability to accomplish them, thel rules of discipline enjoined by the
              Sage to help beginners on the Hinayana and Mahayana paths: if, after
              properly receiving vows from an abbot, that person would then guard
              them because he is bound both by fear of seen and unseen sufferings in
              worldly existence and by shame whenever he reflects, 'The multitudes of
              Noble Ones who know the thoughts of other beings will be shamed if I
              break my vows, . . .'</p>
              <p>He, as a result, would become a foundation not only of seen and
              unseen joys in worldly existence, but of the virtues of perfect
              liberation; he would also become a worthy object of veneration for men
              and gods and even receive the praises of Buddhas.</p>
              <p>These three realms of existence, after all, are just suffering,
              while Nirvana, too, is just peace. Looking with pity, therefore, on
              those who wish either for worldly existence or Nirvana, it is the
              Buddha alone who, Himself free from sorrow, removes sorrow, and who,
              having Himself attained great Joy, bestows joy. And He has appeared
              from amongst beings like ourselves.</p>
              <p>The methods He used we can also use. Without timidity and
              laziness, therefore, you should unwaveringly aspire to win highest
              enlightenment and feel free to think, 'I must surely attain Buddhahood
              . ' Guard as your own life the vows you have made which, if violated,
              will cause you to be burnt in hells and which, if preserved, will
              enable you to experience truly wonderful results in proceeding from Joy
              to Joy even now.</p>
              <p>Since the three sets of vows--of the Hinayana, Mahayana and
              Vajrayana paths--are the foundation whereon all virtues may arise,
              remain and grow within oneself and others, try from the very first to
              be firm in their observance.</p>
              <p>Become certain that the Teaching, which is virtuous in its
              beginning, middle and end, and whose words are quite flawless and not
              contra- dictory to the two logical proofs of valid knowledge, is the
              unique spiritual way among ways.</p>
              <p>Know, too, that the Enlightened One who taught it is endowed
              with unhindered wisdom and great compassion -- since He revealed (the
              truth) without close-fistedness --and also with tremendous power.</p>
              <p>Because they are His followers and a gathering of beings with
              virtues similar to His, because also your own sphere of spiritual
              activity is identical to theirs, know the noble Assembly of
              Bodhisattvas to be the best field for increasing your merit.</p>
              <p>Realising that it is your preceptor who points out and
              introduces you to these Three Jewels, that he is endowed with the same
              virtues they have, and that he sustains you with kindliness, always
              attend and meditate upon him with unflagging faith.</p>
              <p>Since they are like yourself in having the nature of being
              endowed with the causes of pain and with a constant state of
              unsatisfactoriness, and like yourself, moreover, in wishing themselves
              to be free from unhappiness and its causes, you should unceasingly
              meditate great compassion for all living beings.</p>
              <p>Recalling the benefits of virtue which you will need in order
              to attain highest enlightenment and to achieve others' good as well as
              your own purposes, strive wholeheartedly with genuine devotion to
              acquire it. In brief, since a mind endowed with faith, compassion and
              devotion is the precursor of all spiritual accomplishments, perform
              every least virtue with these three present.</p>
              <p>Envision the Body of the Enlightened One either in front of you
              or as your own body, and visualise that your dwelling place is a
              Buddhafield wherein all beings are Conquerors surrounded by
              Bodhisattvas and Disciples. Then worship yourself and others with
              oceans of offerings consisting of the enjoyment of the five
              sense-objects.</p>
              <p>Realise that your own virtuous preceptor and all the Conquerors
              are truly equal and nondual in form, activity and essential nature. At
              all times, you should envision him in front of you, or seated atop the
              crown of your head, or within the lotus of your heart, and pray to him
              or meditate upon him as being nondual with yourself.</p>
              <p>Of virtue, nonvirtue, pleasure, pain and all the phenomena of Samsara and Nirvana, mind is the substratum.</p>
              <p>If you were to examine that mind thoroughly from every angle,
              you would realise that it has neither colour nor shape, nor is it
              single or manifold. It therefore has no nature; therefore it is not
              arisen, neither does it remain nor cease. It is devoid of both centre
              and periphery, and is thus away from all extremes. It has just the
              nature of space.</p>
              <p>Even so, cognition is not stopped. Hence mind has the nature of nondual cognition-and-emptiness.</p>
              <p>As one's own mind is, so, too, is the nature of all beings'
              minds. Understand thoroughly that all phenomena are nondual
              appearance-and-emptiness and place your mind in meditation without
              grasping.</p>
              <p>Through meditating nondually on the two objects (one's
              preceptor and the Enlightened One) and objectlessness (emptiness), you
              will attain a superior meditative state of tranquil concentration
              (shamatha) which cannot be disturbed by thoughts.</p>
              <p>Joyfully remembering that every act of virtue or nonvirtue
              increases the strength of one's virtuous or nonvirtuous inclinations,
              always bring virtues to mind and strengthen them.</p>
              <p>Especially should you recollect and analyse the support, form
              and experience of your meditation whenever you have meditated upon an
              object. Through examining further the interdependent origination of
              their causes and conditions--however many they may be --you will attain
              meditative insight (vidarshana) through realising the true state of
              their suchness, i.e., that no support, form or experience whatsoever
              exists.</p>
              <p>Following the performance of virtues, you should gather
              together in one all the merit acquired through that (meditation and the
              like), and fully dedicate them to the attainment of perfect
              enlightenment by yourself and all these countless beings.</p>
              <p>Even though transferrable merit may not have been acquired at
              the time you offer prayers, your wishes nonetheless will be fulfilled
              if you pray for a great purpose to be achieved--for mind alone is
              chief. Every virtue which is adorned by this kind of recollection,
              dedication and noble prayer will increase unceasingly and eventually
              become the cause of great good for oneself and others.</p>
              <p>Everything that is experienced and all other conditioned things
              (samskrtadharma) i.e., the five aggregates, the senses, sense-objects
              and sense consciousnesses) are devoid of any nature of their own
              because they all depend upon causes and conditions.</p>
              <p>You should know, therefore, that these external objects also,
              which appear in various forms to, and are experienced by, mind that is
              stained by mental impressions, are not real; they are like magical
              shows which appear due to a variety of causes they are also like dreams
              that occur during sleep.</p>
              <p>The (so-called) 'unconditioned dharmas' (asamskrtadharma) are
              simply ascriptions. A person would have to be mad to wish to propose
              meaningless names for them, or to indulge in thoughts about them and
              thereby accept them as 'conditioned dharmas'.</p>
              <p>Never scorn the connexion between deeds and their results, for
              (the teachings on) the interdependent origination of cause-and-result
              as it operates in the sphere of relative truth are not deceptive. You
              will experience the ripening results of your actions.</p>
              <p>There are 'eternalists' in whose view the substantiality of
              phenomena is accepted. However, no object whatsoever exists which is
              devoid of (both) direction (i.e., dimension) and time (i.e.,
              consciousness): if you were to analyse the forms of direction and
              space, you could not possibly find a single entity (which is not
              reducible to its component parts). And if a 'single entity' does not
              exist, whence could 'many' appear? As there is no existence other than
              these, the conceptualisation of 'existence' (itself) is an inferior
              one.</p>
              <p>Just as there is no length without shortness, how could a
              nature of 'nonexistence' be apprehended when even a nature of
              'existence' is not obtained?</p>
              <p>Know, intelligent one, that the Real also does not consist of
              'both' (existence and nonexistence) because this possibility has been
              removed by the rejection (of each individually); nor does it consist of
              being 'neither' of the two, because there is no logical proof for this
              possibility and, in any case, there is no possible 'bothness' to which
              it could be an alternative.</p>
              <p>But if we were to conclude that 'Mind alone is real since it is
              formless and thus has no directions', (we would have to admit that) it
              also becomes plural and false if subject and object are identical, (the
              latter being manifold).</p>
              <p>If, however, subject and object are different to one another,
              how then do objects become objectified and mind subjectified? If the
              two arise dually, in what way (e.g, simultaneously or otherwise,) do
              they appear? Finally, what kind of liberation is achieved merely by
              rejecting illusory external appearances?</p>
              <p>Since the object is not established as real by nature, the
              subject, too, is not established as real. The claim that there exists
              somehow a pure consciousness apart from these two, is as extremely
              wrong as the (Sankhya philosophers' notion of a) 'Self' (purusha)
              distinct from the transformations of primal nature (prakrter vikara).</p>
              <p>Be free from supports, knowing that all phenomena from the first, are unarisen, natureless, away from extremes and like space.</p>
              <p>Marvellous and much more wondrous than any wonder is this
              knowledge which does not relinquish the emptiness of all dharmas nor
              yet stop the process of interdependent origination!</p>
              <p>Realise that objects are the nonduality of
              appearance-and-emptiness, that mind is the nonduality of
              knowledge-and-emptiness, and that the paths to liberation are the
              nonduality of methods and wisdom.</p>
              <p>Finally, act (in accord with this insight).</p>
              <p>The stages of cause, path and result should be understood thus:
              the interdependent origination of the relative sphere is like illusion;
              in the ultimate, the nature of dharmas is emptiness; finally, both are
              nondual without differentiation.</p>
              <p>Thus, if the foundation (morality), preparation (reflection),
              meditation, conclusion (dedication of merit and recollection) and the
              process of practice taken as a whole each be multiplied by three (in
              correspondence to the three stages of cause, path and result), all the
              paths of virtue are gathered together in fifteen factors.</p>
              <p>Whoever strives to perfect these (fifteen) factors in each
              performance of virtue enjoys the happiness of fortunate states and
              accumulates oceans of the Two Collections (merit and transcendent
              wisdom).</p>
              <p>Through the clarity of his meditation, he becomes joined with
              the Aryan Path and increases in transcendent wisdom as a result of his
              meditation and noble conduct. Then, attaining the goal (of Buddhahood)
              through coursing along the final stages of the Path, he puts an end to
              all thought constructions by realising the nature of mind to be pure
              from the very beginning. (His mind) becomes one flavour with the
              Dharmadhatu and is transformed into the Svabhavikakaya which is the
              transcendent wisdom of Dharmadhatu and the knowledge of the perfection
              of renunciation.</p>
              <p>For him, the dharmas of worldly existence become transformed
              through the practice of the path so that his body becomes the Body (of
              an Enlightened One) adorned by (112) marks and signs of perfection His
              voice becomes (the Voice of the Buddha) endowed with sixty tones; his
              mind is transformed into Transcendent Wisdom and is also endowed with
              omniscience. Passions are transformed into the boundless virtues of the
              Conqueror and constitute the Sambhogakaya. His deeds are transformed
              into the 'Task-Accomplishing Wisdom' and the countless kinds of
              enlightened activity which form the Nirmanakaya.</p>
              <p>These five wisdoms constitute the perfect realisation of the
              Enlightened One and, inasmuch as He is also endowed with spiritual
              power, they are unending and uninterrupted. May you also, O emperor,
              become like Him!</p>
              <p>Through the merit of offering this gift of Dharma which
              summarises the deep sense of the noble path, may all living beings with
              you, O king, as their chief, quickly attain the highest stage of
              enlightenment.</p>
              <p>My own mind, too, has become encouraged by composing these
              lines as a gift of doctrine and so I shall speak further of another
              matter: undistractedly hear it, O Lord among Beings!</p>
              <p>The time when you should make efforts is now: make firm the
              good fortune you have, ensure long life and the success of your lineage
              and practise right methods to gain liberation</p>
              <p>It is right to make efforts without distraction. At a time
              when Dharma has not yet set like a sun and a religious king like
              yourself sits on the throne, how can your mind remain indifferent to
              the plight of those who wear saffron robes?</p>
              <p>Though I am not old, the strength of my body is slight and my
              mind inclines to be lazy; therefore I wish to be excused for awhile
              that I may seek Dharma's meaning in solitude.</p>
