              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fear
              is a part of human nature, so there is little point in forcing ourselves to
              overcome it or pretending to be unaffected by it. In fact, we do so at our
              peril.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fear
              is a given; it is a fundamental part of life and consciousness. And while it
              may not feel good, fear is useful and necessary. In spiritual life, the problem
              with fear lies in whether we have the wisdom to respond well to it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Buddhism, fearlessness, in regard to both internal and external obstacles, is
              often extolled as a virtue. It takes fearlessness to tackle one’s own neuroses,
              and it takes fearlessness to not become overwhelmed when facing, say, physical
              danger. In the Majjhima Nikaya of the Pali canon, a whole sutta, the
              Bhayabherava, is devoted to how to overcome “unwholesome fear and dread.” But
              fearlessness is not the whole picture.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The
              presentation of the dharma as a whole is couched in terms of taking refuge from
              samsara, from the round of dukkha, or suffering. But one does not seek refuge
              unless one is afraid. Which means that fear, and not just fearlessness, has an
              important role to play. How is this seeming paradox to be reconciled? Different
              Buddhist traditions have approached it in different ways. One well-known
              approach is what we might call the heroic path, the path of overcoming
              perceived shortcomings, including fear. As you progress on the heroic path, so
              the logic goes, fear will naturally decrease. Reach a level of spiritual
              perfection and you will feel no fear at all. So get busy perfecting yourself
              right away!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">By
              contrast, there is what might be thought of as a pragmatic approach. Here, we
              start from the way we actually find ourselves to be—fallible, vulnerable, and
              mortal. The Japanese Pure Land schools call this our bonbu nature. On the
              pragmatic path, the foundation is not striving to better ourselves; rather, the
              basis is naturalness and honesty about our very imperfect selves.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Here’s
              a little story I heard about fear. There was a monastery in the mountains in
              China. Wild deer would come onto the monastery’s beautiful grounds. The monks
              loved the deer and enjoyed feeding them. When the abbot heard about it, he came
              out shouting and waving his arms and attacking the deer with his staff. The
              deer became alarmed and ran away. The abbot put up a notice saying there must
              be no more feeding the deer and any deer seen on the property were to be chased
              off. The monks protested, saying, “We came here to learn kindness and
              compassion. What sort of example are you, getting so mad at these gentle
              animals? This can’t be right.” The abbot addressed the community: “Look, there
              are hunters in these mountains. The only defense these animals have is their
              fear. If you take that away from them, they will all be killed very soon.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we did not have fear—if we were truly fearless—we, like the deer, would be in
              terrible danger without knowing it. We have awareness in order to be wary. The
              most primitive animal will shrink away from noxious contact. Consciousness
              itself is closely related to fear, and to grasping as well. If we did not need
              to get things, or to run away from things that want to get us, then we would
              probably not have developed consciousness at all. We would not need it. Rocks
              do not need to be conscious. They are all-accepting. Acceptance is also one
              kind of Buddhist ideal, but it would be a mistake to take it to an extreme. We
              are not aiming to be rocks.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is sometimes said that faith takes away fear, and there is truth in this. But I
              think the more important point is that faith redirects us from mundane stress
              to the great fear and exhilaration that frames our spiritual life. When the
              practitioner experiences such fear, she knows that she is close to the raw
              energy of life itself, the eÌ�lan vital. It is this life energy that gives
              meaning to the holy life. If we try to hush it up, we might well end up pouring
              a kind of sanctimonious avidya, or ignorance, on top of the worldly kind.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">As
              a young enthusiast for the dharma, I began on the heroic path and learned much.
              But along that way I also encountered, at every step, self-deception and
              spiritual pride. As I have mellowed with age, I have found greater peace,
              sanity, and spiritual consolation in the more pragmatic approach of starting
              with things as we find them. It’s a fact that we get frightened, and simply
              exerting more and more willpower to overcome our fright, or posing as though
              we’re unaffected by it, does not send the fear away.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Pragmatically,
              it may make more sense to view relating to fear as akin to using fire to combat
              fire. The pragmatic dharma-farer can use greater fear to drive out lesser
              fears. When we realize our smallness, seek refuge, and find a place within the
              great dharma realm, we have nothing to lose. Such a reorientation helps one
              find peace in the center of life’s whirlwind. But the whirlwind does not stop. From
              that position, the wise person, cherishing the fear and mindful of the dharma,
              chooses the most compassionate course, fearing more for others than for self
              and realizing that we are all in one boat together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fear
              has its uses, too. For instance, if one wants to cultivate awareness, one can
              readily see that one is never so acutely aware as when one is frightened. At
              such times one stays compulsively alert and cannot sleep. The cultivation of
              awareness, therefore, is a refinement of the energy of fear that is close to
              the core of our basic makeup.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fear
              is sometimes exciting, as when one is testing a new motorcycle to its limit.
              Usually, though, it is unpleasant. But either way, it motivates us. It gets us
              moving. The most basic action that it suggests is to run away—and in many
              situations this is the best course. It might be brave and magnificent to stand
              up to an enemy who is much bigger than you are, but it is also a first-class
              way of getting yourself killed. If a tiger comes, you had better run away, or you
              will soon be its next dinner.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fear
              galvanizes. We can do feats of strength when we are frightened that we cannot
              achieve at other times. Fear mobilizes all of our resources. Zen Master Dogen
              says that we should train in Zen with the same energy we would employ if our
              hair were to catch fire. If that were the case, one would most certainly be
              alarmed and take urgent action.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Clearly,
              there is a range within which fear puts us on our toes and brings out our best.
              When there is too little, we become complacent, bored, and lazy. When there is
              too much, we become paralyzed. When I first began speaking in public, I
              sometimes would sweat and shake and be unable to even get my words out. I found
              that the best thing was simply to tell the audience that I felt terribly
              nervous, which to my surprise allowed me to relax a bit and the audience to
              become more sympathetic. And the thing went off all right.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">From
              experiences like this I realized that the venom that paralyzed me was not so
              much the fear as the pride that made me try to hide the fear, that wanted me to
              present myself as a master over my human nature. But when I could be natural
              and share how I was feeling, a bond was established with the audience. Fear can
              connect people.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Fear
              and love are closely related. To cut ourselves off from one is to cut ourselves
              off from the other. Suppressing awareness of our own vulnerability, we
              inevitably and correspondingly lose sensitivity for those around us. I find
              that the most wrenching fear that one experiences is the fear one feels for
              others. Love is like that. When one loves, one fears for the other. When one
              fears for them, one watches out for them. I have been much more afraid when my
              children were in danger than when I myself was in a life-threatening situation.
              This is true not only for regular people. Just as a mother is fearful for her
              child, the buddhas, ever watchful, are fearful about what shall become of us.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It
              is common to see the dharma in terms of self-development and, ultimately,
              self-perfection. But any perfection that does arise does so as a by-product. It
              is all very well to take techniques from Buddhism and use them to enhance our
              worldly lives, but that is not really what the dharma is about. It is about
              taking up a more wholesome attitude to reality as it is.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">If
              we could somehow get rid of the traits about ourselves that we don’t like and
              by force of will make ourselves perfect, we’d probably be much the worse for
              it. Achieving success in the heroic endeavor, one would probably just become
              completely egotistical about one’s superb achievement. Even before arriving at
              such glory, one would along the way be tempted to pose as having made more
              progress than one actually had and turn a blind eye to one’s own failings. I’ve
              certainly done this.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">We
              are deluded beings, weak and vulnerable. We are especially vulnerable to
              self-centered impulses that arise from our karmic continuum. It is no good
              pretending that because one has read a few books on Buddhism or been to a
              retreat or two, one is now immune to any such failing. Even more sad is the
              case of the person who, after many years of rigorous Buddhist discipline,
              realizes, with despair or cynicism, that he is still prey to powerful, unbidden
              emotions and so concludes either that the dharma does not work or that he
              himself is a hopeless failure.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Realizing
              that we are hopeless cases is, in a sense, essential. We are not going to
              eradicate features of our basic nature, and real spiritual awakening has more
              to do with facing this honestly than it does with arriving at a fantasy of some
              kind of Superman Buddha dwelling within one. To see our real nature, our human
              nature, is not cynicism—it is awakening.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Knowing
              one is imperfect, and deeply so, undermines pride. It puts one on firmer
              ground—a ground of empirical reality. It is, in fact, a relief. It may be a
              disappointment, but even there one can observe the ego at work and, hopefully,
              laugh at oneself. This too is part of one’s all-too-human nature.
              Disappointment with oneself is not something to get rid of; it is something to
              share with others.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              Buddhism, we talk a lot about impermanence. The Buddha talked about
              impermanence in order to make us frightened. You might think it odd that Buddha
              wanted to frighten us in this thoroughgoing way, but how else was he to get us
              to take our spiritual and existential situation seriously? Life is short. There
              is much to be done. Our very world is in peril because of our spiritual state.
              I recently came across a listing of countries that are considered dangerous to
              visit, and the list included more than half of the countries on the planet!
              There are ecological perils, military perils, health perils, and, above all,
              spiritual perils, perhaps the greatest of which is losing concern about all the
              other perils.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Buddhism
              is a refuge, a space where we are accepted as we are, with our faults and
              fears, and where we are encouraged to do what we can for the good of all
              sentient beings. The buddhas are working to help us all the time. They see us
              as being in peril. We do not see this as clearly as they do. This failure to
              see clearly the spiritual peril that we are in is ignorance, avidya. Vidya
              means to see clearly. A-vidya means to be without such clarity. If we saw our
              plight more clearly we would be more motivated to respond to our peril. Things
              will not inevitably get better of their own accord. The state of our world
              depends upon the spirit in which we approach and care for it, and that spirit
              is much more soundly based when it is grounded in an acknowledgment of our true
              nature—fears and all—than when we pose as purer than we are.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There
              is an apparent paradox here—that holding too tightly to our ideals may well
              make us worse by making us blind to reality and thus very likely to get
              ourselves into trouble in both worldly and spiritual ways. Becoming proud of
              ourselves and our own understanding, we easily get into quarrels and rivalries.
              Many of us have been members of spiritual communities in which unkind quarrels
              have broken out or, even worse, have gone on and on in a hidden, underground kind
              of way, suppressed by the attempt to pose as being more enlightened than we
              really are.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This
              is often the result of an unwillingness to acknowledge fear, a refusal to see
              its central place in our makeup, its intimate connection to life itself. We are
              blind to our own blindness and do not see the danger. The blindness is much
              more dangerous than the fear. We do not see our own role in its creation. If we
              did, then we would be more afraid, and our practice would be more careful. We
              would see the spiritual danger that threatens us and threatens others even
              more. We would value the help of the buddhas and ancestors and be less
              arrogant. Then our fear would bring us a little bit of enlightenment, and we
              would realize what a gift it is.</span></p>
