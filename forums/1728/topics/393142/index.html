              <p>im reading the discussion here <a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/366959?page=2">http://sgforums.com/forums/1728/topics/366959?page=2</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and this pulls me back to the past(10 years ago) where i was obsessively(intellectually ,unfortunately) reading about buddhism (theravada -thai,burmese etc..) ,and the teaching of impermanence,suffering(i was suffering intensely physically) and anatta seemed to be the essence of the path.due to my pain,all my 'practice' centers solely on reading(very unfortunate),and there's no actual meditation progress at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my view is this : i see right view as not something dogmatic,but as having the most accurate map which will lead to the ultimate destination.now this sounds simplistic,but through years of pain and searching(and stuck to certain dogmas!),in beginning to realize the immense importance/and subtle truth of this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but what i briefly can say is this : you hold the absolute position that the 3 characteristics is the only way,and all (may be not all - am i misinterpreting u?)other traditions are still wip(work-in-progress),in which they still hold on to a 'essence,'source' etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in other words,they still at the subtlest level,unable to trully,"permanently" see the "ultimate" reality of selflessness.(this is ,a very strong,extreme position of urs - but if turns out to be true,the greatest blessing)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as of me,after 'abandon' buddhism,i was attracted to the mystical teachings ,but now you are pulling me back(there's still much doubt/resistance on my part - and i'll simply see how the next steps unfolded)!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my question is this : perhaps some teachings,when they say "consciousness' ,'ultimate ' dadada... are referring to the 3 seals,but they prefer to simply use 1 word? how are we to judge them? </p>

              <p>i.e if we prefer to continue following their paths,pls give advice on incorporating the essence of the buddhist path into them.(it has been quiet some time i abandon the dharma,and im really not ready to go back yet)</p>

              <p>Yes, so far, I find Buddhism having the clearest view of reality. The right view is a pointer for a mind that is unable to see through the subtle dualistic and 'inherent' tendencies. It is just a raft, but is still important.</p>
              <p>This doesn't mean I don't find things valuable in other religions.</p>
              <p>In fact I probably read more about other religions than most other Buddhists. Like you, I am attracted to mystical texts. They also have good pointers, especially since I am also practicing Self-Inquiry, which is the main Advaita technique.</p>
              <p>Whatever you read or practice, it is still important to have the right view so that when you have transcendental experiences, you do not get stuck. At least that's what I have learnt from others who have gone through the path, I myself am far from enlightened and still learning.</p>
