              <p>Here is an article about practicing the Four Foundations of Mindfulness. This practice is taught by Buddha as a very effective means to attain Liberation. According to Buddha, by practicing the four foundations of mindfulness diligently, one should be able to attain liberation and enlightenment in as little as 7 days and no more than 7 years.</p>
              <p>I think this is a very well written article. I sent our moderator Thusness a few portions which he thought was very very good.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff3300;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">Introduction</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">As 
                                          always when listening to a teaching we first of all develop 
                                          the motivation of bodhicitta, the awakened mind intend 
                                          on the greatest possible benefit for all sentient beings: 
                                          enlightenment. In order to realise this and to establish 
                                          all beings in that state we engage in Dharma study and 
                                          practice.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">The 
                                          Buddha taught the four foundations of mindfulness as the 
                                          basis of all meditation practice in the <em>Satipatthana 
                                          Sutta</em>, the tenth sutra of the middle length collection 
                                          (Majjhima Nikaya) of the Pali canon. This sutra is the 
                                          basis for the mindfulness practices of all Buddhist schools. 
                                          Further explanations are found in the <em>Anapanasati Sutta</em>, 
                                          where the Buddha talks about mindfulness of breath as 
                                          a means to develop all four kinds of mindfulness, and 
                                          in the <em>Kayagatasati Sutta</em>, where he develops the 
                                          instructions on how to practise mindfulness of body by 
                                          giving many examples. These three sutras together are 
                                          the heart of mindfulness practice in the Theravada tradition. 
                                          Gampopa mentions the four foundations of mindfulness in 
                                          the <em>Precious Ornament of Liberation</em> as the factors 
                                          to be developed right from the beginning of one's practice 
                                          as one is entering the normaler path of accumulation. They 
                                          constitute the first four of the 37 factors of enlightenment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Here, 
                                          in the context of this brief introduction, we will not 
                                          discuss all aspects of mindfulness but concentrate on 
                                          what the Buddha called the "Four Foundations". 
                                          Mindfulness itself would be a still vaster subject as 
                                          it includes virtually all practices starting with being 
                                          mindful of the preciousness of our human existence, impermanence, 
                                          cause and effect, suffering, continuing with a mindfulness 
                                          of the qualities of refuge, of bodhicitta, of the masters, 
                                          yidams, and protectors, and finally being mindful of <em>mahamudra</em>, 
                                          the nature of things itself. Mindfulness is what makes 
                                          our practice work. Without it, no practice whatsoever 
                                          will have a profound effect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">When 
                                          explaining the four foundations of mindfulness the Buddha 
                                          first talks about the motivation to develop: the wish 
                                          to obtain complete liberation, nirvana, the complete purification 
                                          of clinging to a self which means the same as going beyond 
                                          all suffering, beyond all worries and complaints into 
                                          true happiness. He then says that in order to practise 
                                          the four foundations of mindfulness, no matter which one 
                                          we intend to practise, we should go to a secluded place, 
                                          sit with crossed legs, and with a very straight upper 
                                          body first let our mindfulness gather in front of us – 
                                          not necessarily with the help of an object, but simply 
                                          through resting with unwavering, steady eyes. Then, through 
                                          contemplating the nature of samsara, we should relinquish 
                                          all desire, all wanting, all clinging to the cycle of 
                                          existence and dissolve all sadness and evil-mindedness. 
                                          With "sadness" the Buddha meant the sadness 
                                          which arises in the beginning when we take the resolution 
                                          to leave samsara behind, an uneasiness due to leaving 
                                          our beloved attachments. There should be no such sadness 
                                          in our mind when we are letting go of the causes of suffering 
                                          (!), but rather the great joy of a firm resolve to go 
                                          towards liberation and to become able to make it accessible 
                                          to all others as well. In order to practise mindfulness 
                                          it is very helpful to have the support of a joyful aspiration. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                                          is the practice of those who are happy to get out of samsara. 
                                          Our basic attitude of mind should be free of clinging 
                                          to this world. Having this as our basis we can develop 
                                          the four foundations of mindfulness. For this we have 
                                          to practise with diligence and with a clear, precise knowing 
                                          of what we are doing, with clearly understood instructions 
                                          on our meditation. Mindfulness means not to be forgetful, 
                                          not forgetting the object of one's intention. Mindfulness 
                                          needs to be accompanied by equanimity, a stable mind, 
                                          not impressed by whatever might appear in mind, and it 
                                          should be continuous, without interruption; not sometimes 
                                          mindful and sometimes not. A continuous mindfulness is 
                                          actually based on a deep letting go, just as Gendun Rinpoche 
                                          always instructed us. Mindfulness establishes itself naturally 
                                          when we have no interest for the world and let go of our 
                                          worldly preoccupation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">But 
                                          there could also be spiritual preoccupations that create 
                                          obstacles: a strong wanting to let go, one is struggling 
                                          to find relaxation with the hope to attain something and 
                                          the fear not to obtain it. When there is too much wanting 
                                          we will soon reject mindfulness practice, since we will 
                                          not be able to enter authentic relaxation. Wanting agitates 
                                          the mind, and so do hope and fear.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">The 
                                          Buddha taught four foundations of mindfulness which are 
                                          set out in a progressive order and serve as foundations 
                                          to discover liberation:</span></p>
              <ul>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">The 
                  						mindfulness developed with these practices is always the 
                  						same: to be aware of what is. But the methods used to

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">The 
                  					  basic instruction of the Buddha on mindfulness of body is: 
                  					  "Regard the body as body." It means to regard 
                  					  whatever is body, whatever has form, as being simply a physical 
                  					  form and not <em>my</em> body, <em>my</em> form, not to identify 
                  					  with the body, but just to regard it as body, an agglomeration 
                  					  of physical constituents. To see what the experience of 
                  					  these physical constituents is like is the next step of 
                  					  this meditation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">The 
                  					  initial instructions for this mindfulness could be condensed 
                  					  into the question: <em>"What do the senses perceive?"</em> This refers to the five physical senses (without the mental 
                  					  sense): whatever can be experienced through touching (inner 
                  					  physical perception), hearing, smelling, tasting, and seeing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">There 
                  					  are many ways to develop mindfulness of the body. All are 
                  					  meant to lead to non-identification with the first skandha 
                  					  of body or form. The most important of these methods is 
                  					  the meditation on the breath. But first we will give the 
                  					  list of other meditations which can be done according to 
                  					  the Buddha: </span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">meditation 
                  						on the impermanence of all body feelings and of all forms 
                  						including the contemplation of the causes of their appearance 
                  						and dissolution</span></li>

                  						on the non-attractiveness of the body which is made up 
                  						of many, not very attractive parts like bones, blood, 
                  						flesh, tendons, mucus, excrements etc. </span></li>

                  						on the fact that the body is composed of the elements 
                  						earth, water, fire, and wind which leads to an understanding 
                  						of the interdependence of physical phenomena</span></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <p> </p>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">the traditional 
                  						contemplation of the charnel grounds, where one contemplates 
                  						corpses in different stages of decay: very fresh, one 
                  						hour old, a few hours old, a day, three days, a week, 
                  						a month, down to the last dust after years of decomposition. 
                  						And at every step one should remind oneself: "My 
                  						own body is of the same nature as this body. As soon as 
                  						the breath stops, it will not be any different from these 
                  						corpses, since it is also a composed phenomena." 
                  						The contemplation of what one sees in the charnel ground 
                  						or what one imagines in one's visualisation should at 
                  						every step be brought in connection with one's own body 
                  						to which one clings so much. One should become completely 
                  						aware of the conditioned, impermanent nature of this body. </span></li>

                  					  of these meditations are also mentioned by Gampopa in the 
                  					  <em>Precious Ornament of Liberation</em>. They are important 
                  					  remedies for desire and ignorance. Further meditations to

                  						on how the body is subject to climatic influences, to 
                  						heat and cold, to hunger and thirst, sometimes feeling

                  					  is actually very important to be mindful of our physical 
                  					  movements. If we are not even mindful of our body, how mindful 
                  					  will we be of our mind? Physical movements are few and actually 
                  					  quite slow, while mental movements are many and extremely 
                  					  quick. The point of practising mindfulness of body is to 
                  					  develop the capacity to refrain from unwholesome acts with 
                  					  body and speech, to settle the mind and to gradually arrive 
                  					  at a mindfulness of mind itself which is the chief of all 
                  					  actions, the starting point for all creation of karma. Mindfulness 
                  					  of the body is definitely more easy to practise than mindfulness 
                  					  of mind. </span></p>

                  						taught extensively about mindfulness of breath. Body mindfulness 
                  						in relation to breath means to be aware of breathing in 
                  						when breathing in, and to be aware of breathing out when 
                  						breathing out. To know that one is a short breath and 
                  						another is a long breath. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <p> </p>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                  						of breathing further includes to experience fully what 
                  						the Buddha called the "breath-body". This is 
                  						a term which refers to the whole body of subtle energy 
                  						movement, the circulation of the inner breath as one is 
                  						meditating the outer breath. We do not limit ourselves 
                  						to watching the breath at the nose or as it makes the 
                  						abdomen rise. We extent our awareness of breathing to 
                  						include the whole body. The whole breath-body is breathing. 
                  						In this way one should use the meditation on breath to 
                  						calm down physical clinging. One can also calm down physical 
                  						sensations with this mindfulness. Up to here this belongs 
                  						to mindfulness of the <em>body</em>. </span></li>

                  						further taught mindfulness of breath as including all 
                  						four foundations of mindfulness. He showed that while 
                  						being mindful of the breath one can be mindful at the 
                  						same time of the sensations, the <em>feelings</em> arising 
                  						in relation to all six senses. As one is connected with 
                  						the breath one can also be mindful of the different meditative 
                  						absorptions with their experiences of physical joy, mental 
                  						joy, end of analysis, and so on. This is also classified 
                  						as mindfulness of feelings. But to be mindful of them 
                  						does not mean to cultivate them, it just means to be aware 
                  						and not to cling. The use of these states is only to open 
                  						up our innate wisdom which will help us to go beyond them.</span></li>
              <p> </p>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">While meditating 
                  						on the breath one can also be mindful of the <em>mind</em>. 
                  						This includes, according to the Buddha, first of all to 
                  						fully experience the mind (to be in full contact with 
                  						the various states of mind, not to be distracted); secondly, 
                  						to increase the joy of one's mind, thirdly to focus the 
                  						mind and fourthly to liberate the mind. </span></li>
              <p> </p>
              <li><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Being mindful 
                  						of <em>Dharmas</em> linked to mindfulness of breathing includes 
                  						meditation on impermanence, on renunciation, on the coming-to-the-end 
                  						of clinging and on complete letting go. </span></li>
              </ul>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">All 
                  					  of this was taught in the <em>Anapanasati Sutra</em>, where 
                  					  it is indicated that the breath can actually serve as the 
                  					  key method to develop all four foundation of mindfulness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">For 
                  					  the interested practitioner we include here some oral Instructions 
                  					  of Gendun Rinpoche on mindfulness of breathing :</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">"When 
                  						we follow the movement of our breathing in and out, it 
                  						should be left quite natural, just as it is. We should 
                  						not force either the body or the mind in any way at all 
                  						but remain completely relaxed and simply let the mind 
                  						become aware of the coming and going of the breath, without 
                  						any distraction, any other thoughts, anything else catching 
                  						our attention. Let the mind merge with the movement more 
                  						and more until it is completely absorbed in it. Do this 
                  						first for 21 breathing cycles, without distraction, and 
                  						then for a greater number, all the time staying attentive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Staying 
                  						attentive does not mean concentrating fixedly on the breathing 
                  						while saying to yourself, „I mustn’t lose the movement, 
                  						I must stay concentrated...". If we start this kind 
                  						of discursive thinking, it will create a level of mental 
                  						agitation which will disturb the natural movement of the 
                  						breathing and of the meditation. We are no longer meditating, 
                  						we are commenting on the meditation. We lose our sense 
                  						of being absorbed in the meditation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">What 
                  						we have to do is simply be aware of the breathing, feel 
                  						it, experience it physically and mentally. We should follow 
                  						it without doing anything else, without comment, without 
                  						trying to change it or modify it in any way. For that 
                  						we have to be very relaxed, very quiet, and practice gently, 
                  						regularly. Doing this, we wait for the calm that will 
                  						allow us to penetrate more deeply into the meditation 
                  						to develop."</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">Do 
                  					  I want to dream or do I want to be present? </span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">If 
                  					  we summarise Trungpa Rinpoche's teaching on the mindfulness 
                  					  of body, we should ask ourselves: "Do I want to dream 
                  					  or do I want to be present?"<em> </em>If you want to 
                  					  dream, don’t practise mindfulness of body, it might wake 
                  					  you up. However, if you want to be present, practise mindfulness 
                  					  of body. Being mindful of the body means to really come 
                  					  in contact and establish a direct connection with our body. 
                  					  It means to sit on the earth and walk on the earth instead 
                  					  of being in our clouds of imagination. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">There 
                  					  is a certain simplicity of physical presence which installs 
                  					  itself and lets us find the way out of our concepts. Our 
                  					  complex, conceptual, always thinking mind is calmed down 
                  					  by feeling the simple presence of walking or of being here 
                  					  on the cushion. It means to relax into the body and to just 
                  					  sit or walk or breathe without wanting anything special, 
                  					  without wanting to go anywhere. It is not the destination 
                  					  that counts but being or walking itself. That's enough. 
                  					  Buddha gives us the permission to just be.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Here, 
                  					  on the first level of mindfulness, there is not yet an intention 
                  					  to analyse or understand something, there is just this basic 
                  					  presence which gives rise to an openness. And this is very 
                  					  helpful! It can also be helpful when you cannot fall asleep 
                  					  at night. You practise a bit of mindfulness of breathing 
                  					  – and relaxation is coming, openness, and it will be more 
                  					  easy to fall asleep, because the agitated subtle energies 
                  					  calm down due to the mindfulness of breathing. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">So, 
                  					  Chögyam Trungpa says: When we contact this feeling 
                  					  of having a very stable ground, our practice becomes linked 
                  					  to what and where we really are. Then, on this very stable 
                  					  ground of being in contact with what really happens, we 
                  					  can open up – we can open up to the surroundings, and also 
                  					  to other practices. But first we need this stability, a 
                  					  feeling of coming home. Thich Nhat Hanh compares it to a 
                  					  child coming home after a long time of absence. To find 
                  					  back home is already a big step ahead on our path.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">Continuing 
                  					  our practice of mindfulness of body in the vajrayana...</span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Also 
                  					  in our vajrayana practices we work a lot on mindfulness 
                  					  of body. The aim here is to lead us to a complete integration 
                  					  of body, speech and mind, and to come to an understanding 
                  					  of the deeper reality of these three. The training begins 
                  					  with mindfully turning a mala in synchronisation with our 
                  					  mantra recitation. We prostrate with our body at full length 
                  					  being fully aware of the outer movement, doing it just the 
                  					  way it should be, and develop at the same time the mindfulness 
                  					  of its inner meaning of going for refuge etc. The body is 
                  					  used as a support to always find back into a virtuous state 
                  					  of mind or into contemplation or meditation. We offer mandalas 
                  					  or perform mudras at the same time as we are reciting and 
                  					  visualising. In meditation we train in the correct posture 
                  					  and we are using mantras and doing recitations. (In this 
                  					  fourfold classification mindfulness of speech also belongs 
                  					  to mindfulness of body, because it is an outer act.) </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                  					  of the body also means to be in tune with our body, not 
                  					  to abuse it, but to remark when we are tired, stiff or cold 
                  					  etc., and to adjust our practice accordingly through changes 
                  					  of position, food, drink, clothes, heating, cooling, rest, 
                  					  sleep, exercise, and so on. To be a yogi actually also means 
                  					  to know what our body wants to tell us. We should generate 
                  					  an attitude of sensitivity, warm-heartedness and non-violence 
                  					  towards our body while not falling into laxity and self-cherishing 
                  					  attitudes. Our body is not simply the slave of our practice 
                  					  but actually a very subtle tool to develop awareness. In 
                  					  vajrayana we even say that is the seat of enlightenment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">When 
                  					  visualising ourselves as a Buddhaform (yidam) we practise 
                  					  mindfulness of body on a still more subtle level. We refer 
                  					  to a deeper reality of "body" in order to bring 
                  					  us to an awareness of the transparent, non-substantial nature 
                  					  of body and form, and to let go of identifications with 
                  					  this normal physical body. Here, our mindfulness is directed 
                  					  to reality as a Buddha sees it, and it will extend our practice 
                  					  of mindfulness beyond all limiting concepts of what we usually 
                  					  consider as "body". All of this is the integration 
                  					  of basic body awareness into the heightened awareness of 
                  					  vajrayana. It is the natural continuation of the experiences 
                  					  of down-to-earth body mindfulness which becomes more and 
                  					  more tuned in to the subtleties of being. When Body is experienced 
                  					  as the subtle reflection of all that happens within and 
                  					  around, it is perceived as the mirror of the whole universe, 
                  					  it reveals its truly sacred dimension. Everything and everyone 
                  					  is seen as contained in that supreme Body of the yidam-divinity.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                  					  of body finally leads us to the understanding that all phenomena, 
                  					  all forms, all ‘bodies’, are free of inherent existence, 
                  					  empty, completely pure, interdependent and transparent – 
                  					  just like reflections on a pure mirror or on clear, unmoving 
                  					  water. This is the true, final simplicity of "just 
                  					  being", which is the key to mindfulness of body right 
                  					  from the very beginning.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;"><em>Question</em>: 
                  					  Can we also apply this teaching on mindfulness of body to 
                  					  thoughts?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;"><em>Answer</em>: 
                  					  Yes. There is actually no difference between outer, physical 
                  					  form and inner form, mental representations or thoughts. 
                  					  As you meditate on the body, you realise that the body is 
                  					  not outside of the mind. And as you meditate on form, you 
                  					  realise that form is not outside, but that there is no difference 
                  					  between thoughts which are purely mental and thoughts which 
                  					  seemingly have an outer support. This is one of the understandings 
                  					  arising due to meditation on mindfulness of the body: the 
                  					  separation line between thoughts, body and outer surrounding 
                  					  dissolves. We can find no more limits to this constantly 
                  					  changing, completely inter-related phenomenon which we call 
                  					  body. Inside–outside becomes completely transparent and 
                  					  indistinguishable. That’s why meditating on the body can 
                  					  be the source of all realisations.</span></p>

                                        Establishing mindfulness of feelings</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">The 
                                        second foundation of mindfulness is the meditation on feelings 
                                        or sensations. And here the Buddha’s instruction is again 
                                        very simple: "Regard feelings as feelings". These 
                                        are just simple feelings, not <em>my</em> feelings. This has 
                                        given rise to the instruction to mentally say, when there 
                                        is an agreeable sensation arising: "agreeable sensation", 
                                        and if disagreeable, to just say: "disagreeable" 
                                        – end of the story, no further comments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;"> According to the Buddha what we call mindfulness of feeling 
                                        is a simple, non-judging awareness of agreeable and disagreeable 
                                        (even sometimes painful) feelings and of "neutral" 
                                        feelings, which refers to meditative absorption states (samadhis). 
                                        And also he instructed us to cultivate the awareness of 
                                        "worldly" and "spiritual" feelings and 
                                        of their combinations as agreeable worldly feelings, disagreeable 
                                        worldly feelings and so on. The instruction can be condensed 
                                        into the question: <em>"What is felt inwardly when a 
                                        sense impression arises?"</em> The idea here is to just 
                                        feel, in a direct way, without any commentary – and to see 
                                        the reactions of immediately judging any experience as agreeable 
                                        or disagreeable, to become aware of these judgements which 
                                        are constantly happening in our mind. To become aware of 
                                        them gives us the possibility to stop the chain. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Our 
                                        feelings will be accompanied by awareness, and as we are 
                                        aware of them and the connected judging process, we can 
                                        find ways to let go of them, one after the other. Due to 
                                        mindfulness we can avoid further chain reactions with all 
                                        the connected emotional trouble. Mindfulness of feelings 
                                        also has the effect that we get to know ourselves better 
                                        and do not run away from our feelings anymore. They become 
                                        familiar experiences of great variety but without any special 
                                        importance. In spite of their great variety they are all 
                                        the same in one respect: they come and go without leaving 
                                        traces. This meditation gradually leads to non-identification 
                                        with the second skandha: feelings or sensations. Feelings 
                                        will then arise without secondary thoughts that create a 
                                        connection to an imaginary I or self. They are simply what 
                                        they are: feelings, a flow of experiences, ever-changing. 
                                        Do you see any self in this?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">You 
                                        can look on your feelings from within, as a personal experience, 
                                        or from without, as if someone else was experiencing them, 
                                        as if looking on yourself from the point of view of an outer 
                                        observer. Both ways of practising are taught and both are 
                                        ok. But according to the Buddha we should look also what 
                                        gives rise to feelings and what causes their dissolution. 
                                        We investigate into impermanence and the conditioned nature 
                                        of feelings. We take an intelligent look into feelings. 
                                        It is non-judging, and because this creates a certain space, 
                                        the non-judging allows for an understanding to arise. We 
                                        see how pleasure is arising and how suffering is arising. 
                                        We see how pleasure goes away and how suffering goes away. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">So 
                                        this is one way of practising with feelings, using our intelligence 
                                        and our curiosity to investigate, and the other way is to 
                                        be simply aware of what is happening: only being aware, 
                                        no need for an effort to understand something, just as in 
                                        the basic mindfulness of body: a very simple mind, nothing 
                                        more. First one should establish basic mindfulness of feelings, 
                                        becoming aware of their coming and going, and then occasionally 
                                        one investigates into the causes and factors of the arising 
                                        and disappearing of feelings, judgements etc. One can, if 
                                        one wishes, take each of the different senses as a support 
                                        for the mindfulness of feeling and see how mind immediately 
                                        judges these feelings. We take sounds as our support, odours, 
                                        tastes, physical sensations, the moving wind, an itching 
                                        sensation – all kinds of supports, and each time we look 
                                        what this does in mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">We 
                                        notice all the thousands and millions of judgements going 
                                        on in our mind, and what usually happens is that we become 
                                        thoroughly disgusted with ourselves, with all this liking 
                                        and disliking. But what to do? It has been going on for 
                                        a long time already. Now we become aware of it, that's great!, 
                                        and soon we will be able to relax with it, and then actually 
                                        we will be able to let go of it from time to time, until 
                                        we come to truly enjoy the non-judging mind. Then there 
                                        is no more struggling to let go. It becomes our preferred 
                                        mode of being.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;"><em>Question</em>: 
                                        Is this being mindful of judgements or still mindfulness 
                                        of feelings? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;"><em>Answer</em>: 
                                        They are interconnected. If you can just remain on the level 
                                        of feelings, you are already an advanced practitioner. Normally 
                                        we are caught in judging before we even realise it. You 
                                        will for example see that as soon as you hear the sound 
                                        of a tractor, there will be a naming "tractor". You think 
                                        that the naming is the thought immediately after the sense 
                                        perception. But before this rather complex naming has happened, 
                                        you have already, more or less unconsciously, judged the 
                                        sound as being agreeable or disagreeable. In meditation 
                                        you will see all of this. Mindfulness of feelings is actually 
                                        in the beginning a mindfulness of how every feeling triggers 
                                        off a chain of reactions. Later then, as a more simple awareness 
                                        installs itself, you will come to the level of simply feeling 
                                        feelings, without further comments, and the difference between 
                                        the sound of a tractor and the lovely voice of a woman becomes 
                                        less and less. </span></p>

                                        Agreeable – disagreeable comes before the naming? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;"><em>Answer</em>: 
                                        Yes, long before. A name is already a complex concept. You 
                                        have already made the difference between this sound and 
                                        all the other sounds, car sounds, animal sounds and so on, 
                                        which you know. You have already zoomed in. You’ve gone 
                                        back to your memory, compared with similar sounds which 
                                        you knew and heard in the past. You compared and, while 
                                        taking into account still more factors of the situation, 
                                        you said: "This is probably a tractor." So there 
                                        is a lot, which has gone on. Agreeable – disagreeable is 
                                        the first, immediate reaction of the mind to the sense-perception. 
                                        It is the reaction which will decide whether we take a protective 
                                        or open attitude towards the situation.</span></p>

                                        mindfulness would be: "How can the basic survival instinct 
                                        become mindfulness of life?" Normally, all our actions 
                                        (breathing, eating, clothing...) are motivated by our basic 
                                        instinct to survive, and all our interpretations of feelings 
                                        are done in relation to wanting to survive. I judge all 
                                        of what I hear, feel and so on as either being dangerous 
                                        or not dangerous. "Can this be a help to me, can I 
                                        profit from this, or might it trouble me, take something 
                                        away from me, make me poorer?" This survival trip continues 
                                        all the time unconsciously in our mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                                        of feelings teaches us to simply be aware and to notice 
                                        that we are <em>already</em> surviving. Every feeling, every 
                                        sensation signals us that we are alive! And we notice that 
                                        life just continues from instant to instant without any 
                                        effort from our side. In this way we get out of these constant 
                                        worries connected to sensations. There is a little hunger 
                                        arising, but one doesn’t have to react immediately. We just 
                                        observe this lively feeling of hunger come and go, and then 
                                        of course we can also do something about it. When there 
                                        is a bang somewhere, we do not need to tense up, we can 
                                        just observe. There is no need to always tense up when something 
                                        is happening. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Some 
                                        quotes from Chögyam Trungpa, Rinpoche: "Survival 
                                        instinct is transmuted into a sense of being... and mindfulness 
                                        becomes a basic acknowledgement of existing. Meditation 
                                        becomes inseparable from the instinct to live... and that 
                                        instinct can be seen as containing awareness, meditation, 
                                        mindfulness. The life force that keeps us alive and that 
                                        manifests continually in our stream of consciousness itself 
                                        becomes the practice of mindfulness. ... We can simply tune 
                                        in to our process of life... Just living is enough without 
                                        reassuring yourself that you are living. If you don't stop 
                                        [the process] to make sure, living becomes very clear-cut, 
                                        very alive and very precise. ...Meditation is the total 
                                        experience of any living being which has the instinct to 
                                        survive!"</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Living 
                                        fully means being fully present in the moment without worrying 
                                        thoughts that prevent direct contact. Trungpa Rinpoche advises 
                                        us to simply remark what is, to shortly zoom into it and 
                                        immediately let go. Touch and let go! This means that we 
                                        touch, we get to know, we see, but we let go quick enough 
                                        to always be in the freshness of the moment. And it is this 
                                        freshness, which opens up to the flow of life. Life is a 
                                        flow of sensations, a flow of feelings. Life is a constant 
                                        flow of perceptions, feelings and sensations. Instead of 
                                        falling into fear we develop a basic confidence that we 
                                        do not need to control all these sensations. We don’t need 
                                        to hold on to some and push away others. We can allow ourselves 
                                        to let the flow happen in our mind. This is the basic notion 
                                        of relaxing into mindfulness of feelings. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">For 
                                        this there has to be a giving up of wanting to manipulate 
                                        the world on this very basic level. Our ordinary survival 
                                        trip makes us want to manipulate the situation: "This 
                                        I want, this I don’t want." In basic mindfulness there 
                                        are no such second thoughts, there is no personal, ego-centred 
                                        interest in our contact with life. It is a very simple presence. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Ego-centred 
                                        mindfulness however is exactly the opposite: the watchman 
                                        on the tower who is always on the lookout for opportunities 
                                        or enemies. This is ‘survival mindfulness’ in which there 
                                        is no equanimity and letting go. We should not cultivate 
                                        mindfulness as a further elaboration of our survival skills, 
                                        but I suspect that this is offered in some of those meditation 
                                        seminaries for managers. We do not practise meditation in 
                                        order to become more performing so that we can better snatch 
                                        away opportunities from others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Chögyam 
                                        Trungpa says, to hold on to feelings of life brings the 
                                        feeling of death. If we grasp onto life we are already half 
                                        dead. That is the motor of depression. Grasping onto live 
                                        kills live. The holding on to some aspect of our life due 
                                        to our urge to survive takes us far away from what is actually 
                                        happening. We are in our personal dark room of clinging. 
                                        And this darkness we are holding onto. When we let go of 
                                        this clinging we immediately get the feeling: "Oh, 
                                        as if I hadn’t seen the sky for a long time. Oh, the freshness 
                                        of the wind!" Suddenly simple, fresh presence begins 
                                        to re-enter our awareness. When this happens it is the sign 
                                        that our depression is coming to an end. When the freshness 
                                        of the moment comes back, this is the end of death and the 
                                        beginning of joy. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">Actually, 
                                        we grasp because we are afraid of death. But if we manage 
                                        to just be there and relax, mindful of one breath after 
                                        the other, we will know that we have survived yet another 
                                        moment and that we can permit ourselves to relax the next 
                                        moment as well. No need to grasp. Thich Nhat Hanh says: 
                                        "Working mindfully with disagreeable feelings grants 
                                        us insight and wisdom." Yes, the wisdom of no fear 
                                        to die, the insight into the truth of non-self, and the 
                                        courage to patiently face one feeling after the other knowing 
                                        that due to mindfulness there is no need to fear that we 
                                        will be overwhelmed by them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">For 
                                        mahayana practice it is very important to open up to feelings, 
                                        because every contact with another person brings feelings, 
                                        agreeable and disagreeable ones, emotions. You cannot be 
                                        a bodhisattva without opening up to feelings. How will we 
                                        be able to help others, if we are not open to feelings and 
                                        willing to let them pass through? How will we be able to 
                                        face all the problems of beings to liberate, if we cling 
                                        to experiences? It is also important that our mindfulness 
                                        is not a cold observer, but rather, to quote again Thich 
                                        Nhat Hanh: "like a lamp shedding light – not a judge", 
                                        and: "like an older sister lovingly taking care of 
                                        her younger brother or sister". A lamp does not only 
                                        give light but also warmth. In the same way our mindfulness 
                                        is not only an expression of wisdom but also of compassion 
                                        and love. We smile at ourselves and occasionally give ourselves 
                                        a hug: a compassionate approach to samsara; bodhicitta applied 
                                        to <em>all</em> beings, including ourselves!</span></p>

                  					  the vajrayana we consciously open up to feelings, we invite 
                  					  them as part of many practices. For example, when we celebrate 
                  					  a feast offering (tsok) together, this gives rise to intense 
                  					  feelings of all kinds and related to all senses. There is 
                  					  an opening up to sense-impressions, an entering into life. 
                  					  Also the practice of setting up a shrine and making it very 
                  					  beautiful is an expression of appreciating feelings, visual 
                  					  forms in that case. Music, incense, singing, playing instruments... 
                  					  – actually, in the tantra we are encouraging feelings to 
                  					  become stronger in order to see better there true nature. 
                  					  We see them as messengers of wisdom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">True 
                  					  mindfulness of feelings is to see their true nature. On 
                  					  the first level of mindfulness of feelings we simply realise 
                  					  the presence of a feeling: <em>Anger is there.</em> Then we 
                  					  see its impermanence: <em>Anger is already gone!</em> Then 
                  					  we see its interdependent origination, the fact that it 
                  					  is not just arising out of the blue, but in chains of cause 
                  					  and effect: <em>Anger arose when clinging to an experience 
                  					  judged as disagreeable etc.</em> And due to seeing the interdependence 
                  					  of feelings we also see that they are illusory, devoid of 
                  					  a lasting essence: if they are gone, they are gone, they 
                  					  don’t leave any traces, they do not occupy any space anymore. 
                  					  <em>Anger is gone and seems like a bad dream which has passed. 
                  					  I cannot even find it any more. </em>And then we understand 
                  					  from within that this can be called emptiness, the emptiness 
                  					  of feelings: <em>In all of this anger there is no self. Looking 
                  					  into it as it arises, there is nothing to see. When looking 
                  					  into it, it is seen no more, as if a bubble was pierced.</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">On 
                  					  the vajrayana path we see all of these feelings as the experiences 
                  					  of the meditation Buddhaform (yidam) or of the lama. We 
                  					  meditate on these feelings not as being our <em>own</em> feelings, 
                  					  but the feelings of the yidam in the space of primordial 
                  					  awareness. There is no more need to worry: feelings arise 
                  					  as the play of awareness in endless space. We come in touch 
                  					  with the true nature of feelings: constantly changing, just 
                  					  like the wind in constant movement; constant activity without 
                  					  any substance – and, if not clung to, this movement is seen 
                  					  as the expression of joy, of great bliss, the perfection 
                  					  of whatever is appearing. It is the expression of the great 
                  					  compassion of non-clinging enlightened mind without self, 
                  					  without any reference point, which is constantly active 
                  					  for sentient beings. It is the spontaneously creative aspect 
                  					  of mind's nature. When there are no dualistic reactions 
                  					  to these movements, these feelings, they are understood 
                  					  to be perfect by nature. There is nothing to be changed 
                  					  in these feelings, since they are the spontaneous, unceasing 
                  					  creativity of mind itself. This is truly "being alive", 
                  					  fully open, without any clinging.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">III. 
                  					  Establishing mindfulness of mind</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Again, 
                  					  the instruction of the Buddha for mindfulness of mind is 
                  					  simple: "Look at mind as mind". Not as <em>my</em> mind! The Buddha was very simple in his teaching, very straightforward, 
                  					  but when putting his advice into practice one quickly sees 
                  					  how profound his teaching is. The instructions to this third 
                  					  mindfulness could be condensed into the question: <em>How 
                  					  is the mind right now?</em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">The 
                  					  Buddha asks: Is there desire, is there hatred, is there 
                  					  ignorance? Is this mind of the present moment normal (narrow) 
                  					  or wide? Is it concentrated or distracted? Is it a noble 
                  					  or a samsaric mind? Is it surpassable (limited) or unsurpassable? 
                  					  Is it liberated or not liberated? Tensed or relaxed? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">The 
                  					  Buddha taught the first level of mindfulness of mind as 
                  					  being a simple, non-judging mindfulness of the present mental 
                  					  state. Look into the mind as if looking into a mirror, and 
                  					  you will see: "Ah, quite tense" or "Oh, quite 
                  					  open" or whatever: desire, hatred and so on – simply 
                  					  note what is present. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Then 
                  					  mindfulness goes a step further to examine the causes for 
                  					  the appearance and dissolution of the various states of 
                  					  mind. To learn in this way about mental states and their 
                  					  conditioned nature will then help to quicken our letting 
                  					  go of a given situation. We will know how we can encourage 
                  					  wholesome states of mind to arise and what will be favourable 
                  					  to the quick disappearance of unwholesome states. Due to 
                  					  this mindfulness of mind we also begin to know the qualities 
                  					  and capacities of mind. Emotional wounds begin to heal and 
                  					  knots in our mind are loosening.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Basically, 
                  					  mindfulness of mind always remains a simple mindful presence 
                  					  without investigation. The investigation we talk of is not 
                  					  a conceptual thinking about mind. It means to be present 
                  					  in such a way that you notice the arising of an emotion, 
                  					  you notice the thoughts just before its arising which trigger 
                  					  the emotional reaction, you notice your body sensations, 
                  					  images etc. before the emotion, during, and afterwards. 
                  					  Because we are aware of the mind we notice how a mental 
                  					  state disappears, what thought precede its disappearance. 
                  					  We see for example for desire that it disappears at the 
                  					  time when we contemplate impermanence or generosity, or 
                  					  that it simply disappeared when we had another thought which 
                  					  was stronger, more interesting. We notice many things about 
                  					  how the mind works, and this is what stimulates wisdom and 
                  					  understanding. There is a trace of understanding which rests 
                  					  after having witnessed the mind's working. We do not search 
                  					  for this understanding, it is enough to be mindful, the 
                  					  rest is automatic. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000; font-size: normal;">Mindfulness 
                  					  of mind is already quite subtle, we have to be increasingly 
                  					  relaxed to notice these workings of our mind. This is not 
                  					  a gross level mindfulness anymore. Going from mindfulness 
                  					  of body to feelings and then to mind, we need more experience 
                  					  in not interfering with what we observe. Normal practitioners 
                  					  cannot start with their mindfulness training directly on 
                  					  the level of mind; they have to start on the level of the 
                  					  body and feelings. In the beginning it might already be 
                  					  difficult enough to just watch the breath without manipulating 
                  					  its rhythm and depth.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333;"><em><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: normal;">Remaining 
                                        indifferent or becoming interested? </span></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">If 
                                        we condense Trungpa Rinpoche's teaching on this point into 
                                        a headline, it could be: <em>Do I remain indifferent or do 
                                        I become interested?</em> What attitude do I take towards 
                                        my life, towards my mind? Am I interested to know the mind 
                                        and to get out of samsara? Or am I indifferent to these 
                                        questions and prefer ignorance and stupidity? Stupidity 
                                        means to be indifferent to what is happening, not to care 
                                        about one's own future or about others etc. To Trungpa Rinpoche 
                                        the whole teaching about mindfulness of mind is about "mindfulness 
                                        of effort". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">The 
                                        point here is to practise with balanced and determined effort, 
                                        and such right effort is based on right motivation. According 
                                        to Gendun Rinpoche, when we develop the motivation of bodhicitta 
                                        – a truly selfless, compassionate, and most profound dedication 
                                        to enlightenment – right effort and right mindfulness will 
                                        come naturally, and meditation will be easy. Bodhicitta 
                                        is the key to mindfulness and insight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">In 
                                        order to reach enlightenment, true awakening, we need this 
                                        true mindfulness, which is an intelligent mindfulness combined 
                                        with the unwavering, authentic effort of compassion. This 
                                        effort is free of the over-enthusiasm of ambitions and without 
                                        the heaviness of pressure and the feelings of duty. We do 
                                        not practise out of duty nor out of ambition. True effort 
                                        will not arise due to an order, an obligation or just because 
                                        one wants to get somewhere. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">In 
                                        the scriptures right effort is compared to an elephant: 
                                        an elephant who walks steadily and cannot be stopped. He 
                                        walks with confidence and certainty, and his mindfulness 
                                        is completely balanced. With panoramic awareness he walks 
                                        through the jungle. He is interested in the jungle, not 
                                        absent-minded, his senses are very keen. This open-minded 
                                        interest, however, does not make him lose his inner balance. 
                                        This image is not used only because the elephant is very 
                                        tall, you could also take a turtle as an example. What is 
                                        pointed out here is this certainty without hurry and wanting. 
                                        The movement within space is itself what one is interested 
                                        in. Mindfulness in tune with movement is what leads to liberation. 
                                        It is a sure movement that cannot be stopped, full of dignity, 
                                        not agitated, with a panoramic view, and it has a playful 
                                        lightness and intelligence to it. It is sensitive, but not 
                                        hesitating. It is serious, but not too serious. It is decisive, 
                                        but not tense. This gets the mind out of its dream world. 
                                        We look into the mind's working, and we look into the reality 
                                        of mind. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #333333; font-size: normal;">At 
                                        first we use our observer, the abstract, non-emotional observer 
                                        to know the mind. We use dualistic functioning in order 
                                        to better know the mind. There is nothing wrong with using 
                                        dualistic mind processes: we can use this observer to get 
                                        out of emotions instead of entangling us more and more. 
                                        Observing will help us to get out of the emotional jungle 
                                        into a non-judging presence, from moment to moment, without 
                                        comments. </span></p>

                                        Rinpoche describes sudden moments of direct seeing which 
                                        then appear, little gaps that open up to a deeper insight. 
                                        These moments only happen on the basis of discipline, a 
                                        disciplined elephant-like mind which is not distracted. 
                                        While walking as the elephant through the forest of our 
                                        mind, being continuously in touch with what is happening, 
                                        there will naturally be these moments of insight, just as 
                                        when the light is coming through the little openings in 
                                        the forest. Suddenly we see very clearly. In the middle 
                                        of darkness and confusion there are moments of direct seeing.
