              organizations were a bit embarrassed this week when a viral selfie of Pope
              Francis turned out to be fake. But there is a history of dubious
              items—including footprints of the Prophet Mohammed and Buddha’s tooth.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">At this stage of his papacy, a
              Francis photo going viral is almost banal. But there was something different
              about the “Holy Selfie” of Francis that commandeered our Instagram feeds this
              past week. In the image, posted on an unofficial Vatican account, Francis
              smiles broadly as he captures his “first selfie” for the masses. It seemed, for
              a media minute, as if Francis had embraced the technological world’s most
              narcissistic pleasure. The image made<span> </span><em><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">New York Daily News,<span> </span></span></em>Yahoo,
              and CNN. But, as we quickly discovered, the<span> </span></span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/12/14/world/fake-pope-francis-selfie-irpt/"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #6c899d;">picture
              is a fake</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">. And in
              this respect it’s just one in a long line of religious forgeries designed to
              bring fame and fortune to their creators.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Every
              religious group is susceptible to forgers. Whenever you have something of
              value—be it designer purses or actual currency—you have those who will dedicate
              time and effort to forging it. And artifacts relating to religious
              leaders—Jesus, saints, the Prophet Mohammed, or the Buddha—are in particularly
              high demand.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The
              technology used to create these forgeries varies from the kind of thing your
              six year old could do on the living room floor (any piece of old looking wood
              could come from the true cross) to cutting edge science (the Turin Shroud still
              defies efforts to explain how, if it is a forgery, it was made).</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Many
              are housed in museums. A thumb-sized artifact dubbed the “Ivory Pomegranate”
              (even though it is made of hippopotamus bone) and bearing a paleo-Hebrew
              inscription was bought by the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1988. At the time,
              it was believed to have adorned the High Priest’s scepter in Solomon’s Temple
              and was, thus, the most important artifact in the museum’s collection.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Then,
              on Christmas Eve, 2004, the Israel Museum announced that the pomegranate was a
              modern forgery. Those who were believed to be responsible were, in fact,
              indicted by the police and the Israel Antiquities Authority, though there are
              some who continue to advocate for the authenticity of the artifact.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The
              truth is that forgery is an ancient phenomenon and that doubts hang over the
              authenticity of everything from bones of John the Baptist to stone-encased
              footprints of Mohammed. The reasons for producing religious forgeries are
              simple: power, money, attention, influence, and entertainment. There are some
              who believe that Columbia scholar Morton Smith forged the so-called Secret
              Gospel of Mark (so secret that no one but Morton Smith has ever seen it) as a
              joke on the academy.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">So far
              as the Francis selfie goes, the cost to the consumer is relatively low. It’s
              somewhat embarrassing to share a fake news item, but you’re hardly alone. In
              other cases, however, fake relics cost the believer a great deal more.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In
              2005, more than 60,000 donors poured $45 million and 270kg of gold into the
              construction of a Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in Chinatown in Singapore. A relic
              as precious as a tooth of the Buddha himself demanded lavish accommodations,
              and people were eager to contribute. According to the official </span><a href="http://www.btrts.org.sg/sacred-buddha-tooth-relic"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; color: #6c899d;">website</span></a><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">, the tooth was found by a Buddhist
              monk in 1980 when he was repairing the remains of a collapsed shrine in
              Myanmar.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">But
              almost immediately after the temple complex opened in 2007, people began to ask
              questions. In a series of articles, Lianhe Zaobao pointed out that historical
              records suggest that there were only two extant teeth of the Buddha and both of
              those are already accounted for. Moreover, why had no one heard of this
              discovery?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>More worrying, however, was the
              appearance of the tooth. Dr. Pamela Craig, a senior lecturer at the School of
              Dental Science at the University of Melbourne who was interviewed by<span> </span><em><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">The Straits Times</span></em>,<span><em><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;"> </span></em></span>remarked
              that “there’s absolutely no possibility that it is a human tooth.” Every single
              dental expert who was consulted by newspapers and media outlets agreed that the
              tooth belongs to a herbivorous animal, likely of the<span> </span><em><span style="border: none windowtext 1.0pt;  padding: 0in;">bos</span></em><span> </span>species. Write your own joke about
              vegetarians turning bovine.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In
              response to the accusations and letters from angry donors, the temple took out
              advertisements in major news outlets in Singapore telling people, “We should
              stand firm on our own faith towards the sacred relics.”</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 12.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Defenders
              of ambiguous relics often point out is that what is important is belief, not
              authenticity. Some of the Catholic Church’s language about controversial
              religious artifacts like the Shroud of Turin underscores this point. If people
              believe in relics, and if those relics are focal points for religious devotion,
              then perhaps we can leave it there. But tell that to the thousands who donated
              to the temple in Singapore.</span></p>
