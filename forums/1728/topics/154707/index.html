Lesser and lesser young people talk of Dao De(righteousness) anymore. Due to globalization, and stressing on ming zu(democracy) self right, People become more and more selfish. People now also want fast and invent things that are convenient, which promote people's laziness. Material comfort increase, mental Stress also increase.

            <div class='col-md body'>Quite often Buddhism is seen as a religion of constantly meditation and chanting all day. Although they are important practise they should not be seen as what Buddhism is all about. Buddhist teachings is to be lived in everyday life, practise and cultivation is within our daily lives.<br><br>Modern living is probably more hectic that the past... many of us are so busy that we even lack time to sleep. It may not be feasible to spend a long time in sitting meditation/chanting/etc. However true Buddhist practise does not take time, whenever it is... wherever we are, we can practise the dharma. That is probably 'Modern Buddhist Living'.<br><br>In the early days after Buddha's enlightenment it was already taught that the 8 fold-path cultivation leads to enlightenment:<br><br>Good Conduct<br>Buddhist ethics is not a rigid moral code. Nor are they about making judgements and arousing guilt. Rather, Buddhists try to be aware of a particular failing and resolves to do better, striving diligently to live up to Good Conduct.<br><br><strong>Right Speech</strong> is about not telling lies, avoiding harsh speech, slandering and back-biting. Generally it is about not using our speech faculties in harmful and unproductive ways.<br><br><strong>Right Action</strong> deals with our behaviour. To live a life where our actions are conducive to the happiness of ourselves and those around us. A lay person may, as part of their commitment to the Buddha's Way,observe the Five Precepts.<br><br><strong>Right Livelihood</strong>. A good Buddhist does not compromises his integrity by becoming involved in any activities that harm other people, animals or the environment.<br><br>Mental Development<br><strong>Right Mindfulness</strong> and <strong>Right Concentration</strong> bring us fully into the heart of meditation. Meditation is a gradual process of training the Mind to focus on a single object and to remain fixed upon that object without wavering. Constant practice of meditation helps us to develop a calm and concentrated mind. It is important to note that one needs a qualified teacher to guide one when one begins meditation.<br><br><strong>Right Effort</strong> is required if we are to advance steadily on the spiritual path. It is important to note that spending too much energy, like using too little energy, can also be counter-productive.<br><br>Wisdom<br><strong>Right Understanding</strong> refers to the need to understand, both in theory and practice, the Buddha's teachings, testing them against our experiences. Only then can sound faith and confidence arise.<br><br><strong>Right Thought</strong> is that which motivates our practice- the right reasons. Practice is not for acquiring greater power or wealth, but to advance on the Buddha's path towards Enlightenment and True Happiness for one and all.<br><br>-----------------<br><br>On a deeper level...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> To cultivate our actions is not as good as to cultivate the body,<br>To cultivate the body is not as good as to cultivate the mind,<br>To cultivate the mind is not as good as not having arising of the mind.</span><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">What is cultivation? Where do we practise cultivation? Let me tell you a story: More than twenty years ago, I took four years to cultivate as I travelled across the country. Step by step, I covered Taiwan by walking. Once when I was in Hua-Lian, an elderly Buddhist asked me, "Master! A monk should reside in the temple to meditate, pray and chant sutras, but when you travel about what are you cultivating? I replied, "ThatÂ’s right! I am cultivating. Sakyamuni Buddha teaches us to cultivate our conduct. He does not encourage us to cultivate sitting down! In the past few years I had been practising sitting meditation, now I wish to travel about. While walking and also amidst all my other activities, I do not commit evil deeds, I chant the names of the Buddhas, I praise and commend others, I tell people about the Dharma, I avoid the places of vice, this is the way I cultivate."<br><br>Thus, to cultivate means cultivating in the midst of our activities. This is a point that many people do not understand. They think that cultivation will result in a society that is pessimistic and low-spirited. This is a mistake.</span></div>

What relief it must be for to be free from such and other unecessary 'mind-chatter'.<br><br>And yes assumtion is another thing the mind seems to be very very good at, without getting the facts straight.

Truth in itself is simple - it is a form of direct experience. Trying to know conceptually without practising will only lead to grasping and dharma attachments. Sorry if I have termed it in a very 'chim' way. Obviously I do not have my master's skills in teaching dharma in a lively and simple manner!<br><br>Basically what I meant was, the past, the present, the future, cannot be attached. Why is this so? Because the past is already over, the future has not yet come, the present cannot be attached because once you attach to the Present Moment - it becomes the past. Thus the Present is ungraspable. Living in the Now means being mindful/aware - not attached to anything of the Past, Present or Future.<br><br>Anyway I am very surprised that you are 13 years old. Finally I found someone younger than me who posted in this forum!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> This proves that one is never too early to begin Buddhist cultivation! (p.s. there are scriptural records of two 7 year old novices who attained enlightenment during Buddha's times) Very good that you have started young.. you have learnt much.</div>

Very Happy<br></blockquote>Wisdom in dealing with problems and leading people is also very important,  to develope such wisdom we must also be constantly mindful/aware... practising the 8 fold path. Gradually we will gain wisdom. Although solving problems require intellect, Wisdom is not merely a form of intellect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Intellect does not necessarily make you live a happy life, not end up in jail, not cause any 'wars' and conflicts. Gradually we will gain greater wisdom and Prajna wisdom (wisdom to directly perceive Emptiness).<br><br>I believe what you meant by "energy" means viraya, preserverence, effort. Not only must we have this in our daily work... it is also very important towards enlightenment. Without this, how can we accomplish anything on the Bodhisattva path?

That is by not deceiving others, knowing the cause and effect, knowing if one's actions will benefit everyone... or cause harm to oneself and others... only through this will we be devoid of any sufferings and miseries. 'Jue' (awareness) can also mean "awakening" (jue wu).. only with wisdom and mindfulness will we not be affected by Greed, Anger/Hatred, Ignorance.

Actually 'give up' is not really letting go/non-attachment. If we maintain non attachment all the time in our job, then giving up is only a manifest of wisdom that we really are not capable of that job.<br><br>Also, we should not easily give up on situations. Because everything is an opportunity for our cultivation and practise. This is how wisdom is gained - through cultivation and various experiences. I must say I do not have much experience in the working world yet... and I am lack of wisdom.<br><br>My compo exams ended yesterday. hehe</div>
