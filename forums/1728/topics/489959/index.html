              <p style="margin-top: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; border: none;  padding: 0in; "><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;"><br> </span><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">SEPTEMBER 6 — It was nice to hear about
              heartwarming stories at the sidelines of the Bersih 4 mass rally in Kuala
              Lumpur last weekend.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Three Catholic churches — St John’s Cathedral in Bukit
              Nanas, St Anthony’s Church in Pudu, and the Church of Our Lady of Fatima in
              Brickfields — offered refuge to rally-goers should police clamp down hard on
              them.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Since that did not happen, St John’s offered them free
              buns and water, with Buddhist group Ti Ratana Penchala Community Centre parking
              its food truck there. It was a similar scene at St Anthony’s.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">At Dataran Merdeka, dozens of Muslims performed their
              prayers on the streets, with non-Muslims forming a ring around them to prevent
              any disturbance. Many also informed their friends to refrain from honking their
              maddening vuvuzelas during the prayers.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Of course, not everybody was happy with these gestures
              of kindness.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Pro-Umno portal MyKMU.net had said prior to the rally
              that the Catholic churches were just provoking the police by offering to
              shelter participants should the rally turn ugly.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In an article that carried no byline, the portal said
              the churches did not offer such protection before, and were doing it only to
              play the religious card in the run-up to the Sarawak state elections.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Muslims who prayed on the streets were also chided by
              some of their brethren for forfeiting comfort and peace in nearby mosques. Some
              accused them of putting on a show of piety, or trying to make questionable statements.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Muslims should be able to pray wherever it is
              convenient for them. I saw a man praying at a quiet corner in a shopping mall a
              few weeks ago, and I had to stop myself from wondering why he had done so.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="float: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Those who were lucky enough
              to have spent some time overseas would perhaps have performed their prayers in
              a public area at least once. And people would just let them be, knowing it is
              part of every Muslim’s personal obligations.</span></span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Many forget that fact when they live in a country that
              offers so many exclusive privileges for Muslims.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Here, some Muslims complain that prayer rooms in
              shopping malls are too small, too stuffy, too stinky. As if it is an obligation
              for everyone to accommodate Muslims, simply because well, they are Muslims.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Muslims may be the majority in this country, but that
              should offer them no special treatment. They should instead feel blessed that
              most places are thoughtful enough to offer them a place for them to perform
              prayers every few hours daily.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">These people feel special when they see prayer rooms
              provided in buildings overseas, not realising that prayer rooms elsewhere are
              afforded not to just Muslims, but to all faiths.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It is common to see shared quiet rooms where Muslims
              can perform their daily prayer, Christians can hold their mass, and for others
              to meditate and contemplate on life — all in the same place.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">This willingness to share, however, is rarely extended
              by Muslims here.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">During Bersih 4, the nearby Masjid Jamek was open, but
              was indifferent towards accommodating and welcoming adherents.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Participants were blamed by some media for “occupying”
              spaces for prayers by resting there and the sound of the vuvuzelas outside were
              panned for “annoying” the focus of Muslims who were trying to pray.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I went on a holiday in Siem Reap last week, and it was
              a humbling experience to witness Buddhist rituals under a giant Buddhist statue
              in the Kulen Mountain National Park.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The ancient temples in the Angkor complex themselves
              were definitely among the most sacred and holiest places for local Hindus and
              Buddhists hundreds of years ago, and now anybody can walk in and have their
              breath taken away by their religious majesty.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">I have had the same experience at the Erawan Shrine in
              Bangkok, just months before yet another fatal bombing. In Tokyo, I was free to
              give my respects and try out the purification ritual at the shrines. I am sure
              many of my readers have their own similar experiences.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">But non-Muslims would have little chance to do so in
              our mosques. When it comes to prayer, some in the Muslim community seem to
              close themselves off from the world, relieving others the chance to observe and
              find out what it is that makes Islam so attractive, if any.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mosques used to be the centre of Malay communities
              back in the day. It was a place for socialising, for children to learn, some
              even had bazaars in their compounds.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">There has never been a time where mosques are as many
              as they are right now. But instead, most are as lifeless as ever.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Mosques are built huge and ornate, but sometimes just
              a tool for politicians to win voters’ hearts. Instead of making mosques
              attractive, religious authorities vilify those who avoid them.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Worse still, there is some sort of a possessiveness
              towards mosques and Muslim praying areas.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Who can forget when a Buddhist group decided to borrow
              a surau, or prayer hall, in a Kota Tinggi resort for meditation two years ago?</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Instead of showing hospitality, many Muslims went
              berserk. The owner of the resort was called in by the police. The surau itself,
              was in the end torn down as it was deemed “polluted” by the Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That is how much some Muslims value their places of
              worship.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">The recent heartwarming stories we heard of others
              accommodating Muslims should at least open the eyes of Muslims.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It would be a nice gesture if Muslims can also respect
              non-Muslims’s acts and places of worship. Instead, we see protests against a
              cross hung at a church. Christians cannot use the word “Allah.” Their bibles
              are seized.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Non-Muslims have shown they can open their doors to
              Muslims. Will we ever see Muslims reciprocating?</span></p>
