              <p><span>SONG SIX</span>: Initiation into our true
                                      existential condition</p>
              <p><span>EHMAHO</span>! Again, beloved children of my
                                      heart, listen! “Mind”, this universal concept, this most
                                      significant of words, being no single entity, manifests as the
                                      gamut of pleasure and pain in samsara and nirvana. There are as
                                      many beliefs about it as there are approaches to Buddhahood. It has
                                      innumerable synonyms.</p>
              <p>In the vernacular it is “I”; some Hindus call it “the Self”; the
                                      Disciples say “self-less individual”; the followers of Mind-only
                                      call it simply “mind”; some call it “perfect insight”; some call it
                                      “Buddha-nature”; some call it “the Magnificent Stance” (Mahamudra);
                                      some call it “the Middle Way”; some call it “the cosmic seed”; some
                                      call it “the reality-continuum”; some call it “the universal
                                      ground”; some call it “ordinary consciousness”. Since the synonyms
                                      of “mind”, the labels we apply to it, are countless, know it for
                                      what it really is. Know it experientially as the here and now.
                                      Compose yourself in the natural state of your mind’s nature.</p>
              <p>When at rest the mind is ordinary perception, naked and
                                      unadorned; when you gaze directly at it there is nothing to see but
                                      light; as Awareness, it is brilliance and the relaxed vigilance of
                                      the awakened state; as nothing specific whatsoever, it is a secret
                                      fullness; it is the ultimacy of nondual radiance and emptiness.</p>
              <p>It is not eternal, for nothing whatsoever about it has been
                                      proved to exist. It is not a void, for there is brilliance and
                                      wakefulness. It is not unity, for multiplicity is self-evident in
                                      perception. It is not multiplicity, for we know the one taste of
                                      unity. It is not an external function, for Awareness is intrinsic
                                      to immediate reality.</p>
              <p>In the immediate here and now we see the face of the Original
                                      Lord abiding in the heart centre. Identify yourself with him, my
                                      spiritual sons. Whoever denies him, wanting more from somewhere
                                      else, is like the man who has found his elephant but continues to
                                      follow its tracks. He may comb the three dimensions of the
                                      microcosmic world systems for an eternity, but he will not find so
                                      much as the name of Buddha other than the one in his heart.</p>
              <p>Such is my introduction initiating recognition of our true
                                      existential condition, which is the principal realization in
                                      Cutting Through to the Great Perfection.</p>
              <p><span>SONG SEVEN</span>: Assertion of our Intrinsic
                                      Buddhahood</p>
              <p><span>EHMAHO</span>! Once more listen attentively, my
                                      noble sons and daughters. The three modes of Buddha’s being <del>-
                                      essence, nature and responsiveness -</del> and the five modes of
                                      being, as well as the five aspects of primal awareness, all are
                                      completed and perfected in the naturally luminous intrinsic
                                      awareness of the here and now.</p>
              <p>The essence of Awareness, indefinable by any term such as
                                      colour, shape or other attribute, is the dharmakaya; the inherent
                                      radiance of emptiness is the light of the sambhogakaya; and the
                                      unimpeded medium in which all things manifest is the
                                      nirmanakaya.</p>
              <p>The three modes are explained figuratively like this: the
                                      dharmakaya is a crystal mirror; the sambhogakaya is its
                                      nature—brilliant clarity; and the nirmanakaya is the unobstructed
                                      medium in which the reflection appears.</p>
              <p>From the first, people’s minds have existed as these three modes
                                      of being. If they are able to recognize this spontaneously, it is
                                      unnecessary for them to practise even so much as a moment of formal
                                      meditation—the awakening to Buddhahood is instantaneous.</p>
              <p>In this introduction to the three modes they are defined
                                      separately. In truth, my heart-children, do not fall into the error
                                      of believing them to be separate, belonging to different
                                      continuums.</p>
              <p>From the beginning, the three modes of being are empty and
                                      utterly pure. Understanding them as a single essence that is the
                                      union of radiance and emptiness, conduct yourself in a state of
                                      detachment.</p>
              <p>The triad of essence, nature and responsiveness, again,
                                      corresponds to dharmakaya, sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya.
                                      Understanding these three as the mystic union of emptiness and
                                      radiance, conduct yourself in a state of detachment.</p>
              <p>Further, since the primal awareness of self-existing Awareness
                                      manifests everything whatsoever, this awareness is the pure-being
                                      of the Creator, Vairocana; since it is unchanging and unchangeable,
                                      it is the pure-being of Immutable Diamond, Aksobhya-vajra; since it
                                      is without centre or circumference, it is the pure-being of
                                      Boundless Light-form, Amitabha; since it is also the gem that is
                                      the source of supreme realization and relative powers, it is the
                                      pure-being of the Fountain of Jewels, Ratnasambhava; since it
                                      accomplishes all aspiration, it is the pure-being of the Fulfiller
                                      of All Ambition, Amoghasiddhi. These deities are nothing but the
                                      creative power of Awareness.</p>
              <p>The primal awareness of Awareness is mirror-like awareness
                                      because of the manifest clarity of its unobstructed essence. It is
                                      awareness of sameness because it is all-pervasive. It is
                                      discriminating awareness because the entire gamut of diverse
                                      appearances is manifest from its creativity. It is the awareness
                                      that accomplishes all actions because it fulfils all our ambition.
                                      It is awareness of the reality-continuum, the dharmadhatu, because
                                      the single essence of all these aspects of awareness is primal
                                      purity. Not so much as an atom exists apart from these which are
                                      the creativity of intrinsic Awareness.</p>
              <p>When a pointed finger introduces you directly and immediately to
                                      the three modes <del>- essence, nature and responsiveness -</del> and the Five Buddhas and the five aspects of awareness, all
                                      together, then what is experienced is brilliant, awakened Awareness
                                      unaffected by circumstance and uninfluenced by clinging thought; it
                                      is cognition of the here and now, unstructured and unaffected.</p>
              <p>All the Buddhas of the three aspects of time arise from this
                                      Awareness. Constantly identify yourselves with it, beloved sons and
                                      daughters, because this is the spirituality of all the Buddhas of
                                      the three aspects of time.</p>
              <p>Awareness is unstructured, natural radiance your own mind, so
                                      how can you say that you cannot see the Buddha? There is nothing at
                                      all to meditate upon in it, so how can you complain that meditation
                                      does not arise? It is manifest Awareness, your own mind, so how can
                                      you say that you cannot find it? It is a stream of unceasing
                                      radiant wakefulness, the face of your mind, so how can you say that
                                      you cannot see it? There is not so much as a moment of work to be
                                      done to attain it, so how can you say that your effort is
                                      unavailing? Centred and dispersed states are two sides of the same
                                      coin, so how can you say that your mind is never centred? Intrinsic
                                      Awareness is the spontaneously originated three modes of being,
                                      which is achieved without striving, so how can you say that your
                                      practice fails to accomplish it? It is enough to leave the mind in
                                      a state of non-action, so how can you say that you are incapable of
                                      attaining it? Your thoughts are released at the moment of their
                                      inception, so how can you say that the antidotes were ineffective?
                                      It is cognition of the here and now, so how can you say you do not
                                      perceive it?</p>
              <p><span>SONG EIGHT</span>: The Method of Attaining
                                      Conviction</p>
              <p><span>EHMAHO</span>! Once again, beloved sons and
                                      daughters, listen with devotion! “Mind in its insubstantiality is
                                      like the sky.” Is this true or false, my children? Confirm it by
                                      relaxing completely and looking directly at the mind, gazing with
                                      your entire mind, free of all tension.</p>
              <p>“The emptiness of the mind is not just a blank nothingness, for
                                      without doubt it is the primal awareness of intrinsic Awareness,
                                      radiant from the first. Self-existent, natural radiance is like
                                      sunlight.” Is this indeed true? To confirm it, relax completely,
                                      looking directly at the nature of your mind.</p>
              <p>“There is no doubt that it is impossible to objectify or grasp
                                      thought or the movement of memory. This capricious, changeable
                                      movement is like the cosmic wind!” Is this indeed so? To confirm
                                      it, relax completely, looking directly at the nature of your
                                      mind.</p>
              <p>“Without doubt all appearances whatsoever are our own
                                      manifestation. All phenomena, whatsoever manifests, is like
                                      reflection in a mirror.” Is this indeed so? To confirm it, relax
                                      completely, looking directly at the nature of your mind.</p>
              <p>No experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is
                                      nothing to see other than that seen at the moment of vision. No
                                      experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is
                                      nothing to meditate upon other than mind. No experience is possible
                                      anywhere but in the mind, so there is nothing to do other than what
                                      is done in the mind. No experience is possible anywhere but in the
                                      mind, so there is no samaya to be sustained outside the mind. No
                                      experience is possible anywhere but in the mind, so there is no
                                      goal to be reached that is not in the mind.</p>
              <p>Look, look, and look again. Look at your own mind!</p>
              <p>Project your attention into external fields of space, and,
                                      attentively watching the nature of your mind, see if it moves. When
                                      you are convinced by observation that the mind does not move,
                                      retract your attention and concentrate upon the mind within, and
                                      look carefully for the projector of diffused thought. When you have
                                      decided that there is no entity responsible for thought patterns,
                                      look carefully for the colour and shape of the mind. When you
                                      arrive at the emptiness that has no colour or shape, look for a
                                      centre or circumference. Certain that middle and margin are the
                                      same, search for an inside and an outside. Finding no distinction
                                      between inside and outside, you arrive at Awareness, which is as
                                      vast as the sky.</p>
              <p>“By virtue of its all-penetrating freedom this Awareness that
                                      has no centre or circumference, no inside or outside, is innocent
                                      of all partiality and knows no blocks or barriers. This
                                      all-penetrating intrinsic Awareness is a vast expanse of space. All
                                      experience of samsara and nirvana arises in it like rainbows in the
                                      sky. In all its diverse manifestation it is but a play of
                                      mind.”</p>
              <p>You need only look out from the motionless space of intrinsic
                                      Awareness at all experience, illusory like the reflection of the
                                      moon in water, to know the impossibility of dividing appearances
                                      from emptiness.</p>
              <p>“In a state of Awareness there is no separation of samsara and
                                      nirvana.” Look out from the motionless space of intrinsic Awareness
                                      at all experience, illusory like the reflection in a mirror, and no
                                      matter what manifests it can never be tasted, its existence can
                                      never be proved. In this dimension samsara and nirvana do not exist
                                      and everything is the dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>All beings wandering in the three realms of samsara remain
                                      trapped in dualism until they realize that within their own
                                      perception resides the primal awareness that is the ultimate
                                      identity of all experience of samsara and nirvana. Due to the power
                                      of the delusive subject/object dichotomy, they hold samsara and
                                      nirvana to be different states of mind. They remain bound because,
                                      where in truth there is nonduality, they see a duality.</p>
              <p>In reality no distinction between samsara and nirvana can exist
                                      in anybody’s mind. However, when the worldly fool rejects some
                                      things and indulges in others, avoiding the “bad” and cultivating
                                      the “good”, despising one while loving another, then due to
                                      partiality, prejudice and bias, aimlessly he wanders through
                                      successive lives.</p>
              <p>Rather than attain the spontaneously accomplished three modes of
                                      intrinsic Awareness without striving, thick-headed aspirants
                                      explore the techniques and stages of many time-consuming methods of
                                      “self-improvement”, leaving them no time to reach the seat of the
                                      Buddha.</p>
              <p>“Emphatically, all phenomenal appearances whatsoever are one’s
                                      own vision.” Look out from the state of motionless intrinsic
                                      Awareness and all light-form and animate existence is like
                                      reflection. Appearances are empty, sound is empty and indeed one’s
                                      own nature is originally empty.</p>
              <p>Similarly, turn your attention inwards to the mind that is the
                                      viewer, and your thought processes, naturally subsiding, are empty
                                      like the sky, unstructured, free of conceptual elaboration, utterly
                                      indeterminable, beyond description, concept and expression of any
                                      kind.</p>
              <p>All events whatsoever are an illusory magical display of mind
                                      and all the magical display of mind is baseless and empty. When you
                                      have realized that all events are your own mind, all visual
                                      appearances become the empty dharmakaya.</p>
              <p>Appearances are not binding. It is through attachment to them
                                      that beings are fettered. Sever all delusive attachments, children
                                      of my heart!</p>
              <p><span>SONG NINE</span>: Mist Dream and Optical
                                      Illusion</p>
              <p><span>EHMAHO</span>! Best beloved, fearless sons and
                                      daughters, without applying the spur, the horse will not gallop;
                                      without thorough churning, the butter will not separate; without
                                      detailed explanation you will not be convinced of my meaning. So
                                      while I sing my long but lyrical songs, listen in comfort, relaxed,
                                      without drooping ears!</p>
              <p>Until you perceive all appearances as mind you will never
                                      realize the meaning of emptiness. To facilitate this understanding,
                                      you favoured children must apply yourselves fully to a diligent
                                      analysis and thorough search. Firstly, where do appearances come
                                      from? Secondly, where are they now? Lastly, where do they go?</p>
              <p>During your examination you will see that just as mist arises
                                      out of the sky and dissolves back into the sky, appearances are the
                                      magical display of your mind, arising in the mind and vanishing
                                      back into it.</p>
              <p>Take as an example the shimmering effect seen by a man with an
                                      impaired sense of vision when he gazes ahead. Although the
                                      shimmering appears to exist in front of his eyes, nothing is
                                      there—it is an optical illusion.</p>
              <p>In the same way, when mental functions are impaired by negative
                                      propensities that cause clinging to apparently external objects as
                                      discrete and substantial entities, then visual and auditory
                                      phenomena appear to exist where not so much as an atom can be
                                      proved to have ultimate reality. Everything is a figment of the
                                      mind.</p>
              <p>All these figments of mind are baseless and empty. They are
                                      non-existent light-forms, apparition and magical illusion, like the
                                      reflection of the moon in water. Compose yourself in the reality of
                                      inseparable appearance and emptiness!</p>
              <p>Now in our sleep we may dream of our native country, our
                                      parental home, and our relatives or friends, as if they were
                                      actually present, and an appropriate strong feeling may arise.
                                      Although our family and friends are not actually present and we
                                      have not stirred an inch from our beds, we may experience a
                                      face-to-face encounter with them of the same vivid intensity as in
                                      the waking state.</p>
              <p>Each and every sensual experience of our lives is an experience
                                      similar to last night’s dream. Just as we attach labels to dream
                                      entities, objectifying and clinging to them as substantial
                                      entities, so appearances are modified and apprehended by mind in
                                      the waking state. In the same way that dreams have no substance, so
                                      the figments of the mind, all appearances whatsoever, are also
                                      empty.</p>
