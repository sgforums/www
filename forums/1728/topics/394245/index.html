              <p>A teaching by the great Zen Master Dogen.<br> <br> Fukanzazengi<br> Universally recommended instructions for Zazen<br> <br> The Way is originally perfect and all-pervading. How could it be 
              contingent on practice and realization? The true vehicle is 
              self-sufficient. What need is there for special effort? Indeed, the 
              whole body is free from dust. Who could believe in a means to brush it 
              clean? It is never apart from this very place; what is the use of 
              traveling around to practice? And yet, if there is a hairsbreadth 
              deviation, it is like the gap between heaven and earth. If the least 
              like or dislike arises, the mind is lost in confusion. Suppose you are 
              confident in your understanding and rich in enlightenment, gaining the 
              wisdom that knows at a glance, attaining the Way and clarifying the 
              mind, arousing an aspiration to reach for the heavens. You are playing 
              in the entranceway, but you still are short of the vital path of 
              emancipation.<br> <br> Consider the Buddha: although he was wise at birth, the traces of his 
              six years of upright sitting can yet be seen. As for Bodhidharma, 
              although he had received the mind-seal, his nine years of facing a wall 
              is celebrated still. If even the ancient sages were like this, how can 
              we today dispense with wholehearted practice?<br> <br> Therefore, put aside the intellectual practice of investigating words 
              and chasing phrases, and learn to take the backward step that turns the 
              light and shines it inward. Body and mind of themselves will drop away, 
              and your original face will manifest. If you want such a thing, get to 
              work on such a thing immediately.<br> <br> For practicing Zen, a quiet room is suitable. Eat and drink moderately. 
              Put aside all involvements and suspend all affairs. Do not think “good” 
              or “bad.” Do not judge true or false. Give up the operations of mind, 
              intellect, and consciousness; stop measuring with thoughts, ideas, and 
              views. Have no designs on becoming a Buddha. How could that be limited 
              to sitting or lying down?<br> <br> At your sitting place, spread out a thick mat and put a cushion on it. 
              Sit either in the full-lotus or half-lotus position. In the full-lotus 
              position, first place your right foot on your left thigh, then your left
               foot on your right thigh. In the half-lotus, simply place your left 
              foot on your right thigh. Tie your robes loosely and arrange them 
              neatly. Then place your right hand on your left leg and your left hand 
              on your right palm, thumb-tips lightly touching. Straighten your body 
              and sit upright, leaning neither left nor right, neither forward nor 
              backward. Align your ears with your shoulders and your nose with your 
              navel. Rest the tip of your tongue against the front of the roof of your
               mouth, with teeth and lips together both shut. Always keep your eyes 
              open, and breathe softly through your nose.<br> <br> Once you have adjusted your posture, take a breath and exhale fully, 
              rock your body right and left, and settle into steady, immovable 
              sitting. Think of not thinking. Not thinking—what kind of thinking is 
              that? Nonthinking. This is the essential art of zazen.<br> <br> The zazen I speak of is not meditation practice. It is simply the Dharma
               gate of joyful ease, the practice-realization of totally culminated 
              enlightenment. It is the koan realized, traps and snares can never reach
               it. If you grasp the point, you are like a dragon gaining the water, 
              like a tiger taking to the mountains. For you must know that the true 
              Dharma appears of itself, so that from the start dullness and 
              distraction are struck aside.<br> <br> When you arise from sitting, move slowly and quietly, calmly and 
              deliberately. Do not rise suddenly or abruptly. In surveying the past, 
              we find that transcendence of both mundane and sacred, and dying while 
              either sitting or standing, have all depended entirely on the power of 
              zazen.<br> <br> In addition, triggering awakening with a finger, a banner, a needle, or a
               mallet, and effecting realization with a whisk, a fist, a staff, or a 
              shout - these cannot be understood by discriminative thinking, much less
               can they be known through the practice of supernatural power. They must
               represent conduct beyond seeing and hearing. Are they not a standard 
              prior to knowledge and views?<br> <br> This being the case, intelligence or lack of it is not an issue; make no
               distinction between the dull and the sharp-witted. If you concentrate 
              your effort single-mindedly, that in itself is wholeheartedly engaging 
              the way. Practice-realization is naturally undefiled. Going forward is, 
              after all, an everyday affair.<br> <br> In our world and others, in both India and China, all equally hold the 
              buddha-seal. While each lineage expresses its own style, they are all 
              simply devoted to sitting, totally blocked in resolute stability. 
              Although they say that there are ten thousand distinctions and a 
              thousand variations, they just wholeheartedly engage the way in zazen. 
              Why leave behind the seat in your own home to wander in vain through the
               dusty realms of other lands? If you make one misstep you stumble past 
              what is directly in front of you.<br> <br> You have gained the pivotal opportunity of human form. Do not pass your 
              days and nights in vain. You are taking care of the essential activity 
              of the buddha way. Who would take wasteful delight in the spark from a 
              flint stone? Besides, form and substance are like the dew on the grass, 
              the fortunes of life like a dart of lightning—emptied in an instant, 
              vanished in a flash.<br> <br> Please, honored followers of Zen, long accustomed to groping for the 
              elephant, do not doubt the true dragon. Devote your energies to the way 
              that points directly to the real thing. Revere the one who has gone 
              beyond learning and is free from effort. Accord with the enlightenment 
              of all the Buddhas; succeed to the samadhi of all the ancestors. 
              Continue to live in such a way, and you will be such a person. The 
              treasure store will open of itself, and you may enjoy it freely.<br> <br> Eihei Dogen [21]</p>

              <p>Related, see article in <span class="forum"> </span> <span class="topic"> <a href="331569">Pure 
              Awareness</a> </span></p>
              <p><em>(Tejananda) </em></p>
              <p><em><br>My experience with rigpa / pure awareness is of ‘stepping back’ to 
              use Dogen’s evocative phrase, where Awareness or Suchness is 
              ‘self-known’, the sense of ‘me here’ disappears and everything that 
              appears is appearing in / as a field of sort of equal awareness 
              everywhere with no ‘inside’ or ‘outside’. I first noticed this after a 
              period in which ‘the watcher’ became very evident and seemed to have a 
              quasi-location just behind my head. At some point, the watcher simply 
              disappeared, and has never returned, and there was just the availability
               of this field of equal awareness as I just described. As far as I can 
              ascertain, the dropping away of believing in ‘me’ as a fixed ‘self’ came
               in the wake of this becoming ‘available’. I’m not absolutely certain 
              though – I just thought to ‘check’ one day and noticed it wasn’t there. 
              It’s possible it hadn’t occurred to me to check in this way before. I 
              made the connection with the first 3 fetters &amp; sure enough there was
               no doubt and a clarity as to what was or wasn’t the effective path, 
              together with a much clearer sense ‘from inside’ of how all the 
              different wisdom teachings and perspectives in different Buddhist and 
              (to the extent I’m aware of them) non-Buddhist traditions were in 
              harmony with each other. That said, my habit energies (sankharas) still 
              give me a very rough ride and my predominant experience of life tends to
               be rather painful.</em></p>

              <p>I like the Dogen article, thanks.</p>
              <p>Anyway, just recommending a book to any who are interested,</p>
              <p><strong>Maura O' Halloran, "Pure Heart, Enlightened Mind: The Life &amp; Letters of An Irish Zen Saint"</strong></p>
              <p>Maura is an Irish lady who went to Japan to study under a renowned Zen master and attained the level of a Zen Master in just 3 years. She later died in a car accident and was revered in rural Japan as an emanation of Kannon Bodhisattva.   She was praised by the Zen master as being his best disciple ever.  I find this book very interesting for her perspective on dealing with difficult people, hard work- difficulties in life in general and practice.   It also broke down some of my preconceptions and expectations.</p>
