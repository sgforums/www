A country may have different religions co-existing at the same time, such as Buddhism, Catholicism, Christianity or Islam. But, we have to understand that it is the condition arising from love that causes people to have families, parents and children. It is a good thing if the family is happy and blissful. However, if the family members bear different faiths, so long as each member keeps his faith to himself, refrain from slandering or debating over each otherÂ’s faith, but mutually respecting each otherÂ’s faith and character, then the family will naturally be harmonious.<br><br>Further, the younger generation ought to refrain from arguing with their elders because it is their parents who brought them up. Moreover, there is no purpose in arguing with them. We have to practise filial piety and be good so that we do them proud. Then, they will feel that their children are righteous, well behaved, and may willingly join us to learn about Buddhism. This will be ideal. Otherwise, it is not filial to constantly argue with them. When we learn and practise Buddhism, we have to exercise wisdom. With regards to differences in religions and faiths, as long as we maintain mutual respect, I believe, the family will be harmonious.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Freedom in choice of religion<br><br>If the children of a Buddhist family choose to marry a person of a different faith, will the marriage work out well?</span></strong><br><br>Although a person may be a Buddhist himself, it is not necessary that his children must also Buddhists. We may, of course, promote and encourage our children to embrace Buddhism. However, we cannot force it upon them. Moreover, we should not object to their marriage just because their partners are from a different faith.<br><br>In this present age, everybody has the freedom to love and choose his or her own lifetime partner. Similarly, everyone has the freedom of choice of religion and faith. No religion can compel its followers (and their dependants) to only believe in that particular faith, and object to marriages outside that particular faith. I believe, as parents, with regards to their childrenÂ’s marriages, the primary concerns are the relationship between the two parties and how to guide their children in deciding their lifetime partners. Religion and faith are secondary factors; it is their happiness after the marriage that matters most of all. It would be useful for parents to counsel their children about the code of family ethics, such as the role and responsibilities of a husband and wife, and how to be good parents themselves. If they do not know how to live harmoniously and fulfil their responsibilities as husband and wife, or to be good parents, even if both of them believe in Buddhism, the marriage may still not work out well. If, for instance, the choice partner believes in a different faith, as a parent, one may promote the teachings of Buddhism so that he or she finds it acceptable. It will, of course, be good to establish a household based on the principles of Buddhism. If, meanwhile that cannot be achieved, one should adopt the Buddhist teaching of loving-kindness, compassion and equality towards all beings, in relation to the son-in-law or daughter-in-law. It is a good thing for a couple to bear the same faith and share the same principles and values, with both cultivating together and becoming partners on the Bodhi-path. It would be even better if they were eventually reborn in the Buddha-land.<br><br>*snipped*</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is indeed such a thing in Buddhism that I have aptly termed, 'Match-Made-By-Kamma'.<br><br>Most living beings, especially evident within the human race have an individual, usually from the opposite sex with whom they maintained an intimate and personal relationship. Such a relationship with the kammic seeds being cultivated can span countless of lifetimes. Life after life, individuals come together to renew and reconnect their relationships, assisting each other in life and in the development of spiritual cultivation. Such devoted companions are integral and essential to one's quest for perfection and to become a fully-enlightened being - a Buddha.<br><br>To cite a story, long before the advent of our Lord Sakyamuni Buddha in a past aeon of the world, there is an earlier Buddha known as Dipankara. At that time was a young forest-dwelling ascetic known as Sumedha. When Sumedha knew that Dipankara Buddha was crossing the area, he immediately took upon the task to prepare a smooth road for the Buddha to cross. Sumedha was still in the midst of preparing when Dipankara Buddha arrived. Full of devotion, Sumedha prostrated himself into a muddy hollow for the Buddha to cross smoothly and made a vow to become a Buddha himself in the future.<br><br>At the same time, a young lady known as Sumitta stepped forward joyously, bearing incense and fresh flowers to congratulate the young ascetic. However, Sumedha immediately rejected her support, affirming that he was a forest-dwelling ascetic and wanted to live alone. Dipankara Buddha witnessing the entire episode step forward to cautioned the young ascetic Sumedha. He announced that the young ascetic would one day become a fully-enlightened being but he also told Sumedha that for every aspirant to Buddhahood had a spiritual companion who was his inseparable partner throughout the long, arduous quest for spiritual perfection. The lady Sumitta was his spiritual companion.<br><br>And through many lifetimes, this couple had to go through many obstacles as they strive for the benefits of all beings and their spiritual cultivation together. There are many stories in the Jataka where one can find tales about this special couple and the unwavering love and support both has for each other.<br><br>Finally in our world 2,500 years ago, the young ascetic Sumedha, reborn as Prince Siddhartha achieved perfection and became the fully-enlightened Buddha. The lady Sumitta, reborn as Princess Yasodhara attained arhanthood.<br><br>This idea of 'match-made-by-kamma' can be further cemented within the Anguttara Nikaya (The Numerical Discourses). There was a layperson Nakulapita who together with his wife, Nakulamata expressed their wishes to the Buddha to be reborn repeatedly as companions.<br><br>The Buddha on hearing those words replied, "If man and wife, who are leading a harmonious life, wish to be together in the next existences, they should have the same faith, the same morality, the same liberality and the same level of knowledge. Then they will be in one another's sight so long as this life lasts and in the future life as well."<br><br>He added on further, "When both are faithful and bountiful, self-restrained, of a righteous living. They come together as husband and wife, full of love for each other."<br><br>These examples may shock many as Buddhism is often seemed as hardlined teachings against marriage, love commitments and lay life.<br><br>In fact, the Buddha was so often full of praises for happy and virtuous couples during His time!<br><br>So have you found your 'Match-Made-By-Kamma' yet?<br>If not, take your time.<br></div>

In this way the 'karmic affinity' is not purely 'love relationship' but also a dharma affinity.. (fa yuan) I do think that it works... my dharma teacher is a lay teacher and my master made both her and her husband to be lay clergies to help propogate the dharma. It has worked very well.<br><br>Nevertheless we shld not think as if that there must be someone out there that we are 'fated' to meet and marry... or that in the next life we are going to be fate to meet someone... since causes and conditions and karma isn't about fate. Though of course, we can plant the causes and conditions..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by civilization:</div><div class="quote_body">There is indeed such a thing in Buddhism that I have aptly termed, 'Match-Made-By-Kamma'.<br><br>Most living beings, especially evident within the human race have an individual, usually from the opposite sex with whom they maintained an intimate and personal relationship. Such a relationship with the kammic seeds being cultivated can span countless of lifetimes. Life after life, individuals come together to renew and reconnect their relationships, assisting each other in life and in the development of spiritual cultivation. Such devoted companions are integral and essential to one's quest for perfection and to become a fully-enlightened being - a Buddha.<br><br>To cite a story, long before the advent of our Lord Sakyamuni Buddha in a past aeon of the world, there is an earlier Buddha known as Dipankara. At that time was a young forest-dwelling ascetic known as Sumedha. When Sumedha knew that Dipankara Buddha was crossing the area, he immediately took upon the task to prepare a smooth road for the Buddha to cross. Sumedha was still in the midst of preparing when Dipankara Buddha arrived. Full of devotion, Sumedha prostrated himself into a muddy hollow for the Buddha to cross smoothly and made a vow to become a Buddha himself in the future.<br><br>At the same time, a young lady known as Sumitta stepped forward joyously, bearing incense and fresh flowers to congratulate the young ascetic. However, Sumedha immediately rejected her support, affirming that he was a forest-dwelling ascetic and wanted to live alone. Dipankara Buddha witnessing the entire episode step forward to cautioned the young ascetic Sumedha. He announced that the young ascetic would one day become a fully-enlightened being but he also told Sumedha that for every aspirant to Buddhahood had a spiritual companion who was his inseparable partner throughout the long, arduous quest for spiritual perfection. The lady Sumitta was his spiritual companion.<br><br>And through many lifetimes, this couple had to go through many obstacles as they strive for the benefits of all beings and their spiritual cultivation together. There are many stories in the Jataka where one can find tales about this special couple and the unwavering love and support both has for each other.<br><br>Finally in our world 2,500 years ago, the young ascetic Sumedha, reborn as Prince Siddhartha achieved perfection and became the fully-enlightened Buddha. The lady Sumitta, reborn as Princess Yasodhara attained arhanthood.<br><br>This idea of 'match-made-by-kamma' can be further cemented within the Anguttara Nikaya (The Numerical Discourses). There was a layperson Nakulapita who together with his wife, Nakulamata expressed their wishes to the Buddha to be reborn repeatedly as companions.<br><br>The Buddha on hearing those words replied, "If man and wife, who are leading a harmonious life, wish to be together in the next existences, they should have the same faith, the same morality, the same liberality and the same level of knowledge. Then they will be in one another's sight so long as this life lasts and in the future life as well."<br><br>He added on further, "When both are faithful and bountiful, self-restrained, of a righteous living. They come together as husband and wife, full of love for each other."<br><br>These examples may shock many as Buddhism is often seemed as hardlined teachings against marriage, love commitments and lay life.<br><br>In fact, the Buddha was so often full of praises for happy and virtuous couples during His time!<br><br>So have you found your 'Match-Made-By-Kamma' yet?<br>If not, take your time.<br></div></blockquote>So romantic!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by snowstar:</div><div class="quote_body">Do buddists believe in soulmate or the right one for you? I have always wondered if there is a soul mate for everyone. I used to think that everything in nature exists in pairs to make it complete. Male and female. New life will only be created when male and female merge as one. Light and darkness. Light will only exist when there is shadows or darkness. Good and evil. Good will only exist if there is bad to show a contrast. Happy and sad. One will not know what happiness is when one has not experienced sadness. Yin and yang. And the list goes on.... Will someone be kind enough to enlighten me?</div></blockquote>Maybe it is a concidence, perchance it may be that i am supposed to answer this question. It just happened that i myself am exploring this topic and saw this thread.<br><br>First thing first, just to offer you my view. It is a mistake to think that you need a pair to be complete. A female thinks she is 100% female, a male thinks he is 100% male. This is how society conditioned your thinking and it is laughable.  A person is 50% male and 50% female, at least initially, half of which come from your father, the other from your mother. If you can agree to that, then drop the thinking that you need some other to be complete, simply because you are already complete to begin with.<br><br>For the issue at hand, currently the best book in print on the subject is arguably "Edgar Cayce on Soul Mates". Fascinating read if you are interested in the subject.  (Available at selected library branches, search the catalog --  i'm currently holding a copy.)<br><br>An introduction:<br><a href="http://www.edgarcayce.org/about_ec/cayce_on/soulmates/" rel="nofollow">http://www.edgarcayce.org/about_ec/cayce_on/soulmates/</a><br><br>I can only show you the path, you have to travel through it. Enough said.<br></div>
