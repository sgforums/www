He has comprehended the totality of cause and effect. He knows for instance, how and when is the universe going to end and the next universe forms again. He also know what is going to happen to mankind a long time from now. I don't think it's 5000 years btw, will be longer than 5000 years.<br><br>Anyway it's not that there is no way we can be good in that period of time. As a matter of fact there will continue to be Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Dharma practitioners even when the lifespan has decreased to 10 years old and people can murder each other with a blade of grass. However, these people will be hiding in the wilderness as the commoners no longer accept nor hear the dharma.. and their (the sages and practitioners') lives become threatened in society.<br><br>If you are a true dharma practitioner and are born in those times, you will not be born among those 'commoners' who suffer terribly and are shrouded by ignorance and evil, but you will be born among the sages and practitioners who hides away in the wilderness.<br><br>Only after the great calamities caused almost the entire human race to be annihilated whereby only a small group of people survived, they wake up from their evil ways and tend towards the wholesome path. It is at this time, the Bodhisattvas (Maitreya cld be one of the Bodhisattva to appear), Arhats, and practitoners returns to the society to preach the way of dharma again... at this time the lifespan becomes an upward trend all the way to 84000 (note that 84000 may not be a literal number, but a figurative number meaning 'uncountable')<br><br>more info about the whole thing -- <a href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no2a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/vol8no2a.htm</a><br><br>So to answer your question -- is it all fated? It is not a matter of whether it's 'fated', but that on the whole, the collective karmic conditionings of humanity is really beyond our capacity to transform. Just like even though the Buddha is born on Earth, few people practice his way, nor attain Enlightenment.<br><br>At this trend it will have to eventually reach great calamity before people wake up. BUT, what we can change, is ourselves. If we can change ourselves, we will not be born with those terrible conditions... but continue practicing in the mountains even in that period of time.</div>
