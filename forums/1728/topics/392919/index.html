              <p>my aim/goal now is to strive for a unshakable knowing,a "sense" of certainty,of the truth.now this may sound vague,and one may naturally ask - what truth?truth about what?one's self?phenomena/objects?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now questions are within the world of thoughts,and im unwilling to fall into the conceptual realm;as i trust the mind will never be the vehicle that will take us all the way to the realm of awakening.so there's just this simple sense of belief/trust that there's some ultimate truth,when realized,will take one beyond any sense of doubt,an unshakable certainty that - this is it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my question is,how can one differentiate between  experiences and true realization ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since in one sense,realization has the same quality as experience,since in the recognition/noticing of something which has always been there( the removal of obscurations) ; there's this "something (insight)which suddenly appears".experiences also appears and ends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>perhaps bernadette roberts is right in which she said(in her book - what is self)the self can only be known/understood when it's gone,and through retrospection can one know that the end of self has been reached.one will never know the what self is as long as one is in it.</p>

              <p>another question that comes to mind is this : without reliance on anyhing,and i mean ,anything at all - teachers,scriptures,faith in stages of path,can one reach the end of the journey?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i really want to dispense with anything conceptual,any views,any belief,thoughts and just let wherever this approach takes me to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>though im now reading (and try to digest) thusness's article -  7 stages,and also other spiritual articles,it just doesn't seem to get me anywhere.it seems my main obstacles now are the mind/thoughts,and i need to trust more on direct observation and let whatever revelation comes unhindered(by trying to understand with the mind). </p>

              <p>Just a few points: I assume you have read the blog I and Thusness run, and are familiar with his articles.</p>
              <p>You asked, what is one 'certain of' when one is realised? First of all there are a few different realisations and experience - mainly the I AMness, One Mind, No Mind, Emptiness. Each insight are complementary are important as they relate to different insights of the nature of reality and deconstructing certain mental constructs. As Thusness described,<em><span style="color: #333333;"><br></span></em></p>

              <p>(see Thusness's reply in <a class="entry-title" rel="bookmark" href="/forums/1728/topics/391975">Mind and Self-Liberation</a>)</p>
              <p>If you follow the path of self inquiry, you ask 'Before birth Who am I?' or just 'Who am I?' - This koan will lead to the realisation of I AMness. There is certainty about the luminous aspect of one's Being. One knows without a doubt that there is an undeniable luminous essence that is aware and present as a sense of pure beingness or a pure sense of existence, presence and knowingness. Then one may practice another koan, or further investigations to deconstruct the objective pole resulting in the insight of non-duality or One Mind where one is then 'certain of' reality as not divided in terms of subject and object, followed by further deconstruction leading to the experience of No Mind and insight of Anatta. Each insight brings a new insight and certainty about reality and deconstructs a different level of mental construct.</p>
              <p>However this path is different from Daniel Ingram, who follows the path of vipassana. It climbs the insight stages (nanas), results in fruition, and leading to the No Mind experience and Anatta insight. It bypasses the I AMness stage of realisation.</p>
              <p>So if you 'choose' to go through the I AMness experience, to have the certainty and conviction in your luminous essence, you can start with self inquiry like what the Zen tradition (especially emphasized in some Zen masters like Master Hsu Yun) or the Advaita tradition teach. However in Buddhism, the I AM is not the final stage of enlightenment, since insight into Anatta and Emptiness does not come automatically, though in itself it is an important realisation and experience.</p>
              <p>If you prefer to practice Vipassana, it is a slightly different path but also eventually leads to realisation of non-dual luminosity and anatta. I do have some experience with it and experienced some of the insight stages (nanas) but currently I do not focus on this path.</p>
              <p>As for realisation vs experience: Realisation is just clearly and directly seeing a fact of reality that is so obvious and clear as to be beyond doubt.</p>
              <p>In my undestanding, passing states and experiences are not realisation since they may not be related to seeing/realising the fundamental nature of reality which is eternal and ever-present. If it is simply an experience that comes and goes, that is not insight. Insight is 'seeing' something that is a fundamental truth of reality and ever-present at all moments (though it is not a dualistic seeing, not a 'me' seeing something) and hence is not something that comes and goes, not something that can 'leave' or 'be lost'.</p>
              <p>As Tejananda said in his article <strong><a href="http://sites.google.com/site/tejanandajohnwakeman/pureawareness">Pure
                                                       Awareness</a></strong> (which is quite a good read): <em></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Is there any way to distinguish 
                                                      between non-insightful states of
                                                      openness, stillness etc and pure awareness? One way would be to note 
                                                      whether
                                                      these qualities are arising or not – i.e. are they objects
                                                       that
                                                      come into awareness; or is it unarising (undeveloped, natural) 
                                                      emptiness-clarity
                                                      which is not an object (or subject) but which is just ‘there/here’ by 
                                                      its very
                                                      nature?</span></em></p>
              <p>As I am far from realising everything and can only speak from what I've learnt, hope Thusness and Longchen can comment further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh and regarding teachers, teachers and views, I wrote based on what Thusness said in my forum: <strong><em>I have to agree with you that a teacher is important - an experienced and enlightened teacher who can impart the Right View. This is to help us 'see' how a non-dual non-conceptual direct meditative experience is being reified into a metaphysical essence without even us noticing it. Ignorance goes far deeper than a non-dual, non-conceptual meditative state. Hence, a teacher is necessary to point out the right view, otherwise we will reify our meditative experience and get stuck on the monist view that you mentioned.</em></strong></p>
              <p>Like what Thusness said and I quoted previously:</p>
              <p><em>if the path consists of practice without the right view,
                                                                              almost without fail it will result in Advaita 
                                                      sort of
                                                                              experience.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhism is very subtle and without proper guidance it is difficult to grasp what the Buddha wants us to know.</p>
              <p>But of course as Thusness said in <a href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">On
                                           Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous 
                                          Perfection</a>:<br><em><br>Before proceeding any further, it is of absolute 
                                          importance to know that there is no way the stanzas can be correctly 
                                          understood by way of inference, logical deduction or induction.  Not 
                                          that there is something mystical or transcendental about the stanzas but
                                           simply the way of mental chattering is a 'wrong approach'.  The right 
                                          technique is through 'vipassana' or any more direct and attentive bare 
                                          mode of observation that allows the seeing of things as they are.  Just a
                                           casual note, such mode of knowing turns natural when non-dual insight 
                                          matures, before that it can be quite 'efforting'.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Self Inquiry too, leads  to direct experience and observation of of the I AMness without conceptual overlay.</p>
              <p>Any method must lead to "<em>direct and attentive bare

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Just a sharing.. since we are all practicing and learning.</p>
              <p>IMO, it is good to practice and refer to the teaching.. for authentication. Good realised Teachers are very important.</p>
              <p>More often than not, the initial experiences will have in-correct assumptions. For example, the first experience of the pure presence will almost always be characterised and assumed to be a vast, all-pervading eternal witness that is observing and witnessing the world/sense experiences.</p>
              <p>The realisations are usually stage-based. The implication, is that a wrong assumption will leave us stuck in that particular stage where the assumption was made. For example, if we assume that the Reality is like the I AM stage -level understanding, we most probably will not move on to realise the non-dual level experiences. And without the experiences of non-duality, it is quite impossible to realise the more subtle realisation of emptiness... as the emptiness insight 'required' the experience and understanding of non-duality.</p>
              <p>So.. the insights build up progressively with each correct re-orientation.</p>
              <p>Also, IMO, realisations are not just mind-level insights. There is an energetic aspect. For example, non-conceptuality is also an energetic experience. The energy-level of the body is different when non-conceptuality is experienced.</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Just a few points: I assume you have read the blog I and Thusness run, and are familiar with his articles.</p>
              <p>You asked, what is one 'certain of' when one is realised? First of all there are a few different realisations and experience - mainly the I AMness, One Mind, No Mind, Emptiness. Each insight are complementary are important as they relate to different insights of the nature of reality and deconstructing certain mental constructs. As Thusness described,<em><span style="color: #333333;"><br></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">1. If you de-construct the subjective pole, you will be led to the experience of No-Mind.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">2. If you de-construct the objective pole, you will be led to the experience of One-Mind.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">3. If you go through a process of de-constructing prepositional phrases like "in/out" "inside/outside" "into/onto," "within/without" "here/there", you will dissolve the illusionary nature of locality and time.</span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #333333;">4. If you simply go through the process of self-enquiry by disassociation and elimination without clearly understanding the non-inherent and dependent originated nature of phenomena, you will be led to the experience of “I AMness”.</span></em></p>
              <p>(see Thusness's reply in <a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/1728/topics/391975">Mind and Self-Liberation</a>)</p>
              <p>If you follow the path of self inquiry, you ask 'Before birth Who am I?' or just 'Who am I?' - This koan will lead to the realisation of I AMness. There is certainty about the luminous aspect of one's Being. One knows without a doubt that there is an undeniable luminous essence that is aware and present as a sense of pure beingness or a pure sense of existence, presence and knowingness. Then one may practice another koan, or further investigations to deconstruct the objective pole resulting in the insight of non-duality or One Mind where one is then 'certain of' reality as not divided in terms of subject and object, followed by further deconstruction leading to the experience of No Mind and insight of Anatta. Each insight brings a new insight and certainty about reality and deconstructs a different level of mental construct.</p>
              <p>However this path is different from Daniel Ingram, who follows the path of vipassana. It climbs the insight stages (nanas), results in fruition, and leading to the No Mind experience and Anatta insight. It bypasses the I AMness stage of realisation.</p>
              <p>So if you 'choose' to go through the I AMness experience, to have the certainty and conviction in your luminous essence, you can start with self inquiry like what the Zen tradition (especially emphasized in some Zen masters like Master Hsu Yun) or the Advaita tradition teach. However in Buddhism, the I AM is not the final stage of enlightenment, since insight into Anatta and Emptiness does not come automatically, though in itself it is an important realisation and experience.</p>
              <p>If you prefer to practice Vipassana, it is a slightly different path but also eventually leads to realisation of non-dual luminosity and anatta. I do have some experience with it and experienced some of the insight stages (nanas) but currently I do not focus on this path.</p>
              <p>As for realisation vs experience: Realisation is just clearly and directly seeing a fact of reality that is so obvious and clear as to be beyond doubt.</p>
              <p>In my undestanding, passing states and experiences are not realisation since they may not be related to seeing/realising the fundamental nature of reality which is eternal and ever-present. If it is simply an experience that comes and goes, that is not insight. Insight is 'seeing' something that is a fundamental truth of reality and ever-present at all moments (though it is not a dualistic seeing, not a 'me' seeing something) and hence is not something that comes and goes, not something that can 'leave' or 'be lost'.</p>
              <p>As Tejananda said in his article <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sites.google.com/site/tejanandajohnwakeman/pureawareness">Pure Awareness</a></strong> (which is quite a good read):</p>
              <p><em><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Is there any way to distinguish between non-insightful states of openness, stillness etc and pure awareness? One way would be to note whether these qualities are arising or not – i.e. are they objects that come into awareness; or is it unarising (undeveloped, natural) emptiness-clarity which is not an object (or subject) but which is just ‘there/here’ by its very nature?</span></em></p>
              <p>As I am far from realising everything and can only speak from what I've learnt, hope Thusness and Longchen can comment further.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh and regarding teachers, teachers and views, I wrote based on what Thusness said in my forum: <strong><em>I have to agree with you that a teacher is important - an experienced and enlightened teacher who can impart the Right View. This is to help us 'see' how a non-dual non-conceptual direct meditative experience is being reified into a metaphysical essence without even us noticing it. Ignorance goes far deeper than a non-dual, non-conceptual meditative state. Hence, a teacher is necessary to point out the right view, otherwise we will reify our meditative experience and get stuck on the monist view that you mentioned.</em></strong></p>
              <p>Like what Thusness said and I quoted previously:</p>
              <p><em>if the path consists of practice without the right view, almost without fail it will result in Advaita sort of experience.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Buddhism is very subtle and without proper guidance it is difficult to grasp what the Buddha wants us to know.</p>
              <p>But of course as Thusness said in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-anatta-emptiness-and-spontaneous.html">On Anatta (No-Self), Emptiness, Maha and Ordinariness, and Spontaneous Perfection</a>:<br><em><br>Before proceeding any further, it is of absolute importance to know that there is no way the stanzas can be correctly understood by way of inference, logical deduction or induction. Not that there is something mystical or transcendental about the stanzas but simply the way of mental chattering is a 'wrong approach'. The right technique is through 'vipassana' or any more direct and attentive bare mode of observation that allows the seeing of things as they are. Just a casual note, such mode of knowing turns natural when non-dual insight matures, before that it can be quite 'efforting'.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Self Inquiry too, leads  to direct experience and observation of of the I AMness without conceptual overlay.</p>
              <p>Any method must lead to "<em>direct and attentive bare mode of observation that allows the seeing of things as they are"</em> in order for insights to arise.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I wholeheartedly agree that 'Buddhism is very subtle and without proper guidance it is difficult to grasp what the Buddha wants us to know'. Such is my experience thus far. Indeed there is '<em>there is no way the stanzas can be correctly understood by way of inference, logical deduction or induction'. </em></p>
              <p>If anybody were to possess an Arahant's psychic eye abilities or even that of the Buddha's, they would probably see that since time immemorial, very few humans out of the whole world population would be able to achieve true Dharma insight (that which will immediately allow you to know beyond doubt you will be fully liberated from future rebirths after this present lifetime) in one single lifetime, regardless of the era they live in.</p>
              <p>That is why samsaric existence will continue to be for most of us for a very long time until conditions for Dharma learning and insight come and stay together at right time. We can cultivate countless conditions for the quick achievement of Dharma Insight, but most of us will hardly be able to know exactly when such conditions will ripen.</p>

              <p>in my original post,there's this (immature) assumption to make the path and attainment into a simple 2 stage - ignorant and enlightenment,duality and nonduality etc... in the past i was much taken by ssome teachings which promoted just this,and give a single path/practice towards this attainment.</p>
              <p>the path is not that simple it seems.....</p>
              <p>aen: ive just beginning to read this blog (also awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com)and there are still many things to chew/understood</p>
              <p>longchen : as 4 ur comment o assumptions,im really not sure the ones i have,there's readng from diferent sources,and its 'rojak' in here... i simply have the attitde that whn one 'get it'(awakened),all doubts/questioning will vanish .</p>
              <p>about energetic experience,there';s a number of enlightened teachers whose describe their own realization unvoidably involve certain kind opf energy/experience.</p>
              <p>it's like realization involves the "soul being release frm bondage of physical body" sensation,sort of obe...</p>
              <p>so far my path doesn't involved any sort of experiences,and there's frustration/doubt that im not practicing correctly,if the theory of experiences are true.   </p>

              <p>about the "experience" of realization : im still far from it,and speculation isnt helpful at this stage of my practice ,but im still curious to know :</p>
              <p>1. is ultimate realization really involves sensation similar to obe(out of body) experiences?</p>
              <p>2. is the ultimate knot(fundamental ignorance) can sort of 'reside'in this physical body(therefore when the knot is finally broken,the body reacts in a strong/extreme way)?   </p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Realisation does not necessarily lead to out of body experiences.</p>
              <p>I do however, have out of body experience sort of experiences while doing self-inquiry.</p>
              <p>Felt like floating out of my body into the surroundings even as I was walking, like I was a sphere of awareness floating away from my body. It was also very blissful. If I am not wrong, I was asking myself "Who is dragging this corpse along?"</p>
              <p>Thusness told me it is due to disassociation.</p>
              <p>So such experiences happen, but I don't think it is necessary for enlightenment. Enlightenment and OBE are not the same and not exactly related. However, when one's nondual insight matures, one will experience the 'Mind-Body Drop' which is a form of deconstructing 'body'. One will feel weightless and without body. I have not experienced this so cannot comment further. However, it is not the same as the sort of disassociative experience I described above.</p>
              <p>OBEs however sometimes happen when you reach what Daniel Ingram called 'the arising and passing event' (A&amp;P) in meditation (or even in dreams), it also happens during lucid dreaming, or when you experience sleep paralysis, or if you take drugs (but I don't do drugs). These are altered states of consciousness where these things do happen, from my experience.</p>

              <p>Such experiences may however be helpful as Jax Peterson says:</p>
              <p> <em>At some point, as the crown chakra fully opens don't be 
                  surprised to notice that you have floated away from your body... usually only 
                  several feet away.  Just you, a sphere of Awareness, floating in the space of 
                  your room or outside looking back at your body.  In that moment you then know 
                  your body has no real connection to you in terms of identity... it is just like 
                  a car you have been driving around for awhile.</em></p>
              <div style="clear: none;"><em> </em></div>
              <div style="clear: none;"><em>The floating out of the body experience produces a 
                  permanent sense of true non-identity.  More doubts fall away... forever.  At

              <blockquote>
              <div style="clear: none;"><br></div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Would it be possible for you to share with us here some 
                  of those clear light abbreviated methods? Or maybe in private e-mails? 
                  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to go to a retreat...<span class="ecxApple-style-span" style="font-family: 'times new roman','new york',times,serif; font-size: 16px;">
              <div style="clear: none;"><br>Jax:  Thanks 
                  Lanusse!  I would be glad to share some basic Clear Light practices that bring 
                  about a very pronounced sense of Being rapidly.  From investigating most of the 
                  lineage models as presented in the world's mystical practice traditions from 
                  various cultures around the planet since 1966, and experimenting with those 
                  methods as taught to me by masters of those traditions,  I can say that by now 
                  its become clear to at least myself, that there do exist methods and approaches 
                  that are more accurate and direct than others.  And among the most direct 
                  methods there also appears to be commonalities of result.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">To super-summerize the entire path in one expression I 
                  would say:  The fastest route and approach would be to engage in a practice that 
                  opens the crown chakra easily.  When the crown chakra opens the sphere of 
                  Awareness that has its seat in the skull, experiences total unbounded spacious 
                  Awareness automatically.  Imagine this sphere of Awareness, which is your actual 
                  cognitive presence as though enclosed within the center of a lotus flower, 
                  situated towards the top of skull, yet centered in the skull.  The petals of the 
                  lotus flower surround your consciousness which sits directly above the center of 
                  the flower's stem.  The stem is the central channel of the subtle body of 
                  Light.  When the nourishing sap rises up the stem and reaches the flower at the 
                  top, the petals begin to open revealing that which is within the flower.  In 
                  this case the sap that rises up the stem is Kundalini.  The flower petals are 
                  actually an extremely fine network of web-like energy channels that are usually 
                  contracted and dormant.  This web of energy networks adds to the sense of 
                  solidity that makes the sphere of Awareness seem as though it is a solid entity 
                  attached firmly within the skull. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">At death this cocoon-like network of energy channels 
                  disintegrates and the sphere of Awareness floats away from the physical body.  
                  For a practitioner of Clear Light methods, like Dzogchen thogal and yang-ti, 
                  they will float out of the body through the eyes.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> For various other reasons at times, the sphere of 
                  Awareness breaks loose of the confining energy webbing and floats outside of 
                  the body.  This happens at times of near-death experiences caused by heart 
                  attacks, severe illnesses and sudden impacts.  However the sphere of Awareness 
                  is still connected to the body through the central channel connected to the 
                  heart chakra.  If normal death occurs, the Awareness will enter the central 
                  channel and will drift down through the central channel to the heart center.  
                  This is experienced as though one is floating through a tunnel of light.  At the 
                  end of the central channel at the heart a very bright light is observed.  As one 
                  moves closer to the Light it appears to be a Beingness of unconditional love, 
                  bliss and total wisdom... it is your true nature shining.  The Awareness 
                  may merge with the Light, if so that would be total Self-Realization.  In Tibet 
                  that is referred to as the merging of the son and mother lights.  The son would 
                  be Rigpa and the mother would be the pure Emptiness of the Dharmakaya.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">However, there is another method to enter directly into 
                  this dimension of Light, Being and Knowing through very specific practices.  By 
                  bringing the Kundalini energy up through the central channel into the crown 
                  chakra, the chakra energy field opens and expands.  At first one notices a 
                  sensation of no longer being connected to the body yet not yet away from it.  
                  Awareness becomes fully present to its nature as a beingness that is not located 
                  in a body nor even in the universe or located in space or time.  In this moment 
                  of illumination, if one deliberately notices the head or skull it will seem 
                  transparent or completely absent.  It seems instead of you being in your body, 
                  rather your body is in you as the unchanging field of Being/Awareness.  This is 
                  the first stage.  Most can come to this and do in their first retreat.  The 
                  experience leaves one without doubts and certainty of one's actual true 
                  nature.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Now, it is not necessary to raise the Kundalini up the 
                  central channel.  Actually in the center of the crown chakra there is a huge 
                  reservoir of Kundilini always present, due to the fact that the crown chakra is 
                  the seat of Awareness.  One can utilize a not well known method to activate the 
                  Kundalini directly in the crown chakra alone.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">Here is the method:  sense a spot of energy like 
                  a luminous clear-white ball slightly below the crown of your skull, centered 
                  between the ears but slightly higher, yet centered in between.  Close your eyes 
                  and sense that the little luminous sphere is the center of your Awareness.  
                  Notice how the sphere is itself Awareness.  Be that sphere and just be.  
                  Concentrate on only that.  Notice the interior of your skull, as if it is 
                  hollow, remain with your eyes closed and sense a spacious clear light 
                  inseperable from your awareness.  If the interior of your skull seems foggy or 
                  densley dark instead of clear and empty, practice looking in a mirror at your 
                  eyes and at the clear glass of the mirror at your eyes in the reflection until 
                  your visual awareness seems crisp and transparent.  Then sit and do the practice 
                  again with your eyes closed, but noticing the crisp clearness of the interior 
                  light that offers a sensation of clear inner empty space.  You need to sense a 
                  dimension of spaciousness as luminous awareness.  Practice with this exercise 
                  until you begin to sense that the solidity of your skull is becoming transparent 
                  and your sense of being a sphere of Awareness has become pronounced.  At that 
                  moment, just rest as that Awareness.  The mind will have already vanished with 
                  all its thoughts and images... just rest in that Clear Light Awareness, that you 
                  are.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">After 20 to 30 minutes slowly open your eyes and begin 
                  to integrate the external spatial dimension of the room as you see it, into your 
                  Awareness.  Now with eyes fully open... just rest in total integration with the 
                  space of Being just as you are. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">If you don't then re-engage in conceptualizing and 
                  other mental meanderings, you will find great peace and stability in just being 
                  present effortlessly.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">To further open the crown chakra, practice with these 
                  exercises along with external sky-gazing and bringing your Awareness to your 
                  eyes, crisply and without moving your eyes, gaze straight into the space of the 
                  sky.  After 20 or 30 minutes of external sky gazing, immediately close your eyes 
                  and notice the vast inner space of your skull and the clarity of your inner 
                  spacious Awareness.  Now notice that the top of your crown appears transparent 
                  and open to the sky.  Your entire skull is becoming transparent... just rest in 
                  that luminous transparency which is the nature of your Being.  All sense of ego 
                  identity or self will vanish as those shadows are transformed into Light, the 
                  Clear Light of Awareness.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">There are many more details that I have left out, as 
                  they really are best suited to live guidence as given in the retreat setting.  
                  But this abbreviated form will definitely produce immediate results... its been 
                  well tested not only in my retreats but in my weekly practice sessions that I 
                  teach in Chicago.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">I would ask for those who want guidance and have 
                  questions, please post to the group lists, as your issues, challenges and 
                  questions will be beneficial to all of us.  If you are too shy to do so, then 
                  just email me directly. </div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">If those on these lists are serious about your practice 
                  success, then here you go!  Take advantage of my being able to mentor you 
                  through these steps of practice.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">At some point, as the crown chakra fully opens don't be 
                  surprised to notice that you have floated away from your body... usually only 
                  several feet away.  Just you, a sphere of Awareness, floating in the space of 
                  your room or outside looking back at your body.  In that moment you then know 
                  your body has no real connection to you in terms of identity... it is just like 
                  a car you have been driving around for awhile.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">The floating out of the body experience produces a 
                  permanent sense of true non-identity.  More doubts fall away... forever.  At 
                  least that's been my experience...</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">There are two more stages beyond this level of 
                  practice.  The next exercises open all the chakras and the energies of 
                  consciousness become stabilized in the central channel.  The third level opens 
                  all of the Light channels between the heart and the eyes, as well as Light 
                  channels through out the head and entire body.  Eventually, the heart chakra 
                  opens fully and completely revealing the Infinite Light of Unconditional Love 
                  and Compassion for the benefit of all beings...</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">We are actually doing part of the third level work on 
                  the first level exercises.... and that is why this approach is so powerful and 
                  rapid.  What is experienced has nothing to do with the mind and its 
                  endless</div>
              <div style="clear: none;">prattle and distraction.</div>
              <div style="clear: none;"> </div>
              <div style="clear: none;">For those interested to experiment and explore... 
                  please do!  May you never be the same!</div>

              <p>Hi Seeker,</p>
              <p>Please don't get frustrated. The path is not easy to walk.... for anyone. Those concepts of guru's being special and above others are just ego-images... The practice becomes most-ordinary with time.</p>
              <p>For me, there are also much areas where integration is required.</p>
              <p>As for the energy level difference, it is not about OBE. It is that when non-conceptuality is occuring, the mental deconstruction let go of all constrictions and one feels energised and released. The energy difference is sudden and distinct.  You know, all kinds of mental speculating, projecting, duality-split are actually very energy consuming. To hold convention reality in place, energy is unconsciously expended.. :)</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>You won't understand this now.</p>
              <p>It is of no use to intellectually grasp this.. It will only confuse further.</p>
              <p>Right now, i see that you are trying to put all this information into a conceptual framework. IMO, it is better to take the information 'lightly', but put the effort in practicing mindfulness... like now noticing and feeling the urge to put all the information into safe way of understanding.</p>
              <p>Sorry if i sound harsh. I have this habit before... it have proven to be a major stumbling block.. trying to mentally compartmentalise and intellectualise information.</p>
              <p>Later on, the more memories of information that one have, they will pop up often and pulling your attention into verifying them.</p>
              <p>At non-conceptual stage, 'nonduality' and 'emptiness' are also tools and concepts used... for there is nothing that can define 'what is'.</p>

              <p>The desire to 'know the truth as they are' is an inward pulling to just being. In the end, all thoughts itself dissolve, including the inquiry itself will dissolve, in which Sri Ramana Maharshi described eloquently:</p>
              <p><em>"The thought 'Who am I?' will destroy all other thoughts, and like the 
                  stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get 
                  destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-Realization."</em></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> " Any method must lead to "<em>direct and attentive bare
              mode of observation that allows the seeing of things as they
              are"</em> in order for insights to arise. "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>aen : very insightfully said,since clarity is vitally
              important for seeing thing as they are ;and this is why
              mindfulness cannot be dispense of .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but im still in the search for a object of focus;not in the
              intense concentrative way in which one focuses 1 thing to the
              exclusion of everytthing else(i naturally lack this kind of
              ability)</p>
              <p>since it's this sense of separate self that's the root cause of
              suffering ,instead of focussing of any
              objects/phenomena(eg.the sense field-sound,sights
               etc..)perhaps i should just keep my attention
              barely ,strongly and continuously on this (vague) sense of a
              separate entity.</p>
              <p>will this kind of practice leads to a fruitful
              results/insights? </p>
              <p>i think this is the essence of self inquiry,"just be",simply
              remain as "i am".</p>

              <p>Yes this is fine.</p>
              <p>Thusness usually will ask others (if he didn't ask them to do vipassana) to do koans like "Who am I" as a koan will lead to direct realisation of the I AM.</p>
              <p>This I AM may in the beginning be confused with individuality, but further investigation will lead to the experience of I AM as infinite, impersonal, like a universal source.</p>
              <p>But even that is not yet the realisation of non-dual or anatta.</p>

              <p>To help the nation you don't necessarily have to go into politics. But each person have their own calling.</p>
              <p>Buddhism isn't just about 'meditate in peace' since most of us have our own work.</p>
