            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</div><div class="quote_body">This is a question of how would Buddhism help people. The applications of Buddhism is very wide and can be realised within this lifetime through practising what the Buddha taught. Other religions teach about doing good, avoiding evil, and they usually teach about the possibility of being reborn in heaven, or a better place. In Buddhism we also teach there is this possibility to reborn in a better place due to karma, but in Buddhism rebirth in any better place within the 6 realms of existence is not ultimate. In Buddhism, we teach about liberation from Samsara as well, and it is not just a matter of doing good and avoiding evil, creating good karma.<br><br>You do not even need to see your past lives to experience the bliss of nirvana, to experience freedom from all vexations, all dukkha, and attain purity of mind. In Buddhism, other than doing good and avoiding evil, we emphasize a lot on purification of the mind and mind training, and eventually to attain liberation. This is something that is special in Buddhism -- the chance of liberation. We can experience the fruition of the attainment of sainthood in our lifetime. Therefore I said Buddhist practices' applications are very wide in the present. The three trainings - Morality, Concentration, Insights, each of them have benefits in our lives. If we master them, we can achieve what Buddha and other enlightened beings achieved.<br><br>Also in Buddhism it is not just a matter of 'belief', much less is 'Mi2 Xing4' (superstition). We must practise and learn from Buddha, not theoretical or academic, we must cultivate what the Buddha cultivate, practise what the Buddha practised. And see the results for ourselves.</div></blockquote>Very true...indeed.<br><br>January... even if you do not believe in past life... it is fine.<br><br>Buddhism, is in fact,  very very advanced psychology. It is so advanced that current scientist and researcher have not even scratched what Buddha has found.<br><br>If you do not believe in all the mystical stuff... Buddhism can still be seem from a very practical psychological approach.</div>

Or you have found part of Buddhism very true and comfortable to you... but is still uneasy with some of the mystical aspects. Your mind cannot reconcile the apparent discrepencies. You need confirmation.<br><br>If you really go far enough... you will discover that the so-called normal way of dealing with life is inducive of more suffering. This is because there are 'blindspots' in the way people understand themselves. Buddhism allows us to gain deep understanding into these blindspot and make changes accordingly.<br><br>In this aspect... its approach is really very advanced psychology. Instead of changing the environment at large, Buddhism deals with the problem from the<br>root... which is the way we reacte/relate to life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi January,<br><br>I re-read my post.  Though it may not sound soothing to the ears, take it positively.  I have no ill intention.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Trying to forcefully account for non-material phenomenon by hard science is analogous to casting an1-inch-knitted net into an ocean and concludes that no species in the ocean has a size smaller than 1 inch.  We have to know the limitation of hard science as we know the limitation of the net.  If one chooses to remain blind to these limitations then we have made science into a blind-faith religion.  It is the spirit of science that is laudable.  What Buddha taught is systematic and the results are clearly stated but an effort to walk the first step must be made to witness the result and that includes past lives experiences.  Have an open mind so that you will not miss something valuable. Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Much of the misconception is that you do good, begets good rewards; do bad begets bad rewards. This is often a mixture of the buddhist idea of kamma into mainstream folk-deity-beliefs. Kamma has somehow transform into another force that is judging people. Which is not true at all.<br><br>Kamma in Pali means "effect". Kamma is one of the five universal laws that the Buddha had discovered. Venerable S Dhammika had written a book sometime ago titled "All About Buddhism" which explains very clearly the idea of kamma. Now I don't have the book with me so I'll try to explain kamma as much as I can recall and understand.<br><br>The whole kamma theory (that you had named) is a process. A process of cause, <strong>condition</strong>(often people forgets about this factor) and effect.<br><br>Now say if this person is handicapped, say due to an accident. Then the cause could be either, he was not mindful of the situation he is in, and given another condition that there was a driver who is not mindful as well, and another supplementary condition is that they cross path. Now the effect will be that this person to be injured and unfortunately turned handicapped. Kamma took place in this scenario is not because anyone had done anything exactly bad, but lack of mindfulness in their action. Now if the former person and the driver would have been more careful and mindful, the cause has changed, even the condition remains, that the two would meet each other, but perhaps the car stops at red light and this person happily crossing the road, no one is injured.<br><br>This is kamma.<br><br>If my parents have cancer, then probably due to the lifestyle they have led for decades that gives cancer a chance to develop. Take my father for example, he started smoking since the age of 11 but he had quitted smoking when he turned 56 due to an operation. Though he had stayed clean from smoking for near 4 years now, I won't be surprise if (touch wood! touch wood!) he would be caught down by lung cancer. 45 years of hardcore smoking and we can imagine how much damage had he done to his own lungs. Now smoking becomes the cause and the body is the condition. And due to biological law (one of the five universal laws) if the body reacts in a negative way then cancer develops which is the effect.<br><br>Yet another example of kamma.<br><br>Now if my friend is in trouble, and if I <span style="font-style: italic;">really</span> do treat him/her as a friend, then I should try to help to the best of my abilities. This is what friends are for! Even in the Pali Canon, I can't remember the title but I think there is a short discourse that was said by the Buddha in regards to friendship. How should a friend try to influence his friends in a positive manner. And supporting one another.<br><br>The Buddha, motivated by the compassion He had for the world, that He generously spread the Dhamma to people who are fortunate enough to hear from Him (cause). And a large group of this people who became the Buddha's disciples made efforts by been diligence, hardworking, and do a lot of propogation work (condition) which eventually even people living in this time, though may not hear from the Buddha personally, are able to receive the same Dhamma as well (effect). Given the compassionate feature in Buddhism, all the more we should encourage and applaud UNICEF for its good effort in helping poor countries.<br><br>No offence but I think your understanding of the kamma theory IS rubbish.<br><br>Literally kamma takes place in anything we do. We make a small and harmful lie here and there to boast our own ego now and then. Well it may seems relatively harmless, but it slowly and gradually conditions your mind in "getting used of lying". Which may eventually lead you to big problem. Now this is what the Buddha caution us about, not to allow us in getting used in these bad habits. Now if a person is habitually short tempered, probably this creates an impression in the 8th conscious and in our future rebirths, we may have the <span style="font-style: italic;">tendency</span>(note:it's not determined) of becoming a short tempered person again.<br><br>So my understanding of Buddha's teaching about past lives, is one of the explaination on some of our very hard-to-kick habits (be it good or bad ones). Or probably these habits are due to our upbringing from our parents or some incidents that happened between us and our friends which made great impact.<br><br>Whichever the case is, the Buddha in His 45 years of ministry was more interested in improving our quality of living by upgrading our spirituality. Kamma definitely is not a determining factor but rather a conditioning factor, changes can take place and these changes, as what the Buddha had taught, should be for the better.<br><br>Sad to say, as Buddhism spread to many regions and mixed with various culture, some may seems to have been "degraded" to mere superstitious. But I am interested in what Buddha had taught and not non-buddhistic practices, I won't want to waste my energy and time on those things.<br><br>I think you should too. If you genuinely cannot accept kamma and past lives, then move on, Dhamma is a practical thing and I believe given your high intelligence you can certainly find something that is really useful and beneficial to you.</div>
