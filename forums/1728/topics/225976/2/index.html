It is possible that shamanic practices got mixed in. Also, there are 2 main religions in Tibet that has monkhood... Buddhism and Bon.<br><br>Tradition and culture will alway infiltrate themselve into any original traditions.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by january:<br><br>we could tell that past lives theroies are crap because it is obvious from us people.......</blockquote>Long ago, people say the world is flat because it is obvious that the world has to be flat because we don't see it as round. Or it is obvious that the planet earth has to be at the center of the solar system etc.<br><br>The Church didn't want to look into Galileo's telescope to see for themselves, they think it is too obvious that Galileo is talking bullshit.<br><br>All these are <strong>dogmatism</strong>. When there is proof, and a scientific method to actually proof it yourself, if you insist on holding on your old view that is just being dogmatic. No difference than any other blind beliefs in any gods or God.<br><br><blockquote>who say that no life can exist in pacific ocean deep end..... scientist only say that it is unlikely.... yes i agree scientist do make mistakes in their beliefs system....<br><br>science is always about theories under certain assumptions and as new knowledge is form, certain assumptions and theories has to be modified...<br><br>religious people therefore tend to use this aspect of science and therefore say that past lives, god and all their strange strange beliefs may be true....</blockquote>The point is that in Buddhism you find out for yourself and do not just blindly stick to beliefs and not do anything, wait to be saved etc. We do not believe in creator God.. we believe that things like liberation, nirvana, is very achievable by everyone in this life.<br><br><blockquote>there are alot of old wife tales in the past.... saying you cannot do this on certain days and you cannot do that  blar blar blar.....<br><br>but do you follow them... because there are no true and following them is a waste of time... if we follow what you say...<br><br>then we have to spend lots of money on UFOs findings.... we have to spend more money on christian practices , other religion practises, on astrology reading, on tarot practices , on past lives theories.</blockquote>Unfortunately for Buddhist practitioners who have done the practise and seen for themselves the results, Buddhism is definitely not waste of time and it can help people so much.<br><br><blockquote>there are so many many religious types of practices in the world ... all claiming they have evidence for their beliefs... so do you want the whole world to spend the money on researching all these funny funny theories....<br><br>all these funny funny theories has the same amount of theories and stories and evidence as compared to the past lives theories and mediation that leads to nirvana.......</blockquote>Except that in Buddhism we have experiential evidence. Most other religions are stuck on beliefs. With exception of contemplative traditions which indeed has lots of similarities with Buddhism (i.e Taoists, Christian, Judaist mystics, Islam Sufism, Hindu Advaita, or even certain New Age circles etc). These are the ones that really want to find out for themselves, not just believe, but truly experience what is taught.<br><br><blockquote>science and knowledge building has to be selective and choose the area of knowledge that it wants to invest in.......<br>things like medicine, genetic studies, disease control, logistic control, monetry movement, crime control, junvenile deliquent, engineering problem, are problems that are real and indeed we could overcome and come up with new knowledge and benefits to ourselves....</blockquote>In Buddhism the 4 noble truths already stated so clearly what are the problems, and the solution to the problems. These problems are very real and Buddha provided a way to overcome them. So of course anyone, everyone can benefit from it.<br><br><blockquote>things like past lives, god and cultural practices will still be carried out by believers because when people have free time, they tend to spend some time to carry out their hobbies.......<br><br>we have to educate these people to stop these hobbies which they think is useful and ask them to do better and more productive things</blockquote>Buddhism don't worship gods nor is cultural practices emphasized.<br><br>Past lives is not the important thing in Buddhism, and indeed it does not have much application. Although this does not mean it is false - that is why I have been suggesting there is both scientific evidence, and countless others who did remember their past lives. So all I am saying is that it is possible to find out for ourselves that past lives and afterlife is true. And even if you do not want to remember past lives, the ability to recall will naturally come when your Buddhist practise reaches certain level.<br><br>I suggest you find out more about Buddhism first to know how does Buddhism relate to our lives and how it can help people.</div>
