At a higher, we can even end rebirth and enter into the highest bliss (not mundane joy or pleasures) of Nirvana. The bliss is not just a good feeling, it is quite indescribable since Nirvana is beyond time and space.<br><br><blockquote>if you look at science and nature of knowledge.... it is something that is built upon time over time... theories lead to application leading to more discoveries, more theories, more application and lead to the civilisation of human race....<br><br>vehicles today have round wheels is something that the past has discovered like many centuries ago.... all these knwoledges are useful and past down, modifed , improved and lead to more and more application....<br><br>computer knowledge integrates with vehicle and leads to smart cars....<br><br>this is how science and knowledge does.. they lead to more and more useful things and through intergration of different knowledge, new things are being built.....</blockquote>With regards to the truth leading to perfect liberation, Buddha already has it. It cannot be improved because the realm beyond time and space and form cannot be improved.<br><br><blockquote>cannot you see that a building of a ship requires the cooperation of different knowledges in different people......<br><br>therefore, you people who believe can talk all you want about seeing vivdly your past life.. so therefore there is indeed past and future life....<br><br>but the question is.. so what are you going to do about it..... is there any real benefits and applications you have come up with... does it lead to more knowledges....</blockquote>Not very important except it can strengthen your will to be liberated, so you will practise harder. Longchen said:<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by longchen:</blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">Yes, you are right,  the reincarnation/rebirth cycle is really full of suffering and unsatisfactoriness. It is clearly more so... if one have seen across lifetimes.<br><br>Every single one of us is looking for happiness... it is 'embedded' within Universal Mind.  It is just that the way most of us are doing it is not very effective. We think that we can get what we want in the rebirths.</div></blockquote>------<br><br>[quote]all i can see of religions, god and past lives theories is that it always come up wtih some pseudo reasonings, plus many evidence from some people experiences, and may kinds of stories and finally string them all up with a kind of reasoning which in the end therefore is an unbreakable truth to believers......If something can be totally disproved then we might have to accept it.<br><br>However, so far, and I don't think it can be, rebirth has never been disproved.<br><br>But so far, countless have realised this to be true.<br><br><blockquote>this is the reality that there are many believers of god, past lives so i keep thinking how i can help you people to "see the light" and walk out of your shadow of ignorance....<br><br>first there are two groups of people. their older generation in the 40-50 and above they have little education and it is extremely difficult to talk to them about proper reasoning.<br><br>the younger generation are only a little better than the older generation.. and the lack of studying useful subjects and the spending of most of the time playing and enjoying our lives has made the younger generation not very knowledgeabel about truth...</blockquote>I agree with you that logic is higher than mythic. I will elaborate on that. (Oh by the way are you the one who replied me in the Atheist Unite thread whereby I pasted Ken Wilber's article?)<br><br><blockquote>they are more knowledgeable about things like PS3, Pornograph, how to be a good basketballer, how to get a girlfriend......and where to find good food....watch nice television shows....<br><br>i feel like i am gandalf. i need to find back my white stick which will act as a beacon of light to guide people out of the darkness...... and become smarter people with more correct beliefs... only then..... the world will improve faster if its human inhabitants are smarter people</blockquote>Yes again logic, intelligence, knowledge, is more valuable than all those.<br><br>But there is something even higher. I will elaborate on that.</div>

The trinity of active  mainstream atheists (Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett) are at it again evangelizing the gospel of the God-less society.<br><br>For the most part, I agree with them. Belief in God is not required and it's the cause of so much suffering around the world via religious extremisms. However, their approach is too fundamentalistic for my taste. While I personally don't limit the idea of God to its Christian or Muslim or Jewish concept, I also don't think that logic and rationalism alone could ever take the place of faith and religion. It's like saying that integral calculus can be taught to students without them learning basic algebra.<br><br>The biggest flaw of the New Atheists is that, their ideas, no matter how rational, <a href="http://stuartdavis.com/node/1127" rel="nofollow">are FLAT</a>. They are too focused attacking the the idea of God without defining <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/153/story_15318_1.html" rel="nofollow">which level of God</a> they're attacking. I say that they're pretty much attacking the <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/153/story_15318_1.html" rel="nofollow">mythic God</a>. However, they're making a lot of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performative_contradiction" rel="nofollow">performative contradictions</a> and thus elevate their own level of God in the process: the <a href="http://www.beliefnet.com/story/153/story_15318_1.html" rel="nofollow">mental God</a> (read: logic, rational).<br><br>But if there's one good thing that the New Atheists are doing, it's that they're elevating the psychological development of people who are ready to step out of mythic belief in God. I just hope that these people don't get stuck in rational level because there are other higher levels of God that can only be understood and appreciated once we take a skinny dip into the trans-rational.<br><br>Kudos to the <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.11/atheism.html" rel="nofollow">WIRED article</a> for not buying into the atheistic Kool Aid <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"The New Atheists have castigated fundamentalism and branded even the mildest religious liberals as enablers of a vengeful mob. Everybody who does not join them is an ally of the Taliban. But, so far, their provocation has failed to take hold. Given all the religious trauma in the world, I take this as good news. Even those of us who sympathize intellectually have good reasons to wish that the New Atheists continue to seem absurd. If we reject their polemics, if we continue to have respectful conversations even about things we find ridiculous, this doesn't necessarily mean we've lost our convictions or our sanity. It simply reflects our deepest, democratic values. Or, you might say, our bedrock faith: the faith that no matter how confident we are in our beliefs, there's always a chance we could turn out to be wrong."</span><br><br>(Note: For more details on levels of God and a more-embracing spirituality, check out the book <a href="http://isc.integralinstitute.org/public/about/ISCNewStayInformed.aspx" rel="nofollow">Integral Spirituality</a>, and the <a href="http://isc.integralinstitute.org/Public/static/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">ISC portal</a>).[/b][/quote]<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by An Eternal Now:<br><strong><br><br>You should really read Ken Wilber's book, for a start on theoretical knowledge, A Brief History of Everything is a must-read for Ken Wilber's titles.

I myself have experienced one level of transrational experience, and my other friends in the forum has experienced more or all of the transrational experiences <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Altogether there are 10 stages of human consciousness, mythic and rational/logic are lower than the transrational.<br><br>Unfortunately I don't have the book with me otherwise I can quote from the book.. really a good read.</strong></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Originally posted by An Eternal Now:</strong></div><div class="quote_body"><strong>His philosophy is quite wide naturally since it is an integral viewpoint.

So there is no doubt and confusion over what is prerational and transrational for one with the sort of experiences.
