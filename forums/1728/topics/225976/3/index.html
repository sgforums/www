How would you rationalise that?<br><br>What about other animals like clams, sea urchins and the like? I mean these are living even without the 5 senses. So what inhabits them, if they have no souls?</div></blockquote>Animals have little opportunity to do good things - they are busy looking after themselves and finding food - the human realm is the best to cultivate blessings. The animals will have to be reborn as an animal until their karma is exhausted. One day they may be able to be reborn as a human again.<br><br>Also another thing is even if we are human in this life, it does not mean we did not do any evil deeds before. The karmic seeds in our storehouse consciousness, our karma, is really immeasurable. Throughout aeons we have committed all sorts of things, just that due to certain conditions, the good ones ripen first and in our life we become human, or even have a luxurious life. It does not mean he will not die of cancer, and next life may not live in lower realms. So if we have the opportunity as a human to practise dharma, we should seize it and end the path to lower realms, and ultimately, free ourselves from the cycle of rebirth.<br><br>Without 5 senses, there is still 6th sense consciousness - mind consciousness. The yogacarin doctrine adds 7th and 8th consciousness, self-conscious and the storehouse consciousness, which is something that needs to be explained. In short 7th consciousness is consciousness of self, which is an illusion, and 8th consciousness is the storehouse consciousness where all our karmic seeds and memories are planted. Everything we do we will plant a seed in our storehouse consciousness and when conditions are there, the seed ripens into effect. When we sleep, we have all sorts of dreams, sometimes good dreams, sometimes nightmares. It is due to 7th consciousness searching the 8th consciousness for the 'videotapes'. At the time of death, the 8th consciousness karmic seeds manifest and propels us to different realms. If the 7th consciousness (self consciousness, duality consciousness) is dissolved, and one merges with our primordial clear light nature, then rebirth may not take place.<br><br>In Buddhism we don't say 'soul inhabit', but rather, they have 6th, 7th, 8th consciousness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all,<br><br>Everything in the Universe is compounded or made up of parts, which are in turn made up of parts, which are in turn made up of smaller and smaller parts. Each of these parts changes constantly - sometimes grossly but mostly subtly (to our senses). There is no single fixed component of anything that is not subject to change. A thing exists only when the parts that constitute it come together. Thus, there is no fixed unchanging self within anything - this is called impersonality. It also means that everything is interconnected and interdependent upon each other. Nothing exists on its own as a separate self.<br><br>If a real or permanent self exists, one should be able to identify it. However, one's body changes unceasingly from second to second from birth to death. The Mind changes even much more rapidly. Thus, we cannot say the body, Mind or any particular combination of the two is one's self. Neither can an independent self exist as both the body and Mind depend on many factors to exist. As the so-called self is just a collection of conditioned and changing physical and mental factors, there is no real or concrete element of self in us.<br><br><strong>Today science has tell us that nothing is created nor destroyed they just changing from one form to another form.</strong><br><br>Take for example a candle flame.The candle is like a body hosting the flame(mind/consciousness))When the candle is fully consumed the flame will gone.So is this to say that the flame is dead ? Gone forever?Well.. as science has tell us that nothing is created nor destroyed they just changing from one form to another form.the flame is not destroyed is just that the elements that make up the flame disintegrate and these molecules will continue in the process of changing form.When encountering a similar condition the flame will be formed again.<br><br>Just like oxygen to carbon dioxide and so on and so fornth<br>just like kinetic energry to potential energry and so on and so fornth(they don't disappear or die off but constantly changing from one form to another form<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">Our mind/consciousness which are formless elements are neither created nor destroyed </span><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi January,<br><br>Just to share what I felt from reading this thread.<br><br>Firstly, I think you seems to have something against the belief in past lives. Buddha through His experience and insight, sees that life is a continuum. Life neither start out-of-nowhere nor ends abruptly. Nibbana should be the primary objective of a buddhist, but of course, knowing that Nibbana is not easy to attain, as buddhists, we gradually train and cultivate ourselves, to condition us to achieve this Supreme Bliss. It may take one, two, or even many lifetimes ahead of us to achieve that.<br><br>But a journey of a thousand miles begins from your first step (I think it's a nice quote from Lao Tze). So to prepare us for that, Buddha, during His 45 years of propagation had explicitly taught His Teachings. And Buddha's Teachings are very practical, because rather than praying and seeking for external divinity, we seek inwards to the purification of the mind. For our actions and speech originate from our thoughts.<br><br>Now you may ask again so how is past lives practical? Well, to the best of my knowledge, Buddha never instruct anyone to be immerse and dwell into their past lives. When Buddha mentioned past lives, usually His own or some others, His objective was to teach the audience the Dhamma. Buddha was a very skillful Teacher. He often used analogies that best suit to His audience.<br><br>Buddha taught issues like how to handle one's anger, one's craving and so on. I find that these are very practical issues, in fact, many leading counselling and psychology fields did look into the buddhist scriptures in support of their role in mental modelling.<br><br>For Buddha had said that the Past is gone and Future yet to come only the Present is what that matters. Buddha often emphasized that we should 'live in the present moment'.<br><br>So my feeling is that you have somehow misunderstood from some of the, perhaps, misinformed buddhists, that made you have such strong case against past lives.<br><br>There may have meditators who claimed to see their past lives, which could be true. That simply shows that they have achieve a very profound focus of the mind that they could recollect their past lives. But recollecting one's past lives is not a meditator's objective. I think you could have misunderstood on this part.<br><br>January, it's good to know that you do have your own beliefs, in fact that is what Buddha encourages. We should always think more, and not afraid to query further. And I applaude your effort in trying to educate people on this. I just did a check on Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion#Present_day_adherents" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion#Present_day_adherents</a><br><br>It seems like Buddhim's population ranks only 6 in the world. To be effectively spread your ideaologies, perhaps you can consider share your ideas with the former five. I believe if they do convert to your school of thoughts, the quantity would have been much of an aid in your noble thoughts in educate the world and to cultivate smarter people.<br><br>Meanwhile, it will be greatly appreciated that you would respect the beliefs of the people, mainly buddhists, in this forum, just as much as we would respect your misinformed and misguided understanding in the Dhamma.</div>

The applications of Buddhism is very wide and can be realised within this lifetime through practising what the Buddha taught. Other religions teach about doing good, avoiding evil, and they usually teach about the possibility of being reborn in heaven, or a better place. In Buddhism we also teach there is this possibility to reborn in a better place due to karma, but in Buddhism rebirth in any better place within the 6 realms of existence is not ultimate. In Buddhism, we teach about liberation from Samsara as well, and it is not just a matter of doing good and avoiding evil, creating good karma.<br><br>You do not even need to see your past lives to experience the bliss of nirvana, to experience freedom from all vexations, all dukkha, and attain purity of mind. In Buddhism, other than doing good and avoiding evil, we emphasize a lot on purification of the mind and mind training, and eventually to attain liberation. This is something that is special in Buddhism -- the chance of liberation. We can experience the fruition of the attainment of sainthood in our lifetime. Therefore I said Buddhist practices' applications are very wide in the present. The three trainings - Morality, Concentration, Insights, each of them have benefits in our lives. If we master them, we can achieve what Buddha and other enlightened beings achieved.<br><br>Also in Buddhism it is not just a matter of 'belief', much less is 'Mi2 Xing4' (superstition). It is not just blindly believe in what Buddha said, although we have confidence in the three treasures and the dharma teachings that would lead us to liberation, we also practise and eventually to see the truths ourselves. We must practise and learn from Buddha, not theoretical or academic, we must cultivate what the Buddha cultivate, practise what the Buddha practised. And see the results for ourselves.</div>
