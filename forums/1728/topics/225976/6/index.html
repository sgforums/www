In my previous job I was the favourite whipping boy for everything that goes wrong in the company... Things become so unbearable that I have to quit that job and sat at home for 6 months before I got my current job.<br><br>I have heard this from an old Chinese venerable in a Dharma CD: Everytime you are wronged and that you have been taken advantage of, you are extinguishing some of your bad karma, and if you are remain kind, compassionate and stoic in the face of all these adversity, you even get to build good karma! My own personal experience is that if you are confronted by hostile people with ill intentions, you can diffuse the hostile feelings from these people if you stay true to your compassion and not show any reciprocal hostility to these people... If someone talks to you in an angry and confrontational tone, you won't help the exchange by raising your voices and going into a voice duel with him. Instead, its better to keep quiet. Later when that person has cooled down, then you can explain your situation to him in a calm manner..... Easier said than done I know, but worth trying.<br><br>I wish you all the best in your career and family. May you be happy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a word of advise to all dharmas bro n sisters , if you don't feel like helping then don't help . Don't go and tok to pple behaving like you are forced to help n making groundless accusations to pple just based on first impression or 1 time meeting then stereotyping pple as " that particular kind of pple " or telling them " you must be like this and like , thats why pple will treat you this way . Please if you don't know or don't understand what the other party is actually going through don't make sweeping statements . You are actually none the wiser . Can a person actually describe the difference between the sweetness of a apple and the sweetness of a mango without the other party actually tasting it him/herself ? Don't assume just because a person like to wear bermudas to go out then it means he will also wear the same attire to go to work n interviews , use your brain more . If that is the case then can i say just because i see a ger wear bikini to the beach mean she also wear bikini to her workplace and interview ?

I honestly contemplate why this is so and slowly changed myself. It is me who emitted bad vibes or am i being too sensitive etc that caused the problems in the first place?<br><br>if you look at ur situation in a different perspective.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just for your info , the footwear i am wearing is a sandal not a flip flop . I don't know how you differentiate footwear . But i have a feeling you are placing unneccessary emphasis on minor things . Since you emphasize so much on pples clothings , impression and etc i got nothing else to say except to say you are just another pple whom judge pple based on their image and nothing else which i find very shallow . In which you also belong to the type of pple whom like to stereotype and make pples life difficult just because their images do not suit your reqirements . The Buddha encourage pple to have doubts , to find out the truth for themself instead of believing blindly what other pple say . If you think that a buddhist must believe whatever another buddhist said , then i afraid that is also why there are so many pple who follow cult blindly and also that is also how the terrorist manage to brainwash pples minds , by making them believe strongly yet blindly that what they are doing is " right " . There are many pple whom convert to other religion just because their parents fails to teach them properly abt their own religion but just order them to follow what they do . If you prefer to have pple to follow blindly what buddhism preaches then i'm afraid you're just another person whom only do things blindly by the book and not practicing right understanding . I am a very curiouse person whom will not follow a person blindly even if that person is a rinpoche . I do not believe that just because a person has a very " good " reputation or has attained high social satatus he will automatically be the best . To me , he is just another human being which may also make mistakes . Before the NKF scandal is made public and official , everyone strongly believe that durai is a gd man . But time proves otherwise , maybe you may accuse me of being disrespect to rinpoache but i am just saying what i think . If you were to take offence i also got nothing to say .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh by the way if you really were to hate pple to wear flip flop or sandals to meet you , then please highlight to pple that you do not like to walk with pple wearing flip flop AND sandals . So that if pple were to really wear flip flop or sandals going to meet you , they will remove their foot wear and walk barefooted instead so as to show a mark of respect to you . Perhaps i may have tossed the image of the buddha but since you bother to remember every action of me to use against me untill now , i can understand that you are really very particular of what pple do to buddhist things . But if you do not like pple to do that particular actions , you should have told him or me not to do that  on the spot instead of remembering what pple did wrong and remember it untill now to make noise abt it . That shows that you are very petty and bear grudges against what you don't like .</div>
