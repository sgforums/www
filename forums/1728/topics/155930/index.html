It is only through this that one can develope great compassion, and is generally better for health.<br><br>If you want to learn from Guan Yin and have great compasion, then you should learn to be a full time vegetarian. If not, at least eat from '5 Clean Sources of Meat'.<br><br>As for relation of Guan Yin and cows.... The story about Guan Yin and cow is a myth.<br><br>Another note for 5 clean sources of meat - ordering live seafood or in fact any live animals (ye3 wei4 also) is violating the third rule:<br>(3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake</div>
