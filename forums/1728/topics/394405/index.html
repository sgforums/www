              <p>Buddha on Curing Hemorrhoids Sutra<br>Based on the Chinese translation by<br>Tripitaka Master Yi Jing of Tang Dynasty<br>English translation by Yutang Lin</p>
              <p>Thus I heard: At one time Bhagavan and five hundred great monks were in the bamboo grove garden of the great city of Rajagrha. Then many monks' bodies were inflicted with hemorrhoids; their physical bodies were thin and weak and entangled in lingering pain and suffering, and they were extremely worried and annoyed day and night. Then Meritorious Ananda, having witnessed this matter, went to where the World Honored One was. He prostrated and touched Buddha's soles with the top of his head in respect, and then stood on one side. He said to the World Honored One, "Now in the city of Rajagrha there are many monks whose bodies are inflicted with hemorrhoids. Their physical bodies are thin and weak and entangled in lingering pain and suffering, and they are extremely worried and annoyed day and night. World Honored One, how to cure all these hemorrhoid diseases?" Buddha told Ananda, "You may listen to this Curing Hemorrhoids Sutra, and then maintain its repetition so that it is well memorized in mind that you would not forget it. In addition, you should widely proclaim and explain it to others. Thus all these hemorrhoid diseases would be eradicated, such as wind hemorrhoids, heat hemorrhoids, depression hemorrhoids, trinity hemorrhoids, blood hemorrhoids, abdominal hemorrhoids, nasal hemorrhoids, dental hemorrhoids, tongue hemorrhoids, eye hemorrhoids, ear hemorrhoids, head hemorrhoids, limb hemorrhoids, back hemorrhoids, anus hemorrhoids, and hemorrhoids that grow on joints all over the body, all such hemorrhoid tumors would dry up, fall off, perish, and undoubtedly be cured. To attain such cure all should maintain repetition of the following miraculous mantra," and Buddha uttered the mantra (rendered in Pin Yin): Da Zhi Ta, E Lan Di, E Lan Mi, Shi Li Pi, Shi Li Shi Li, Mo Jie Shi Zhi, San Po Ba Du, Sha He.</p>
              <p><br>"Ananda, To the North from here there is a great snow mountain king, and in it there is a great Sala tree named 'Difficult to Overcome.' It has three types of flowers: those that are budding, those in full bloom, and those withered. Just as those flowers fell as they withered, the hemorrhoids inflicting my monks would fall like that, no more bleeding and no more pus, forever free from pain and suffering, and all completely dried up. Furthermore, one who repeats this Sutra often would attain the wisdom to know one's past lives and remember events of the latest seven lives, and perfectly accomplish the mantra practice." Buddha again uttered the following mantra: <br>Da Zhi Ta Zhan Mi, Zhan Mi She Zhan Mi, She Mo Ni She Zhan Ni, Sha He.</p>
              <p><br>As Buddha finished proclamation of this Sutra, Meritorious Ananda and all in the assembly greatly rejoiced, faithfully received the teaching and carried on as they were taught.</p>
