            <div class='col-md body'>Sri Sri Ravi Shankar is a teacher of the Aryuvedic tradition, which focuses on the Indian medicinal wisdom (rather than spiritualistic). Therefore although their practises are no doubt good for health, just like many yoga practises, it's focus is quite different from meditations in Buddhism.<br><br>But I checked his site, it seems that he is well versed in Bhagavad Gita, one of the main doctrines of Hinduism. He also attempts speak in terms of other spiritual paths. Indeed, spirituality is universal and the ancient wisdom of Buddha, Jesus, is beyond names and beliefs. But still there are differences and each path leads to different goals/aims.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>Buddha's way is best if you want to combat stress</strong><br>By Stefanie Marsh, The Times, April 8, 2004<br><br>London, UK -- IN CASE more than 20 centuries of grueling spiritual journeys towards harmony and balance have not persuaded you, scientists have now proved that Buddhist meditation relieves stress.<br><br>Researchers at Wisconsin University monitored the brain activity of 25 randomly chosen individuals and concluded that Buddhist meditation causes a significant reduction in anxiety and correspondingly increased levels of positive emotions.<br><br>Members of the group, who meditated for 14 hours over an eight-week period, exhibited a dramatic increase in levels of activity in the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain that is most commonly associated with well-being and happiness.<br><br>The only problem now is to resolve which form of meditation is the most successful in combating what has been labelled BritainÂ’s Â“stress epidemicÂ”. Nine out of ten workers claim to suffer from stress and almost a million people claim incapacity benefit for mental strain.<br><br>While transcendental meditation has been shown to lower blood pressure, Â“mindfulness trainingÂ” is reported to decrease symptoms in those with confirmed psychiatric diagnoses.<br><br><strong>According to the Tibetan spiritual teacher, the Venerable Lama Yeshe Losal Rinpoche, it is specifically Buddhist meditation that yields the most positive results. Other forms of meditation, such as the form practised in yoga where yogis attempt simply to clear their minds, were less effective.<br><br>Â“Buddhist meditation is different from other forms of meditation because it attempts to rid the mind of what we call the five poisons Â— desire, attachment to material things, pride, jealousy and anger,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“Other forms of meditation say that in time you will find inner peace but do not treat the root cause of unhappiness, and the same can be said for various other forms of so-called stress-busting. Even karate or swimming require the mind to be active, so there is no fundamental change occurring.Â”</strong><br><br>The Venerable Lama, who has a large following in Britain, including bankers, lawyers and government officials, accused the British of being too negative.<br><br>Â“Physically a lot of people have become incapable of enjoying their lives because they do nothing but sit in front of the television,Â” he said.<br><br>Â“They have become so focused on their professions, which often require very boring repetitive skills, that they lose motivation for everything. A lot of people in Britain are very negative and are very happy to judge other people and also themselves. They have become paralysed and donÂ’t know how to be positive.<br><br>Â“In Buddhism you learn to use meditation as a target. You need to find out your poison and transform that into a positive.Â”<br><br>The Venerable Lama came to Britain in the 1960s and is now the abbot of Kagyu Samye Ling monastery in Scotland. He is a meditation master and specialises in bringing meditation into everyday life.<br><br>Buddhist Lamas, or teachers, recommend 15 minutes of meditation every day, preferably in the mornings. In the Â“seven-point postureÂ”, for example, which can be held either cross-legged on the floor or sitting in a chair, the focus moves from the seat to the eyes, spine, shoulders, back of the neck, mouth and tongue.<br><br>Â“Sit down and prioritise what it is you want from your life and try to target the weakest point in your life.Â”<br><br>Tibetan Buddhism dates back to AD173, when Buddhist scriptures arrived in southern Tibet from India during the reign of Thothori Nyantsen, the 28th king of Tibet.<br><br>There are 152,000 Buddhists in Britain. The elimination of hatred, greed and ignorance are core to the Buddhist faith.<br><br>Lama Zangmo is the first western female Lama in Britain. She is also the spiritual director of the Tibetan Buddhist Centre in London.<br><br>She said: Â“Meditation is about the present moment and learning to live our lives to the full in the present moment.<br><br>Â“WhatÂ’s special about Buddhism is that it enables you to bring something with you into your everyday life. ItÂ’s very different from becoming calm through yoga or acupuncture.Â”<br><br>HEALING BY CONCENTRATION<br><br><strong>Chanting</strong><br><br>Anathema to many until recently, chanting, especially in yoga classes, has a new following among those keen to Â“let it all outÂ”.<br><br>It is believed that the sounds caused by chanting have a healing effect on the nervous system. The two main types are Gregorian and overtone. The word Â“OmÂ” is rarely heard in class: it is a recluse mantra for those who wish to renounce the world.<br><br><strong>Transcendental meditation</strong><br><br>The most controversial form is still in relative infancy after being introduced to the world by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1959. But more than four million people, including the Beatles, Clint Eastwood and the film director David Lynch, enthusiastically took it up in their search for Nirvana.<br><br>TM involves the repetition of a Sanksrit mantra, a short word or phrase which is said to have a soothing effect and to allow a deeper level of consciousness while remaining fully alert. Harmful effects include physical tics and emotional volatility.<br><br><strong>Mindfulness meditation</strong><br><br>Mindfulness, vipassana or insight meditation, requires practitioners to focus on the details. A person attempting vipassana should try to be aware of thoughts, sounds, smells and sensations as they happen.<br><br>Someone practising mindful meditation will sit quietly and try to Â“witnessÂ” whatever goes through the mind, not reacting or becoming involved with thoughts, memories, worries, or images. A focus on the breath and patience are often key components in this form of meditation.<br><br><strong>Yogic gaze</strong><br><br>Practitioners often choose to focus their Â“gazeÂ” on a candle, although any other relatively stationary object can be used.<br><br>The candle, which is placed at armÂ’s length and at eye level, is gazed at for several minutes. The eyes are then closed and the practitioner attempts instead to focus on the image of the candle inside the head.</blockquote>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the replies and referrences. great insight!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>i usually meditate on the qualities of shakyamuni buddha on his compassion, liberations and universal love and unity in oneness. sometimes i meditate by reciting the mantras of bodhisattvas' with my mind and heart a thousand times by mental calculation and it increased improved my mindfulness focus and concentration better, and i sometimes do practice insight meditation to seek and realise things as they do really are like that (and the answers are really actually all up in there). believe me its amazing to experience how true this universal oneness is when u feel yr fingers lose its senses touches when meet together and for the moment u just forgot yr fingers were connected n it was like all combines in one single stream feeling the energies travelling from one hand to other hand so naturally without a break or leak. yes i practice the buddhist meditation 9 out of 10 times, but i am also being more open to explore to find deeper clue to the path of the true realisations with the ultimate aim to achieve enlightenment on the other end. but i am also not clinging on to this DESIRE to achieve enlightenment or deeper insight cos i simply doing what i need and ought to do naturally.<br><br>each individual has his/her own path, the progress that leads to finally arriving in the source depends on his/her own creative abilities to seek the path in cultivating unfolding layers and layers of wisdom and spirituality with the guidance of your true mind as the awakened one pointed out.<br><br>i'm not a person who would like to be flashy and showing off who my great and how great my master is but i simply respect every individual gifted talents and sharing of showing the different ways. just as the awakened one pointed out to us and we need to explore and investigate to receive the true realisations authentically.<br><br>i'm not familiar in any hinduism yoga or meditation technique and i do agree buddha's middle way is the ultimate best way (though i don't wish to emphasize on the word best cos i don't wish to harbour conceit in my practice and i have run out of vocab to describe my thoughts also)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>seek and you will find even during waking moments u can even realise something. be flexible and open and with no prejudice and lower one's pride to absorb the knowledge with kindness and peacefulness. it might have taken me many lifetimes to be this far in my thoughts without any master. yes it aint easy to find a good teacher but i know when the time comes i will meet my teacher. these are my sharings and experiences.<br><br>thanks for your sharing too.<br><br>metta<br></div>
