              <p>The Tibetans are very diligent in their practices with many accomplishing hundreds of millions of mantras, prostrations and/or prayers. </p>
              <p>Just an observation, it seems that many of them reached accomplishment, namely, freedom over life and death, they know time of death and have total ease in dying, some can even choose to go off anytime. Which is saying alot about their lack of attachments. </p>
              <p>Many of them accomplished through simple ways like reciting mantras, prayers or prostrations.  Anyway, it is not 100% certain that one need to always go through meditation.  One of the recent rainbow body case, Khenpo Ah Chuk, he practised the mani mantra 400 million times or so. I have been told by a master of several other rainbow body cases of people who practised mantra diligently (this is not long time ago).  In those cases, they were uneducated, did not know how to meditate, but through one-pointedly practising, they accomplished astonishing deep levels of understanding. Through the experiences of many people, some around me, faith, perseverance and single-minded practice can definitely produce results.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i'm just sharing this with anyone who is interested.</p>

              <p>If they have a great master to impart them the View, just following that master's instruction one will certainly gain liberation given that he also practices sincerely. If lets say, a practitioner is transmitted Dzogchen instructions, he can actually practice at any moment of his life, whether he is chanting, prostrating, or even walking or doing his dishes. There were even well known 'sleeping yogis' who pretended to be beggers sleeping off the streets, but is actually very advanced and enlightened meditators.</p>
              <p>Whatever practice one does, there must be direct realisation of the nature of mind which can be pointed out by an experienced teacher. The recognition of the nature of mind is not dependent on which state or circumstances we are in, whatever we do, whether meditating, chanting, or just daily activities, we can sustain the recognition of our true nature since our true nature is ever-present and 'always available', as the basis of all knowing and activities. Without insight into our true nature, chanting, visualisation etc is more of a matter of developing concentration and shamatha.</p>
              <p>As Bodhidharma says:</p>
              <p><em>"To find a Buddha, you have to see your nature." Whoever sees his 
                                      nature is a 
                                      Buddha. If you don’t see your nature, invoking Buddhas, reciting sutras,
                                       making 
                                      offerings, and keeping precepts are all useless. Invoking Buddhas 
                                      results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping 
                                      precepts 
                                      results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future 
                                      blessings-but 
                                      no buddha. If you don’t understand by yourself, you’ll have to find a 
                                      teacher to 
                                      get to the bottom of life and death. But unless he sees his nature, such
                                       a 
                                      person isn’t a tea6er. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold Canon he 
                                      can’t 
                                      escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms 
                                      without hope 
                                      of release. Long ago, the monk Good Star was able to recite the 
                                      entire Canon. 
                                      But he didn’t escape the Wheel, because he didn’t see his nature. If 
                                      this was 
                                      the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or
                                       
                                      shastras and think it’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, 
                                      reciting 
                                      so much prose is useless."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>"The sutras say that someone who wholeheartedly invokes the Buddha is 
                                      sure to 
                                      be reborn in the Western Paradise. Since is door leads to Buddhahood, 
                                      why seek 
                                      liberation in beholding the mind?</em></p>
              <p><em>If you’re going to invoke the Buddha, you have to do it right. Unless
                                       you 
                                      understand what invoking means, you’ll do it wrong. And if you do it 
                                      wrong, 
                                      you’ll never go anywhere.</em></p>
              <p><em>Buddha means awareness, the awareness of body and mind that prevents 
                                      evil 
                                      from arising in either. And to invoke means to call to mind, to call 
                                      constantly 
                                      to mind the rules of discipline and to follow them with all your might. 
                                      This is 
                                      what’s meant by invoking. Invoking has to do with thought and not with 
                                      language. 
                                      If you use a trap to catch fish, once you succeed you can forget the 
                                      trap. And 
                                      if you use language to find meaning, once you find it you can forget 
                                      language. 
                                      To invoke the Buddha’s name you have to understand the Dharma of 
                                      invoking. If 
                                      it’s not present in your mind, your mouth chants an empty name. As long 
                                      as 
                                      you’re troubled by the three poisons or by thoughts of yourself, your 
                                      deluded 
                                      mind will keep you from seeing the Buddha and you’ll only waste your 
                                      effort. 
                                      Chanting and invoking are worlds apart, Chanting is done with the mouth.
                                       
                                      Invoking is done with the mind. And because invoking comes from the 
                                      mind, it’s 
                                      called the door to awareness. Chanting is centered in the mouth and 
                                      appears as 
                                      sound. If you cling to appearances while searching for meaning, you 
                                      won’t find a 
                                      thing. Thus, sages of the past cultivated introspection and not speech. 
                                      This 
                                      mind is the source of all virtues. And this mind is the chief of all 
                                      powers, The 
                                      eternal bliss of nirvana comes from the mind at rest. Rebirth in the 
                                      three 
                                      realms also comes from the mind. The mind is the door to every world and
                                       the 
                                      mind is the ford to the other shore. Those who know where the door is 
                                      don’t 
                                      worry about reaching it. Those who know where the ford is don’t worry 
                                      about 
                                      crossing it."</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is why a teacher is important, but not just any teacher - a liberated, very enlightened teacher who is able to know the right view, and this is not so common. And it is even subtler than that. If we practice very very hard, and experienced deep states and realisations similar to Hinduism, we still won't be enlightened if we do not have the right view imparted by a teacher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I wrote in my blog: <em>"I also do not think she said nor implied that teachers and teachings are not necessary. And I have to agree with you that a teacher is important - an experienced and enlightened teacher who can impart the Right View. This is to help us 'see' how a non-dual non-conceptual direct meditative experience is being reified into a metaphysical essence without even us noticing it. Ignorance goes far deeper than a non-dual, non-conceptual meditative state. Hence, a teacher is necessary to point out the right view, otherwise we will reify our meditative experience and get stuck on the monist view that you mentioned."</em></p>

              <p>there are many people who attained realisation through pure praying and reciting mantra.  Guru only transmit mantra, they practised and through receiving blessings, they realised.Certain mantras. Actually the only common theme that runs through these people is diligence and strong faith.  anyway, in history this has happened so many times with so many examples.   </p>

              <p>If the practitioner did not receive instructions like on Dzogchen or Mahamudra, but they are practicing mantra as part of the tantric tradition, then what they are practicing is actually called the Development stage. It is part of the path, but itself is not the same as the realisation of the nature of mind.</p>
              <p>Chanting is a form of Shamatha practice. Shamatha (tranquility, one pointedness, concentration) practice serves as a foundation for Vipashyana (insight), but they are not the same. Chanting calms the mind so that you are not lost in the thoughts, but even if you transcend thinking, you may not necessarily realise the nature of mind. At this stage one must look and observe directly to discover the nature of mind. The thing is, you will never be able to observe the nature of your True Mind if you are constantly overwhelmed by thinking, hence Shamatha is helpful in the beginning. But even if thoughts stop or slow down, that doesn't necessarily mean you discovered your Mind, or are directly observing the true nature of Mind.</p>
              <p>As someone (who himself spoke about realising his own Mind while reciting a mantra many years ago, but that webpage was taken down) wrote, <em>Imagine a torch shining on a wall...The torch symbolises the
                                           SEEING, and the light which emanates from the torch and hits the wall 
                                          symbolises the thoughts. The problem is that you are trying to find the 
                                          torch, (ie: the SEEING), but you are looking for it on the wall, (ie: in
                                           the thoughts). Also, thoughts can happen thick and fast and can be 
                                          quite erratic...  so not only are you <strong>looking in the wrong place</strong>,
                                           but you are chasing a moving target. A mantra at least steadies the 
                                          appearance of the thoughts. It's like steadying the light on the wall, 
                                          so you have a better chance of tracing the beam back to its source, but 
                                          never forget, only the torch (the SEEING) is the source. The mantra is 
                                          nothing but a thought, an appearance that has no independent nature, 
                                          repeated. However, as I have said, whilst a mantra can help on the so 
                                          called 'search', it is not actually necessary. Knowledge is the DIRECT 
                                          method.</em></p>
              <p><em>No techniques are needed. The SEEING ( the ordinary 
                                          everyday awareness ) does not need to do anything to BE, to exist. Any 
                                          techniques can only be on the level of thought, and therefore are 
                                          outside of the only reality which is the SEEING. The SEEING is NEVER not
                                           there, it is ALWAYS seeing the thoughts, no matter what they may be. It
                                           is always aware of everything, it cannot under any circumstances not be
                                           there, you can't lose it. So just BE IT. HAVE A SENSE OF IDENTITY WITH 
                                          IT AND NOTHING ELSE. You ARE the torch !</em></p>

                                          divisions: 
                                                            the development stage and the completion stage. What 
                                          does the 
                                                            development stage mean? It means to realize the wisdom
                                           of the 
                                                            Buddha and to practise visualizing ourselves as a 
                                          deity, the 
                                                            buddha body relates to the visualization of the 
                                          physical form 
                                                            of the deity one is practising. The speech aspect is 
                                          the 
                                                            mantra recitation. The mind aspect is to do with 
                                          visualizing 
                                                            in the heart centre various objects. Sometimes it's a 
                                          letter: 
                                                            hung or hri, it can be a Dorje and so on. These 
                                          aspects 
                                                            together define the development stage practice. The 
                                          wisdom of 
                                                            the Buddha has no shape or colour, however, we 
                                          practise with 
                                                            shape and colour.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000066; font-size: normal;">Some people like this method. If people feel 
                                          positive 
                                                            towards this type of practise, then they should do 
                                          that. But 
                                                            some people don't like that kind of practice. For 
                                          people who 
                                                            don't feel drawn to this type of practice, they 
                                          shouldn't do 
                                                            it too strongly, just a little bit. That's the 
                                          explanation of 
                                                            the development stage.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; color: #000066; font-size: normal;">What does completion stage mean? Within our mind we
                                           
                                                            have wisdom and awareness the same as a Buddha, and 
                                          our body 
                                                            is also the same as the buddha body. When we are 
                                          practising 
                                                            the completion stage we have the idea that our body is
                                           the 
                                                            wisdom aspect of the Buddha. Then we practise with the
                                           body, 
                                                            we train with the body physically. Having trained 
                                          physically, 
                                                            the channels and the wind energy and the essence which
                                           travels 
                                                            around in the channels are slowly transformed. Because
                                           our 
                                                            physical nature is transformed, our mind also becomes 
                                                            transformed. The main point is practising with one's 
                                          body. So 
                                                            then, if one is training with the wisdom wind which 
                                          moves 
                                                            through the channels and the precious drops, then one 
                                          adopts 
                                                            the posture and holds the vase breath and does the 
                                          trulkor or 
                                                            the yoga practice and it's very physical. When one 
                                          gradually 
                                                            over time purifies the impure winds, impure channels 
                                          and 
                                                            impure drops, then all of one's defilements and 
                                          obscurations 
                                                            are purified. One will naturally give rise to 
                                          recognition of 
                                                            the nature of mind. That's the explanation of the 
                                          completion 
                                                            stage.</span></p>

              <p>MINGYUR RINPOCHE: In Vajrayana, we have development-stage practice, 
                                          involving visualization and mantra, and completion-stage practice, which
                                           involves working with the energy channels – prana, nadi, and bindu. 
                                          Dzogchen gets right to the heart. It’s more direct than any other 
                                          method. You need preparation and various kinds of support, but the 
                                          practice itself is direct. Even if you have a shortcut, there still 
                                          needs to be a road there to travel on. Otherwise, you can’t use the 
                                          shortcut.</p>
              <p>...</p>
              <p>MINGYUR RINPOCHE: The teacher’s role is to point out. There are many 
                                          stages of development and many experiences that can be quite similar to 
                                          or confused with rigpa. For example, the practice of formless or 
                                          objectless shamatha – resting the mind without an object of 
                                          meditation – can be similar to Dzogchen practice, to rigpa, but it is 
                                          not the same. Similarly, one may experience a kind of dullness of mind 
                                          that has very little conceptualization, which we call <em>alaya</em>, the 
                                          base consciousness. Many people think that alaya is the essence of the 
                                          mind, but that’s not really Dzogchen. So the teacher keeps pointing out 
                                          the natural mind, so you can see very clearly the difference between 
                                          conceptual mind and natural mind, between alaya and rigpa, between 
                                          objectless shamatha and rigpa.</p>

                                           think when we

                                                                  go back deep into your consciousness. This is 
                                          one thing. My
                                                                  perspective is that when you chant, you are not 
                                          dealing with our
                                                                  luminous clarity. We're dealing with 
                                          propensities deep in your
                                                                  consciousness. Insight meditation itself deals 
                                          directly with this
                                                                  clarity. That is the luminous clarity. But if we
                                           were to continue
                                                                  to chant, you are actually focusing more on the 
                                          deeper layers of
                                                                  consciousness that deals with propensities and 
                                          the power of
                                                                  concentration. Do you see what I mean? It's not 
                                          so much of the
                                                                  luminosity. However, the chanting itself, when 
                                          it takes strength,
                                                                  it creates a kind of momentum. A momentum that 
                                          synchronises not
                                                                  only with your sub-conscious or the deeper 
                                          layers of your
                                                                  consciousness, but also your conscious level. 
                                          This means it can
                                                                  sync the two layers into one. This syncing the 
                                          two into one clears
                                                                  your mind, clears your thoughts. And then at 
                                          this time, you ask who
                                                                  you are, that is, not letting the momentum take 
                                          place, but just
                                                                  feel and sense... then you ask what is it. At 
                                          that moment, you
                                                                  might see your reality. But your mind must be 
                                          able to settle down
                                                                  first. But you must know there is a difference 
                                          between working at
                                                                  the concentration level, dealing with the karmic
                                           propensities and
                                                                  creating new momentums, and practicing insight 
                                          meditation that
                                                                  touch directly the clarity and the luminous 
                                          nature, are two
                                                                  different things. You see what I mean or not?<br> <br> <span style="color: red;">Participant 1</span>: 
                                          Yeah I think so.
                                                                  This means that I still need to do insight 
                                          meditation?<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">Thusness</span>: Yes 
                                          you have to do
                                                                  insight meditation. Even if you attain calmness 
                                          you still have to
                                                                  do insight meditation. You must feel the 
                                          awareness... You must
                                                                  sense it everywhere... That is very important 
                                          for liberation. Now
                                                                  when we talk about awareness, we don't call it 
                                          Self or we don't
                                                                  call it Mind. Why people call it Awareness is 
                                          because they do not
                                                                  want to call it Self, because there is no Self. 
                                          The reason they
                                                                  said Awareness, is because Awareness is not an 
                                          entity. It is not a
                                                                  thing. It is just a point of luminous clarity. 
                                          It is just clarity.
                                                                  But because we are so accustomed to thinking 
                                          things in terms of
                                                                  object and subject, we always take Awareness as 
                                          something. It must
                                                                  be somewhere inside, residing somewhere. Even if
                                           it is not residing
                                                                  inside the body it must be somewhere, someplace.
                                           This is the
                                                                  problem, you see. So when you say that letÂ’s be 
                                          aware. We always
                                                                  think of Â“how?Â” How to be aware? When we say 
                                          Â“where is awarenessÂ”,
                                                                  they always look for a place, they always look 
                                          for a something.
                                                                  This is how the mind react, this is what I call a
                                           momentum. They
                                                                  always behave this way. They do not know how to 
                                          say Â“Just do
                                                                  nothing. Everything is expressing itself by 
                                          clarity.Â” They always
                                                                  want to react, you see what I mean?</p>

              <p>Meditation is a word, and words are used in different ways by 
                                          different speakers. This may seem like a trivial point, but it is not. 
                                          It is quite important to distinguish exactly what a
                                              particular speaker means by the words he uses. Every culture on 
                                          earth, for example, has produced some sort of mental practice which 
                                          might be termed meditation. It all depends on how loose a
                                              definition you give to that word. Everybody does it, from Africans 
                                          to Eskimos. The techniques are enormously varied, and we will make no 
                                          attempt to survey them. There are other books for that.
                                              For the purpose of this volume, we will restrict our discussion to 
                                          those practices best known to Western audiences and most likely 
                                          associated with the term meditation.</p>
              <p>Within the Judeo-Christian tradition we find two overlapping 
                                          practices called prayer and contemplation. Prayer is a direct address to
                                           some spiritual entity. Contemplation is a prolonged period
                                              of conscious thought about some specific topic, usually a religious 
                                          ideal or scriptural passage. From the standpoint of mental culture, both
                                           of these activities are exercises in concentration.
                                              The normal deluge of conscious thought is restricted, and the mind 
                                          is brought to one conscious area of operation. The results are those you
                                           find in any concentrative practice: deep calm, a
                                              physiological slowing of the metabolism and a sense of peace and 
                                          well-being.</p>
              <p>Out of the Hindu tradition comes Yogic meditation, which is also 
                                          purely concentrative. The traditional basic exercises consist of 
                                          focusing the mind on a single object: a stone, a candle flame,
                                              a syllable or whatever, and not allowing it to wander. Having 
                                          acquired the basic skill, the Yogi proceeds to expand his practice by 
                                          taking on more complex objects of meditation: chants, colorful
                                              religious images, energy channels in the body and so forth. Still, 
                                          no matter how complex the object of meditation, the meditation itself 
                                          remains purely an exercise in concentration.</p>
              <p>Within the Buddhist tradition, concentration is also highly 
                                          valued. But a new element is added and more highly stressed. That 
                                          element is awareness. All Buddhist meditation aims at the
                                              development of awareness, using concentration as a tool. The 
                                          Buddhist tradition is very wide, however, and there are several diverse 
                                          routes to this goal. Zen meditation uses two separate tacks.
                                              The first is the direct plunge into awareness by sheer force of 
                                          will. You sit down and you just sit, meaning that you toss out of your 
                                          mind everything except pure awareness of sitting. This
                                              sounds very simple. It is not. A brief trial will demonstrate just 
                                          how difficult it really is. The second Zen approach used in the Rinzai 
                                          school is that of tricking the mind out of conscious
                                              thought and into pure awareness. This is done by giving the student 
                                          an unsolvable riddle which he must solve anyway, and by placing him in a
                                           horrendous training situation. Since he cannot flee
                                              from the pain of the situation, he must flee into a pure experience 
                                          of the moment. There is nowhere else to go. Zen is tough. It is 
                                          effective for many people, but it is really tough.</p>
              <p>Another stratagem, Tantric Buddhism, is nearly the reverse. 
                                          Conscious thought, at least the way we usually do it, is the 
                                          manifestation of ego, the you that you usually think that you are.
                                              Conscious thought is tightly connected with self-concept. The 
                                          self-concept or ego is nothing more than a set of reactions and mental 
                                          images which are artificially pasted to the flowing process of
                                              pure awareness. Tantra seeks to obtain pure awareness by destroying 
                                          this ego image. This is accomplished by a process of visualization. The 
                                          student is given a particular religious image to
                                              meditate upon, for example, one of the deities from the Tantric 
                                          pantheon. He does this in so thorough a fashion that he becomes that 
                                          entity. He takes off his own identity and puts on another.
                                              This takes a while, as you might imagine, but it works. During the 
                                          process, he is able to watch the way that the ego is constructed and put
                                           in place. He comes to recognize the arbitrary nature of
                                              all egos, including his own, and he escapes from bondage to the ego.
                                           He is left in a state where he may have an ego if he so chooses, either
                                           his own or whichever other he might wish, or he can do
                                              without one. Result: pure awareness. Tantra is not exactly a game of
                                           patty cake either.</p>
              <p>Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. The 
                                          method comes directly from the Sitipatthana Sutta, a discourse 
                                          attributed to Buddha himself. Vipassana is a direct and gradual
                                              cultivation of mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by piece 
                                          over a period of years. The student's attention is carefully directed to
                                           an intense examination of certain aspects of his own
                                              existence. The meditator is trained to notice more and more of his 
                                          own flowing life experience. Vipassana is a gentle technique. But it 
                                          also is very, very thorough. It is an ancient and codified
                                              system of sensitivity training, a set of exercises dedicated to 
                                          becoming more and more receptive to your own life experience. It is 
                                          attentive listening, total seeing and careful testing. We learn
                                              to smell acutely, to touch fully and really pay attention to what we
                                           feel. We learn to listen to our own thoughts without being caught up in
                                           them.</p>
              <p>The object of Vipassana practice is to learn to pay attention. We
                                           think we are doing this already, but that is an illusion. It comes from
                                           the fact that we are paying so little attention to the
                                              ongoing surge of our own life experiences that we might just as well
                                           be asleep. We are simply not paying enough attention to notice that we 
                                          are not paying attention. It is another Catch-22.</p>

              <p>Hi AEN,</p>
              <p>II agree that reciting mantra induces shamatha.  But don't forget, mantra invokes deity.  There is such a thing as blessings. And blessings are inconceivable.  Meditation is largely relying on self-power. Blessings involves a bigger picture. </p>
              <p>I am glad to hear that someone realised his mind through reciting though it's a pity he pulled down his site. </p>
              <p> it's just good to encourage people that if they feel inclined to it, chanting is a perfectly good path to take... i always encourage pureland.  Many Dzogchen realised lineage masters emphasize that pureland practice must take place together with Dzogchen practice.  Cos in case you can't accomplish deep enough level, got insurance.  Buddha's blessngs more powerful than self-effort most cases u know. </p>

              <p>In a nutshell:</p>
              <p>Basically what I am saying is that purely chanting is pure shamatha practice and by itself cannot lead to enlightenment, but leads to calmness and concentration and deals with the momentum (the seeds in 8th consciousness).</p>
              <p>Chanting can lead to a state of calmness, which is condusive for insight meditation (vipashyana), which is to investigate and observe directly the nature of mind.</p>
              <p>However we must not confuse shamatha with vipashyana practice. We must not give others wrong info.</p>
              <p>Shamatha leads to samadhi and some shamatha practice even leads to jhanas, but in itself does not result in enlightenment.</p>
              <p>It is important to understand that chanting by itself deals with momentum and concentration and calmness, while vipashyana deals with the luminous and empty nature of mind.</p>
              <p>What you said about pure land is valid, but it's important not to let others misunderstand. They must clearly understand the difference between shamatha and vipashyana.</p>
              <p>What I said has nothing to do with 'analysing too much' - in fact I didn't even post much, most of what I posted are direct quotes from other masters. Are you saying they are analysing too much?</p>
              <p>There is in fact no problem with analysing if provided with the correct teachings. Analysing is an important and essential tool. We have to have the right analysis to counter 'wrong analysis'. Then we have to develope insights so that whatever we learnt is immediately experienced without the need of analysing.</p>
              <p>In fact I don't think the masters are giving purely mental analysis: they are in fact speaking from experience. Just because we do not fully comprehend what others said doesn't mean it's just theory. For others it could be their direct experience, and we should take it to heart.</p>

              <p>If they attained rainbow body, that means they not only practiced Trekchod which is cutting through illusions to the nature of mind, but also Thodgal, which is a specific Dzogchen (Mahamudra also have their own practices) practice to develope the rainbow body.</p>
              <p>Many Tibetan practitioners are hidden Dzogchen practitioners. On the surface they only chant but their inner practice may not be known. They are certainly not just Shamatha practitioners.</p>

              <p>If that practitioner has even attained Sotapanna (the first out of four stages to Arhantship), he is already assured no more rebirth in lower realms, and certainty to attain full liberation (arhat) within 7 lifetimes.</p>

              <p>The above is for the Hinyana path. It should be noted that a Sotapanna does not necessarily have to wait for 7 lifetimes, many practitioners enter Sotapanna stage, then ascend all the way to Arhat in one lifetime.</p>
              <p>For the Mahayana/Bodhisattva path: If that practitioner has even attained 1st Bhumi, he is assured non-retrogression into samsara -- means he is like the Sotapanna on an assured path to liberation.</p>

                                                  falling away from the Bodhisattva Ideal. This is only when he achieves 
                                                  what we call Irreversibility. And the Bodhisattva becomes Irreversible 
                                                  only in the eighth </em><em>bhumi, the eighth stage out of the ten. So 
                                                  look what a long way the Bodhisattva has to go before he can be 
                                                  completely sure that he's going to persevere to the end. So he becomes 
                                                  Irreversible in this eighth </em><em>bhumi, that is to say Irreversible 
                                                  from full Enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. Up to that 
                                                  point, till he becomes Irreversible, there's always the danger,<strong> not that
                                                   he'll fall away from the spiritual life itself no - that danger he has 
                                                  overcome long before - but there is the danger that he'll fall back into
                                                   spiritual individualism: that he'll give up trying to become 
                                                  Enlightened, trying to become a Buddha for the sake of all, slip back 
                                                  into spiritual individualism in the sense of seeking to gain 
                                                  Enlightenment just for his own sake.</strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is very clear that non-retrogression in Eight Bhumi means not falling back into Hinayana. It does not mean Bodhisattvas before eight bhumi can fall back into samsara, pls don't misunderstand.</p>
              <p>Then you may ask, does realising nature of mind means achieving bhumi?</p>
              <p>It depends on what you mean by realising nature of mind. The criteria in Buddhism to achieve 1st Bhumi means realising the twofold emptiness of self and dharmas. If you realise the union of luminosity and emptiness, you are certainly already in the bhumis.</p>
              <p>Some people realise the luminosity aspect of Mind, which is far more common, and reify it as Self. This is what Ch'an Master Sheng Yen called the One Mind or Great Self. Many people go through this stage and think it is enlightenment. In actuality, what they realise is the luminosity, the vivid Presence and Awareness aspect of Mind. It can be misunderstood to be a metaphysical essence, a Source, an Eternal Witness. This is still not the realisation of no-self. But nevertheless it is still an important realisation, a stage to go through.</p>
              <p>In other words, some practitioners seen Mind, which is the luminous aware aspect, the essence of mind. But they did not realise the nature of mind, which is Empty. That is why Thusness always said æ˜Žå¿ƒ (see Mind) is not the same as è§�æ€§ (see the [empty] nature)</p>
              <p>If a person realises the union of luminosity and emptiness, he is truly enlightened in the Buddhist sense and is already in the bhumis.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So just realise mind is not enough, you got 
                                      to have depth in
                                                              your realisation which may take beyond this 
                                      life.  For eg.
                                                              Gampopa when he was talking about one-taste on 
                                      meditation, when he
                                                              give the theory, he also say, actually one taste
                                       is like this---
                                                              then he wave his hand through the pillar beside 
                                      him as if it is not
                                                              solid.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Gampopa is trying to show the non-solidity and emptiness of appearance.</p>
              <p>However it doesn't mean everyone who realised One Taste must therefore perform miracles like moving through pillars. That's not the point.</p>
              <p>The One Taste realisation is when the realisation of the luminous and empty nature of mind is realised to be the very essence and nature of all appearances.</p>
              <p>There is still one more stage after One Taste: the stage of Non-Meditation. It is a natural progression from One Taste stage. When all appearances are realised to be of the spontaneously perfected luminous and empty nature, already so, so called practice moves from efforting to spontaneity.</p>

              <p>the problem with such discussions, is that i post some statement
                                          then you read off your interpretation of it and write your comments
                                          then i have to veer off my initial perspective to go address
                                          your perspective. Goes too far afield.</p>
              <p>I think to cut things short, i'd put it this way, relevant to
                                          the initial point i am making in the first post here.</p>
              <p>Those people I'm referring to are not hidden Dzogchen
                                          yogis.  Normal people, in fact i think a bit handicapped.The
                                          teacher just gave them the simple practice of reciting. 
                                          There are certain practices that have been described by Buddha in
                                          tantras to be able to bring such effects. Of course takes diligence
                                          and faith. Just that brought high accomplishments. Of course one
                                          can choose to practice trekchod and togal. </p>
              <p>Sorry for my comment about you analysing too much. I thot it
                                          might be too bzbody of me. Didn't mean harm. Anyway, you are free
                                          to choose your own path.</p>

              <p>Chanting practiced by itself is a pure shamatha, concentrative practice that leads to absorption. Thusness told me it can lead to non-dual experience where subject and object merges, where there is only just the sound and the chanting but no background/separate hearer, like a temporary experience of no-self, yet it is not the realisation and insight of the nature of reality as no-self. Just by chanting something doesn't necessarily give rise to insight.</p>
              <p>If you insist that chanting by itself alone gives rise to insight, I would like to ask you, how is this practice any different from the chanting practiced in Hinduism, Islam, etc, since they also practice chanting (and yes Islam and I think Catholics too have their own rosary beads and keep chanting the name of God. Hinduism needless to say: the tradition of mantra chanting actually originated from Hinduism).</p>
              <p>I think what Bhante Gunaratana (and likewise what Thusness and Ven Shen Kai) pointed out is very important. Vipassana is something peculiar to Buddhism. Shamatha already existed long before Buddha. Pure concentration leads to samadhi, absorption, calmness, and can deal with karmic momentum. However Vipassana/Vipashyana deals with the luminous clarity, the Awareness, and the empty nature of Awareness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However the thing is this: when one reaches a state of thoughtless samadhi through chanting, at that moment, there is a very good chance one can inquire or 'trace the beam back' into the Source, like a spontaneous inquiry 'Who am I' will draw one back to the Source and realise true Mind.</p>

              <p>dear AEN,</p>
              <p>chanting per se does not lead to accomplishments.  BUT, chanting invokes deity and blessings, and blessings can lead to accomplishments.</p>
              <p>Chanting not only can lead to insight, it can purify karma and even lead right up to rainbow body, it can also solve alot of worldly problems.  It solve both relative and ultimate problems. Unfortunately many people are just satisfied with solving worldly problems and stop there. </p>
              <p>There are many past examples of people who attained accomplishment by chanting alone.  Requires great faith and diligence.</p>
              <p>About your point on chanting in other tradition,  look at what other traditions chant, and what we chant. I think there is difference right? </p>
              <p>Actually if you look at chanting of Amitabha, it can also be considered accomplishment by chanting.  But different from what i'm talking about above, which is accomplishment in this life. Once one go into Amitabha pureland, one can attain very high realisation easily, in fact it is said that once out of the lotus and see Buddha Amitabha is first bhumi already which is very very high level. Going into pureland is not that much longer than this life. This life is brief, death comes anytime and after death, straight to pureland. Very fast.</p>
              <p>Actually, i dun know how many people really appreciate. Pureland practice is very great kindness to us.</p>

              <p><em>"<strong>To find a Buddha, you have to see your nature." Whoever sees his nature is a Buddha.

Invoking Buddhas results in good karma, reciting sutras results in a good memory; keeping precepts results in a good rebirth, and making offerings results in future blessings-but no buddha. If you don’t understand by yourself, you’ll have to find a teacher to get to the bottom of life and death. But unless he sees his nature, such a person isn’t a tea6er. Even if he can recite the Twelvefold Canon he can’t escape the Wheel of Birth and Death. He suffers in the three realms without hope of release. Long ago, the monk Good Star was able to recite the entire Canon. But he didn’t escape the Wheel, because he didn’t see his nature. If this was the case with Good Star, then people nowadays who recite a few sutras or shastras and think it’s the Dharma are fools. Unless you see your mind, reciting so much prose is useless."</em></p>
