              <h1>The Radiant Mind Is Unawareness  <a id="radiant" class="back " title="Go up" name="radiant" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/boowa/straight.html#top"> </a></h1>
              <p>Normally the mind is radiant and always ready to make contact with 
              everything of every sort. Although all phenomena without exception fall 
              under the laws of the three characteristics — stress, inconstancy, and 
              not-self — the true nature of the mind doesn't fall under these laws.</p>
              <p>The extent to which the mind <em>does</em> follow these laws is because
               the things that fall under these three characteristics come spinning in
               and become involved with it, so that it goes spinning along with them. 
              Even then, though, it spins in a way that doesn't disintegrate or fall 
              apart. It spins with the things that have the power to make it spin, but
               the natural power of the mind itself is that it <em>knows and does not 
              die.</em> This deathlessness is something that lies beyond 
              disintegration. This non-disintegration is something that lies beyond 
              the three characteristics and the common laws of nature, but we're not 
              aware of it because conventional realities become involved with the mind
               and surround it, so that the mind's behavior conforms thoroughly to 
              theirs.</p>
              <p>The fact that we're unaware that birth and death are things that have
               always been with the mind infected by defilement, is because ignorance 
              itself is an affair of defilement. <em>Birth and death are an affair of 
              defilement.</em> Our own true affair, <em>the affair that's ours pure and 
              simple — the affair of the mind pure and simple — is that we don't have 
              the power to be our own true self.</em> We have been taking all sorts of 
              counterfeit things as our self all along, and so the mind's behavior is 
              not in keeping with its true nature. Its behavior falls under the sway 
              of the deceits of defilement, which make it worry and fear, dreading 
              death, dreading everything. Whatever happens — a little pain, a lot of 
              pain — it's afraid. If even the least little thing disturbs it, it's 
              afraid. As a result, the mind is filled with worries and fears. Even 
              though fear and worry aren't directly an affair of the mind, they still 
              manage to make it tremble.</p>
              <p>We'll see — when the mind is cleansed so that it is fully pure and 
              nothing can become involved with it — that no fear appears in the mind 
              at all. Fear doesn't appear. Courage doesn't appear. All that appears is
               its own nature by itself, just its own timeless nature. That's all. 
              This is the genuine mind. 'Genuine mind' here refers only to the purity 
              or the <em>'saupadisesa-nibbana'</em> of the arahants. Nothing else can be
               called the 'genuine mind' without reservations or hesitations. I, for 
              one, would feel embarrassed to use the term for anything else at all.</p>
              <p>The 'original mind' means the original mind of the round in which the
               mind finds itself spinning around and about, as in the Buddha's saying,
               'Monks, the original mind is radiant' — notice that — 'but because of 
              the admixture of defilements' or 'because of the defilements that come 
              passing through, it becomes darkened.'</p>
              <p>The original mind here refers to the origin of conventional 
              realities, not to the origin of purity. The Buddha uses the term <em>'pabhassaram'</em> — <em>'pabhassaramidam cittam bhikkhave'</em> — which means radiant. It 
              doesn't mean pure. The way he puts it is absolutely right. There is no 
              way you can fault it. Had he said that the original mind is pure, you 
              could immediately take issue: 'If the mind is pure, why is it born? 
              Those who have purified their minds are never reborn. If the mind is 
              already pure, why purify it?' Right here is where you could take issue. 
              What reason would there be to purify it? If the mind is radiant, you can
               purify it because its radiance is unawareness incarnate, and nothing 
              else. Meditators will see clearly for themselves the moment the mind 
              passes from radiance to mental release: Radiance will no longer appear. 
              Right here is the point where meditators clearly know this, and it's the
               point that lets them argue — because the truth has to be found true in 
              the individual heart. Once a person knows, he or she can't help but 
              speak with full assurance.</p>
              <p>Thus the fact that our mind is surrounded, made to fear, to worry, to
               love, to hate, or whatever, is caused entirely by the symptoms of 
              conventional reality, the symptoms of defilement. We have no mental 
              power of our own. We have only the power of defilement, craving, and 
              mental effluents pushing and pressuring us day and night while we sit, 
              stand, walk, and lie down. Where are we going to find any happiness and 
              ease as long as these things, which are constantly changing, keep 
              provoking the mind to change along with them without our being aware of 
              the fact?</p>
              <p>There can be no ease in this world — none at all — until these things
               can be completely eradicated from the heart. Until then, we can have no
               secure ease and relief in any way. We can only shift and change about, 
              or lean this way and that, depending on how much we're provoked by the 
              things that come and involve us. This is why the Buddha teaches us to 
              cleanse the mind, which is the same thing as cleansing ourselves of 
              suffering.</p>
              <p>There is no one who has genuinely penetrated the principles of the 
              truth like the Lord Buddha. Only he can be called <em>'sayambhu'</em> — 
              one who needs no teaching or training from anyone else. In curing his 
              heart of defilement, he performed the duties of both student and 
              teacher, all by himself, until he awakened to the level of the 
              superlative Dhamma, becoming the superlative person, the superlative 
              Master.</p>
              <p>This is not to deny that on the level of concentration — the 
              development of mental stillness — he received training from the two 
              hermits; but that in itself wasn't the way of extrication leading to the
               level of omniscience <em>(sabbaññu).</em> By the time he was to attain 
              omniscience, he had left the two hermits and was striving on his own. He
               came to know the Dhamma on his own and to see on his own, without 
              anyone else's teaching him. He then brought that Dhamma to teach the 
              world so that it has known good and evil, heaven, hell, and <em>nibbana</em> ever since. Had there been no one to teach us, we of the world would be
               completely burdened with the mass of fire filling our hearts and would 
              never see the day when we could put our burdens down.</p>
              <p>This being the case, we should appreciate the worth of the Dhamma 
              that the Buddha brought to the world after having endured hardships in a
               way no one else in the world could have managed.</p>
              <p>So now, at present, what is it that covers the heart so that we can't
               find its radiance and purity, even though each of us wants to find 
              purity. What conceals it? To answer in terms of natural principles, we 
              should start with the five <em>khandhas.</em> As for the 'mind of 
              unawareness,' we can save that for later. Let's just start out with 
              what's really obvious — the five <em>khandhas</em> and their companions: 
              sight, sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations.</p>
              <p>These make contact with the eye, ear, nose, tongue and body, and then
               link up with the mind, forming the basis for this assumption and that. 
              The mind then takes the objects that have come passing by and uses them 
              to bind itself, entangle itself, or encircle itself so that it is 
              completely darkened with love, hate, anger, and all sorts of other 
              states, all of which come from the things I have mentioned.</p>
              <p>But what lies buried deep is our belief that the <em>khandhas</em> form
               our self. From time immemorial, whatever our language, whatever our 
              race — even when we are common animals — we have to believe that these 
              things are us, are ours; that they are a being, the self of a being, our
               own self. If we become deities, we believe that our divine bodies are 
              ours. If we become hungry ghosts or whatever, the things we dwell in — 
              gross bodies or refined — we take to be us or ours. Even when we become 
              human beings and begin to have some sense of good and evil, we still 
              have to believe that 'This is us,' or 'This is ours.' Of the five <em>khandhas,</em> the body <em>(rupa)</em> is 'us.' <em>Vedana, sañña, sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana</em> are 'us,' are 'ours.' These assumptions lie buried deep within us.</p>
              <p>The Buddha thus teaches us to investigate. We investigate these 
              things so as to see their truth clearly and then to uproot our mistaken 
              assumptions and attachments that they are the self. We do this for the 
              sake of freedom and for nothing else.</p>
              <p>If we look at these things in their normal state, we might wonder why
               we should investigate them. Sights are simply sights; sounds are 
              sounds; smells, smells; tastes, tastes; tactile sensations are simply 
              natural phenomena as they've always been. They've never announced that 
              they are our enemies. So why investigate them?</p>
              <p>We investigate them to know the truth of each one of them as it 
              actually is, to realize our own delusions by means of this investigation
               and to extricate ourselves from them through knowledge — for the fact 
              that the mind lays claim to the <em>khandhas</em> as its self, as 
              belonging to itself, is because of delusion and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Once we have investigated and clearly understood what these things 
              are, the mind withdraws inwardly through knowledge, understanding, and 
              discernment, with no more concern for these things. We investigate 
              whichever <em>khandha</em> is most prominent. We needn't conjecture or 
              speculate about the fact that we haven't contemplated the five <em>khandhas</em> in their entirety, or each <em>khandha</em> in turn. We needn't 
              conjecture at all. All we need to do is to see which <em>khandha</em> is 
              prominent and merits investigation at the moment — which <em>khandha</em> we feel best suited to handle — and then investigate and explore it so 
              that it becomes clear.</p>
              <p>Take, for instance, the body, whichever aspect of the body is most 
              prominent in your awareness — the aspect that has you most interested, 
              that you want most to investigate. Latch onto that spot and focus on 
              examining it so as to see its truth in terms of the question, 'What is 
              stress?'</p>
              <p>In the texts we are told that stress <em>(dukkha)</em> means 
              'unendurability,' but this doesn't sit well with my own crass tastes, 
              which is why — one man's meat being another man's poison — I prefer to 
              translate stress as 'a constant squeeze.' This is more in keeping with 
              my tastes, which are very crude. For example, the phrase, <em>'yampiccham
               na labhati tampi dukkham,'</em> is right in line with my translation. In
               other words, 'Not attaining what is desired is stress.' How is it 
              stress? In that it puts a squeeze on us, or makes us uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>If we don't get what we want, we're uncomfortable. Even if we get 
              what we want but then lose it, we suffer stress. Stress in this sense 
              fits the translation, 'a squeeze.' This squeeze is what's meant by 
              stress or unendurability. If it can't endure, let it go its own way. Why
               mess with it? Actually, no matter which <em>khandha,</em> no matter which
               of the three characteristics, the mind is the one at fault for getting 
              attached, which is why we have to examine the <em>khandhas</em> until we 
              have them clear.</p>
              <p>Whatever aspect of the body, look so as to see it clearly. If we're 
              not yet clear about the filthiness in our 'physical heap,' we can look 
              at the charnel ground within us so as to see it clearly. When we're told
               to visit the charnel ground, this is where we make our visit. Even if 
              we visit a charnel ground outside, the purpose is to reflect inwardly on
               the inner charnel ground — our own body.</p>
              <p>As for the external charnel ground, in the days of the Buddha it was a
               place where corpses were scattered all over the place. The dead were 
              hardly ever buried or cremated as they are today. So the Buddha taught 
              monks to visit the charnel ground, where old corpses and new were 
              scattered everywhere. He also gave detailed instructions as to the 
              direction from which to enter, in keeping with his sharp intelligence as
               a self-dependent Buddha, the Teacher of the world. He said to approach 
              from the upwind side and not from the downwind side. Otherwise the 
              stench of the various corpses would be bad for your health.</p>
              <p>'When you encounter corpses in this way, how do you feel? Look at the
               different types of corpses. How do you feel? Now refer inwardly, to 
              your own body, which is another corpse.' This is how he taught the monks
               to investigate. Once we have an eyewitness — ourself — as to what the 
              corpses in the external charnel ground are like, we can refer inwardly 
              to the internal charnel ground: ourself again. Once we have grasped the 
              basic principle, the external charnel ground gradually fades out of the 
              picture. Instead, we investigate our internal charnel ground so that it 
              becomes gradually more and more clear. In other words, we see how this 
              body is a well of filth. Repulsive. Something that constantly has to be 
              washed, bathed, and cleaned.</p>
              <p>Is there anything that, once it has become involved with any part of 
              the body, remains clean? Even the food we eat, once we consume it, 
              becomes filthy from the moment it enters the mouth and passes on down. 
              Our clothing is also dirty. It has to be washed and laundered — a lot of
               fuss and bother. The same holds true for our homes. They constantly 
              have to be cleaned, scrubbed, dusted, and swept. Otherwise they turn 
              into another charnel ground because of the filth and the smell. 
              Everywhere, wherever human beings live, has to be cleaned — because 
              human beings are filthy. And since our bodies are already filthy, 
              everything that comes into contact with them becomes filthy. Even food —
               delicious, inviting, appealing food — once it becomes mixed with the 
              filth in the body, such as saliva, becomes filthy as well. If you took 
              food of various kinds into your mouth and then spit it out, there'd be 
              no way you could take it back in again. It'd be too disgusting. 
              Revolting. Why? Because the body is filthy by its very nature, and so 
              whatever becomes involved with the body becomes filthy as well.</p>
              <p>To contemplate in this way is called investigating the charnel 
              ground, or investigating the theme of loathsomeness.</p>
              <p>So. Focus in on seeing its inherent nature. Look at every facet, in 
              whichever way comes most naturally to you. When you've examined one 
              spot, your knowledge gradually seeps into the next spot and the next. If
               mindfulness and awareness keep in close connection, discernment can't 
              help but go to work and advance unceasingly. You'll feel profoundly 
              moved as you come to see and know truly, step by step. This is 
              discernment on the first level of investigation.</p>
              <p>Once you've investigated filthiness, you then investigate the process
               of change in the body. In other words, filth is in this body. Dry 
              corpses, fresh corpses, raw corpses, cooked corpses, all kinds of 
              corpses are gathered together in this body, but I've never heard the 
              place where they are barbecued, roasted, and stewed called a 
              crematorium. Instead, it's called kitchen. But actually, that's what it 
              is, a crematorium for animals. And then they're all buried here in this 
              stomach, this grave. We're a burial ground for all kinds of animals — 
              yes, us! — if we look at ourselves in all fairness, with impartiality, 
              because we're filled with old corpses and new. Once we have contemplated
               in this way, then if we don't feel disenchantment, if we don't feel 
              disengagement, what will we feel? — for that's the way the truth 
              actually is.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught us to get to the truth, because this is what the 
              truth is. If we don't resist the truth, we will all be able to unshackle
               ourselves from our attachments and false assumptions — from our 
              stupidity and foolishness — step by step. The mind will become bright 
              and clear, radiating its brightness with dignity, bravery, and courage 
              in the face of the truth that comes into contact with it at all times. 
              It will be content to accept every facet of the truth with fairness and 
              impartiality. Even though we may not have yet abandoned our attachments 
              absolutely, we can still find relief in having put them down to at least
               some extent. We no longer have to be constantly weighed down with our 
              attachments to the <em>khandhas</em> to the point where we are always 
              miserable. This is in keeping with the saying, 'Fools, the heavier their
               burdens, the more they keep piling on. Sages, the lighter their 
              burdens, the more they let go — until nothing is left.'</p>
              <p>When we investigate in this way, we should examine the process of 
              change in the <em>khandhas.</em> Every piece, every bit, every part of the
               body undergoes change. There's no exception, not even for a single 
              hair. Everything undergoes change in the same way. So which part is us, 
              which part is ours, to which we should be attached?</p>
              <p>The same holds true with the word <em>'anatta,'</em> not-self. It 
              drives home even more firmly the fact that these things don't deserve 
              our attachment. <em>'Anatta'</em> lies in the same parts as change — the 
              very same parts. They're <em>anatta,</em> not ours or anyone else's. <em>Each
               one, each one is simply a natural phenomenon mingled with the others in
               line with its own nature,</em> without any concern for who will like it 
              or hate it, latch onto it or let it go.</p>
              <p>But we human beings are light-fingered and quick. Whatever comes our 
              way, we snatch hold of it, snatch hold of it, with no concern for right 
              or wrong. We're more light-fingered and quick than a hundred monkeys, 
              and yet all of us, all over the world, like to criticize monkeys for not
               being able to sit contented and still. Actually we ourselves can't stay
               contented and still in any position. We're full of restlessness — 
              unruly, reckless, overflowing our boundaries — and yet we never think of
               criticizing ourselves. The Dhamma taught by the Buddha is thus like a 
              stick for slapping the hands of this light-fingered, unruly monkey.</p>
              <p>With the three characteristics, <em>anatta</em> among them, he warns 
              us, strikes our wrists: 'Don't reach!' He slaps us, strikes us: 'Don't 
              reach for it as "me" or "mine."' The phrase, 'The body is not the self,'
               is just like that. 'Don't reach for it. Don't latch onto it.' This is 
              simply so that we will see that it's already not-self. By its nature 
              it's not-self. It doesn't belong to anyone at all. He's already told us:
               <em>'Anatta:</em> It's not the self.' This is how we investigate the 
              body.</p>
              <p>So, now then: Focus on visualizing it as it disintegrates, in 
              whichever way seems most natural to you. This part decomposes. That part
               decomposes. This part falls off. That part falls off. Let yourself 
              become engrossed in watching it, using your own ingenuity. This falls 
              off, that falls off, until everything has fallen apart — all the bones, 
              from the skull on down. Once the skin that enwraps them has decomposed, 
              the flesh has decomposed, the tendons that hold them together have 
              decomposed, the bones can't help but fall apart, piece by piece, because
               they are held together only by tendons. Once the tendons decompose, the
               different parts have to fall off piece by piece in a pile on the 
              ground, scattered all over the place. You can even visualize having 
              vultures, crows, and dogs come to eat and scatter the parts everywhere. 
              How does the mind feel about this?</p>
              <p>Well then, look at it. Visualize the liquid parts seeping into the 
              earth and evaporating into the air, then drying away, drying away until 
              they no longer appear. The solid parts, once they've dried, return to 
              the earth from which they came. Earth returns to earth, water to water, 
              wind to wind. Penetrate down into any of four elements — earth, water, 
              wind, or fire — because each gives clear evidence of the Noble Truths.</p>
              <p>We don't have to think that we've examined earth clearly, but this 
              element or that element isn't clear. We needn't think that way at all. 
              If we examine any one of them until it's clear, we will penetrate them 
              all, because earth, water, wind, and fire are all already open and 
              aboveboard. They appear to our sight. In our body, we already have 
              water. Wind — for example, the in-and-out breath — is already clearly 
              there, already clear to see. Fire — the warmth in the body — is 
              something we all have here in our bodies. So why don't we accept its 
              truth with right discernment? Once we've investigated it over and over 
              again, we have to accept it. We can't resist the truth, because that's 
              why we're here: We want the truth.</p>
              <p>So keep investigating. Look for the part that's 'you' or 'yours.' 
              Look for it! There isn't any — not a one! The whole thing originally 
              belongs to them: to earth, water, wind, and fire. It originally belongs 
              to the different elements.</p>
              <p>Now, when you look in this manner, the mind can settle down and grow 
              still. At the same time, these aren't preoccupations that will make the 
              mind proud, conceited, or unruly. Rather, they are themes that calm the 
              heart, which is why the Buddha taught us to investigate them repeatedly 
              until we understand and become adept at them.</p>
              <p>When the mind sees clearly with its own discernment, it can't help 
              but withdraw into stillness, firmly centered within, letting go of all 
              its cares. <em>This is one level in the investigation of the khandhas.</em></p>
              <p>Now for the next step: Investigate feelings of pain, especially when 
              you are ill or have been sitting in meditation for a long time, and 
              severe pain arises. Take it on, right there. A warrior has to fight when
               the enemy appears. If there's no enemy, how can you call him a warrior?
               And what's the enemy? Feelings of pain, the enemy of the heart. When 
              you're ill, where does it hurt? There: You have your enemy. If you're a 
              warrior, how can you run away and hide? You have to fight <em>until you 
              gain knowledge and then use that knowledge to come out victorious.</em></p>
              <p>So. What does the pain come from? From the time we were born until we
               first sat in meditation, it wasn't there. Before we first became ill, 
              it didn't appear. It appears only now that we're ill. Before that, where
               was it hiding? If it's really 'us,' our mind should have been aware of 
              it at all times, so why hasn't this kind of pain appeared at all times? 
              Why is it appearing now? If the pain is 'us,' then when it vanishes why 
              doesn't the mind vanish with it? If they're really one and the same 
              thing, they have to vanish together. The pain should appear as long as 
              the mind is aware. If they're one and the same thing, the pain shouldn't
               vanish. You have to look and investigate until this is clear. At the 
              same time, analyze the body when the pain arises — when, for example, 
              your legs ache or when this or that bone hurts. Fix your attention on 
              the bone if the bone is really hurting.</p>
              <p>Is the bone the pain? <em>Ask yourself! And whatever you're asking 
              about, focus your attention right there.</em> Don't ask in the abstract 
              or absentmindedly. Ask in a way that focuses the mind right down to see 
              the truth. Focus steadily right on the pain. Stare the mind right down 
              on whichever bone you identify with the pain. Look carefully to see, 'Is
               this bone the pain?' Fix your attention there. Really observe with your
               own discernment. If this bone is really the pain, then when the pain 
              vanishes, why doesn't the bone vanish with it? If they really are one 
              and the same thing, then when the pain vanishes, the bone should vanish 
              too. It shouldn't remain.</p>
              <p>But look: When the disease goes away, or when we get up from sitting 
              in meditation, the really severe pain vanishes, the stress vanishes. So 
              if they <em>are</em> one and the same thing, why doesn't the bone vanish 
              as well? This shows that they aren't one and the same. The feeling isn't
               the same as the body. The body isn't the same as the feeling. 
              Similarly, the body and the mind aren't one and the same. Each has its 
              own separate reality. Distinguish them so as to see them clearly in line
               with this truth, and you'll understand their true nature through 
              discernment, with no doubts at all. Feeling will appear in its true 
              nature.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the investigation will come circling in, circling in, 
              circling in to the mind. The pain will gradually shrink into itself, 
              away from the mind's assumptions. In other words, you will see that the 
              mind is the culprit. The mind is the instigator. The physical pain will 
              gradually subside and fade away. The body will simply be there as the 
              body, with the same reality it had before the pain appeared. And now 
              that the pain has vanished, the flesh, skin, tendon, bone or whatever 
              part you had identified as the pain will maintain its reality in the 
              same way. It isn't the pain. The body is the body. The feeling is the 
              feeling. The mind is the mind. Fix your attention on seeing them 
              clearly. Once the mind has penetrated to the truth, the pain will 
              disappear. This is one result.</p>
              <p>Another result is that even if the pain doesn't vanish — here I'm 
              referring to the physical pain — still it can't have any impact on the 
              heart and mind. Ultimately, the mind is serene, secure, and majestic, 
              there in the midst of the physical pain. No matter which part of the 
              body you say is pained — even if it's the whole body at once — the mind 
              isn't disturbed or agitated in any way. It's relaxed and at ease because
               it has seen with discernment right through the pain appearing at the 
              moment. This is another sort of result that comes from investigating 
              pain.</p>
              <p>When investigating pain, then the greater the pain, the more 
              important it is that your mindfulness and discernment not retreat. They 
              have to keep advancing so as to know the truth. You needn't aim at 
              making the pain vanish, because such a desire would simply enhance the 
              pain and make it more and more severe. Actually, <em>you're making an 
              investigation simply to see the truth.</em> Whether or not the pain 
              vanishes, know the truth that is the pain or gives rise to the pain by 
              seeing through it with your own discernment: That's enough. Fix your 
              attention there, and these things will keep appearing and disappearing 
              there in the <em>khandhas.</em></p>
              <p>The body appears for a certain period and then disintegrates in what 
              we call death. As for feelings of pain, they appear a hundred times in a
               single day and then disappear a hundred times, a thousand times as 
              well. What's lasting about them? This is the kind of truth they are. Get
               so you clearly know with discernment the truth of painful feelings as 
              they appear. Don't retreat or let the mind wander adrift.</p>
              <p>What is <em>sañña</em> labeling at the moment? <em>Sañña</em> is the 
              important instigator. <em>As soon as sankhara fashions anything — blip! —
               sañña latches right onto it</em> and labels it this, labels it that — 
              stirring things all up. When we talk about the things that create havoc,
               provoking this issue and that, we're referring to these characters: <em>sankharas</em> and <em>saññas</em> that label things and stamp meanings on them. 'This 
              is us. This is ours. This is pain. It hurts right here. It hurts right 
              there. I'm afraid of the pain. I'm afraid to die' — afraid of everything
               of every sort. These are the characters that fool us into fear, making 
              the mind apprehensive, making it give up its efforts and lose. <em>Is it 
              good to lose?</em> Even children playing games have a sense of shame when
               they lose, and try to make up their losses. As for meditators who lose 
              out to defilement, who lose out to pain: If they don't feel embarrassed 
              in the presence of the defilements, the pains and themselves, then 
              they're simply too shameless.</p>
              <p>Know that <em>vedana, sañña, sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana</em> are 
              simply individual conditions displayed by the mind. They appear and 
              vanish. <em>'Sañña anatta' — </em> see? They too are not-self, so how can 
              you hold to them? How can you believe them to be you, to be yours, to be
               true? Keep track of them so that you can know them clearly with 
              mindfulness and discernment: audacious, undaunted, diamond-hearted, 
              decisive in the face of defilement and pain of every sort.</p>
              <p><em>Sankharas,</em> mental formations: They form — blip, blip, blip — 
              in the heart. The heart ripples for a moment: blip, blip, blip. The 
              moment they arise, they vanish. So what substance or truth can you find 
              in these <em>saññas</em> and <em>sankharas</em>?</p>
              <p><em>Viññana,</em> cognizance: As soon as anything comes into contact, 
              this takes note and vanishes, takes note and vanishes. So ultimately, 
              the <em>khandhas</em> are full of nothing but appearing and vanishing. 
              There's nothing lasting about them that can give us any real sustenance 
              or nourishment. There's not even the least bit of substance to them. So 
              use your discernment to investigate until you see clearly in this way, 
              and you will come to see the real Dhamma taught by the Buddha, which has
               not been otherwise from time immemorial and by the same token will 
              never be otherwise at all.</p>
              <p>Once we've investigated to this extent, how can the mind not withdraw
               into stillness until it is plainly apparent? It has to be still. It has
               to stand out. The mind's awareness of itself has to be prominent 
              because it has withdrawn inwardly from having seen the truth of these 
              things. <em>The mind has to be prominent.</em> Pain, no matter how 
              horribly severe, will dissolve away through investigation, through the 
              mind's having clearly seen its truth. Or if it doesn't go away, then the
               pain and the mind will each have their own separate reality. The heart 
              will be inwardly majestic. Undaunted. Unfearing.</p>
              <p>When the time comes for death, let it happen. There is no more fear, 
              because death is entirely a matter of <em>rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana.</em> It's not a matter of the 'knower' — the heart — 
              breaking apart. It's not the knower — the heart — that dies. Only those 
              other things die. The mind's labels and assumptions have simply fooled 
              it into fear. If we can catch sight of the fact that these labels and 
              assumptions are illusions and not worthy of credence, the mind will 
              withdraw inwardly, no longer believing them, but believing the truth 
              instead, believing the discernment that has investigated things 
              thoroughly.</p>
              <p>Now, when the mind has investigated time and again, ceaselessly, 
              relentlessly, it will develop expertise in the affairs of the <em>khandhas.</em> The physical <em>khandha</em> will be the first to be relinquished 
              through discernment. In the beginning stage of the investigation, 
              discernment will see through the physical <em>khandha</em> before seeing 
              through the others and will be able to let it go. From there, the mind 
              will gradually be able to let go of <em>vedana, sañña, sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana</em> at the same time.</p>
              <p>To put the matter simply, once discernment sees through them, it lets
               go. If it has yet to see through them, it holds on. Once we see through
               them with discernment, we let them go — let them go completely — 
              because we see that they are simply ripplings in the mind — blip, blip, 
              blip — without any substance at all. A good thought appears and 
              vanishes. A bad thought appears and vanishes. Whatever kind of thought 
              appears, it's simply a formation and as such it vanishes. If a hundred 
              formations appear, all hundred of them vanish. There is no permanence to
               them substantial enough for us to trust.</p>
              <p>So then. What is it that keeps supplying us with these things or 
              keeps forcing them out on us? What is it that keeps forcing this thing 
              and that out to fool us? This is where we come to what the Buddha calls 
              the <em>pabhassara-citta:</em> the original, radiant mind. 'But monks, 
              because of the admixture of defilement,' or 'because of the defilements 
              that come passing through' — from sights, sound, smells, tastes, tactile
               sensations; from <em>rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana,</em> that our labels and assumptions haul in to burn us — 'the mind becomes 
              defiled.' It's defiled with just these very things.</p>
              <p>Thus investigation is for the sake of removing these things so as to 
              reveal the mind through clear discernment. We can then see that as long 
              as the mind is at the stage where it hasn't ventured out to become 
              engaged in any object — inasmuch as its instruments, the senses, are 
              still weak and undeveloped — it is quiet and radiant, as in the saying, 
              'The original mind is the radiant mind.' <em>But this is the original 
              mind of the round of rebirth — </em> for example, the mind of a newborn 
              child whose activities are still too undeveloped to take any objects on 
              fully. <em>It's not the original mind freed from the cycle and fully 
              pure.</em></p>
              <p>So while we investigate around us stage by stage, the symptoms of 
              defilement that used to run all over the place will be gathered into 
              this single point, becoming a radiance within the mind. And this 
              radiance: Even the tools of super-mindfulness and super-discernment will
               have to fall for it when they first meet with it, because it's 
              something we have never seen before, never met before, from the 
              beginning of our practice or from the day of our birth. We thus become 
              awed and amazed. It seems for the moment that nothing can compare to it 
              in magnificence.</p>
              <p>And why shouldn't it be magnificent? It has been the king of the 
              round of rebirth in all three worlds — the world of sensuality, the 
              world of form, and the world of formlessness — since way back when, for 
              countless aeons. It's the one who has wielded power over the mind and 
              ruled the mind all along. As long as the mind doesn't possess the 
              mindfulness and discernment to pull itself out from under this power, 
              how can it not be magnificent? This is why it has been able to drive the
               mind into experiencing birth on various levels without limit, in 
              dependence on the fruits of the different actions it has performed under
               the orders of the ephemeral defilements. The fact that living beings 
              wander and stray, taking birth and dying unceasingly, is because this 
              nature leads them to do so.</p>
              <p>This being the case, we have to investigate it so as to see it 
              plainly. Actually, radiance and defilement are two sides of the same 
              coin because they are both conventional realities. The radiance that 
              comes from the convergence of the various defilements will form a point,
               a center, so that we can clearly perceive that 'This is the center of 
              the radiance.' <em>When any defilement appears,</em> in correspondence 
              with that state or level of the mind, <em>a very refined stress will 
              arise in the center we call radiant.</em> Thus radiance, defilement, and 
              stress — all three — are companions. They go together.</p>
              <p>For this reason, the mind possessing this radiance must worry over 
              it, guard it, protect it, maintain it, for fear that something may come 
              to disturb it, jar it, obscure its radiance. Even the most refined 
              adulteration is still an affair of defilement, about which we as 
              meditators should not be complacent. We must investigate it with 
              unflagging discernment.</p>
              <p>In order to cut through the burden of your concerns once and for all,
               you should ask yourself, 'What is this radiance?' Fix your attention on
               it until you know. There's no need to fear that once this radiance is 
              destroyed, the 'real you' will be destroyed along with it. Focus your 
              investigation right at that center to see clearly that this radiance has
               the characteristics of inconstancy, stress, and not-self just like all 
              the other phenomena you have already examined. It's not different in any
               way, aside from the difference in its subtlety.</p>
              <p>Thus nothing should be taken for granted. If anything has the nature 
              of conventional reality, let discernment slash away at it. Focus right 
              down on the mind itself. All the really counterfeit things lie in the 
              mind. <em>This radiance is the ultimate counterfeit</em> and at that 
              moment it's the most conspicuous point. You hardly want to touch it at 
              all, because you love it and cherish it more than anything else. In the 
              entire body there is nothing more outstanding than this radiance, which 
              is why you are amazed at it, love it, cherish it, dawdle over it, want 
              nothing to touch it. <em>But it's the enemy king: unawareness.</em></p>
              <p>Have you ever seen it? If you haven't, then when you reach this stage
               in your practice you'll fall for it of your own accord. And then you'll
               know it of your own accord — no one will have to tell you — when 
              mindfulness and discernment are ready. It's called <em>avijja — </em> unawareness. Right here is the true unawareness. Nothing else is true 
              unawareness. Don't go imagining <em>avijja</em> as a tiger, a leopard, a 
              demon, or a beast. Actually, it's the most beautiful, most alluring Miss
               Universe the world has ever seen. Genuine unawareness is very different
               from what we expect it to be.</p>
              <p>When we reach genuine unawareness, we don't know what unawareness is 
              and so we get stuck right there. If there's no one to advise us, no one 
              to suggest an approach, we are sure to stay stuck there a long time 
              before we can understand and work ourselves free. But if there is 
              someone to suggest an approach, we can begin to understand it and strike
               right at that center, without trusting it, by investigating it in the 
              same way we have dealt with all other phenomena.</p>
              <p>Once we've investigated it with sharp discernment until we know it 
              clearly, this phenomenon will dissolve away in a completely unexpected 
              way. At the same time, you could call it Awakening, or closing down the 
              cemeteries of the round of rebirth, the round of the mind, under the 
              shade of the Bodhi tree. <em>Once this phenomenon has dissolved away, 
              something even more amazing that has been concealed by unawareness will 
              be revealed in all its fullness.</em></p>
              <p>This is what is said to be like the quaking of the cosmos within the 
              heart. <em>This is a very crucial mental moment: when the heart breaks 
              away from conventions.</em> This moment, when release and conventional 
              reality break away from each other, is more awesome than can be 
              expressed. The phrase, 'the path of arahantship giving way to the 
              fruition of arahantship' refers to precisely this mental moment, the 
              moment in which unawareness vanishes. As we are taught, when the path is
               fully developed, it steps onward to the fruition of arahantship, which 
              is the Dhamma — the mind — at its most complete. From that moment on, 
              there are no more problems.</p>
              <p>The phrase, 'the one <em>nibbana,'</em> <a id="t-1" class="noteTag " name="t-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/boowa/straight.html#n-1">1</a> is fully realized in this heart in the moment 
              unawareness is dissolving. We are taught that this is the moment when 
              the path and the fruition — which are a pair — come together and meet. 
              If we were to make a comparison with climbing the stairs to a house, one
               foot is on the last step, the other foot is on the floor of the house. 
              We haven't yet reached the house with both feet. When both feet are on 
              the floor of the house, we've 'reached the house.' As for the mind, it 
              is said to reach the Dhamma or to attain the ultimate Dhamma, and from 
              the moment of attainment it's called 'the one <em>nibbana.'</em></p>
              <p>In other words, the mind is completely free. It displays no further 
              activity for the removal of defilement. This is called the one <em>nibbana.</em> If you want, you can call it the fruition of arahantship, for at this 
              stage there are no more defilements to quibble. Or you can call it the 
              one <em>nibbana.</em> But if you want to give it the conventional label 
              most appropriate to the actual principle, so that nothing is deficient 
              in conventional terms, you have to say 'the one <em>nibbana</em>' so as to
               be completely fitting with conventional reality and release in the 
              final phase of wiping out the cemeteries of the mind of unawareness.</p>
              <p>The Buddha taught,</p>
              <strong>n'atthi santi param sukham:</strong><br> <em>There is no ease other than peace.</em>
              <p>This refers to the stage of those who have no more defilements, who 
              have attained <em>sa-upadisesa-nibbana</em> alive, such as the arahants.</p>
              <p>To practice the religion means to attend to your own heart and mind. 
              Who is it that suffers pain and difficulty? Who is the suspect, forever 
              imprisoned? Who else, if not the mind? And who has it imprisoned, if not
               all the defilements and mental effluents? To deal with the situation, 
              you have to deal directly with the enemies of the heart, using your 
              discernment, for only sharp discernment is capable of dealing with the 
              defilements until they dissolve away of their own accord, as I have 
              already mentioned. From that point on, there are no more problems.</p>
              <p>As for <em>rupa, vedana, sañña, sankhara,</em> and <em>viññana,</em> they're simply conditions — just conditions — <em>no longer capable of 
              affecting or provoking the mind.</em> The same with sights, sounds, 
              smells, tastes, and tactile sensations: Each has its separate reality. 
              To each one we say, 'If it exists, it exists. If not, no matter.' The 
              only problem has been the mind that makes labels and assumptions through
               its own stupidity. Once it gains enough intelligence, it becomes real. 
              All phenomena within and without are real. Each has its own separate 
              reality, with no more of the conflicts or issues that used to occur.</p>
              <p>When we reach the stage where 'each has its own separate reality,' we
               can say that the war between the mind and defilement is over. When the 
              time comes to part, we part. If not, we live together, like everyone 
              else in the world, but we don't take issue with each other like everyone
               else in the world, because we've made our investigation.</p>
              <p>If the words 'inconstancy, stress, and not-self' don't refer to the <em>khandhas</em> for which we are responsible, what do they refer to? So now we have 
              completed our studies — our study of the three characteristics <em>(tilakkhana),</em> rather than of the three divisions <em>(tipitaka)</em> of the Pali canon,
               although actually the three divisions are nothing other than the three 
              characteristics, in that the three divisions are a description of the 
              three characteristics throughout.</p>
              <p>Inconstancy: the process of change. Stress. Not-self: The <em>khandhas</em> are not us — not us while we are living, so when we die what is there 
              to latch onto? When you see the truth in this way, you don't worry or 
              feel apprehensive over the life or death of the <em>khandhas.</em> The 
              mind simply perceives the modes in which the <em>khandhas</em> behave and 
              break apart, but by its nature it doesn't disband along with the <em>khandhas,</em> so there's nothing to fear. If death comes, you don't try to prevent 
              it. It life continues, you don't try to prevent it, for each is a truth.</p>
              <p>In completing your study of death, you become the ultimate person — 
              the ultimate you. When you have completed your study of death, you don't
               fear death — 'If life continues, let it continue; if death comes, let 
              it die' — for you have spread a net around yourself with your 
              discernment. You don't tremble over the truths of which the heart is 
              fully aware at all times.</p>
              <p>So. That's enough for now. As it happens, we're at the end of the 
              tape...</p>
