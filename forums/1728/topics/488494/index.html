              Penny Satori attempts to explain the inexplicable</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Palliative and intensive care units at hospitals have a
              close relationship with death, giving rise to many experiences that defy any
              rational explanation. Patients who foresee the exact time when they will die;
              others who seem to decide for themselves the day and the hour, moving their
              death forward or delaying it; family members' prophetic dreams or presentiments
              on the part of third parties who, without even knowing that someone has been
              brought to the hospital or has suffered an accident, are certain that he has
              died.<br> <br> Only healthcare professionals who work closely with terminally ill patients
              know first-hand the extent and variety of these strange experiences. Science
              has not been able to offer any kind of answer, and so these experiences are
              usually described as paranormal or supernatural. This label is "too vague
              for the significance of these experiences," explains the British nurse
              Penny Sartori, who has worked for nearly 20 years in ICU.<br> <br> Such a career is sufficiently solid for her to have seen everything, recognize
              patterns and come up with a hypothesis regarding these phenomena. So much so,
              that she has a doctorate on these questions, whose principle conclusions were
              published in the book<span><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></span><em><span style="color: #333333;">The Wisdom of Near-Death Experiences</span></em><span><em><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></em></span>(Watkins
              Publishing).<br>  <br> <strong><span style="color: #333333;">"Visions"
              shared with family members</span></strong><br> <br> Throughout her career, Sartori has interviewed patients who have had near-death
              experiences (NDE), as well as family members who have had shared death
              experiences (SDE). The number of these experiences and the repetition of
              patterns make her discard the hypothesis of chance, or of it being impossible
              to find a logical reason for this widespread phenomenon.<br> <br> Her main thesis is centered on the idea that "our brains are separate from
              our consciousness. In other words, the brain may be channeling what some people
              call the soul, rather than responsible for creating it." This idea would
              explain, she adds, why "the soul and enhanced consciousness can be
              experienced separately from the body," as in NDEs or in Buddhist
              meditation. The examples that Sartori uses in her book are numerous, but they
              all tend to coincide in that the patients who have these NDEs are always those
              who end up embracing death most peacefully and happily, as do family members
              who have a premonition of the death of their loved ones. Why? According to
              interviews with these family members, it is because they are convinced that
              death is only the end of their earthly life.<br> <br> Independent of whether they are believers, agnostics, or atheists, all of them
              have a dream or a vision about how their family member leaves this world guided
              by someone — spouses who have already died, anonymous beings or angels
              — and with a clear sensation of "peace and love." At first,
              Sartori says, "it struck me as odd that some family members of the
              deceased didn't feel sad after foretelling the death of their love one, but
              when I interviewed them I realized that they were peaceful because they had
              experienced this sensation of life's transcendence."<br> <br> <strong><span style="color: #333333;">Choosing
              the "most appropriate" moment to die</span></strong><br> <br> This is the case of the people who, knowing when they will die, ask to be alone
              for a few minutes, or die exactly when a family member, who stays at their side
              constantly, leaves them for just a moment to go to the bathroom. Other equally
              noteworthy cases are those of people who die just after seeing a family member
              who has been delayed in arriving to see them because he or she was out of the
              country, or when all of the paperwork for inheritances and life insurance is
              finished. "They appear to be waiting for a specific event to take place
              before they can permit themselves to die," the nurse says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>John Lerma, director of the Tucson Medical Center and
              specialist in palliative care, has gathered examples very similar to those
              cited by Sartori, in Into the Light: Real Life Stories about Angelic
              Visits, Visions of the Afterlife, and Other Pre-Death Experiences (New
              Page Books). According to his reports, "70 to 80 per cent of his patients
              waited for their loved ones to leave the room before dying."<br> <br> <span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Sartori refuses to believe that these
              experiences are based on hallucinations. "It's not possible for several
              people to see the same thing and to be capable of describing it exactly the
              same way if it's really just a distorted perception of reality," she
              points out. Some theses are based on the famous theories of Prof. Raymond
              Moody, who coined the concept of near-death experiences at the end of the
              1970's.</span><br> <br> <span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">Her most novel studies center on experiences
              shared by people who accompany those who are dying. "They open an entirely
              new path of rational enlightenment regarding the question of life after death,
              because the people who talk about these experiences are healthy. They are
              usually seated next to the death bed of a loved one when they are overcome by
              one of these marvelous and mysterious experiences. And the very fact that these
              people are not near death rules out the usual explanations. Since their
              experiences cannot be attributed to brain chemistry disorders, we will have to
              go beyond this argument," she assures.</span><br> <br> <strong>New Paths of Investigation<br> </strong><br> <span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">The way some people try to explain this
              phenomenon based on brain dysfunction, which Sartori calls "cynical,"
              doesn't hold up with the examples of people who enter the hospital with
              late-stage Alzheimer's disease who suddenly become coherent.</span><br> <br> <span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">"These are terminally ill patients who are
              incapable of articulating a single word, who surprisingly begin to talk
              completely coherently, interacting with people who are not in the room and who
              are often deceased family members," the author explains. Besides, she
              adds, "it often happens that after this experience they stop being
              agitated and end up dying with a smile on their face, usually one or two days
              later."</span><br> <br> <span style="background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;">The argument that these visions are drug-induced
              isn't accepted by the author either because, she says, hallucinations due to
              medication "cause anxiety, the exact opposite of what these patients feel.
              “In her book, the author defends the idea that these kinds of experiences can
              be key for demonstrating the existence of life after death and that they should
              at least open a new direction of research (like some that are based on quantum
              physics) for scientific studies. She is definitely convinced that
              "death is not as fearful as we imagine."</span></span></p>
