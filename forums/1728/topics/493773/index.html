              Sakya Trizin, His Holiness Ratna Vajra Rinpoche</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Anne Wisman Buddhistdoor
              Global | 2017-04-05 | </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 13pt; text-align: justify;">On
              the 9 March, the 42nd Sakya Trizin was enthroned at the Sakya monastery Magon
              Thubten Namgyal Ling in India. His Holiness Ratna Vajra Rinpoche is the oldest
              son of the His Holiness the 41st Sakya Trizin, and the first Sakya Trizin to be
              enthroned under the new succession system announced in May 2014. The
              enthronement ceremony was streamed live via Facebook.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">The
              Sakya Trizin is the head of the Sakya School of Tibetan Buddhism, which was
              founded in 1073 by Khön Konchok Gyalpo, a member of the Tibetan noble family
              Khön, who established a monastery in the region of Sakya (present-day Shigatse
              Prefecture), Tibet. Leadership of the school has always remained in the Khön
              family, who are said to descend from Gods of the Realm of Clear Light that
              entered the human realm. Today, the Sakya School is one of four major schools
              of Tibetan Buddhism.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Traditionally,
              the office of Sakya Trizin or “Sakya Throne-holder” is held for life.
              Succession usually occurs after the death of the previous Sakya Trizin, and
              candidates for succession are drawn from the Khön family line. In 2014,
              however, a new system, proposed by the former Sakya Trizin and agreed upon by
              both the Phodrangs—the two palaces of the Sakya school; Dolma Phodrang and
              Phuntsok Phodrang—was adopted, with the agreement of His Holiness the 14th
              Dalai Lama. In its revised form, the tenure of the Sakya Trizin lasts only
              three years, with the possibility that an office holder may take office more
              than once in his lifetime. Qualifications for the position include: “the
              complete fulfillment of studies of all the basic courses of Rites and Rituals
              of the Sakya; studies in all the major philosophies; having received
              empowerments, reading transmissions, and pith instructions; having studies the
              teachings of the ancestral Dharma teachings of Lamdre Ts’ogshey and Lamdre
              Lobshey, along with other important teachings and empowerments; and having
              accomplished the basic recitation retreat on Hevajra and other important
              tutelary deities.” (Official website of His Holiness the Sakya Trizin)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">Candidates
              for the position continue to be drawn from Khön family descendants, and future
              office holders are already in training. “The new system is based on the one
              used by the abbots of Ngor Monastery, which is a part of the Sakya school. The
              great master Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö [1893–1959] once suggested that the
              Sakya Trizins should follow Ngor’s approach, and now they will do that.” said
              Lama Migmar Tseten, Buddhist chaplain at Harvard University and founder of the
              Sakya Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a 2015 interview. (Lion’s Roar)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">His
              Holiness Ratna Vajra Rinpoche is the first to be enthroned under this new
              system, having met all the aforementioned requirements. Born on 19 November
              1974, the 42-year-old Sakya Trizin is the 42nd in an unbroken lineage dating
              back to 1073. His Holiness has been educated in the Sakya school since birth by
              his father, the His Holiness the 41st Sakya Trizin, and many other lineage
              masters. In 1998, he completed a kachupa degree (equivalent to a bachelor's
              degree in Buddhist philosophy), which he studied under Khenpo Ngawang Lekshey
              Kunga Rinpoche (also known as Khenpo Migmar Tsering, 1955–99). In addition, he
              has studied various esoteric and exoteric traditions and is, at present,
              considered one of most qualified masters in the Sakya school. In 2002, His
              Holiness Ratna Vajra Rinpoche married Her Eminence Dagmo Kalden Dunkyi,
              selected via the age-old Sakya tradition of holy divination. They have two
              daughters and a son.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13pt;">His
              father, the previous Sakya Trizin, Ngawang Kunga Tegchen Palbar Trinley Samphel
              Wangyi Gyalpo, born in 1945 in Tsedong, near Shigatse Prefecture, will continue
              to provide guidance to his son in the years to come.</span></p>
