I did it because even though Christianity doesn't conform to my way of thinking and I couldn't mould myself to become a devoted Christian with unquestionable faith and belief. I cannot make myself say one thing, but think and do something else. For example, I believe that Jesus Christ sacrificed his life to save many people, possibly including you and me from our sins and I honour and respect him for His noble deeds. But I can't say that I believe I am truly saved from my sins by his selfless deed. I refuse to be a hypocrite and liar to God (if He exists) and myself.<br><br><blockquote>You may want to join some buddhist youth group to enlarge your network, and sincerely hope you will find a buddhist boyfriend soon, who will also be your spiritual friend towards enlightenment path.</blockquote>I was keen to join the Bright Hill Temple group after helping out at one of the tsunami aid events as I was impressed by the positive aura of the people there.

You may want to join the buddhist fellowship at paya lebar, it is quite centralized and more towards east.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello all,<br><br>I happen to understand why some Christians cannot tolerate having a spouse of another faith.<br><br>To start off, the Bible actually says so (II Corinthians 6:14-15). Furthermore, Christians are supposed to love Jesus and God over and above your own family. Jesus underscored the importance of this commitment when he said:" If any man come unto me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brother, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he can not be my disciple." God himself also tested Abraham by commanding him to sacrifice his own son as a show of loyalty to God over his own family.<br><br>It becomes clear that to a Christian, his life is not his own but rather God's, and his priority and commitment will not be to his family first, but to God and the church. Speaking for myself, I am very committed to my wife and two kids. They will always rank number one in my heart (now I am also a Buddhist, but Buddhism does not require me to make a choice between my family and the dharma), and I expect the same level of commitment from my wife. A Christian spouse obviously cannot give me that kind of loyalty and commitment.  Conversely, I cannot give a Christian spouse that same level of loyalty and commitment she demanded of me to God. This is the thing that often causes inter-faith relationship to fail.<br><br>In practical terms, a non-Christian spouse will also not understand when they need to dock a significant portion of their family income in order to tithe, and over the long term, this kind of thing can and do cause family friction.<br><br>So, surfbabe, it is actually a blessing in disguise that you break up with your boyfriend now, rather than having this problem exploding into your face ten years (and three kids!) later. My advice is to look for a b/f who share the same metaphysical outlook as you, or at least, do not think that religious matters should get in the way of relationships.<br><br>(Nb: It is not my intention to disparage Christian values in my post. Christians value different things, and I respect that.)<br></div>
