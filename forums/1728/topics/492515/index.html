              or musical accolade, which began the practice of presenting philosophical
              notions through music, and is continued till date by our Bauls.  Written
              by 'AtiÅ›a', meaning 'preeminent', which is the honorific title of the great
              Buddhist saint, Dipankara Srijnana, of 10th century Bengal, this song is part
              of a bulk of Buddhist literature, known as 'charya-giti'. AtiÅ›a himself states
              in 'Carya-giti-vritti', 'Pure philosophy (samyak siddhanta) is explained here
              in a two-fold way.  It is a 'vajra-giti' in form and in it is primarily
              shown 'nirodha-satya' (the cessation of suffering)'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Preserving history,
              specially the history of thought and philosophy, is a vital task, as it is
              through this account of the past that a nation understands it's present
              identity and is able to preserve it responsibly.  Today, it has become
              imperative for Bangladesh to look back and comprehend the many facets of
              history that has made us who we are.  I would like to begin this sojourn,
              into history, with an account of, probably one of the most influential sons of
              this soil, Buddhist Mahasiddha AtiÅ›a Dipankara Srijnana, from 10th century
              Bengal, whose indelible message of compassion still resounds all over the
              world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>From the abounding
              hagiographies of AtiÅ›a we learn that he was born into an affluent Hindu
              household in Vikrampura (present Bangladesh) and named Chandragarbha.
               However, following the footsteps of his spiritual mentor, the
              'Enlightened' Gautama Buddha, he abandoned hearth and home to become an ascetic
              and begin a quest for knowledge that led him to far away shores.  Having
              reached the pinnacle of scholarship and enlightenment, AtiÅ›a's fame spread so
              far and wide, that a learned Tibetan king invited him to spread the word of
              Sakyamuni in the 'Land of Snow'.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>On his way to Tibet,
              AtiÅ›a, spent a year in the Kathmandu Valley.  Much of this detailed
              information is based on the 'Itinerary of Atisha's Travels', authored by
              Dromton, the chief disciple of the Buddhist master AtiÅ›a and the initiator of
              the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism.  From this we learn about AtiÅ›a's
              role in the foundation of the Bikramshila Vihar of Tam Bahil in what is now the
              quarter of Kathmandu town known as Thamel.  It is at this time that AtiÅ›a
              composed the 'Charyasamgrahapradipa' that contains some kirtan verses.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Although Buddhism had
              been introduced into Tibet some two hundred years earlier by Padmasambhava and
              Shantarakshita, Buddhist practice in the country had largely been destroyed
              during the anti-Buddhist purges of the Tibetan king, Lang Darma (circa 836 AD),
              a follower of Bön, the pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Invited in 1042 by
              Jangchub Ö, a ruler of Ngari in western Tibet, AtiÅ›a was asked to present a
              Dharma that everybody could follow and that would show how all the paths of
              Sutra and Tantra could be practiced together.At Ngari, he was very impressed
              with the king's request for "a teaching of the people. Had he been asked
              for advanced empowerments into tantric deity systems, AtiÅ›a would have been far
              less pleased".In response, AtiÅ›awrote 'Bodhi-patha-pradipa' or 'Lamp for
              the Path', the original Lamrintext that served as the basis for the revival of
              pure Buddhist practice in Tibet.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style='font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: "Times New Roman","serif";'>Lamrim is a special set
              of instructions that includes all the essential teachings of Buddha arranged in
              such a way that all his Hinayana and Mahayana teachings can be put into
              practice in a single meditation session. The stages of the path to
              enlightenment, or Lamrim in Tibetan, is the backbone of Kadampa Buddhism, which
              inspires all to be compassionate towards fellow humans.'I shall take no delight
              in attaining enlightenment</span></p>

              last nine years of his life at the Buddhist Monastery of Nyethang, near Lhasa,
              nested between ethereal and verdant hills besides the Lhasa River, under an
              azure sky - almost a bit of heaven on earth.  In Tibet it is, endearingly,
              said that the Master chose this place because of its proximity to River Lhasa,
              which reminded him of the land of his birth.</span></p>
