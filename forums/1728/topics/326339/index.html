              <p><strong>I KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW: THE CONTEMPLATION OF DEATH</strong></p>
              <p>A Talk given by Ajahn Brahmavamso to the monks at Bodhinyana Monastery on 20th December 2000.</p>
              <p><strong>Sabbe sattÄ� maranti ca marimsu ca marissare,Tath'evÄ�ham marissÄ�mi, n'atthi me ettha samsayo.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of you will recall that gatha, which I chanted in PÄ�li at the beginning of this talk. It means, 'All beings will die, they are of the nature to die, and I too will also die, of that I have no doubt'. It's one of those beautiful chants which we have in Buddhism. It relates to the fact that every one of us will die. I will use this contemplation of death for today's Dhamma talk.</p>
              <p><br>In particular, this afternoon, I was thinking about the block of land, which we are purchasing opposite our monastery. I thought what a wonderful thing it would be if we could use some of that land as a Buddhist crematorium. The monks can go there in the evening and just contemplate death, next to, or even inside, the crematorium. Contemplation of death is part of our tradition.</p>
              <p><br><strong>The Illusion of Life<br></strong>I told the lay people, who are soon going to accompany me to India and then to the North East of Thailand, to Wat Pah Nanachat, the monastery where I spent so many years, that if they are lucky, there's a good chance that they might see a Buddhist funeral. There the body of the person who has died is not sanitised by embalmers. It's just put into a very simple coffin so that everyone can go and look at, and even touch, the person who has died. It is then burnt out in the open. The very cheap wood of the coffin quickly burns away to reveal the body. The body burns away part by part, bit by bit, and you can see the members of the body come apart from each other. You can see the skull pop and explode, and all the other parts of the body eventually just being burnt away. After many hours, all that's left are the bones. To be able to see death in the raw is a marvellous privilege in ones life. By sanitising death we are preserving the illusion of life.</p>
              <p>The illusion is that life will go on forever. The whole purpose of life is just the seeking of pleasures and amusements, and the accumulation of wealth. In the perspective of death, all of those foolish things, which we do in life, appear so obviously stupid. We see them as things that are completely worthless.</p>
              <p><br>We heard recently of a couple of monks who disrobed. If only they could have gone to a funeral, and been able to watch a body being burnt, they might have been able to see themselves in those flames. That will surely happen to them one day. All of the searching: for sensory pleasures, for having relationships, getting married, having houses, accumulating wealth and cars, having experiences, going up the Amazon, or trekking in the Himalayas; what does all that mean in the face of death?</p>
              <p><strong>Asoka's Brother</strong><br>One of my favourite anecdotes on death is the story of Asoka's brother.[1] Asoka was the Indian Emperor who became a Buddhist. Asoka had a brother, named V´tasoka, who seemed completely unspiritual, and was into sensory pleasures. Being the brother of the Emperor afforded him many opportunities to indulge in them. In order to lead his brother into understanding the Dhamma, Asoka set a trap for him.<br>As I re-tell the story, with some literary licence, the Emperor was in his bath while his robes and insignia were laid outside. Asoka had arranged for some of his close advisers to be walking with his brother and, as if by accident, to come through the bath house. Pointing out the Emperors robes just lying on the bench, the advisers said to Asoka's brother, 'Why not try these on for size? Who knows? One day when your brother dies, you will probably be Emperor. Try them on. Go on, it will be alright'. At first the brother would not do it. He knew that it was illegal to do so. But in the end his pride got the better of him. Who wouldn't like to dress up in the Emperor's clothes? It was all pre-planned, and so as soon as he was dressed in the Emperor's clothes, the Emperor Asoka came out of the bathhouse and caught him!</p>
              <p><br>The Emperor asked: 'What are you doing? Are you usurping the throne? Are you a traitor?' Because this was a crime, the Emperor said, 'Even though you are my brother, I have to administer the law impartially. The penalty for this is death.'<br>Despite his own brother's desperate pleas for mercy, the Emperor insisted on maintaining the law and having his unfortunate brother killed. However, he added, 'Seeing you are my brother, and you would like to be Emperor so much, for the next seven days you can enjoy all the pleasures of an Emperor. But you will have none of the responsibilities. You can enjoy my harem. You can have whatever you want to eat. And whatever entertainment I enjoy, you can enjoy as well. The pleasures of the Emperor are yours for seven days. But after seven days, you will be executed'. Then the Emperor left.</p>
              <p><br>After seven days, the Emperor Asoka summoned his brother to the place of execution. The Emperor asked him, 'Did you enjoy the harem, all those beautiful girls? Did you enjoy the best food from my kitchens? Did you enjoy my musicians and other entertainers?' The brother looked down at the ground, his shoulders drooping and said, 'Could I enjoy all that? I couldn't even enjoy one night's sleep. How can you enjoy anything when you know that you are soon to be executed?'<br>The Emperor smiled and said, 'Now you may understand!'</p>
              <p><br>Whether its seven days, seven months, seven years or seventy years, how can you enjoy the pleasures of the senses, such as: sex, sport, movies, travelling or accumulating possessions? How can you enjoy all that when you know that you are going to be executed? Whether it's seven days, seven months, seven years or seventy years, soon you are all going to be dead.</p>
              <p><br>Through this experience, the brother learnt much of the Dhamma. He became a devout Buddhist from that time on and kept the precepts. His insight into the meaning of death made very clear that which is important in life.</p>

              <p>Very poignant! Thanks for posting this Isis, but I have one nagging concern. Throughout the majority of most peoples lives, they work so hard and spent so much time in the pursuit of knowledge that enhances the material comforts of life. Ultimately, the sum total of all knowledges acquired by doctors, accountants, engineers, architects, scientist etc. etc. serve nothing but to enhance the sensory pleasure and material comforts of this "life". If "life" is so short and transient, why are we spending so much time in the pursuit of non-spiritual knowledge?</p>
              <p>If I use the analogy of Asoka's brother, if I am put into the shoes of the brother, I defintely wont be able to enjoy the comforts of being an emperor, but by the same token, I wont be able to acquire any skills and knowledge (non-spiritual ones) either?   </p>

              <p><br>I think that doctors, acountants... scientists etc, also do serve other important tasks ( eg savings lives, reducing sufferings, improving the environment, protect the country, nation building...) in our short n transient lives. It is when we use the technologies n knowleges to<em> overly</em> indulge in our sensory pleasures or to <em>solely </em>pursue the materialistic gains( for further indulgence) for no ends that they become meaningless in this short and valuable human life time.    </p>
              <p>I think for eg , being a accountant, u may have higher disposal income which u could provide better for your family, and possible could treat your relatives, then friends better too; and if possible, spread out to help strangers in the society through donations etc. Oh, your income tax also serve the country in nation building.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png">  I guess all these can be seen as a form of paramita of giving, then by the logic of cause n effect, you could enhance your current life ( able to give is happiness) as well as next life.  </p>

              <p>I agree with you. In fact, all these worldly pleasure is nothing compare to the pleasure in heaven. Then the pleasure in heaven is also nothing compare to the "pleasure" of enlightenment.</p>

              <p><strong>Continuing ....</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I Know, but I Don't Know</strong><br>The Buddha wanted his monks to contemplate their death in the same way. It is as if you are all going to be executed! Life is a death sentence! We are all on death row in this monastery, but we don't know how the execution is going to take place, and we don't know exactly when. A weaver's daughter once responded to a series of questions from the Buddha, by answering, 'I know, but I don't know'. The Buddha smiled and acknowledged her wisdom. Someone asked her afterwards, 'What do you mean by you know, but you don't know?', and she replied that she knew that she would die, but didn't know when she would die (Dhp-a, XIII. 7).</p>
              <p><br>Insight into death rearranges your priorities. So what is important for you? You are soon going to die, and after your death you are going to be carrying the kamma of this life into your future lives.</p>
              <p>Any person who doesn't believe in rebirth is going to get a great shock when it happens. It's true. Reincarnation is real. You will soon experience this for yourselves! Embracing the reality of your death and subsequent rebirth gives you a different perspective on how to live your life.</p>
              <p><br>As monks, we have the ten reflections for one who has gone forth. The tenth is a reflection on our deathbed. (An X, 48)[2] It is traditional to ask a monk on his deathbed, 'What states of JhÄ�nas have you achieved? What stages of liberation, or Enlightenment have you reached?'</p>
              <p><br>Good monks do not tell even their friends about such attainments, unless they are close to death. That's why it is an old tradition to ask monks that question only on their deathbeds. I encourage you to do the same. Ask your fellow monks when they are near death, 'What have you achieved? What have you realized?' Such questioning brings back a sense of urgency to what we are doing in this monastery. We don't want to live for years and years in this or other monasteries, going from place to place in the Buddhist monastic world, and then find at the end of our life that we are no further along the Path to Liberation than when we started. We don't want to find that we haven't made proper use of this wonderful opportunity to experience a JhÄ�na, or to at least achieve Stream Winning. I say this because if you don't realize these things in your life as a monk, after death who knows what might happen?</p>
              <p><br><strong>Throwing Up a Stick</strong><br>In one of the stories from the suttas, the Buddha said that your future rebirth is so very uncertain. It's like throwing a stick into the air. You can't be sure which end it is going to fall on. In the same way, you can't be certain after death if you will fall into the fortunate realms or the unfortunate realms! (Sn 15. 9)</p>
              <p><br>That impressed me. But it also scared me, when I first read it. We all think that if we make lots and lots of good kamma then we are certain of a happy rebirth. And you do make good kamma, because you are all good monks. You keep the precepts very well. The novices are good, they are great novices. Even the visitors who come here are all very high minded. They are pure minded beings for the most part. As beings in the world go, you are the cream. However, even if you live a very good life, even if you are a monk for many years in this life, if you don't penetrate to Stream Winning then you can't be certain what rebirth is going to follow!</p>
              <p><br>All that you can achieve by making lots of good kamma is to make one end of the 'stick' heavier. Then the chances are it will fall on the heavy end, and your good kamma will ripen into a beautiful rebirth. But the sutta very clearly says that even though one end is heavy, every now and again that stick will land on the lighter end. So, even if you make lots of good kamma, the bad kamma that you have performed, either in this life or in previous lives, is still there. Because of that bad kamma, which hasn't been used up yet, there is always the chance of being reborn in a very unfortunate rebirth.</p>
              <p><br>That is the fear of samsÄ�ra. It's not just old age, sickness and death in this life. Its also, old age sickness and death in future lives, in less pleasant lives than the one you are in now. Even though you may be a good monk, a good novice, or a good lay person, it's still uncertain what your rebirth is going to be. This fact makes you put forth more effort on your spiritual path. It makes you more diligent. Where does diligence come from? Where does that effort come from? It only comes when you see how dangerous rebirth is.</p>
              <p><br><strong>Letting Go<br></strong>I gave a talk last night to lay people about the meditation on letting go, of just doing nothing. To be able to do nothing, you have to be able to understand that doing nothing is important. That letting go within the mind is valuable. Just sitting down meditating is a matter of life and death, more important than any other business. Meditation is more important than our finances, our relationships, our children, our vehicles, or our possessions. It is more important even than going out and working for the community. It's more important than everything else because it's the only way to make an end of suffering.</p>
              <p><br>Accumulating wealth, what meaning has that? It all disappears when you die. Indulging in the pleasures of life, even if you manage to get them in great amounts, usually just bring lots of frustrations. If you do get lots and lots of pleasure in this life, so what! It always disappears in the pain and fog of old age. One of the things that you notice in life, as you get older, is that most of the pleasures in life occur early on and the pain of life is what you're mostly left with at the end. Knowing this, seeing the dangers in life, why does anybody get involved in all this wasting of time?</p>
              <p><br>We can go around teaching others, or writing books for others, and spreading the Dhamma, but is that really our duty in this life? So many people are spreading the Dhamma, but so few people are realising the Dhamma. Sometimes you wonder what we are spreading anyway. If you don't realise the Dhamma for yourself, you run the risk of spreading muck around. And people will take up that muck, thinking that it's Dhamma. Sometimes people give teachings on muck, and everyone thinks how Enlightened they are; but it's all muck Dhamma. It's not real Dhamma. They haven't realised the Dhamma for themselves. That's a great shame for this world. We don't really need people spreading Dhamma as much as we need more people realising that Dhamma.</p>

However, most will not have any special feeling and will do nothing if you tell them that they are going to die in 15-20 years time. For example, in the story of Liao Fan 4 lessons; Mr Yuan Liao Fan  knew he could only leave till 53 but yet he did not do anything positive until he met a monk who told him that his fate can be changed by completing 3000 good deeds.</p></div>

              <p>A person is only a digit in an economy. When a person is living, all his activities contribute to the economy of the country. The engine behind an economy is through people' pursuits of profit, wages, interest and rent and in terms for the satisfaction of their material needs and wants.</p>
              <p>People want better housing and hence they work hard and willing to pay high prices for better houses and hence developers and architects build better houses as they are motivated by the higher profits and pays.</p>
              <p>Similarly, people want better health care and hence they work hard and willing to pay high prices for better health care and hence doctors and pharmaceutical firms develop new and better techologies and medications for better health care as they are motivated by the high profits and pays.</p>
              <p>So, though people know that they cannot bring along their material possession when they die, they still have to work hard for money so that they will have money to pay for their medical bills when they fall sick, money to pay for the rent and food. Without money, one can only depend on others' charity.</p>
              <p>So, the morale of the story is that the emperor's brother will not be able to enjoy since he knows that he is going to die seven days later but he still has to work to pay for his living until he dies on the seven days. Without money, the emperor brother may have to die on the first day as he may not have money to pay for his food and medical fee and he will die of hunger and illness.</p>

              <p>The bliss of nirvana is beyond the duality of pleasure and displeasure. (also see footnotes) The bliss of Nirvana is simply Clarity of What Is. All pleasure and displeasure are transient experiences, are not I or mine or have any graspable substance/inherent existence... just the display of luminous-emptiness. But when falsely identified and attached, it causes suffering. When its true nature is discerned in direct experience, it is the bliss of Nirvana.</p>
              <p>With Clarity of What Is, there is no attempt at escaping pain, nor is there grasping/seeking of pleasure. That pain alone is self-liberating, there is no need to escape. Everything is experienced in its utmost clarity -- whether pain or pleasure, everything is experienced as it is... as the display of our true nature, luminous-emptiness. No more trying to escape, and no more seeking.</p>
              <p>But life carries on, spontaneously of itself -- there is no doer or controller... deeds happen, actions arise, but not by a self -- there is no center. Effort continues to arise to help make the world a better place -- but it is seen there is no doer of deeds, and there is no grasping to gain and loss as its true nature is discerned.</p>
              <p>It is realised in awakening that there is only ever the present appearance of life, with no individual/self at its core who could ever escape even if they wanted to. Everything is just the manifestation, happening of Buddha-Nature. Nirvana is just Samsara rightly seen.</p>
              <p>Anyway regarding the topic, my opinion is that effort has to be put whether in gaining worldly and supermundane wisdom, both are important. Just like we put in a lot of effort in gaining our education, certificates and so on... similarly real effort has to be put to gain spiritual insights.</p>
              <p>But whether one is more important than another is not really correctly put, because firstly they are dealing with two important facets of life (i.e. you can't say 'art' and 'mathematics' are better than each other, each has its place) and it also assumes that to gain one, one has to abandon the other. This is not true, and relative truth and ultimate reality are not two.</p>
              <p> As a highly realised and accomplished teacher, Daniel Ingram a.k.a Dharma Dan said... <em>Each person, situation, and time is different, but carefully consider
                                              that the life you will awaken to is the actual, ordinary life you live,
                                              so make it a good one, and realize that when your spiritual quest is
                                              over, there is still the laundry. </em></p>
              <p>Oh and, Daniel Ingram holds a doctorate, has a high salary job as a surgeon, and I know of other enlightened persons who also hold high positions and earn high income, including in this forum. So 'mundane knowledge' in itself does not conflict with 'supramundane knowledge'. However it is also true that there must be enough time for intensive spiritual practice for faster progress.</p>
              <p>As Daniel Ingram said, <em>...Thus, unless you happen to be unusually talented, if you really want to
                          get what the Buddha was talking about, you will probably have to go on
                          at least some retreats, and probably of a few weeks each at least, and
                          this assumes that you will practice very well and can put aside dealing
                          with your "stuff", which most just don't seem willing or able to do
                          most of the time.</em> <em>While I managed to do this stuff while having jobs, relationships,
                          graduate studies, and the like, it was nothing resembling easy or
                          cheap. I gave up nearly all of my vacation time for years to retreats,
                          my career development was delayed, I spent much less time doing other
                          things so that I could sit daily (such as TV, time with
                          friends/family), there were relationship stresses, money that was
                          borrowed and often very tight, and the like. I still think it was the
                          right thing to do, but I recommend being realistic about what this may
                          cost on many fronts, particularly if you have children, who, in my
                          humble opinion, deserve your time and commitment. Sometimes it takes
                          some time for people to gently strip their lives down a bit in healthy
                          and non-destructive ways to make some more time for the dharma. Others
                          will make radical changes and go off in wildly new directions...</em></p>

              <p>Continuing...</p>
              <p><strong>The Purpose of Life</strong></p>
              <p>When you start reflecting on death, everything starts to become so clear. You realize how foolish you have been. During my life I have wasted so much time, when I really didn't have time to waste. When I look back on my early years as a monk, I did waste too much time. But fortunately I had enough good meditation as well. Now as a forty-nine year old monk I can't afford to waste any more time.</p>
              <p>I look at all the opportunities young monks have, and sometimes, well, they don't make good use of those opportunities. They don't hang around in their huts, or on their walking paths for hour after hour, walking and sitting, walking and sitting. They don't use the time in between walking and sitting to study the <em>suttas</em>, and to contemplate their meaning. If you are wasting time, isn't that a shame!</p>
              <p>Here we have one of the best monasteries in the world and some of the best facilities. Of all the monasteries that I have been to, this is one of the best. It's as good as it gets. Sometimes, just living in a forest takes so much effort. In the forest monasteries that I knew in Thailand, you had to spend so much of the day just walking the long distance for the alms round, and then working in the monastery in the afternoon. The time for seclusion to meditate was very limited.</p>
              <p>So, reflect on the following: 'I don't know how long I'll have these facilities. I don't know how long I'll be healthy enough to do this'. There are enough monks here with bad backs or bad knees, bad this and bad that. If you're a healthy monk, or even a reasonably healthy one, if you can sit meditation, cross your legs and straighten your back without too much pain, you are extremely fortunate. You won't always be like that. <em>Use this opportunity now!</em></p>
              <p>It's not just your body that is going to die, your good health will die, your energy will die, and your opportunities will die. So reflect on death, as it says in the <em>suttas</em>, as if your turban was on fire. In other words, death gives precedence to the practice, and it makes the Eightfold Path<a name="11b885d3ab84a531__ednref3" href="http://www.bswa.org/modules/icontent/index.php?op=print&amp;page=95#_edn3"><span><span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">[3]</span></span></span></a> the most important thing in the world. It gives the Path priority over everything else. It would be wonderful if people had that understanding of death to the degree that they embraced it all the time. It would be wonderful if they had that mindfulness, which remembers that death is always stalking you. Death can happen at any time!</p>
              <p>Therefore, what's important to me is to develop the Eightfold Path as much as I can, as deeply as I can, so that I can experience the <em>JhÄ�nas</em>. It's important that I can experience the Paths and Fruits of this practice. It's important that I can be free. Free first of all from the lower realms, and eventually from rebirth altogether. Otherwise death becomes very scary, even for great practitioners. They can fall so easily if they haven't got this security from bondage, this security from all bad rebirths. We use these reflections on death to generate a sense of urgency.</p>
              <p>As we travel the Eightfold Path, we should not use force. We don't 'do' the practice, it is something we allow to happen. We renounce all other business in our lives. I've often noticed that if you just allow this path to happen, it happens so beautifully, so powerfully and so effectively. The problem is we don't allow the path to happen. We are too busy doing other things. It's quite clear what we are supposed to be doing.</p>
              <p>We know the section of the Eightfold Path about virtuous conduct; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood. Everyone in this monastery, even if you are in this monastery temporarily, can tick off those three parts of the Eightfold Path. You're fulfilling them, that is of course, as long as you are keeping the rules and the precepts of this monastery.</p>
              <p>Now as to Right Effort, (it is unfortunate that we have to translate these terms into English), as soon as you say right effort, people think of striving and struggling, and forcing and controlling, and doing. If we can somehow turn our minds to effort without doing, to a practice of letting go, then we have gained some deeper understanding about what right effort truly means. It's the effort to let go, not the effort to add to or to get rid of, that is one of the hardest things for the Western mind to get around. Often people waste so many years and so much of their time just trying too hard.</p>
              <p>It's the <em>Arahants</em>, and the people who have great wisdom, who have no difficulty. Those of you who have studied PÄ�li<span style="font-family: Normyn;">,</span> come across this again and again. <em>JhÄ�nas</em> are easy for the wise; they are attained with no difficulty. You should reflect on how these states can be attained without difficulty? It is because those people know the path to entering the <em>JhÄ�nas</em>. It is the 'no difficulty' path. So don't make it difficult! If you can let go, disentangle yourself from the past and the future, then there is no difficulty. Let the past and the future die for you, so that you've only got the present moment. Let all thinking die. Then there is no difficulty. What does it mean when you die to all your past? All the things you worried about, and all the concerns about the past, it's all gone. And as for the future who knows?</p>
              <p><strong>Into the Light</strong></p>
              <p><em>The present moment is the only thing that you ever have</em>. When you die your body and all your concerns, are taken away from you. What were you worried about? Let it all go. Allow your thinking, thinking, thinking, to die. When a person's dead, they are brain dead, there's no brain activity. When a person dies, often in the first moments after death, there is that silence of the mind, before the mind made body can start to name things, and start to conceptualise about what they are experiencing. For the first few seconds or even longer, it's a time of silence, a different type of perception. This is similar to what one can do in one's meditation, let go of that inner chatter, allow it to die, as if <em>you are</em> dying. Many people when they have been close to death have had spiritual experiences. In many traditions, they have experiences of dying to the world and becoming wise afterwards. The experience which <em>TheravÄ�da</em> monks of our tradition have is that when they get into <em>JhÄ�nas</em>, they die to the body and become wise to the nature of the mind.</p>
              <p>That experience of allowing every thing to disappear is so similar to the process of dying, that the reflection on dying can very easily be incorporated into the practice which leads into <em>JhÄ�nas</em>. Die to the past and future. Die to the thoughts. Die to the body, and eventually die to the breath. It's as if you take your last breath as you are meditating. In other words your body becomes as still as a corpse, you completely let go of the breathing, and go into the <em>nimitta</em>. It is just like that when a person dies. They go out of their body into the light that is the same as the <em>nimitta</em>.</p>
              <p>Really we're talking about an <em>amata</em> state (a deathless state). <em>Amata</em> is a word that is used in PÄ�li. The word death, <em>marana</em>, is always about the death of the body. The death of the mind is called <em>ParinibbÄ�na</em>, but the death of the body is always <em>marana.</em> The past participle of that is <em>mata</em>, dead or died. But do you know what really doesn't die? If you've contemplated this through deep meditation, you know it is this stream of consciousness. It's that which carries on after death. In that sense, the stream of consciousness is <em>amata</em>, because that is beyond the physical death. It's that which can be reborn in the <em>rÅ«pa</em> realms (material realms) or the <em>arÅ«pa</em> realms (immaterial realms). However, that's not the end of things. I think that word <em>amata</em> was popular in the time of the Buddha because, like most people even today, when they talked about some sort of salvation, it was very much a materialistic idea. It was the idea of going into a state of <em>amata</em>, of deathlessness, where they could <strong>'</strong><em>be</em><strong>'</strong> forever and ever and ever, without having to worry about death. Some sort of heaven realm, some sort of eternity realm. Perhaps the way the Buddha used the word <em>amata</em> was taking it from common usage and giving it a different meaning. But from experience, what doesn't die is the stream of consciousness, the <em>mano viññana</em> or mind consciousness. In <em>JhÄ�nas</em><em><span style="font-family: Normyn;"> </span></em>you can actually know what mind consciousness really is as an experience.</p>
              <p>In the <em>JhÄ�nas</em> it is as if the body has died along with all the conceptions of the world, all feelings, everything that is concerned with the world and the body. So really the <em>JhÄ�nas</em> are death-like states, in the sense that the body has gone, it has disappeared. The worlds of the past and future have gone, they have disappeared. All your possessions have gone, they have disappeared. All your thoughts have gone, they have disappeared, along with all the struggling and doing. The coming and going, has gone, they have disappeared. Can you understand me? Can you understand what the word 'death' means? It means transcending this body. It is letting go of the body. The problem is of course, that most people when they die go and get born again, and then they have to die all over again. They keep on doing that because they don't fully die to the world, they die a little bit, <em>but they still want to experience some more</em>.</p>
              <p>So you have to learn how to develop the meditation of letting go, that effort which abandons all the plans and busyness, all of those little fetters, those little knots, which tie you to this worldly body. It's fascinating to sometimes reflect on just how wisely you've spent your day. What's occupied your mind today? Do a statistical analysis. How much of your mind has been occupied today with the body, or with the world, or with the monastery, or with your own affairs? And how much has been occupied with the affairs of the deathless? That will give you a good idea of why you're not getting Enlightened. We have to be more occupied with the deathless!</p>

              <p><strong>A Place of Simplicity</strong></p>
              <p>I've been struggling for many years to try and make this monastery a place where you don't need to worry about much. To organise it so that all of the basic human needs are provided for. Out there in the world people have to struggle so much just to survive, to have a house, and food to get by. It's so complex out there. The whole ethos and meaning behind the monastery is to be a place of simplicity. A place where the time you spend looking after this body, feeding it, washing it, and housing it is so little, that you can devote the majority of your time to the deathless, that which lies beyond the body. However people always tend to make life more complex. They always make things more difficult: taking the body from one place to another, getting it healthy, feeding it, and washing it, or whatever else it is that we do with our bodies. There is so little time left for the mind. When we've developed the perception of death, and its opposite, the deathless, we can incline and spend more time on that which is beyond death. Even though you may not have experienced those states yet, in this life anyway, there is something that recognises the existence of the state of mind that is beyond the body. By just knowing that much, it's like a whiff of scent. It is enough to show you what direction to go.</p>
              <p>Remember that all the doing, which we think is right effort, keeps us with this body, keeps us with the past and the future; so it is not the correct type of doing. It's effort which leads to more entanglements. The effort which leads to letting go is remembering that this doesn't belong to me. It is <em>cÄ�ga</em>, giving up and abandoning. That's why this monastery can be a prison if you don't want to be here. But if you're completely content here, if you're completely happy, then it's not a prison any more. It's contentment that frees you. Letting go is thinking that it doesn't belong to me. I'm content with whatever's happening. Its <em>anÄ�laya</em>, or freedom from attachment. It's the Teflon mind, nothing sticks to it, nothing can land on it, and its <em>patinissagga</em>, always giving up, relinquishing; going in the opposite direction to attaching. It's actually throwing things off rather than allowing things to land on you and to ingratiate themselves with you. That's the effort to let go. <em>That's the effort that leads to the transcending of death.</em></p>
              <p>When you let go of all these things, everything disappears: the body goes, the world goes, the huts go, the books go, the illnesses go, the Buddhist Society of Western Australia disappears. Everything is gone, and you realise what monastic life is all about. The holy life, at least the start of it, is all about going into the realms of the mind. And if you have got into <em>JhÄ�nas</em>, an insight that comes automatically after those <em>JhÄ�na</em> states is that the stream of mind consciousness has died to the body. There has been a separation. It is just like the Christian idea of the soul leaving the body. It is the stream of consciousness that leaves the body, not physically, because these are different planes. The realm of the mind, mind space, is not something that you can measure in physical space. It is a parallel universe if you like, but that parallel universe, the mind space, is independent. It is completely unaffected, if it wants to be, by the four dimensional world of space and time.</p>
              <p><em><strong>NibbÄ�na</strong></em></p>
              <p>To know that much means that there will never be a fear of death, because you know what death is. It's the death of the body. It's the death of the five senses, the ending of that entire world outside. Such understanding gives you a different perspective. It is one of the greatest treasures, one of the greatest happinesses, that you have ever found. All the pleasures of the world seem to be so useless, so trivial and petty. You really wonder why you've been messing around: with relationships, with sex, with getting married, with accumulating wealth or keeping wealth. What a foolish thing to do spending your life running around, backwards and forwards, when you could have these beautiful blissful states of mind! That's why I've always encouraged people by hook or by crook, somehow or other, to get a taste of those states. One taste will change your life and give you a different perspective. Even though it may have been only one taste many years ago, you can't forget that. You can't ignore it because it's a powerful transforming experience. It gives you an idea an experience of what is possible, what it means to let go of the <em>kÄ�ma</em> <em>loka</em>, the world of the body, the world of, birth, old age sickness and death.</p>
              <p>When you look at the world of the mind, you see that the mind doesn't get old, and it needn't get sick. The mind really only gets sick if you let it get sick. That's why the Buddha said that even though the body is sick, the mind does not need to be sick. (Sn III, 1) So even though the body gets sick, don't let the mind get sick too. The stream of consciousness can be completely above that. If you can do just that much and completely let go of the world of the body, then you will at least be an <em>AnÄ�gÄ�mi,</em> a Non Returner. When you die you will go up to the realm of the mind, play around there for a few aeons and from there, <em>NibbÄ�na</em>. I shouldn't really say this, but it's not a bad way of exiting from <em>samsÄ�ra</em>. The Buddha would quite rightly criticise me for advocating any type of existence, even in the <em>AnÄ�gÄ�mi</em> realms. The Buddha says it's just not worth it, it's best to <em>NibbÄ�na</em> as soon as you can.</p>
              <p><em>NibbÄ�na</em> is like another level of death. It is the end of the mind. Ordinary death is the death of things relating to the body, the death of this world, the losing of all your possessions, and separation from what you loved. Old age and sickness, they're just the messengers of death, the precursors, just the signs that death is coming. 'Death is coming!' It's just like the first bills you get, the first reminders, saying if you don't pay within a few days you are going to be taken to court. They're the warning notices, and then suddenly it just comes.</p>
              <p>Old age and sickness, they are all part of death. It's amazing how people can completely neglect and deny those warning signs. They get old, old, old and they think they're still going to live for a long time, they get sick, sick, sick and they think they are always going to get better. These are the warning signs that: 'Death is coming. Death is coming. Death is coming.' If you've got a bad back today, that's a warning sign that death is coming. If you have a headache, or stomach ache, if you feel a bit low in energy or even if you've just had a cold, that's death coming. Always remember that. These symptoms are like death knocking on the door, you may not be quite ready yet, but it doesn't really matter. Death will just break in, like a home invader, and drag you away, <em>whether you are ready or not</em>.</p>

              <p><strong>Summary and Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><br>So it's good to be ready. You do that by preparing to let go of this world. This world is useful in as much as it provides a means for the holy life to be lived. This body is useful in that it provides a vehicle for you to be able sit down and meditate, and gain the JhÄ�nas, and the consequent insight the enables one to leave samsÄ�ra. That's the whole purpose of the body, the purpose of the senses, and the purpose of this life. However people who don't know the purpose of life, the meaning of life, just waste their time and do foolish things. They go around and around, like children on a merry-go-round, thinking that it's so good, so wonderful and so enjoyable. Doing the reflection on death again and again, allows you to let go of a lot of the useless pursuits in your life.</p>
              <p><br>Even those of you who are senior monks in this monastery, what do you really want to achieve? You might die tonight. What's important to you? Is it finishing off that letter, or is it meditating and getting into JhÄ�na. You may only have another week or two, who knows? What's really important to you? Just before your death do you want to look back and be able to say: 'I've used this life properly? At least I've had a JhÄ�na, (or even better) I've got Magga Phala, the Fruit of the Path.' Then you can die at ease, and you've used this life as it's supposed to be used. You've made the best of your opportunities. So be diligent. Know the Path, and know what works!</p>
              <p><br>Make that effort, which is a letting go. Remember, 'this doesn't belong to me'. The body doesn't belong to me. This monastery doesn't belong to me. My letters doesn't belong to me. My family doesn't belong to me. My past, my history, don't belong to me, and neither does my future. You own nothing in this world. Death teaches how little you really own. The body belongs to nature. The past belongs to fantasy. The future belongs to stupidity. You own nothing. All your thoughts belong to your conditioning. You own nothing, nothing, nothing. My robes just belong to the earth. All the possessions in my hut belong to the earth as well. All that is mine will one day go to the rubbish dump. It will be incinerated.</p>
              <p><br>I thought when I first came here, that I would build this monastery strong so that it would last for hundreds and thousands of years. And already you can see it is falling apart. Cracks are appearing in the walls of your huts. The monk who told me he saw cracks appearing in the wall of his hut should look at his own body and see the cracks right down his own body. We're falling apart. We're crumbling. Soon we'll be dust like that hut.</p>
              <p><br>When we look at things in this way, we get everything into perspective. The crack in the wall of your hut is showing you death. You're grateful to the harbinger of death for encouraging you to let go and develop the deep meditations. You are dying to the body, dying to world, and dying to the defilements that keep you in that world. You are liberating yourself, owning nothing, and being content with owning nothing. When you're content, you need nothing. When you're content you're dead to desires. When people die you write on their gravestone, 'Rest in Peace'. When you're in JhÄ�nas you are resting in peace, and NibbÄ�na is the only true peace.</p>
              <p><br>These are some reflections about death, reflections about NibbÄ�na, reflections about the body, the world and the mind. So please be diligent, life is fading away so fast.</p>

              <p>Very poignant! Thanks for posting this Isis, but I have one
              nagging concern. Throughout the majority of most peoples lives,
              they work so hard and spent so much time in the pursuit of
              knowledge that enhances the material comforts of life. Ultimately,
              the sum total of all knowledges acquired by doctors,
              accountants, engineers, architects, scientist etc.
              etc. serve nothing but to enhance the sensory pleasure and
              material comforts of this "life". If "life" is so short and
              transient, why are we spending so much time in the pursuit
              of non-spiritual knowledge?</p>
              <p>If I use the analogy of Asoka's brother, if I am put into
              the shoes of the brother, I defintely wont be able to enjoy
              the comforts of being an emperor, but by the same token, I wont be
              able to acquire any skills and knowledge (non-spiritual ones)
              either?   </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't think all the knowledge acquired by doctors, engineers and scientist are totally useless. It can be used for the greater good. For instance, engineer build houses for the poor. Scientist research and experiment to find a cure for HIV and cancer. We also need accountant to do audit for charity organisation, school etc. </p>

                              					<span class="blackText">Interview by Lisa Schneider</span></div>
              <p><br> <img src="http://www.beliefnet.com/imgs/tout/author020916.jpg" border="0" alt="" align="left"><em></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Thich
                              Nhat Hanh is a Zen monk, teacher, poet, peace activist, and the author
                              of more than 100 books, including "Anger," "The Miracle of
                              Mindfulness," and "Living Buddha, Living Christ." In his latest book,
                              "No Death, No Fear," he invites both Buddhists and non-Buddhists alike
                              to look deeply into the nature of life and death.</em><br><br> <strong>For someone who is dealing with a painful loss or a personal fear of
                              death but knows nothing about Buddhism or meditative technique, what do
                              you recommend as way to begin to let go of fear and grief?</strong><br><br> I think there's a way of training ourselves in order not to become the
                              victim of fear and grief -- that is to look deeply into ourselves and
                              to see that we are made of non-self elements. And when we look around
                              ourselves, we can recognize ourselves in the non-self elements, like a
                              father looking at his children can see himself in his children, can see
                              his continuation in his children. So he is not attached to the idea
                              that his body is the only thing that is him. He's more than his body.
                              He is inside of his body but he is also at the same [time] outside of
                              his body in many elements. And if we have the habit of looking like
                              that, we will not be the victim of our attachment to one form of
                              manifestation, and we will be free. And that freedom makes happiness
                              and peace possible.</p>
              <p><strong>Other than meditation, is there any specific practice that can help you come to this understanding?</strong><br><br> Yes. The Buddha advised us to bear in mind that everything is
                              impermanent, that nothing has an absolute entity that remains the same.
                              And when we keep that insight in mind, we can see more deeply into the
                              nature of reality, and we will not be locked in the notion that we are
                              only this body, this life span is the only life span we have. In fact,
                              because nothing can be by itself alone, no one can be by himself or
                              herself alone, everyone has to inter-be with every one else. That is
                              why, when you look outside, around you, you can see yourself. And when
                              you look into yourself, you can see the world outside. So that is a
                              training.</p>
              <p><strong>I wonder if you'd answer the question you say you like to pose to your Christian friends: "Where was Jesus before he was born?"</strong> <br><br> In the Christian tradition, people speak of the living Christ, the
                              living Jesus. It means Jesus is not affected by birth and death. So the
                              question can be rephrased, "Where was Jesus after he was born?" Because
                              if you look at that manifestation of his body and you think that Jesus
                              is only that body, you are misled -- Jesus must be much more than that
                              body, that manifestation. So if you can answer that question, you can
                              answer the other question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's like when you look at a sheet of paper and look deeply, you
                              can see that the paper is made of trees and sunshine and earth and
                              clouds, and even before the manifestation of the sheet of paper in this
                              present form, you can only see the sheet of paper in the non-paper
                              elements that existed before.</p>
              <p>So we should be able to see Jesus Christ even with that manifestation.
                              And before that manifestation, we cannot say that Jesus did not exist
                              because the nature of Jesus is the nature of no birth and no death. And
                              birth and death cannot affect Jesus. If we look like that we have a
                              much deeper understanding of the person, of the nature of the Lord.</p>
              <p><strong>Can you explain what you mean by that manifestation? What is being
                              manifested?</strong><br><br> Manifestation is showing a presence -- when conditions are sufficient,
                              something manifests itself. And that is not a beginning, that is a
                              continuation also. It's like a beautiful cloud in the sky -- that is a
                              manifestation: before being a cloud, the cloud has been other things
                              like water, vapor, heat and so on. So looking deeply, you can only
                              recognize the presence of the cloud in the non-cloud elements that have
                              been there before that manifestation of the cloud.</p>
              <p><strong>You say that without awareness or mindfulness we live like dead
                              people. Can you talk about what you mean by the practice of
                              resurrection?</strong><br><br> Usually people have a tendency to be caught in the worries concerning
                              the future or in the regret concerning the past. There is some kind of
                              energy that is pushing them to run and they are not able to establish
                              themselves in the present moment. And that prevents them from getting
                              in touch [with] what is there in the present moment. And life is
                              available <em>only</em> in the present moment. If you abandon the present moment you cannot
                              live the moments of your daily life deeply. That is why those who are
                              not capable of being there in the present moment, they don't really
                              live their life -- they live like dead people, like the French writer
                              Camus used to say.</p>
              <p>That is why if you know the techniques of
                              mindful breathing, mindful walking, mindful smiling, you can bring your
                              mind back to your body and you become truly alive at every moment and
                              that can be described as the practice of resurrection. Resurrection can
                              be at every moment for life to be truly possible.</p>
              <p><strong>Is that what you're talking about when you say "When you come back
                              to mindfulness and awareness the energy of the Holy Spirit is present
                              in you"?</strong><br><br> Yes, when mindfulness is there you are attentive to yourself, you are
                              attentive to other people around you and understanding becomes
                              possible, compassion becomes possible. And that improves the quality of
                              your life and the lives of those around you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>You say that we should not only accept but welcome the notion
                              of impermanence. How is it that impermanence "makes everything
                              possible"?</strong><br><br> If things were not impermanent, life would not be possible. Suppose you
                              sow a seed of corn. If the seed of corn is not impermanent, it cannot
                              sprout and become a young plant of corn and you would have no corn to
                              eat. That is why impermanence is very important, crucial for life. That
                              is why instead of complaining about impermanence you have to say "Long
                              live impermanence!"</p>
              <p><strong>What would you say to someone, for example, whose child has just died? How should they understand what's happened?</strong><br><br> I would say that when conditions are not sufficient, something cannot
                              manifest itself fully. It may be waiting for a few other conditions in
                              order to manifest. And if we keep that in mind and if we are capable of
                              seeing that manifestation in other forms then we don't have to be the
                              victim of despair and fear.</p>
              <p>Suppose you are impressed with a particular cloud in the sky. When it
                              is time for that cloud to become the rain you won't see that cloud
                              anymore and you will cry. But if you know that the cloud has been
                              transformed into the rain and the rain is calling you, "Darling, I am
                              here, I'm here," if you have that kind of capacity of recognizing the
                              continuation of that manifestation, you don't have to live in despair
                              and grief. That is why for those who have lost someone who is close to
                              him or to her I advise that they look deeply within and see that the
                              one who was close is still there, somehow, and with the practice of
                              deep looking they can recognize his or her presence very close to him
                              or to her.</p>
              <p><strong>Do you ever have doubts about these truths?  How do you deal with your own doubts?</strong><br><br> Doubt in my tradition is something that is very helpful. Because of
                              doubt you can thirst more and you will get a higher kind of proof.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If our true nature is one of no birth and no death, what are
                              our present lives for? How can we find meaning in the actions that we
                              take?</strong><br><br> Our life is a manifestation, and we can very well make that
                              manifestation beautiful and meaningful and have a good influence on
                              other manifestations in the now and in the future. If we know how to
                              create the energy of love, understanding, compassion, and beauty, then
                              we can contribute a lot to the world, influencing positively other
                              manifestations. Because if the manifestations that happen in the
                              present moment are beautiful and good, their continuation in the future
                              will be also good and beautiful.</p>
              <p><strong>You say that people of any faith can use these teachings.</strong><br><br> Yes.</p>
              <p><strong>But most Christians and others profess a faith in an embodied life
                              after death. How can your teaching of no-death/no-self be useful to
                              them?</strong><br><br> There is an interesting story I would like to tell you. There is a lady
                              who believed very strongly that if she died she would go to heaven and
                              she would meet her husband, who died at the age of 30. And she said
                              that when she was 70, and I asked her, "When you go to heaven, how old
                              do you expect your husband to be -- 30 or 70? If he's 30 and then you
                              are 70, then that's no match at all!"</p>
              <p>So because we are attached to a specific form of manifestation, that is
                              why we suffer. If we are free from that kind of attachment, we can
                              easily recognize ourselves in other people, in different forms of
                              manifestation, and then we don't have to suffer.</p>
              <p><strong>Is there anything more you want to add?</strong> <br><br> I think concerning the question about the presence of Jesus. In the
                              Bible there's a story telling us that there was a disciple of Jesus
                              walking with him but not recognizing him at all -- that is after the
                              crucifixion. And then only when Jesus begins to break the bread do they
                              recognize that the person that had been walking with him is their
                              teacher.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is that Jesus is very close, if you have the kind of eyes
                              that is free from attachment and you can recognize him at anytime and
                              anywhere. So the same thing is true with the person who is dear to you.
                              You may have thought that he's no longer there, she's no longer there
                              and you are looking for him or for her elsewhere and in the future. But
                              if you have that kind of eye that we call a "signlessness" you'll be
                              able to recognize him or her right in the here and the now and you will
                              no longer be a victim of fear and grief and despair.</p>

              <p><br>Sorry to hear this about your grandpa, wilsonhao. Yes, it is natural that we would feel sad in such situation.</p>
              <p>When my dad passed away, and many yrs later, my uncle, I was sad. Especially my dad, tears kept streaming down my face when I'm in bed the first night he was gone. It is a painful feeling that someone close to u has gone. Same when my dog died.</p>
              <p>Those time, what I did was to remind myself that one life gone is not one life gone forever. A life ends means a new life starts all over again. It goes on and on, life after life until  liberation. Then I woke up and there were hopes again as I realised that could actually do something for them, our beloved.  It is not the end. It is another start.</p>
              <p>How? By chanting or doing merits for them as much as i could and as long as I live. Thinking that i could help them( no matter how small) to be reborned in a better life, my miseries sudsides and diIigence in Dharma practice increased.   </p>
              <p>That's another one of my DIY methods again.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> U may try. Don't be too sad, as there's work to do now. It is fortunate that we have heard the Dharma, and now we can make good use of our knowledge, no matter how litter, to help our beloved.</p>
