                    on Thrangu Monastery Earthquake<br> <br> Khenchen Thangu Rinpoche<br> <br> April 15, 2010</strong></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">There are many 
              disasters caused 
                      by the four elements—earthquakes, wildfires, strong winds, and 
              turbulent 
                      seas—and they also bring disease and illness. In such a time, we
               need 
                      to be careful and practice the Dharma as much as we can. <br> </span></p>
              </div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Jyekundo 
                    in Tibet is a small and sparsely populated area, but it is a place
               where 
                    there are many Tibetan people, and there are also many 
              monasteries. At Thrangu 
                    Monastery in Jyekundo, many of the lamas and monks both those 
              abroad and 
                    those on site have put in tremendous efforts for many years. These
               efforts 
                    have not just been in terms of external things; they have also put
               effort 
                    into spiritual practice. In terms of study and contemplation, a 
              monastic 
                    college for the study of texts and philosophy was founded. It 
              gradually 
                    grew and there formed a body of students and scholars, who are the
               foundation 
                    of the teachings. A primary school to provide basic education for 
              young 
                    students had also been built. <br> <br> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">In 
                    terms of meditation, a retreat center for the practice of the Six 
              Yogas 
                    of Naropa was built where monks engaged in practice. Another 
              retreat center 
                    for the practice of the deities who purify the lower realms, 
              Sarvavid Vairochana 
                    and Protector Akshobhya, had been restored and retreatants were 
              doing the 
                    practices of those deities. A Mahakala retreat center was built 
              during the 
                    time of Karmapa Thekchok Dorje (1798-1868) and contained a statue 
              of Mahakala. 
                    Here, daily practices had been held for many generations. In 
              addition, there 
                    was a large new temple where daily services were held. <br> <br> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now 
                    there has been the terrible earthquake in Jyekundo, Qinghai, and 
              these structures 
                    have all been ruined. Additionally, many monks have passed away in
               the earthquake. 
                    This is a great tragedy and a great obstacle. Please think of this
               and make 
                    good prayers on the behalf of all those who passed away. If you 
              gather merit 
                    by helping with the relief and restoration, it will be helpful for
               the world 
                    in general and in particular prevent the Dharma from disappearing.
               It is 
                    important that the lineage of teaching and practice not wane: 
              Without a 
                    lineage of teaching and practice, the Dharma would perish.<br> <br> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Sometimes 
                    people might think that temples and monasteries are not all that 
              important. 
                    However, there are both transient sentient beings and the lasting 
              external 
                    environment. With sentient beings, there might be many for a 
              while, including 
                    great scholars and meditators. Great lamas might appear. There may
               be many 
                    members of the Sangha, but just as water flows downstream, fifty, 
              sixty, 
                    seventy, or eighty years later they will all pass away and a new 
              generation 
                    will come. When this happens, even if there were a strong lineage 
              of Dharma 
                    in the previous generation, we do not really know whether that 
              lineage would 
                    continue in the next.<br> <br> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">The 
                    way that the lineage can continue from generation to generation is
               to have 
                    a good, stable outer environment. When there is the external 
              environment 
                    of a monastery with a shrine, retreat center, and monastic 
              college, then 
                    due to that place, the Sangha, great lamas, and great meditators 
              might pass 
                    away but the continuity of their activity will remain present 
              there. <br> <br> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">This 
                    is why restoring monasteries is crucial. If the monasteries fall 
              into ruins, 
                    the environment declines as well and the inhabitants gradually 
              disappear. 
                    Buddhism would not be able to remain long in this world. But if a 
              monastery 
                    continues to exist, the great lamas and masters can perform vast 
              activity 
                    for the Dharma during their entire lives. A group of students will
               gather; 
                    the lamas will teach the students; and they will practice. Thus 
              gradually 
                    the students will spend the first part of their lives studying and
               practicing 
                    the Dharma and the latter part upholding, protecting, and 
              spreading Buddhism. 
                    When that generation comes to its end, a new generation can 
              continue that 
                    work, upholding, protecting, and spreading the teachings, which 
              can thus 
                    remain. This is why temples and the Sangha are so very important. <br> <br> </span></div>
              <div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 15pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">If 
                    sponsors can make contributions and help in either large or small 
              ways, 
                    that would be wonderful. We spend this life gathering wealth and 
              possessions, 
                    and sometimes this can be meaningful, but sometimes there is the 
              danger 
                    that this might become the grounds for conflict and dispute. For 
              that reason, 
                    I ask all the faithful benefactors to help in any way you can. <br> <br> <br> </span></div>
