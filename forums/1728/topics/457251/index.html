              <h4>(<a id="ten" name="ten">Ten Benefits</a>)</h4>
              <p>"Monks, for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is 
              cultivated, developed, pursued, handed the reins and taken as a basis, 
              given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken, ten 
              benefits can be expected. Which ten?</p>
              <p>[1] "He conquers displeasure &amp; delight, and displeasure does not 
              conquer him. He remains victorious over any displeasure that has arisen.</p>
              <p>[2] "He conquers fear &amp; dread, and fear &amp; dread do not 
              conquer him. He remains victorious over any fear &amp; dread that have 
              arisen.</p>
              <p>[3] "He is resistant to cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of 
              gadflies &amp; mosquitoes, wind &amp; sun &amp; creeping things; to 
              abusive, hurtful language; he is the sort that can endure bodily 
              feelings that, when they arise, are painful, sharp, stabbing, fierce, 
              distasteful, disagreeable, deadly.</p>
              <p>[4] "He can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four 
              jhanas — heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding in the 
              here &amp; now.</p>
              <p>[5] "He wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he 
              becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. 
              He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, &amp; mountains as if through
               space. He dives in &amp; out of the earth as if it were water. He walks
               on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting crosslegged he
               flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches 
              &amp; strokes even the sun &amp; moon, so mighty &amp; powerful. He 
              exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>
              <p>[6] "He hears — by means of the divine ear-element, purified &amp; 
              surpassing the human — both kinds of sounds: divine &amp; human, whether
               near or far.</p>
              <p>[7] "He knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals, 
              having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with 
              passion as a mind with passion, and a mind without passion as a mind 
              without passion. He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with 
              aversion, and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion. He 
              discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion, and a mind 
              without delusion as a mind without delusion. He discerns a restricted 
              mind as a restricted mind, and a scattered mind as a scattered mind. He 
              discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind, and an unenlarged mind as
               an unenlarged mind. He discerns an excelled mind <a id="fnt-1" class="noteTag " name="fnt-1" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.119.than.html#fn-1">[1]</a> as an excelled mind, and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind. He 
              discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind, and an 
              unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind. He discerns a released 
              mind as a released mind, and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind.</p>
              <p>[8] "He recollects his manifold past lives (lit: previous homes), 
              i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, 
              thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, 
              many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many 
              aeons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion, [recollecting], 'There I 
              had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such 
              was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of 
              my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had
               such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was 
              my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my 
              life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he remembers 
              his manifold past lives in their modes &amp; details.</p>
              <p>[9] "He sees — by means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing 
              the human — beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how 
              they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; 
              unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were 
              endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the 
              noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence 
              of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have 
              re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower 
              realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct 
              of body, speech, &amp; mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held
               right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — 
              with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good
               destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine 
              eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human — he sees beings passing away 
              &amp; re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior &amp; 
              superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in 
              accordance with their kamma.</p>
              <p>[10] "Through the ending of the mental effluents, he remains in the 
              effluent-free awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having known 
              and made them manifest for himself right in the here &amp; now.</p>
              <p>"Monks, for one in whom mindfulness immersed in the body is 
              cultivated, developed, pursued, handed the reins and taken as a basis, 
              given a grounding, steadied, consolidated, &amp; well-undertaken, these 
              ten benefits can be expected."</p>
              <p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
