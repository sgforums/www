              <div class="content">
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The true nature of appearances is that they've 
              never been born<br>If birth seems to happen, it's just clinging, nothing 
              more<br>The spinning wheel of existence has neither a base nor a root<br>If 
              there is a base or root, that's only a thought</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The true nature of the mind is union, 
              inseparability<br>If you separate its aspects, you're hooked on some view<br>The 
              sign of the true lamas is that they hold a lineage<br>The ones who make stuff up 
              are just being dumb</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The mind's basic reality is like the clear and 
              open sky<br>But the dark clouds of thoughts just cover it all up<br>So let the 
              lama's pith advice<br>Be the wind that blows those clouds away</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Even confused thoughts themselves are clear 
              light that shines so brilliantly<br>Experiences so bright like sun and 
              moonlight<br>Without any direction, clarity shines timelessly<br>You cannot find 
              it, so you can't say what it is</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">So many kinds of certainty shine like the stars 
              in the sky<br>Whatever arises is the greatest bliss<br>Its nature is simplicity, 
              the dharmakaya expanse<br>The six dependent appearances are empty 
              naturally</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This natural flow is effortless, there's not a 
              klesha in sight<br>Within this basic state, completely relaxed<br>Wisdom without 
              fixation abides continuously<br>The three kayas inseparable - the greatest 
              miracle!</span></p>

              <p>Just a sharing... of something Thusness wrote some time ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">An 
              insightful post by Jax. <br><br>Therefore the so called "Clear Aware Space" is 
              no more special than this moment of arising sound or passing scent.  The failure 
              to recognize that all apparent arising and passing transience is non other than 
              the Dharmakaya is the problem of all problems. <br><br>When a pith instruction 
              like “Relax and fully open to whatever is” is taught to a mind that is still 
              under strong influence of dualistic tendencies, it is easy for such a mind to 
              read  and practice in the form of clinging to the “Aware Space” and shunting 
              away from the transience, thereby setting itself infinitely apart unknowingly. 
              <br><br>If however there is maturity of insight that whatever arises share the 
              same taste -- luminous yet empty (via twofold emptiness),  then practice is 
              naturally and simply unreserved opening to whatever is, it cannot be otherwise. 
               There can be no movement, duality and preference from this to that for there is 
              no ‘this’ that is more ‘this’ than that.  <br><br>With clear recognition and 
              unperturbed practice of complete unreserved opening to whatever is, all 
              transience will reveal to posses the same taste of non-dual samadhi and 
              self-liberation that we once thought to be the monopoly of the so called “Clear 
              Aware Space”.<br><br>It is therefore advisable that after the direct experience 
              and realization of the pure sense of existence, a practitioner further 
              penetrates anatta and the empty nature of phenomena.  These insights are 
              necessary and should not be considered “long cut”.  It will help a practitioner 
              better appreciate the art of great ease in time to come.<br><br>My 2 
              cents.<br><br>The degree of “un-contrivance”,<br>Is the degree of how unreserved 
              and fearless we open to whatever is.<br>For whatever arises is mind, always 
              seen, heard, tasted and experienced.<br>What that is not seen, not heard and not 
              experienced,<br>Is our conceptual idea of what mind is.<br><br>Whenever we 
              objectify the “brilliance, the pristine-ness” into an entity that is 
              formless,<br>It becomes an object of grasp that prevents the seeing of the 
              “forms”,<br>the texture and the fabric of awareness.<br>The tendency to 
              objectify is subtle,<br>we let go of 'selfness' yet unknowingly grasped 
              ‘nowness’ and ‘hereness’.<br>Whatever arises merely dependently originates, 
              needless of who, where and when.<br><br>All experiences are equal, luminous yet 
              empty of self-nature.<br>Though empty it has not in anyway denied its vivid 
              luminosity.<br><br>Liberation is experiencing mind as it is.<br>Self-Liberation 
              is the thorough insight that this liberation is always and already 
              is;<br>Spontaneously present, naturally perfected!<br></span></span></p>
