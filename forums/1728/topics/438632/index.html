               January 22, 2011Â By Edward c. Utacht 
              "Vivid Awareness" presents Khenchen Thrangu's commentary on the famous Dzogchen/Mahamudra Master Khenpo Gangshar's texts "The Concise Mind Instructions Called Naturally Liberating Whatever You Meet", and "Naturally Liberating Whatever You Meet: Instructions to Guide You on the Profound Path". The book also includes translations of both root texts. It is probably worth pointing out that the only previous source for English translations of these texts was "The Crystal Cave" published by Rangjung Yeshe Publications. "The Crystal Cave" is restricted and requires prior completion of the tantric preliminaries and a signed letter from one's Mahamudra/Dzogchen guru. The commentary is a compilation of teachings given by Khenchen on 4 occasions during 2007. 
              This is among the very finest texts I have read on Mahamudra and Dzogchen. Both the commentary and root text present a progressive path of meditation on the Nature of Mind. There are short teachings on the common and uncommon preliminary practices, followed by a teaching on the special preliminary of the "Analytical Meditation of the Pandita". This essentially consists of looking into the mind and attempting to locate its dwelling place, an exercise that will allow one to directly encounter the emptiness of one's mind. 
              Following the preliminary teachings is a lengthy teaching on "The Resting Meditation of a Kusulu". This is the real heart of the book, and contains the oral instructions on Treckcho found in Dzogchen upadesha texts like Patrul Rinpoche's "Clear Elucidation of the True Nature", and "The Special Feature of the Wise and Glorious King". For example, on p.122 "Don't pursue the past and don't invite the future. Simply rest naturally in the naked ordinary mind of the immediate present without trying to correct it or "re-place" it.", and on p. 125 " If you rest like that, your mind-essence is clear and expansive, vivid and naked, without any concerns about thought or recollection, joy, or pain. That is awareness (Rigpa)." These and other similar statements are clearly explained. 
              My favorite part of the book is the discussion of " Taking our Life Situations as the Path". This part of the book contains clear instructions on self-liberation of the emotions, taking sleep as the path, and even an interesting condensation of the instructions of "Dark Practice" found in the Dzogchen Togal teachings. All the instructions are exceptionally clear, and one leaves the book with one's understanding of the nature of one's mind greatly clarified. Excellent!
