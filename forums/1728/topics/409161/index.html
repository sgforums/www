              <p>I remember years ago Thusness would have me explain the dharma to people from various forums. One time many years ago I thought it would be better if Thusness explained by himself to the others, so I told Thusness why don't you post yourself or something like that. Thusness suddenly appeared serious (he seldom talk in this tone) and asked me so are you going to do this or not? Then he told me the reason (not exact words now but along this line) he had me to do this was because I was lacking in merits to gain enlightenment. And then he said something like... you think I'm joking? Suddenly at that moment I realized why he was always taking the trouble and instructing me to do all those things... when he could have done it himself.</p>
              <p>Not long later I had a meditation experience... he informed me it is due to my merits ripening due to explaining the dharma to someone some time ago. He informed me there is a direct causal relation. When asked how does he know that merits is important for experience and realization, he simply says this is his experience. He says it may not make a lot of sense to a dualistic mind, but this is how it (dependent origination) works.</p>
              <p> Anyway... here's an article:</p>

               am coming around the home stretch on finishing reading the Majjhima 
              Nikaya and am up to Sutta #142.  I found this especially interesting as 
              it talks about specifically the subject of Merit and the making 
              thereof..</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">Bhante
               talks about how one always should offer gifts not to him but to the 
              Sangha and this is the actual Sutta which is  basis for this idea and 
              there is a lot of detail about this and really cemented this idea in my 
              mind.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">In
               fact the Buddha says that even when that last remnants of the Sangha 
              exists and all they have on that shows them to be a part of the Sangha 
              is a yellow piece of cloth around their neck (yes this is the Sutta 
              where that is discussed), that even if you offer a gift to one of them 
              but rather offer it to the whole Sangha including not only that present 
              day group but also the entire Sangha throughout history, that you are 
              benefiting from the purity of the Arhants and the Buddha who were past 
              members of that Sangha.<br><br>This Sutta starts with a man making an 
              offering to the Buddha.  The Buddha turns him down!  Ananda comes and 
              pleads on behalf of the man to accept the gift.  The teaching begins: 
              "Do not offer the gift to me but to the whole Sangha both present and 
              past members" (Paraphrased).<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">But
               when you offer it to just that one member of the Sangha that you are 
              giving it to, that it is "Purified" by the receiver only and the  
              subsequent merit that accrues is only based on the morality and purity 
              of that one person.   And not the whole historical Sangha including the 
              many Arhants and Buddhas in the past.  In fact it is a OCEAN of 
              difference.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
               this must mean that even if you offer something to a Tibetan or 
              Mahayana or Zen monk when you only consider that person as a messenger 
              for the entire Sangha from times past that that gift is the same as 
              giving it to the Buddha himself.  But you must have this in your mind 
              and the Sutta says to be very careful NOT to consider the person you are
               giving it to -no matter what their perceived purity. That person is 
              only a messenger of the Sangha. When you make it personal greed can 
              enter into the equation and this depersonalizes the intention.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">The
               Sutta also talks about the how much merit one accrues when one gives to
               an Arhant, Anagami, etc down to one who has path knowledge of Sotapanna
               and has not fruition.   The number is incalculable in all cases.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">Below
               that there are offerings down to people who are just on the Path to 
              Nibbana which is 3rd from the bottom in this group of 14 levels of 
              purity.  Yet the merit still is incalculable and has good result.<br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">So
               we are near the bottom friends!  The lowest level is a dog/animal in 
              which merit accrues 100 fold.  Humans of low morality are 100,000 fold. 
               So homeless people, while of very low morality, do merit some gifts!  I
               like to give to homeless but only if I believe they need it.  I am not 
              going to buy them their next beer!<br><br>(But I think I read in another
               sutta years ago that Merit doesn't ripen very much in the present 
              lifetime. It is very weak.  In the 2nd lifetime after this it has more 
              power but in the 3rd it comes to full fruition)</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">The
               other thing the Sutta says is that you become tied to those people's 
              purity that you give to and by doing so you are, in a sense, swept into 
              the stream towards achieving what they have achieved.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">So find monks (and even nuns! Ha Ha) and give to them.  But think of the whole historical Sangha when doing it.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">Much Merit to all</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;"><br></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 100%;">David<br><br>PS
                Here is something interesting that I will post here and that is about 
              Alcohol and the giving of it as a gift.  We debated this on the DS 
              discussion site and everyone pretty much thought it  was OK to accept 
              gifts of wine at Christmas but then Bhante jumped in and said that by 
              giving Wine to a person that by doing so you are taking part in whatever
               action that that gift enables.  If that person commits some immoral act
               then you get to have a part of that merit or I should say demerit.  If 
              they go out and plough down somebody because they are DUI, then 
              psychically you get to have a piece of that demerit. If they beat up 
              their wife and curse or otherwise break precepts -which is really why 
              the 5th precept to avoid drugs is there in the first place- then you 
              share the demerit.<br><br>It appears after a long time of mulling all 
              this over that the world is an impersonal flow of events.  If you give 
              something to somebody and do it without their knowing it it won't matter
               because there is no self there TO know anyway!  Even if you left a gift
               at the door of an Arhant's Kuti and he did not know you did it you 
              would still accrue the merit that would be appropriate as if you had 
              handed it to  him. </span><br><span style="font-size: 85%;"><br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03XpZlOGYM">Youtube Video on Merit by Bhante</a><br><br></span></div>

              <p>I remember years ago (in fact even today) Thusness would have me explain the dharma to people from various forums. One time many years ago I thought it would be better if Thusness explained by himself to the others, so I told Thusness why don't you post yourself or something like that. Thusness suddenly appeared serious (he seldom talk in this tone) and asked me so are you going to do this or not? Then he told me the reason (not exact words now but along this line) he had me to do this was because I was lacking in merits to gain enlightenment. And then he said something like... you think I'm joking? Suddenly at that moment I realized why he was always taking the trouble and instructing me to do all those things... when he could have done it himself.</p>
              <p>Not long later I had a meditation experience... he informed me it is due to my merits ripening due to explaining the dharma to someone some time ago. He informed me there is a direct causal relation. When asked how does he know that merits is important for experience and realization, he simply says this is his experience. He says it may not make a lot of sense to a dualistic mind, but this is how it (dependent origination) works.</p>
