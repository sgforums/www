              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">David Loy SPRING 2002 tricycle</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Buddhism encourages us to be wary of antithetical concepts,
              not only good and evil, but success and failure, rich and poor, even the
              duality between enlightenment and delusion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">If only there were evil people somewhere, insidiously
              committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the
              rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through
              the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his
              own heart? <em>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn</em></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Because it emphasizes mindfulness of our thought processes,
              Buddhism encourages us to be wary of antithetical concepts, not only good and
              evil, but success and failure, rich and poor, even the duality between
              enlightenment and delusion. We distinguish between the opposing terms because
              we want one rather than the other, yet the meaning of each depends upon the
              other. That may sound abstract, but such dualities are actually quite
              troublesome for us. If, for example, it is important to live a pure life
              (however I understand purity), then I need to be preoccupied with avoiding
              impurity. If wealth is important for me, then I am also worried about avoiding
              poverty. We cannot take one lens without the other, and such pairs of
              spectacles filter our experience of the world.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What does this mean for the duality of good versus evil? One
              way the interdependence of good and evil shows itself is this: we don’t feel we
              are good unless we are fighting against evil. We can feel comfortable and
              secure in our own goodness only by attacking and destroying the evil outside
              us. And, sad to say but true, this is why we like wars: they cut through the
              petty problems of daily life and unite us good guys here against the bad guys
              over there. There is fear in that, of course, but it is also exhilarating. The
              meaning of life becomes clearer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">We all love the struggle between good (us) and evil (them).
              It is, in its own way, deeply satisfying. Think of the plots of the James Bond
              films, the Star Wars films, the Indiana Jones films. In such movies, it’s quite
              obvious who the bad guys are. Caricatures of evil, they are ruthless, maniacal,
              without remorse, and so they must be stopped by any means necessary. We are
              meant to feel that it is okay—even, to tell the truth, pleasurable—to see
              violence inflicted upon them. Because the villains like to hurt people, it’s
              okay to hurt them. Because they like to kill people, it’s okay to kill them.
              After all, they are evil and evil must be destroyed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">What is this kind of story really teaching us? That if you
              want to hurt someone, it is important to demonize them first—in other words,
              fit them into your good-versus-evil story. That is why the first casualty of
              all wars is truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Such stories are not just entertainment. In order to live, we
              need air, water, food, clothes, shelter, friends—and we need stories, because
              they teach us what is important in life. They give us models of how to live in
              a complicated, confusing world. Until the last hundred years or so, the most
              important stories for most people were religious. Today, however, the issue is
              not whether a story is an ennobling one, a good myth to live by, but the bottom
              line: will it sell?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The story of good and evil sells because it is simple and
              easy to understand, yet from a Buddhist viewpoint it can be dangerously
              deceptive. It keeps us from looking deeper, from trying to discover causes.
              Once something has been identified as evil, no more is there a need to explain
              it, only a need to fight it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">By contrast, Buddhism focuses on the three unwholesome roots
              of evil, also known as the three poisons: greed, ill will, and delusion. In
              place of the struggle between good and evil, Buddhism emphasizes ignorance and
              enlightenment. The basic problem is one of self-knowledge: do we really
              understand what motivates us?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In a passage from the Sutta Nipata, Ajita asks of the Buddha,
              “What is it that smothers the world? What makes the world so hard to see? What
              would you say pollutes the world and threatens it most?”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">“It is ignorance which smothers,” the Buddha replies, “and it
              is heedlessness and greed which make the world invisible. The hunger of desire
              pollutes the world, and the great source of fear is the pain of suffering.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Because this view offers us a better understanding of what
              actually motivates people—all of us—it also implies a very different way to
              address the problems created by ignorance and desire and violence: not a new
              holy war against evil, but a less dramatic struggle to transform our own greed
              into generosity, ill will into love, and ignorance into wisdom.</span></p>
