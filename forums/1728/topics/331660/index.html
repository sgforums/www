              <div><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span>The essence of Chod practice is to develop the perfection of Wisdom. Buddha Sakyamuni had introduced the Chod practice in the 2nd and 3rd sermon in general. Later on, <span>Pad</span>ampa Sangye (an Indian Saint) and Machig Labdron (a Tibetan Master) extracted the teaching and introduced it with a unique method of cutting through ego clinging instantly. The practice flourished and became very popular. Countless masters and saints practice Chod and attained enlightenment in a lifetime. The Chod practice was introduced in Tibet by the Shijey Tradition, which was one of the eight Chariots of Practical Lineage at that time when Buddhism was introduced in Tibet. The main practice of Chod is to recognise the defilements of ego clinging, attachment to oneself and phenomena, which obstruct the Path to Enlightenment. The method used is to rid the roots of defilements such as HATRED, DESIRE and IGNORANCE.</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana;"><span>The Chod puja is effective for purification of those people who have various sicknesses and especially, for the purification of disturbances caused by the evil spirits. It also benefits us in our daily needs such as prosperity, health and longevity. </span></span></div>

He is recognized by Jamgon Tai Situ Rinpoche as the reincarnation of Sonam Zangpo Rinpoche. The previous Sonam Zangpo Rinpoche was the Lama of late Kyabje Drubwang Sangye Tenzin Rinpoche, who had spent his life in retreat. <span><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></span></p>

At a later period, Jamgon Tai Situ Rinpoche bestowed him with the Bodhisattva vow and the Three Levels of Ordination. After which, Palchen Rinpoche entered a three-year retreat at Sangye Tenzin Rinpoche¡'s retreat centre, where he practiced with great diligence the Profound Naro Chodruk and the generation and completion stages. Jamgon Kontrul Rinpoche also transmitted him with the Pointing-Out instructions of the Mahamudra.</span></span></p>

(Strictly NO CONSUMPTION OF EGGS/MEAT) It's better not to have leather accessories or garments, e.g. wallet, belt, shoe, jacket or etc...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nagas</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Nagas are a kind of long-lived serpent like beings with miraculous powers. They mostly live in the depths of water and are supposed to control the weather, especially rain</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nagas (snakes, water dragons.) can be wisdom holders, and can also cause skin diseases, depletion of life force energy and other obstacles. It is wise to make offerings to Nagas, when disturbing the earth for any reason. It is believed that one's present wealth, fame, health, confidence, merits will improve, obstacles and sickness will be eliminated, one will always meet good friends and masters, has a happy harmonious family with pleasant looking and intelligent children, there will be fine weather in the region with sufficient rainfall, good harvest, and the country will enjoy peace and harmony. last but not least one will accomplish one's practices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We should also dedicate the merit both toward the fulfillment of our aspiration, and also for the benefit of all sentient beings. For example, if one wishes to be free from a particular suffering such as a skin disease, the Naga offerings made should be dedicated to the peace and well being of the injured Nagas, and the aspiration can be made that by this offering may all beings afflicted by the wrath of the Nagas be forgiven for their mistakes and may they meet with the cessation of their ailments etc. Similarly one should pray: May all beings awaken to the heart of enlightenment by this generosity and may this Naga offering assure prosperity for all beings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some of the Benefits of offering Naga Puja</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">1) Obstacles and sickness will be eliminated and one will have good health and wealth;</span></p>
              <p>2) Always meet good friends and masters;</p>
              <p>3) Good harvest of the five grains;</p>
              <p>4) Accomplish one's practice;</p>
              <p>5) Bring happiness, peace and harmony for the family and country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Benefits of offering wealth vase</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Excerpts from the treasure teachings of Padma Thinley and Terton Longsal Nyinpo: <em></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #000080;">This [Naga Vase] will increase wealth and human race,<br>Regardless of whether they are the Sangha, King or Yogis, <br>They will all be able to spread and stabilize the Dharma!</span> </em></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Just as it is mentioned, the karma and merits of humans are dependent upon Earth Deities and Nagas.  Therefore, if we please them, they will help us beyond imagination. <em></em></p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="color: #000080;">Ancestral lineage will stretch longer and develop,<br>Sovereignty, merits and material riches will increase, <br>Crops and harvests will be bountiful, <br>Tree groves and forests will multiply, <br>Followers, wealth, food and drinks will be gathered, <br>The Buddha Dharma will flourish widely and attract admirations!</span> </em></p>
              <p>The Naga Vases will be consecrated with countless substances together with varieties of waters and earth from several sources. At the last stage, the Naga Vases will be blessed by Palchen Rinpoche, Khenpo, and Lama. Upon completion, the Wealth Vases becomes a favorable abode for the Nagas to dwell in happiness. As such, they will seek to benefit the virtuous individuals who have offered the Naga vases, thus ultimately bringing immeasurable merit accumulation as well as countless benefits and good luck.</p>
