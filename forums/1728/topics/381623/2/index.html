              <p>Yes well said. Reminds me of a post I made 3 years ago based on what my Taiwanese teacher said:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><br> Anyway I was reminded of something Teacher Chen 
              mentioned when
                                      reading your post... he taught that our everyday
               reactions to the
                                      external world can be summarised in four steps.<br> <br> <strong>1) I see a mass of things</strong><br> <br> Because the 'thing' you saw is still distant 
              away and you cannot
                                      see clearly, you also do not know that you are 
              looking at. There is
                                      just the Sight, and it is the functioning of our
               Buddha Nature,
                                      Pristine Awareness. There is no mental reactions
               whatsoever (yet),
                                      nor labeling.<br> <br> <strong>2) "Wah, Money!"</strong><br> <br> When we got closer to the object at the distant,
               we instantly
                                      recognised what it is - money. The reason why we
               recognised it as
                                      money is because we have seen and used the money
               before and many
                                      times, the currency is also familiar to us, we 
              have planted the
                                      'seed' of 'money' in our 8th consciousness and 
              therefore, when the
                                      conditions are present, we spontaneously 
              recognised it as
                                      "money".<br> <br> <strong>3) "I came first, this is mine"</strong><br> <br> Due to our ignorance and habitual defilements, 
              we 'personalise' the
                                      situation by making a stance that the money 
              belongs to me, I came
                                      first, etc. Also known as 7th consciousness. 
              There starts to be
                                      grasping and seeking, desire and lust.<br> <br> <strong>4) Sin committed, resulting in either 
              landing up in jail or
                                      rebirth in hell</strong><br> <br> You took away the money you are not supposed to 
              take away and share
                                      with those around you, thereby committing a very
               heavy karma. The
                                      money could be used to save other people's life 
              or for other
                                      important reasons, but somehow out of ignorance 
              you cannot resist
                                      the temptations, and for that you will suffer 
              karmic effects by
                                      ending up with a jail term and a horrible 
              afterlife.<br> <br> ----------<br> <br> So moral of the story is... do not wait until 
              Step 4, it is too
                                      late. When 'Step 2' happens, we must instantly 
              recognise it with
                                      mindfulness, and the thought is self-liberated. 
              Otherwise we will
                                      go on seeking and grasping, leading to step 3, 
              and step 4. Step 2
                                      is the Cause/Seed, and Step 4 is the Effect. 
              Step 1 is merely the
                                      functioning of our pristine awareness, buddha 
              nature.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi Emanrohe!   My contention that anger, or other emotional outburst for that matter,  is non conceptual, is that it does not arise during point of engagement, but it arise from condition in reference to "I".  I may have "learnt" dislike someone, but if do not think or the someone, anger does not arise. Remember, emotions are a primal response"good" or "bad" in relation to self.  Anger manifest as initially as irritation, as it builds, impatience and finally a lost of mental control and if unrestrained maybe physical violence. When "self" is threatened or reaches one's level of emotional IQ, ones loses composure and becomes irrational. Anger is a lost of control that preconditioned and triggered when a stressor is applied. Predisposition, in this instance, personality inherent and not acquired.  Ever realise that every new born baby has a personality? Some are placid and content, others curious and very inquisitive, some insecure and required constant attention and still others highly irritable. This are inborn traits which not conceptual, they simply are, thus forming the one basis of relationship. The conceptual or awareness of "I" does not develop until much later. Preconditioning with the basis of one personality in contact with one's environment  and persons in contact, further develops one's personality. However, at or around the onset of puberty, one start consciously  wonder one individuality and tries different persona to develop or finds one's identity.  While is it true that sometimes, especially kind do not know in certain situations. Once if there is a reference "I", a response is forthcoming.  </p></div>

              <p>I was reading this interview by Eckhart Tolle just now and thought to myself "Oh my god, that's exactly the same order as I have experienced it". First I was lost in suffering thoughts, then I had a compulsion to transcend the thoughts as I can't stand them and what I did is precisely the same: asking Who am I? Then everything was dropped off and what remained was just this I AM, this beingness that doesn't have a form but is clearly present. Afterwards I'm just absorbed in this formlessness and next there was just this amazing clarity and experiencing everything as if like a miracle with almost no thoughts, like he said, 90% of the thoughts gone. There's just no more interest in the thought, I'm just basking in wonder of pure awareness, everything ordinary becomes wonderful. I'm only interested in 'feeling' everything than thinking about it.</p>
              <p>And I too felt that I needed to write it down "in case it leaves me or I lose it", and that is why I wrote it here. The experience isn't equally intense in all moments of my life, but this 'peak experience' is actually not a distant experience but is something accessible at any moment (there's only One) Right Now in the Present Moment, Pure Awareness is the ever-present shining sun that can never be lost. It just becomes temporarily obscured as we become fixated on thoughts, or become distracted... if we just turn the light around we discover this state is our natural state and never leaves.</p>
              <p>The thought that Eckhart Tolle's intro chapter in The Power of Now was a little similar to mine did came to mind on that night as I was writing the post, but it never occured to me that the order it all unfolded was actually similar.</p>
              <p>Excerpt from his interview:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.inner-growth.info/power_of_now_tolle/eckhart_tolle_interview_parker.htm"><em>http://www.inner-growth.info/power_of_now_tolle/eckhart_tolle_interview_parker.htm</em></a></p>
              <p><em><br> Yes. I was about twenty-nine, and had gone through years of 
                                                  			depression and anxiety. I had even achieved some successes, like 
                                                  			graduating with the highest mark at London University. Then an 
                                                  			offer came for a Cambridge scholarship to do research. But the whole 
                                                  			motivating power behind my academic success was fear and 
                                                  			unhappiness.<br><br> It all changed one night when I woke up in the middle of the night. 
                                                  			The fear, anxiety and heaviness of depression were becoming so 
                                                  			intense, it was almost unbearable. And it is hard to describe that 
                                                  			"state" where the world is felt to be so alien, just looking at a 
                                                  			physical environment like a room. Everything was totally alien and 
                                                  			almost hostile. I later saw a book written by Jean-Paul Sartre 
                                                  			called Nausea. That was the state that I was in, nausea of the 
                                                  			world. [Chuckle] And the thought came into my head, "I can't live 
                                                  			with myself any longer." That thought kept repeating itself again 
                                                  			and again.</em> <em><br><br> And (then suddenly there was a "standing back" from the thought and 
                                                  			Looking at that thought, at the structure of that thought," If I 
                                                  			cannot live with myself, who is that self that I cannot live with? 
                                                  			Who am I? Am I one—or two?" And I saw that I was "two." There was an 
                                                  			"I," and (here was a self. And the self was deeply unhappy, the 
                                                  			miserable self. And the burden of that I could not live with. At 
                                                  			that moment, a dis-identification happened. "I" consciousness 
                                                  			withdrew from its identification with the self, the mind-made 
                                                  			fictitious entity, the unhappy "little me" and its story. And the 
                                                  			fictitious entity collapsed completely in that moment, just as if a 
                                                  			plug had been pulled out of an inflatable toy. What remained was a 
                                                  			single sense of presence or "Beingness" which is pure consciousness 
                                                  			prior to identification with form—the eternal I AM. I didn't know 
                                                  			all of that at the time, of course. It just happened, and for a long 
                                                  			time there was no understanding of what had happened.</em> <em><br><br> As the self collapsed, there was still a moment of intense 
                                                  			fear—after all, it was the death of "me." I felt like being sucked 
                                                  			into a hole. But a voice from within said, "Resist nothing." So I 
                                                  			let go. It was almost like I was being sucked into a void, not an 
                                                  			external void, but a void within. And then fear disappeared and 
                                                  			there was nothing that I remember after that except waking up in the 
                                                  			morning in a state of total and complete "newness."</em> <em><br> I woke up in a state of incredible inner peace, bliss in fact. With 
                                                  			my eyes still closed, I heard the sound of a bird and realized how 
                                                  			precious that was. And then I opened my eyes and saw the sunlight 
                                                  			coming through the curtains and felt: There is far more to that 
                                                  			than we realize. It felt like love coming through the curtains. And 
                                                  			then as I walked around the old familiar objects in the room I 
                                                  			realized I had never really seen them before. It was as if I had 
                                                  			just been born into this world; a state of wonder. And then I went 
                                                  			for a walk in the city. I was still in London. Everything was 
                                                  			miraculous, deeply peaceful. Even the traffic. [Chuckle]<br><br> I knew something incredible had happened, although I didn't

                                                  			incredible has happened. I just want to write this down," I said, 
                                                  			"in case it leaves me again or I lose it." And only later did I 
                                                  			realize (that my thought processes after waking up that morning had 
                                                  			been reduced by about eighty to ninety percent. So a lot of the time 
                                                  			I was walking around in a state of inner stillness, and perceiving 
                                                  			the world through inner stillness.</em> <em><br><br> And that is the peace, the deep peace that comes when there is no 
                                                  			longer anybody commenting on sense perceptions or anything that 
                                                  			happens. No labeling, no need to interpret what is happening, it 
                                                  			just is as it is and it is fine. [Laughter] There was no longer a 
                                                  			"me" entity.</em> <em><br> After that transformation happened, I could not have said anything 
                                                  			about it. "Something happened. I am totally at peace. I don't know 
                                                  			what it means." That is all I could have said. And it took years 
                                                  			before there was some "understanding." And it took more years before 
                                                  			it evolved into a "spiritual teaching ."That took time. The basic 
                                                  			state is the same as then, but the external manifestation of the 
                                                  			state as a teaching and the power of a teaching, that took time. It 
                                                  			had to mature. So when I talk about it now to some extent, I add 
                                                  			something to it. When I talk about the "original experience" 
                                                  			something is added to it that I didn't know then.</em></p>
