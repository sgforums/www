              <p>I borrowed a book from Emanrohe, The Unborn: The Life and Teachings of Zen Master Bankei which I think is interesting so I typed out a small section of the book.</p>
              <p>Here's an excerpt from Page 87-91:</p>
              <p>What I teach everyone in these talks of mine is the unborn Buddha-mind of illuminative wisdom, nothing else. Everyone is endowed with this Buddha-mind, only he doesn't know it. My reason for coming and speaking to you like this is to make it known to you.</p>
              <p>Well then, what does it mean, you're endowed with a Buddha-mind? Each of you now present decided to come from your home in the desire to hear what I have to say. Now, if a dog barked beyond the temple walls while you're listening to me, you'd hear it and know it was a dog barking. If a crow cawed, you'd hear it and know it was a crow. You'd hear an adult's voice as an adult's and a child's as a child's. You didn't come here in order to hear a dog bark, a crow caw, or any of the other sounds that might come from outside the temple during my talk. Yet while you're here, you'd hear those sounds. Your eyes see and distinguish reds and whites and other colors, and your nose can tell good smells from bad. You could have had no way of knowing beforehand of any of the sights, sounds, or smells you might encounter at this meeting, yet you're able nevertheless to recognize these unforeseen sights and sounds as you encounter them, without premeditation. That's because you're seeing and hearing in the Unborn.</p>
              <p>That you do see and hear and smell in this way without giving rise to the thought that you will is the proof that this inherent Buddha-mind is unborn and possessed of a wonderful illuminative wisdom. The Unborn manifests itself in the thought "I want to see" or "I want to hear" not being born. When a dog howls, even if ten million people said in chorus that it was the sound of a crow cawing, I doubt if you'd be convinced. It's highly unlikely there would be any way they could delude you into believing what they said. That's owing to the marvelous awareness and unbornness of your Buddha-mind. The reason I say it's in the "Unborn" that you see and hear in this way is because the mind doesn't give "birth" to any thought or inclination to see or hear. Therefore it is un-born. Being unborn, it's also undying: It's not possible for what is not born to perish. This is the sense in which I say that all people have an unborn Buddha-mind.</p>
              <p>Each and every Buddha and bodhisattva in the universe and everyone in this world of humans as well, has been endowed with it. But being ignorant of the fact that you have a Buddha-mind, you live in illusion. Why is it you're deluded? Because you're partial to yourself. What does that mean? Well, let's take something close to home. Suppose you heard about your next-door neighbor was whispering bad things about you. You'd get angry. Every time you saw his face, you'd immediately feel indignant. You'd think, Oh, what an unreasonable, hateful person! And everything he said would appear to you in a bad light. All because you're wedded to your self. By becoming angry, losing your temper, you just transform your one Buddha-mind into the sinful existence of the fighting spirits.</p>
              <p>If your neighbor praised you instead, or said something that pleased you, you'd be immediately delighted, even if the praise was totally undeserved and the pleasure you felt unfounded, a product of your wishful thinking. The delight you experience when this happiness is due to the same obstinate, constitutional preference to yourself.</p>
              <p>Just stop and look back to the origin of this self of yours. When you were born, your parents didn't give you any happy, evil, or bitter thoughts. There was only your Buddha-mind. Afterward, when your intelligence appeared, you saw and heard other people saying and doing bad things, and you learned them and made them yours. By the time you reached adulthood, deep-stead habits, formed in this way of your own manufacture, had emerged. Now, cherishing yourself and your own ideas, you turn your Buddha-mind into the path of fighting spirits (Asuras). If you covet what belongs to other people, kindling selfish desires for something that can never be yours, you create the path of hungry ghosts, and you change the Buddha-mind into that kind of existence. This is what is known as transmigration.</p>
              <p>If you realize fully the meaning of what I've just said, and do not lose your temper, or think you must have this, or decide that you don't like that, or have feelings of bitterness or pity -- that in itself is the unborn Buddha-mind. You'll be a living Buddha.</p>
              <p>It's the same thing I always tell everyone about the Buddha-mind. I do it because when I was a young boy I tried very hard to attain the Buddha-mind myself. In the course of y practice, I sought help from Buddhist teachers. I had interviews with them and questioned them about the various doubts and uncertainties that arose in me. But nobody could give me any help. So I went on practicing very hard. I did zazen. I went and lived in the mountains. I disciplined myself as severely as I possibly could. But none of it helped a bit. I didn't get any closer to understanding the Buddha-mind.</p>
              <p>Finally, when I was twenty-six years old, it suddenly came to me, and I arrived at my realization. I've been telling others about the unborn Buddha-mind ever since. I'm sure there's no one else who can teach these things as thoroughly as I do.</p>
              <p>You can gather from what I've told you that my practice lasted many long years and that I came to realize my Buddha-mind only after great hardship. But you can grasp your Buddha-minds very easily, right where you sit, without that long, punishing practice. That shows the relation that links you to Buddhahood is stronger than mine was. You're all very fortunate indeed.</p>
              <p>Every since I realized the wonderful working of the Buddha-mind, I've been going around telling people about it. Many of them have become convinced of it too. Of course, it's not something I learned from a Buddhist teacher; I discovered it on my own. And since I did, each time I tell others about it at these meetings, my words come from personal knowledge and experience. Hearing about it only once or twice probably won't be enough, so you should listen as many times as you need to. If you have any questions about it, ask them, and I'll answer them for you.</p>
              <p>I was once asked some questions by a Confucian scholar in Edo. I think it would do you good to hear about them. He said: "I have no trouble accepting what you say about 'unborn, undying.' It's quite reasonable. While the body is strong, it's true that the ears hear sounds, the eyes see and distinguish things, the nose recognizes smells, the mouth perceives the tastes of the five flavors and speaks, all in the absence of any conscious thought to do so. But once the body dies, no matter how much it's spoken to, it can make no response; it can't tell one color from another, and it's ignorant of all smells. You can't very well speak of either unborn or undying then."</p>
              <p>Now, the thrust of this argument, while it may seem quite plausible, is wrong. But we can use it to make the principle of "unborn, undying" better understood. Since the physical body is something that was born and is composed of the elements of earth, water fire, and air brought temporarily together, according to the principle that what is born cannot avoid perishing, it, too, must one day perish. But the Buddha-mind is unborn; the body may be burned with fire or decompose through interment, but the Buddha-mind cannot. The unborn Buddha-mind simply makes the born body its temporary home. While it resides there, it is free to hear, see, smell, and so forth. But when the body perishes and it loses its dwelling place, it can no longer do those things. It's as simple as that. The body, being created, has a birth and a death, but the mind, which is originally the unborn Buddha-mind, does not. It stands to reason, doesn't it? It's the same as Shakyamuni's death or nirvana: ne is the unborn, and han is the undying mind. Both point to the Unborn.</p>
              <p>Listen closely, because whatever I say, it's always about your inherent Buddha-mind. The important thing for you is to clarify it for yourself.</p>

              <p>A layman: Every time I clear a thought from my mind, another appears right away. Thoughts keep appearing like that without end. What can I do about them?</p>
              <p>Bankei: Clearing thoughts from the mind as they arise is like washing away blood in blood. You may succeed in washing away the original blood, but you're still polluted by the blood you washed in. No matter how long you keep washing, the bloodstains never disappear. Since you don't know that your mind is originally unborn and undying and free of illusion, you think that your thoughts really exist, so you transmigrate in the wheel of existence. You have to realize that your thoughts are ephemeral and unreal and, without either clutching at them or rejecting them, just let them come and go of themselves. They're like images reflected in a mirror. A mirror is clear and bright and reflects whatever is placed before it. but the image doesn't remain in the mirror. The buddha-mind is ten thousand times brighter than any mirror and is marvelously illuminative besides. All thoughts vanish tracelessly into its light.</p>

              <p>Hi ! From what I've read in the original post, is "unborn/ undying" presumably, as I interpret, means eternal or omnipresent. Sensations as hearing , seeing,means "instinctively knowing" or conciousness. The differentiation of conceptual and non-conceptual conciousness and also duality in reference to I.                                                                                                    I could interpreting out of context, but, is the author implying an everpresent conciousness devoid or uneffected by conceptual and non bi-polar self- referencing. Since it is unborn but omnipresent, is that meant to be a metaphor or an actual phenomenon?</p>

              <p>In a way our Buddha-Nature is ever present and cannot be touched by our conceptual mind, yes. We cannot hope to grasp Buddha-Nature conceptually. But in fact concepts are simply thoughts arising and perceived through Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>In the case of bird chirping, without your thoughts or intention to hear it, and you don't even know you are going to hear it the next moment, nevertheless the sound of bird chirping is spontaneously arising and perceived by your Buddha-Nature.</p>
              <p>It is the same case for thoughts. Thoughts simply arise spontaneously and are perceived spontaneously through Buddha-Nature. However, you are not the thinker of the thought, the thought simply arise spontaneously.</p>
              <p>So is Buddha-Nature separate from concepts? Well, it certainly cannot be perceived by concepts, any more than the thought 'I hear bird chirping' can actually hear the bird chirping, but nevertheless, concepts are perceived spontaneously through Buddha-Nature.</p>

              <p>What I'm saying is -- the thought 'I perceive' is not capable of perceiving. What is it that perceives? That which perceives, is not graspable by thought but nevertheless given names like Buddha-Nature, Intrinsic Awareness, and so on. It is not separate from all the appearances it reflects. Buddha-Nature simply perceives everything like a mirror, without even your intention to do so, or thoughts or forehand knowledge of what you are going to perceive next.</p>
              <p>Everything arises spontaneously in this manner and is perceived through Buddha-Nature. Also, thoughts are likewise -- can you ever know what is your next thought or do you only know it when it comes? You only perceives the thought when it comes and you cannot know the next thought, in other words the thoughts is just spontaneously happening of its own accord, and there is no such thing as a thinker of thought. And whatever thoughts arise too are naturally perceived through Buddha-Nature.</p>

              <p>And that instinct, conditioned response, is too happening through and as the mirror like awareness. Without this awareness, there can be no perception, no movement, no response, no universe.</p>
              <p>Now as you said, the responses are conditioned, which means after you were borned, you were conditioned by your parents, societies, teachers, friends, TV, etc to respond and act in a certain way. When you see your mother, you call 'mummy', when you see your father, you call 'daddy', and so on. All these are learnt, conditioned responses.</p>
              <p>However even before such conditionings, even before you were born into this world, all you have is this Unborn Buddha-Mind, which simply perceives everything as it is even before your conditioning steps in, without even a thought or intention (which are shaped by your conditioning), you are able to perceive, see, hear, smell -- all is the natural functioning of the Unborn Buddha-Mind. And if you are to act in a conditioned way, that too is only made possible by the Unborn Buddha-Mind.</p>

              <p>Conceptuality begins with labels and interpretations of things. Prior to that it is just bare awareness of everything as it is. To be aware without the conceptual labelling is known as the practice of 'mindfulness'.</p>

                                                        is the English translation of the Pali word <em>Sati</em>.
                                       <em>Sati</em> is an activity. What exactly is that? There can be no 
                                      precise 
                                                        answer, at least not in words. Words are devised by 
                                      the symbolic 
                                                        levels of the mind and they describe those realities 
                                      with which 
                                                        symbolic thinking deals. Mindfulness is pre-symbolic. 
                                      It is 
                                                        not shackled to logic. Nevertheless, Mindfulness can 
                                      be experienced 
                                                        -- rather easily -- and it can be described, as long 
                                      as you 
                                                        keep in mind that the words are only fingers pointing 
                                      at the 
                                                        moon. They are not the thing itself. The actual 
                                      experience lies 
                                                        beyond the words and above the symbols. Mindfulness 
                                      could be 
                                                        describes in completely different terms than will be 
                                      used here 
                                                        and each description could still be correct. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">Mindfulness 
                                                        is a subtle process that you are using at this very 
                                      moment. 
                                                        The fact that this process lies above and beyond words
                                       does 
                                                        not make it unreal--quite the reverse. Mindfulness is 
                                      the reality 
                                                        which gives rise to words--the words that follow are 
                                      simply 
                                                        pale shadows of reality. So, it is important to 
                                      understand that 
                                                        everything that follows here is analogy. It is not 
                                      going to 
                                                        make perfect sense. It will always remain beyond 
                                      verbal logic. 
                                                        But you can experience it. The meditation technique 
                                      called Vipassana 
                                                        (insight) that was introduced by the Buddha about 
                                      twenty-five 
                                                        centuries ago is a set of mental activities 
                                      specifically aimed 
                                                        at experiencing a state of uninterrupted Mindfulness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; color: #000000; font-size: small;">When 
                                                        you first become aware of something, there is a 
                                      fleeting instant 
                                                        of pure awareness just before you conceptualize the 
                                      thing, before 
                                                        you identify it. That is a stage of Mindfulness. 
                                      Ordinarily, 
                                                        this stage is very short. It is that flashing split 
                                      second just 
                                                        as you focus your eyes on the thing, just as you focus
                                       your 
                                                        mind on the thing, just before you objectify it, clamp
                                       down 
                                                        on it mentally and segregate it from the rest of 
                                      existence. 
                                                        It takes place just before you start thinking about 
                                      it--before 
                                                        your mind says, "Oh, it's a dog." That flowing, 
                                      soft-focused 
                                                        moment of pure awareness is Mindfulness. In that brief
                                       flashing 
                                                        mind-moment you experience a thing as an un-thing. You
                                       experience 
                                                        a softly flowing moment of pure experience that is 
                                      interlocked 
                                                        with the rest of reality, not separate from it. 
                                      Mindfulness 
                                                        is very much like what you see with your peripheral 
                                      vision as 
                                                        opposed to the hard focus of normal or central vision.
                                       Yet this 
                                                        moment of soft, unfocused, awareness contains a very 
                                      deep sort 
                                                        of knowing that is lost as soon as you focus your mind
                                       and objectify 
                                                        the object into a thing. In the process of ordinary 
                                      perception, 
                                                        the Mindfulness step is so fleeting as to be 
                                      unobservable. We 
                                                        have developed the habit of squandering our attention 
                                      on all 
                                                        the remaining steps, focusing on the perception, 
                                      recognizing 
                                                        the perception, labeling it, and most of all, getting 
                                      involved 
                                                        in a long string of symbolic thought about it. That 
                                      original 
                                                        moment of Mindfulness is rapidly passed over. It is 
                                      the purpose 
                                                        of the above mentioned Vipassana (or insight)

              <p>This has nothing to do with reaching a state of thoughtlessness or in fact reaching any future state of experience -- you (buddha-nature) already are what you already are -- it is your ordinary present awareness than a special state of experience, your present awareness that is cognizing the words displayed on the screen, the sound of air con humming, the thoughts appearing in your mind.</p>
              <p>This is about realising That (You) which shines equally in, and unaffected by, the presence or absence of thoughts. Pure Awareness is certainly not the same as thoughts, for even if you pause all your thoughts and concepts for a moment, Pure Awareness IS. Nevertheless even in the midst of experiences and thoughts, Pure Awareness IS, and in fact couldn't be otherwise -- without Awareness there can be no thoughts, no experience, no world.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>At some point we may experience moments of thought-free pure awareness or even have it last for hours and yet it seems to get 'lost' the next day. What happens is that the habits of mind seems to arise again, the doubts, sense of self, sense of separation and all the resultant (imagined) problems - which isn't in itself (and shouldn't be made into) a problem - but the insight has to be refined. At this point the practitioner may be impelled to dwell in naked awareness to experience awareness more 'clearly' without thoughts, which isn't wrong as a practice -- it is important to experience awareness nakedly (just sense, feel, be, without thoughts), however what is very important also is actually to realise that this Awareness is not an experience among other experiences, but rather it is the underlying nature, like a canvas, in which all experiences are painted on. The paintings can change, but never at any moment can the underlying Awareness be lost. You realise you haven't actually 'lost' Awareness. This Ground Reality, being not a 'thing' among others, but rather the underlying nature of everything, does not come, does not go, does not have birth or death, hence known as the 'Unborn Buddha-Mind'. So whatever you experience changes, but never Awareness as such -- the primordial Ground of Reality, your Original Face.</strong></span></p>
              <p>At this point it is no longer a matter of integrating Awareness into everyday life, all efforts are extra and unnecessary -- rather it is a Realisation that you go through your daily life never separated from this fundamental ground of reality from which all manifestation springs from and return to. This is the fundamental insight of I AMness. This is not the final realisation, but is an important step.</p>
              <p>Thoughts like all other phenomena simply self-arise and self-dissolve in the radiance of the Unborn Buddha-Mind. Everything, thoughts, sight, sounds, sensations, all are the manifestation of this radiance of our Knowing Presence, without which nothing is.</p>
              <p>Knowing your true nature as this Knowing Presence, then nothing is a problem. Not recognizing this and investing identification with the world of objects, your mind, body, mental identity is the cause of all (imagined) problems, all fears, all anxieties, all attachments and suffering.</p>
              <p>As Ajahn Chah overcame his fears while meditating on the cemetary:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"...In his mind’s eye he could see the charred body. He could see<br>a skeleton with guts hanging out, the scorched bits of flesh hanging<br>off, skin and eyes dropping down the cheek, and a half-burned<br>mouth. As he felt this rank mess of flesh walking towards him,<br>he told himself: “Don’t believe it. This is just your imagination.<br>Stop, be still, concentrate, and let go of the fear.” In the meantime,<br>the footsteps were getting closer and closer. Then he heard<br>the steps going around and around him. Thump, thump, thump,<br>circling around again and again. By this time he was in a state of<br>white-hot fear. He had gone beyond anxiety. His body was locked<br>solid and sweating bullets; he was absolutely rigid.</p>
              <p><br>Then this presence came and stood right in front of him.<br>Ajahn Chah was still determined to keep his eyes closed, not<br>even a peek. At this point, he was so completely fear-stricken it<br>burst. The fear system was going at absolutely full force when<br>suddenly he had the thought: “All these years I’ve been reciting,<br>‘The body is impermanent, feeling is impermanent, perceptions<br>are impermanent. The body is not self, feelings are not self, perceptions<br>are not self, mental formations are not self, consciousness<br>is not self.’” So he wasn’t just afraid, he was also very con-</p>
              <p>centrated and very alert. The insight flashed into his consciousness:<br>“Even if this is some terrible ghoulish monster that is going<br>to attack me, all that it can attack is that which is not me. All<br>that it can harm is the body, the feelings, the perceptions, mental<br>formations, and consciousness. That is the only stuff that can get<br>damaged, and that’s not me, that’s not self. That which knows all<br>of these cannot be touched.”</p>
              <p><br>And instantly the feelings of terror evaporated. It was like<br>switching on a light. It disappeared completely and he went into<br>an incredibly blissful state. He went straight from total<br>dukkha—pain and incandescent fear—to an extraordinary bliss.<br>His mind was alert, and as that happened he heard the footsteps—<br>thump, thump, thump—getting fainter. Eventually the<br>footsteps disappeared. He never found out their source."</p>

              <p>About I AMness, I shared this with someone at the I AM stage on another board based on a sharing by Thusness. By refining the I AM in these 4 aspects, non dual insight also eventually arise.</p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><em>Thusness told me that at present try not to talk too much about non-dual
                   and he also talked to me about the deepening of the "I AM" in 4 
                  aspects: 1) the aspect of impersonality, 2) the aspect of the degree of 
                  luminosity, 3) the aspect of dissolving the need to re-confirm and abide
                   in I AMness and understanding why such a need is irrelevant, 4) the 
                  aspect of experiencing effortlessness.<br><br> Impersonality will help dissolve the sense of self but it has the danger
                   of making one attached to a metaphysical essence. It makes a 
                  practitioner feel "God". </em> <em><br><br> The degree of luminosity refers to feeling with entire being, feel 
                  wholely and directly without thoughts. Feeling 'realness' of whatever 
                  one encounters, the tree bark, the sand, etc. (see the next post)</em> <em><br><br> Dissolving the need to re-confirm is important as whatever is done is an
                   attempt to distant itself from itself, if there is no way one can 
                  distant from the "I AM", the attempt to abide in it is itself an 
                  illusion.</em> <em><br><br> On the other hand, abiding in presence is a form of meditative practice,
                   like chanting, and leads to absorption. It can result in the oceanic 
                  experience. But once one focuses on the 4 aspects mentioned above, one 
                  will have that experience too.</em> <em><br><br> Also, as for I AMness, there are varying degrees. It is related to the 
                  five categories of Koan.</em> <em><br><br> In Zen tradition, different koan were meant for different purposes. For 
                  example the experience derived from the koan “before birth who are you?”
                   (which leads to the realisation/experience of I AMness) is not the same
                   as the Hakuin’s koan of “what is the sound of one hand clapping?” The 
                  five categories of koan in Zen                         ranges from 
                  hosshin [introductory koan - Either What is your original face before 
                  birth? or Mu] that give practitioner the  first glimpse of              
                             ultimate reality to five-ranks that aims to  awaken 
                  practitioner the                         spontaneous unity of relative 
                  and absolute  (non-duality).</em> <em><br><br> Similarly different techniques can also be devised to allow a 
                  practitioner to experience the different qualities of Awareness. The 
                  experience of “impersonality” is not the same as the experience of the 
                  “pristineness” of our nature; the experience of “oneness” is also not 
                  the same experience as spontaneity; the experience of non-dual without a
                   subject and object split does not necessary result in the thorough 
                  insight of anatta; the experience of anatta is also not the same 
                  experience when a practitioner thoroughly sees the emptiness nature of 
                  phenomena. Hence, there are the 5 categories of koan. It is not a one 
                  for all sort of medicine. </em></p>
              <p><em>....</em></p>
              <p><em>Here's a good post on 'the degree of luminosity' by a friend 'JonLS' or 
                  'Amadeus':<br><br> I was walking through the park on my way home when something happened. 
                  Something holy arose from within and took over. I was standing there 
                  looking out at the trees and the grass like it was the first time I was 
                  seeing them. I was looking at my hands and feeling my body as it moved 
                  and I was marvelling at being alive and being in this body. I was 
                  acutely aware of being in the world, that I was a separate being in the 
                  world. I was enjoying all this as a child would enjoy a new and novel 
                  experience. I went over to a tree and grabbed a branch, I touched it 
                  softly and then grabbed it firmly, I really wanted to feel the tree, I 
                  really wanted to be there with it, to be present, to feel and see and 
                  take it all in. I bent down and touched the trunk near the roots, it was
                   very real, very solid to my touch, it felt very alive. I noticed some 
                  bare earth around the tree trunk and picked up a chunk and broke it in 
                  my hand and watched and felt it crumble and stream through my fingers as
                   it fell down to the earth. I was feeling so primal, so alive, I went 
                  around to the other side of the tree where the branches were a little 
                  higher off the ground and sqatted under the branches near the tree trunk
                   and put my hand on the trunk and left it there. I was feeling the roots
                   and feeling extremely rooted myself in being. I stayed there for a few 
                  minutes, the feelings arising were so intense and overwhelming that 
                  tears were streaming down my face. Finally I left the tree and moved 
                  closer to the bench and sat and watched the crescent moon in the clear 
                  blue sky, there was a very bright star right beside it, so bright that I
                   thought it might be the headlight of a plane heading towards me. I sat 
                  there and watched this scene and marvelled at life and being alive. </em> <em><br><br> I finally got up and was going to go inside but I had to walk by the 
                  sandbox and I was immediately attracted to the sand. I bent down and 
                  started letting the sand run through my fingers, feeling the texture of 
                  the grains on the skin of my hand. I dug deeply into the sand and 
                  noticed that the sand was very damp when you dug down 3 or 4 inches. And
                   then I found a flat stone. I don't know why this was so fascinating but
                   I was like a little child, I would pick up the stone with a handful of 
                  sand and squeeze the sand so it would run through my fingers and then I 
                  would feel the hard stone pressing against the flesh of my palm and 
                  fingers. It was like finding a treasure, I did this over and over again. </em> <em><br><br> I left the sandbox and moved over to a very large pine tree and grabbed 
                  on the branches really hard. I gave a really good pull on it and ripped 
                  that piece of branch clean off and allowed the needles to run through my
                   fingers as they fell through the ground. I grabbed two branches, and 
                  held on really tight like I was holding hands with the pine tree, I 
                  looked up at it and was just present with it for a little while. But 
                  things were beginning to feel really intense inside of me so I went 
                  inside. </em> <em><br><br> I went in the bedroom to change and got undressed, but when I was 
                  completely undressed I was drawn down to my knees and I bent very low 
                  with my forehead against the carpet. The energy was flowing like crazy 
                  inside, it felt like it was all emanating from the gut area. My head was
                   on the carpet and my gut was much higher since I was still on my knees,
                   this felt right as it had so many times before. Energy was flowing from
                   my gut down through my head and out. But the energy also radiated 
                  outwards in all directions at the same time, like a sacred sun was 
                  shining in my gut. It was extremely intense and overwhelming and 
                  continued for at least 15 minutes. </em> <em><br><br> I have no idea what is going on and I don't care. It feels very right 
                  and it makes everything sacred, my own body, and everything else in the 
                  world. It's almost a mystical experience at times to be alive. </em> <em><br><br> I'm completely filled by this experience, it's overflowing. </em> <em><br><br> I love you. </em></p>

              <p>Dear weychin and all,</p>
              <p>To hear without any thought, idea or interpretation is conceptualisation. To have the idea of hearing is also conceptualisation. So there is just IT(which is also a conceptualisation). So what is before that? It cannot be said or explained because any words or explanations is conceptualisation. You must find it yourself.</p>
              <p>In the zen school of Buddhism, it is taught that all is Buddha nature. In saying all, I do mean all, everything from the way your mind manifests, comes into being, works, plants, people, everything in this world, your perception, everything is Buddha nature. Thus, here Bankei is simply stating a small part of Buddha nature, which is the ability to differentiate between sounds.</p>
              <p>However, the sound is Buddha nature, the hearing is Buddha nature, the ear is Buddha nature, the ear consciousness is Buddha nature, the perceiving the sound is Buddha nature and the distinguishing and naming and conceptualising of the source of the sound by your intellectual capability is also Buddha nature. Remembering is Buddha nature, not remembering is also Buddha nature and so the list goes on. The essential meaning here is that Buddha nature is not something very special. It is right under your feet so to speak (a bad analogy but hopefully it gives u a better idea). That said, what I mentioned is just a conceptual idea of it. The task is to really experience and 'touch' the Buddha nature so to speak. That is the aim. Well, I might have talked too much about Buddha nature already. But once a person realises Buddha nature, one sort of re-lives his life. Buddha nature is thus said to be not far away. And we are said to be within the the Path or already It just that we don't know. So the not knowing is ignorance. In zen, the words Unborn, Buddha nature, Buddha, True Nature, Truth, Path, It are all taken to be equivalent. They are just names of the Essential which is also a name. So we must get what this name is refering to. So what is it?</p>

              <p>I think 'What is it' is a powerful koan and pointer. Whatever you say isn't It (it's your interpretation of It, which thus is not It), you can only 'know' it by becoming ONE with it. Actually there is not even a becoming one, there is only actually IT, our mind merely projects separation.</p>
              <p>When we experience Awareness directly without using our thoughts, everything is experienced as having a magical, alive, shimmery, fresh, amazing and blissful quality to it. Life is not not the 'boring and ordinary' as the mind interpretes it, even the most ordinary things rings of 'awesomeness'. You will be naturally attracted, pulled towards the pristine awareness than to stressful thoughts. The ego will melt in the wonder and majesty of awareness. Awareness will literally blow your mind away <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">  One moment I was just dreaming stressful thoughts, the other moment I 'woke up' and was totally drawn to Awareness itself... there was no compulsion for me to go back to the dream. It's just such a huge contrast. Sometimes it's so blissful that people around me wonder why I'm smiling. But surely I'm not mad... it's mad to not notice Life... hahaha</p>

                      least the wisdom acquired from "The Way" is always in hindsight!
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                       
                                    This is the reason
                      I look towards Buddhism and later became one.  One of the key
                      reasons is there strong understanding of human nature and deals
                      with suffering. cont.-  </p>

              <p>That's right. When you are practicing martial arts, or any intense sport, mind steps out and everything is done in pure spontaneity and oneness.</p>
              <p>Yet actually... this is not merely an experience in martial arts... actually it applies in all moments of life! It can be realised. :)</p>
              <p>When you walk, your true nature's innate wisdom will lead you away from danger, you will naturally avoid banging into trees or people, even while you are at perfect ease, without using thoughts.</p>
              <p>However most of us are in a dream-like state of distraction, than resting in thought free recognition of our primordial state.</p>
