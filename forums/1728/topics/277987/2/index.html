            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by TheGoodEarth (<span style="color: blue;">sinweiy</span>) (<span style="color: red;">yamizi</span>):<br><br>As for Buddhism, no such thing as doing God's work, rite? Also, salvation is not thru Buddha but thru one's own karma and practicing the dhamma - rite?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">depends, it's not exactly true. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">This I agree with sinweiy, although I don't know what he meant exactly. The salvation in Buddhism, at least to my understanding, will be the practice of the Dhamma. Kamma is the residue seed that is stored in our deep conscious mind, it is the result of our actions, speech and thoughts. Henceforth, the practice of the Dhamma becomes the primary factor of our salvation. And that practice doesn't refer only to chanting or meditation; but the attitude and the way we live our lives are the very practice of the Dhamma itself.</span><br><br>The goal of Buddhism is end of suffering, leading to no rebirth, rite?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">end of INNER suffering, yes. no physical rebirth is for arahats. Bodhisattvas and Buddhas still manifest "rebirth" to deliever sentient beings. As when one attained Buddhahood, one accomprise the Triple Bodies: - Truth Body(Merge with Utimate Truth), Bliss Body(True Happiness) and the Manifestation bodIES(manifest into countless bodies to help beings realised the Utimate Truth). </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Suffering is a subjective perception that how a person will be habitually react to a certain situation that he/she is in. Bottomline is there is no inner or outer suffering, our minds make that distinction. If one truly benefits from the practice of the Dhamma, then one's mind who is free from suffering naturally is not bothered by the "outer" (which there isn't in the first place) suffering anymore. The ideas of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas having rebirths belong to the Mahayana. The difference in their rebirths and us, is that we rebirth due to our kamma while the Bodhisattvas and Buddhas rebirth due to their vows.</span><br><br>The goal of Christianity is eternal life in a place better than paradise. So, this is very attractive!<br><br><span style="color: red;">This is VERY true. Haha.</span><br><br>Now, you see why it is much easier to sell Christianity than Buddhism? In Christianity, you just accept and believe in a saviour. it is simple and easy. In Buddhism you have to renounce this and that, meditate, make merits and ensure good karma. That's a lot of hard work to do for oneself. If there is a saviour to do all the work, voila, so simple and easy. Somebody died for my sins - that's good for me. I am absolved, relieved of past misdeeds!<br><br><span style="color: red;">Actually I will have to say something for the christians (to all christian forummers, please correct me if I'm wrong). The thing about 'aceept Christ and you are saved', is that a born-again christian (someone whom have accepted Christ from the bottom of the heart, not necessarily a convert from non-christian faith) and I mean a genuine one, from then on will abide the teachings of Christ and be Christ-like. Be loving, gentle, etc. For the new lifestyle and attitude that the born-again christian had adapted, he is literally turning over a new leaf! That is where the forgiveness of God comes in, for in this part, God forgives the sinners and allow second chance to them. So it is not as simple as it sounds like, there's always a catch. For say someone who had baptised but still go around doing terrible things, of course the nominal christians will say God will judge not us, but I (not christian so I judge haha =P) say God will certainly give that guy a hell (literally) of a good time.</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">While in Buddhism, renounciation only is required for the monks and nuns. However, in such urbanised societies we are living in, I see monks and nuns getting busier after they renounced. I used to know of a nun, besides running her own vihara, she's working on some buddhist youth project, planning some environmental project and some other social welfare projects. So I think the purpose of renouncing which is suppose to give up certain secular commitments is been defeated here. However in the Mahayana spirit, we seek enlightenement in the here and now, whether laypeople or not, it doesn't matter. Renounciation becomes merely an option now. I think if a buddhist keept thinking of making merits and ensure good kamma, then he/she has fail in the practice. Because I believe when Lord Buddha taught about cultivation, He would want us to have the good deeds done for the benefit of others and ourselves, not really about wanting to plant good kamma. That would make buddhists very hypocritical if they do good deeds just to 'ensure good kamma'.</span><br><br>I will tell you this: it is very easy to be a Christian but not easy to be a Buddhist. A lot of Christian beliefs are just make-beliefs and a lot of naive people buy that.<br><br><span style="color: red;">That is after some churches have commercialise the christian-faith. I believe many nowadays christians are like buddhists, don't read their sacred texts. They just believe whatever the pastors (or monks for buddhists' case) tells them and without verifying them with the sacred texts of their religion.</span><br><br>As for 'buddhists' or 'some other faiths' embracing Christianity - let me say this: I don't think they are 'serious' Buddhists. More likely Taoists or others who are neither here nor there (in between religions) type. Anyone who is serious about a belief must begin with an open mind and explore very far.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">maybe you would like to explore the Teaching of Pureland Buddhism. a teaching "Quite" similar to X'tianism. They stress on the Other-power of Amitabha, faith, vow or aspiration and practice nienfo and letting go. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">My personal understanding on any pureland teachings (not only restricting to Amitabha), defies the very fundamental teachings of Buddhism. As for Amidaism (belief in Amitabha), I have heard that it is a fusion between Buddhism and a certain religion that honours fire when Buddhism was spread to that particular region. Amitabha's dharani : Om Ami Deva Shri. Ami refers to infinite light while deva refers to god/deity. Why not Om Ami Buddha Shri then? But of course, pureland belief is currently one of the most popular and practiced sects in mainstream Buddhism. However, as TGE had mentioned in the last para, one 'must being with an open mind and explore very far", hence I suggest to whoever is interested in religion, not to only look at it at face value but consider spending some time and effort and look at it deep and from other angles. Sometimes you will find interesting thing that people choose not to believe in. But always remember, what majority believes doesn't make it necessary true =)</span></div>

It is true that there is no 'sin' per se in buddhistic concept, however, in buddhism we have kamma. And I have met many buddhists who often talk about bad kamma. They chose to perform certain deeds is due to the fear of having bad kamma. For this, I find that it has no difference from the christians' fear on sin. Because both choose to do good out of fear. Of course I won't say there are no genuine practitioners who do good not out of fear.<br><br>But pertaining to the sin and bad kamma concept, this is the same.<br><br>2. It is true that unbelievers will not automatically be subscribed to hell, however, in the buddhist concept, heaven and hell are neither eternal. We have something superiour than that, and that is nibbana. And unbelievers will not be able to attain nibbana but carry on the sufferings of birth and death in the samsara per se. As heaven is a term coined to be the supreme reward from God, the disbelief in God will not entitle one to heaven.<br><br>This point is the same too.<br><br>3. Both christianity and buddhism (or in fact other religions as well), begins their 'salvation'' with faith. The faith that one can attain salvation. But the direction for this attainment varies. For christians, probably will be believing in God and be Christ-like; while the buddhists whom believe that they have the buddha-nature, do practices like the 6 or 10 paramitas, etc.<br><br>I definitely do not equate buddhism to christianity, however, when comes onto the superficial level on the image, I still think that they are pretty the same.<br><br>But buddhism took a worse stance when starting to claim that Jesus is a bodhisattva. In a way trying to look humanistic by accepting other icon of faith (or in fact is it a dirty treat trying to degrade other icon of faith and absorbing it?), it shakens its own buddhistic faith.<br><br>I have a friend who bump into this total stranger and engage in a conversation. This stranger insisted that Jesus is a bodhisattva. Then my friend kindly asked him so it is totally alright for buddhist to convert to christianity since Jesus is a bodhisattva, then it makes no difference to either following Jesus or Guanyin. The stranger couldn't answer and rush off in a huff.<br><br>Sorry to detrack, but my main purpose in sharing is that do not judge christianity (or any other religion) just by face value. Any religion that can survive centuries till now sure have its own rich doctrinal principles.<br><br>What you are seeing in church or hearing from the evangelists are the results of the many evolutions that christianity as a organised faith has experience.<br><br>So is buddhism.</div>

It is true that there is no 'sin' per se in buddhistic concept, however, in buddhism we have kamma. And I have met many buddhists who often talk about bad kamma. They chose to perform certain deeds is due to the fear of having bad kamma. For this, I find that it has no difference from the christians' fear on sin. Because both choose to do good out of fear. Of course I won't say there are no genuine practitioners who do good not out of fear.<br><br>But pertaining to the sin and bad kamma concept, this is the same.<br><br>2. It is true that unbelievers will not automatically be subscribed to hell, however, in the buddhist concept, heaven and hell are neither eternal. We have something superiour than that, and that is nibbana. And unbelievers will not be able to attain nibbana but carry on the sufferings of birth and death in the samsara per se. As heaven is a term coined to be the supreme reward from God, the disbelief in God will not entitle one to heaven.<br><br>This point is the same too.<br><br>3. Both christianity and buddhism (or in fact other religions as well), begins their 'salvation'' with faith. The faith that one can attain salvation. But the direction for this attainment varies. For christians, probably will be believing in God and be Christ-like; while the buddhists whom believe that they have the buddha-nature, do practices like the 6 or 10 paramitas, etc.<br><br>I definitely do not equate buddhism to christianity, however, when comes onto the superficial level on the image, I still think that they are pretty the same.<br><br>But buddhism took a worse stance when starting to claim that Jesus is a bodhisattva. In a way trying to look humanistic by accepting other icon of faith (or in fact is it a dirty treat trying to degrade other icon of faith and absorbing it?), it shakens its own buddhistic faith.<br><br>I have a friend who bump into this total stranger and engage in a conversation. This stranger insisted that Jesus is a bodhisattva. Then my friend kindly asked him so it is totally alright for buddhist to convert to christianity since Jesus is a bodhisattva, then it makes no difference to either following Jesus or Guanyin. The stranger couldn't answer and rush off in a huff.<br><br>Sorry to detrack, but my main purpose in sharing is that do not judge christianity (or any other religion) just by face value. Any religion that can survive centuries till now sure have its own rich doctrinal principles.<br><br>What you are seeing in church or hearing from the evangelists are the results of the many evolutions that christianity as a organised faith has experience.<br><br>So is buddhism.</div></blockquote>Equally well put. But the kamma thingy is not exactly the same though both instill some sort of fear so that human will not misbehave.  The 'sinner' thingy begins by saying that human is already inherently bad regardless of thoughts and actions presently or in the past. That postulation permits the next line: the saviour. So there is condemnation yet redemption - sounds very noble and therefore very saleable.  While bad kamma may be equated to sinning, redemption is different.  There is no one 'son of god' who so graciously died for all humans so that they can be saved. Again, that self-sacrifice martyrdom is very palatable, noble and saleable. If you go by the 'creation' belief - that is the Creator God created everything, don't you think it makes more sense to RECREATE everything than to wait for the Second Coming to fix everything?<br>So my understanding of kamma is the oft-quoted 'you reap what you sowed'. For the Christian salvation, it is 'you are saved by accepting the saviour'.</div>

So while christians see that human are borned with sin; buddhists see that human are just borned with delusion and unwholesome kamma (besides that we have a buddha-nature).<br><br>Of course what you had comment on the creation part was true, God could have recreate everything, but then again, personally I do not believe an existence of such a God. However, from a christian's perspective (christians please correct me if I'm wrong), again God has a plan for everything and that by accepting Christ but do not be Christ-like, don't mean that one would have that redemption. The Christian-faith may begin from a faith in the saviour but I believe that is not the end.<br><br>This is the same in all religion.<br><br>"You reap what you sowed" is a verse from the Bible (ironically). However the concept of Kamma doesn't work so. Between the cause and effect, there is another factor call the condition. Without the appropriate conditions, the desired effect will not be materialised. So you may sow the seeds in the field, on the rock, on the floor and any other place. But only when all the right conditions come in to compliment that cause, or else that effect will not have happened.</div>
