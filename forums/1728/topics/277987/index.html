            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Tan Kah Tee</strong> was brought up in a Baptist Sunday School in Singapore. After pre-U 1, he spent 15 years in the United Kingdom exploring Methodist practices, Anglican rituals, Roman Catholic Gregorian Chants and Eastern Orthodox Icons. He had even lived with Benedictine monks. <strong>Now a Buddhist, Kah Tee will share the insights of this journey wishing that we will learn to appreciate the goodness in other beliefs.</strong><br><br><strong>Venue: BF@PES<br>30 Sep 07<br>Time: 11am<br>All are welcomed!</strong><br><br>Buddhism does not prevent anyone from learning the teachings of other religions. In fact, the Buddha encouraged His followers to learn about other religions and to compare His Teachings with other teachings. The Buddha says that if there are reasonable and rational teachings in other religions, His followers are free to respect such teachings. According to the Buddha, religion should be left to one's own free choice. Religion is not a law, but a disciplinary code which should be followed with understanding. To Buddhists true religious principles are neither a divine law nor a human law, but a natural law. Man should be allowed to choose his religion which is in accordance with his own conviction. One has no right to force another to accept a particular religion. Some people surrender their religion for the sake of love, without a proper understanding of their partner's religion. Religion should not be changed to suit man's emotions and human weaknesses. One must think very carefully before changing one's religion. Religion is not a subject for bargaining; one should not change one's religion for personal, material gains. Religion is to be used for spiritual development and for self-salvation.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quotes from Asoka Pillar:</span><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">One should not honour only one's own religion and condemn the religion of others, but one should honour others' religions for this or that reason. In so doing, one helps one's own religion to grow and renders service to the religions of others too. In acting otherwise one digs the grave of one's own religion and also does harm to other religions. Whosoever honours his own religion and condemns other religions, does so indeed through devotion to his own religion, thinking, ` I will glorify my own religion. ' But on the contrary, in so doing he injures his own religion more gravely, so concord is good. Let all listen, and be willing to listen to the doctrines professed by others</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is a common trend to see that some religions trying to shake of its relationship to the term "religion". Probably over the time people have develop a negative impression towards religion, often relate to dogma and perhaps some other conservative and impractical teachings.<br><br>Although I didn't attend that Dharma Talk, I believe it is good. I had attended quite a few church services many years ago, then and even till now when I read some christian magazines, there will be testimonies of how people from non-christian faith convert into christianity.<br><br>Despite most of them having zero or wrong understanding of what Buddhism and Taoism are about, the journey for them to convert to christians are often very motivating and inspiring. That is what some of my friends and I had observed, the "born-again" are usually more pious and zealous in their effort in sharing their new-found faith.<br><br>Whereas in Buddhism, we don't often see much of these testimonies available.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yamizi:</div><div class="quote_body">Whereas in Buddhism, we don't often see much of these testimonies available.</div></blockquote>As an ex-Christian I can offer some insight: When you get very involved (that is not just casual Sunday mass-type), you will be asked to do God's work - evangelising, witnessing, praying, cell-grouping, etc., etc. Many became very zealous and to demonstrate that, will not hesitate to hold gatherings in schools, after-schools, at work, after-work, at home, etc. etc. going on missions, retreats, bring more lost sheeps to the fold, go forth and multiple, save the sinners (all are sinners regardless, even if they do good!), therefore must convince people to believe Jesus is the saviour and only thru him can you go to heaven, etc. etc.... You will find this when you join them - no need to explain so much.<br>As for Buddhism, no such thing as doing God's work, rite? Also, salvation is not thru Buddha but thru one's own karma and practicing the dhamma - rite? The goal of Buddhism is end of suffering, leading to no rebirth, rite? The goal of Christianity is eternal life in a place better than paradise. So, this is very attractive!<br>Now, you see why it is much easier to sell Christianity than Buddhism? In Christianity, you just accept and believe in a saviour. it is simple and easy. In Buddhism you have to renounce this and that, meditate, make merits and ensure good karma. That's a lot of hard work to do for oneself. If there is a saviour to do all the work, voila, so simple and easy. Somebody died for my sins - that's good for me. I am absolved, relieved of past misdeeds!<br><br>I will tell you this: it is very easy to be a Christian but not easy to be a Buddhist. A lot of Christian beliefs are just make-beliefs and a lot of naive people buy that.<br><br>As for 'buddhists' or 'some other faiths' embracing Christianity - let me say this: I don't think they are 'serious' Buddhists. More likely Taoists or others who are neither here nor there (in between religions) type. Anyone who is serious about a belief must begin with an open mind and explore very far. Start by being a sceptic and ask a lot of questions - deep, probing and embarrasing ones! If you begin by believing already, then what is there to talk about?<br><br>My stand is this: be a Free Thinker first. Explore and examine. Do not commit yourself and then it will be very difficult to retract later <span style="color: red;">unless you are as brave as me</span>! You see, all religion somehow wants you to demonstrate commitment - baptism, seeking refuge, be born-again, etc. etc. Many people once committed feel obligated and won't dare to change even though they know it is not what they like! Worst still when they have this thing called APOSTASY, and you will be jailed or stoned to death. To me, joining an organised religion is not dissimilar to joining a gangland triad. Only difference, it appears to be very noble!</div>
