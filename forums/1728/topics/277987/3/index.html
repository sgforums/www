The extent may differ. It may not manifest itself in such extreme action like killing, but in subtle form of persecution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The simple fact is this: In any religion, as long as you accept their teachings and beliefs whatever that is said or written, and you are a 'member' either by faith, allegiance, conversion, baptism, or whatever rites, you will be assured of a place in Heaven.<br>So, to go to Heaven is not difficult at all. You see, like all manner of materialism, there has to be a promise, an incentive, a reward - in exchange for loyalty, faithful-ship, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: red;">follow-sheep</span></strong></span>.
