              <p><strong><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: medium;">The Heart 
                                    Sutra</span></strong></p>
              <p>(Commentary by Master T'an Hsu)</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: normal;">"OH 
                                    SARIPUTRA, FORM DOES NOT DIFFER FROM THE VOID, AND<br> THE VOID DOES NOT DIFFER FROM FORM. FORM IS VOID AND<br> VOID IS FORM; THE SAME IS TRUE FOR FEELINGS, PERCEPTIONS,<br> VOLITIONS AND CONSCIOUSNESS."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In this part 
                                    of the Heart Sutra the Buddha expounds the luminous Dharma of the 
                                    Middle Way or "When coursing in the deep Prajna Paramita," 
                                    so the saints of three kinds have the occasion to relinquish their 
                                    less-than-perfect views. The sutra was translated by the Tripitaka 
                                    Master Hsuen Tsang who depended on the Buddha alone for its meaning 
                                    and therefore we should consider this teaching to be spoken by the 
                                    Buddha.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The Bodhisattva 
                                    Avalokiteshvara, while practicing deep Prajna Paramita, attained 
                                    radiant wisdom through a full understanding of the ultimate Void 
                                    of the five skandhas. The Dharma of Skandhas is a teaching of existence 
                                    rather than of emptiness, but due to the depth of his Prajna contemplation, 
                                    the Bodhisattva acquired full, complete understanding of True Reality. 
                                    He ended simultaneously the two kinds of birth and death and the 
                                    five fundamental conditions of passions and illusions and irreversibly 
                                    overcame all suffering.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Turning once 
                                    more to Sariputra, the Buddha reiterated the essential point for 
                                    the benefit of those not understanding clearly. Sariputra was the 
                                    best of the best, the most advanced Sravaka or "hearer", 
                                    renowned for his sagacity. According to an established Indian custom 
                                    regarding personal names, a person may decide to use either his/her 
                                    mother's name, or father's, or both. The word sariputra (Chiu Lu 
                                    Tzu in Chinese) literally means certain species of waterfowl similar 
                                    to an egret. Sariputra chose to use the name of his mother, who 
                                    was said by those who knew her to have luminous eyes like that particular 
                                    bird. She had the reputation to surpass her brothers in wisdom and 
                                    keen spirit. Sariputra's mother was an adept of the heterodox path 
                                    and as her name suggests, she was a person of the highest wisdom.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"Form does 
                                    not differ from the Void, and the Void does not differ from form; 
                                    the same is true for feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness." 
                                    This statement highlights and expands the foregoing sentence of 
                                    the Sutra, leading toward a deeper, sharper understanding of the 
                                    Sutra's essential teaching. This Dharma might not be clearly understood 
                                    without some explanation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">I have already 
                                    introduced the fivefold interpretation of the meaning of Void or 
                                    Emptiness, i.e., the obstinate voidness of worldlings; the annihilation 
                                    voidness of those travelling the outer or heterodox path; the voidness 
                                    understood by means of analysis as practiced on the path of the 
                                    two vehicles; the Void perceived by bodhisattvas as the true substance 
                                    of the universe; the supramundane Void of True Existence. "Form 
                                    does not differ from the Void", is an observation of inconceivable 
                                    wisdom rooted in deep practice of Prajna Paramita.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The sense-organ 
                                    group produce three types of experience: Touching combined with 
                                    seeing; one sense-organ door alone; activity of the mind alone. 
                                    This point relates to the six kinds of data, i.e., sight, hearing, 
                                    smell, taste, touch and thought, and the corresponding six material-sense-organs, 
                                    meaning eye, ear nose, tongue, body and mind. All our experiences, 
                                    physical and mental, are generated and accumulated by this group. 
                                    During their interaction with their objects the senses are affected 
                                    or contaminated by earthly views. The result then is dust (attraction 
                                    or aversion of the senses) which characterizes the sentient sphere 
                                    or Kamaloka. Dust of that kind is one of the major hindrances to 
                                    enlightenment.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Let us proceed 
                                    with an analysis of these three types of experience. The first is 
                                    experienced through contact with form, any form, by means of combining 
                                    seeing and touching and includes mountains, rivers, houses, flowers, 
                                    dogs, our body and all the other forms that have corporeality and 
                                    can be touched as well as seen; the result of that contact is the 
                                    dust of form.<br> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The second quality 
                                    is produced separately by one of the four based on touch, i.e., 
                                    hearing, tasting, smelling and touching. Hearing is accomplished 
                                    by the ear and produces sound-dust; smelling is accomplished by 
                                    the nose and results in smell-dust; tasting is done with the tongue, 
                                    generating taste-dust, and touch informs of bodily states thereby 
                                    producing touch-dust.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The third quality 
                                    is the mental activity alone. It engenders mind objects or thoughts 
                                    or ideas and eludes both sight and touch. While each of the five 
                                    organs has its own specialized field, the mind knows and receives 
                                    all of them. Mind-object or mental formation is a shadow of the 
                                    five kinds of dust; the mind knows all of them, but they do not 
                                    know, cannot know one another.<br> The six kinds of dust generate three kinds of experience; but where 
                                    do the six kinds of dust come from? With our five physical sense 
                                    organs, we experience the material world. When a sense-organ relays 
                                    information obtained through contact to its corresponding consciousness, 
                                    the dust is produced. The six kinds of dust involve the participation 
                                    and combination of numerous forms in the process of generating the 
                                    three types of experience. How can form be considered the true existence 
                                    of the supramundane Emptiness? How can we call void what our eyes 
                                    can see and our hands can touch?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">We may believe 
                                    we see with our eyes but actually, it is our seeing nature that 
                                    sees. A dead body, for example, though having eyes, cannot see, 
                                    because its seeing nature is no longer there. The nature as substance 
                                    has no specific residence. It is neither the brain nor the mind. 
                                    It is vast and boundless, signless, unattainable. Despite the fact 
                                    that we can see whatever is in front of us, we cannot see our own 
                                    seeing nature. Because our seeing nature cannot be traced and cannot 
                                    be fathomed, we assign to it the term Emptiness or Void.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">We say, furthermore, 
                                    that Emptiness is the substance of our nature. Speaking of the nature 
                                    of seeing, the number of colors seen, as well as their characteristics, 
                                    are of no relevance. To put it simply, form is nature is form. Nature 
                                    being void, form is void also. What does it mean when we say that 
                                    form is nature? Because our six sense-organs, namely eye, ear, nose, 
                                    tongue, body and mind give rise to the six natures, i.e., seeing, 
                                    hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and knowing, countless forms 
                                    combine and manifest themselves as three kinds of experience and 
                                    in the process generate six kinds of dust. Yet form is not separable 
                                    from nature and nature cannot separate from form. When it is separated 
                                    from form, nature is non-form; form separated from nature is non-nature,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">We have another 
                                    example, in case some people are not completely clear regarding 
                                    the doctrine. Ask yourself, which comes first: Form or nature? If 
                                    you answer that the nature of seeing comes first, then consider 
                                    how can it manifest itself in the absence of form? If, on the other 
                                    hand, your answer is "form", then ask yourself, how can 
                                    you become aware of it without your seeing nature? There is really 
                                    no difference between form and seeing - all of it is relative dharma. 
                                    The nature of seeing, or the seeing consciousness is like this and 
                                    the hearing, smelling, tasting, touching and knowing consciousness 
                                    also.<br> The just concluded study of form and nature according to Yien Yai 
                                    helped us to realize they are inseparable or nondual. Since Void 
                                    is the substance of nature, it must be the substance of form as 
                                    well. Accordingly, to perceive that "form does not differ from 
                                    Void, Void does not differ from form", is to understand that 
                                    they are inseparable. It is the Dharma of Nonduality.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Let me give 
                                    you another example: A mirror is made to reflect whatever is in 
                                    front of it, The "whatever" may be near or far, round 
                                    or square, green, yellow, red, white or all four. The mirror will 
                                    reflect all with equal clarity. Facing clothes, the mirror will 
                                    reflect clothes, facing a table the mirror will reflect a table, 
                                    and when made to face the sky, the mirror will reflect it. Mirror 
                                    always reflects something and, therefore, it is comparable to our 
                                    Self Nature; the reflection can be compared to dust. A person of 
                                    mundane concerns will misunderstand the situation, hold the reflection 
                                    (dust) for the real thing, and struggle to grasp it. Who would believe 
                                    that mountains, rivers, the earth, even the entire universe are 
                                    a mere reflection or dust, and as such, they must all rise and vanish 
                                    in the cyclic existence? What this means is that phenomena are the 
                                    Dharma of Birth and Death. The mirror's reflective capacity is like 
                                    the True Nature of seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching: 
                                    being true Suchness, it is unmovable, and cyclic existence cannot 
                                    touch it. But without a mirror, how can there be reflection?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Their relationship 
                                    is immutable yet clearly defined in terms of sharp contrast. Similarly, 
                                    form and mind-nature are one and the same. One can became enlightened 
                                    and see one's own True Nature practicing this dharma, The Surangama 
                                    Sutra says: "When you see light, your seeing is not the light 
                                    and when you see darkness, your seeing is not the darkness; when 
                                    you see void, seeing it is not the void and when seeing a slab, 
                                    the seeing is not the slab. When your absolute seeing perceives 
                                    the essence of seeing, the former is not the latter; they still 
                                    differ from one another; how can your affected seeing reach that 
                                    absolute seeing?" In the part of the sutra we are presently 
                                    studying, "seeing" applies in the first instance to subject 
                                    seeing and in the second one to object seeing. This point should 
                                    be cogitated and comprehended intuitively. Without form there is 
                                    no nature - form and nature are of the same substance and there 
                                    is no inside or outside. This is the stupendous Dharma of Suchness.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Let us return 
                                    to the example of the bright mirror. The worldling, unlike the saint, 
                                    is interested solely in the reflection, never giving as much as 
                                    a thought to the mirror's reflectivity. Clinging, grasping the reflection, 
                                    the worldling grasps an incidental occurrence on the mirror's surface 
                                    and mistakes it for the original. The uninformed fail to understand 
                                    that all that exists has its nature; earth has earth nature; fire 
                                    has fire nature; water has water nature; wind has wind nature and 
                                    consequently the mirror has mirror nature. Our True Nature is also 
                                    like that and yet most people are confusing illusion with reality, 
                                    quite unaware of their True Nature. They grasp and cling to reflections 
                                    and dust. For them the Tao of Bodhi is difficult to attain. The 
                                    Buddha made use of many expedients while teaching the Dharma of 
                                    Truth. He repeated over and over again so those who listened could 
                                    follow his example and attain enlightenment. Reflection in the mirror 
                                    is impermanent, but the mirror-nature is constant. Reflections come 
                                    and go, but the reflectivity of the mirror remains. However, the 
                                    enlightened practitioner in the tradition of Theravada holds form 
                                    and mind to be two, distinct and separate.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">A bodhisattva 
                                    who attained the intermediate level of practice views the reflection 
                                    as the characteristic of the mirror's nature, and the mirror's capacity 
                                    for reflecting is not held as separate from the reflection. There 
                                    is a cohesive hold, meaning that form and mind are inseparable. 
                                    It is the material entities that are unreal; that is what "immateriality 
                                    of substance" means. Although it is true that a bodhisattva 
                                    is enlightened and the Mahayana doctrine more accomplished then 
                                    the Theravada one, there is still more that needs to be done. The 
                                    only complete enlightenment is that of the buddha, and it is attainable 
                                    only by means of mindfulness, by being observant and by awakening 
                                    to the Ultimate Truth. Form is mind, mind is form and they are neither 
                                    two nor one: That is the fundamental Buddhadharma. True Existence 
                                    is the supramundane Void, and the True Void inconceivably exists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In the forthcoming 
                                    paragraph we will direct our attention to the interpretation of 
                                    "he perceived that all Skandhas are empty, thus he overcame 
                                    all ills and suffering." The adherents of the Buddha needed 
                                    to understand clearly that the form-skandha is the first one of 
                                    the five. The question is, why? Why is form different from the Void, 
                                    and why is the Void different from form? Form is one of the six 
                                    dusts, and the first of the five skandhas. To consider form as having 
                                    independent existence is one of the wrong views. Actually, form 
                                    is not different from the Void. Someone asked why we talk only about 
                                    the skandha of form; why not talk about all five?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Because form 
                                    as shape is most confusing, particularly when applied to the materiality 
                                    of the human body. Feeling or sensation, perception, volition and 
                                    consciousness are the domain of mind. Sound, smell, taste, touch 
                                    and mental formations are from the group of the six dusts also referred 
                                    to as the six forms (to summarize the forgoing discussion of the 
                                    three types of experience). The six dusts are generated by our five 
                                    material -sense-organs, i.e., eye, ear, nose, tongue and body; each 
                                    of these possesses both shape and form, being the first of the five 
                                    skandhas. When we add the six dusts to the five skandhas, we arrive 
                                    at eleven forms called collectively the Dharma of Form.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The remaining 
                                    group of four skandhas is called the Dharma of Mind. The skandha 
                                    of feeling and the skandha of perceptions jointly are amenable to 
                                    fifty-one mental conditions; the skandha of volition has the form 
                                    (or Dharma) of twenty-four non-interrelated actions. The skandha 
                                    of consciousness is controlled by eight minds. The Dharma of Form 
                                    and the Dharma of Mind jointly contain ninety-four Dharmas. In addition, 
                                    there are six inactive supramundane dharmas (asamskrtas), which 
                                    brings the number of Dharmas to one hundred, referred to as the 
                                    Principal Sastras (commentaries). The Buddha's teachings contained 
                                    originally eighty-four thousand of them, but Maitreya Bodhisattva, 
                                    by condensing them, arrived at six hundred and sixty Dharmas.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Vashubandhu, 
                                    the Bodhisattva of non-attachment, distilled their content further 
                                    to obtain one hundred sastras, simplifying it for future students. 
                                    The domain of the mind is vast; it contains four skandhas out of 
                                    five and its cultivation is the means to the attainment of the path. 
                                    Returning to the analogy of the bright mirror, the reflection or 
                                    image is composed of the ninety-four form and mind Dharmas, while 
                                    the six inactive supramundane Dharmas (asamskrtas) constitute the 
                                    mirrorness or True Nature of the mirror.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Bodhisattva 
                                    Avalokitesvara practiced the deep Prajna Paramita and perceived 
                                    that all five skandhas are empty. The radiant, all-encompassing 
                                    wisdom is the Dharma of Reality as Non-action. In terms of our analogy, 
                                    the mirror's True Nature is the Ultimate Reality. It reveals the 
                                    five skandhas as essentially void. But without practice and study, 
                                    how can we understand True Reality?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">The skandha 
                                    of form embodies eleven dharmas, all of which are "not different 
                                    from Emptiness" therefore "form does not differ from the 
                                    Void, and the Void does not differ from form."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">What is the 
                                    true Void? True Void is the luminous wisdom of the enlightened mind; 
                                    without wisdom, how could the Emptiness of the skandhas be disclosed? 
                                    And, for that matter, how could anyone overcome all ills and suffering? 
                                    In reality, to break off the eleven form Dharmas is far from easy. 
                                    Nonduality of form has the inconceivable, brilliant form of supramundane 
                                    Void - the True Existence. Such is the meaning of "form does 
                                    not differ from the Void, and the Void does not differ from form." 
                                    The Buddha was aware that some of his disciples continued approaching 
                                    form and Void as two, as left and right for instance, and therefore 
                                    he elaborated further, in depth: "Form is Void, and Void is 
                                    form."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Form and Void 
                                    initially are nondual. All present form empty of self is the supramundane 
                                    Void of True Existence: It is the stupendous Dharma of Nonduality 
                                    and Nongrasping. Merely by comprehending this concept the five skandhas 
                                    are already broken off. That is the meaning of "the same is 
                                    true for feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness." 
                                    Once the skandha of form was disclosed as void of separate, lasting 
                                    self, the mind- skandhas, similarly, were found to be void. To break 
                                    off one skandha is to break off all of them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">"The same 
                                    is true of feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness"; 
                                    feelings, perceptions, volitions and consciousness are, likewise, 
                                    recognized as void of selfhood: The Void is their essence. The Dharma 
                                    of the Five Skandhas is the teaching of things in general - one 
                                    is all, all is one. Consequently, by understanding one skandha one 
                                    understands all five. The Buddha continued to expand the scope of 
                                    this teaching, once more turning to Arya Sariputra. First, the skandhas 
                                    were revealed as void of self, and now Void is revealed to be their 
                                    true essence.</span></p>

              <p><strong>My comments:</strong></p>
              <p>I think this article is good but the only point I disagree is his comments on Theravada. This is a common misunderstanding. The 'Hinayana' that the master talked about is certainly not refering to the true Theravadin traditions, but a mistaken understanding of Buddha's teaching, which can be found in all traditions.</p>
              <p>Non-duality is the nature of reality and is taught in all true Buddhist traditions. I've seen enlightened Theravadins who has true and deep nondual realisation. Though there certainly are many Theravadins (as well as Mahayanist and Vajrayanist) who made such mistakes of separating mind from phenomena, or mirror from its reflections.</p>
