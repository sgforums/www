              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In the Lotus Sutra, he reveals that there is not a threefold
              path to liberation, but one way. Chandrahas Choudhury reviews “The Lotus Sutra”
              by Donald S. Lopez Jr.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Chandrahas Choudhury Dec. 22, 2016 The Wall Street Journal</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Every morning at thousands of Buddhist shrines in Japan—and
              at the Nichiren Temple in Queens, N.Y., the Rissho Kosei-Kai Center of Los
              Angeles, and the Daiseion-Ji temple in the small town of Wipperfürth,
              Germany—there rises the chant “Nam myoho renge kyo.” These five syllables don’t
              sound so lyrical in translation—“Glory to the wonderful Dharma of the Lotus
              Flower Sutra”—but for those who utter them they proclaim the enduring mystery,
              wisdom and salvific power of one of the most important and ancient books of
              Buddhist teachings, the Lotus Sutra.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The lotus, which roots in mud, rises up through water and
              raises its beautiful petals towards the sky, is the most ubiquitous of Buddhist
              motifs, an image of the ascent from the morass of worldly desires and suffering
              to beauty, peace and virtue. Sutra comes from the Sanskrit word “sutta” or
              “thread,” meaning a set of thoughts or aphorisms on a given subject (as in the
              Kama Sutra, a treatise on love and courtship). Since there is no written record
              of Buddhist doctrine from the time of the Buddha, the canon of Buddhist
              literature brims with hundreds of such sutras which purport to reveal his true
              teaching.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Lotus Sutra has a special place in this canon. A lively
              if often confounding grab bag of parables and proclamations told in both prose and
              verse, it is rich in narrative pleasure and contains more braggadocio than a
              Donald Trump speech. (“The Buddha is the king,” we read at one point, “this
              sutra is his wife.”) Indeed, many scholars trace its self-promotional tone back
              to the era of its composition, when it had to establish itself within a crowded
              market of religious texts and sects in India. The nature of the Lotus Sutra’s
              influence is taken up by the scholar of Buddhism Donald S. Lopez Jr. in the
              latest in Princeton University Press’s excellent series on the “lives of great
              religious books.” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">As with so many religious works from antiquity, the Sutra has
              a history shrouded in uncertainty. Even its authorship is a mystery. By the
              time it was composed in Sanskrit early in the first millennium, the Buddha had
              been dead for 500 years. His striking message, at once austere and
              compassionate, offered a vision of liberation resolutely free of mythological
              content. The Buddha’s eerily convincing diagnosis of the nature of human
              suffering and the way to transcend it had achieved a wide currency in India and
              had extended to China and Sri Lanka. But Buddhism had begun to break up into
              sects over divergent interpretations of the teaching.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The major schism was between the Hinayana and the Mahayana.
              The Hinayana school stressed the importance of monastic life as the only real
              path to liberation. Mahayana Buddhism, on the other hand, was much more worldly
              even in its quest for transcendence. Its hero was not the “arhat,” or the being
              who has attained nirvana, but the “bodhisattva,” the enlightened person who
              perceives the truth but stays behind in the world to help others across to the
              far shore of peace.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Lotus Sutra is a classic—and cacophonous—Mahayana text.
              The book unfolds as a series of dialogues between the Buddha and his followers,
              many of them men of great spiritual prowess themselves. The text slowly and
              artfully builds to a revelation: that of the “saddharma,” or true dharma. The
              Buddha reveals to his interlocutors that the “threefold path” that he teaches
              in other texts—a somewhat arcane theory of different streams of learning and
              discipleship that open out paths to liberation—is actually something of a
              deception.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">In truth, there is only a single Way. But “this Dharma is
              indescribable / Words must fall silent.” (A very lucid account of the possible
              nature of this vision, which the Buddha says cannot be formulated in language,
              can be found in Heinrich Zimmer’s 1952 book “Philosophies of India.) The Buddha
              is so far gone, he explains, that had he taught such a difficult doctrine, he
              would have made himself clear to precisely nobody. Instead, he used the path of
              “skillful means” to set people off on the path to transcendence, preaching to
              each person according to his estimate of their capacity for enlightenment. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">With this master stroke, the Lotus Sutra makes the goal of
              liberation at once more mysterious and more practicable (and, conveniently,
              knocks out other sutras competing for the attention of the faithful). The
              ultimate goal, so elusive, seems almost unattainable, but this makes every
              teacher a student and every student part of a great, throbbing chain of
              learning. Indeed, following the Buddha, any teacher must think seriously not
              just about knowledge, but the right way to transmit it. In this way, the Lotus
              Sutra makes itself indispensable not just as a teaching, but as a tool of
              pedagogy. As Mr. Lopez writes: “Perhaps the central teaching of the Lotus Sutra
              is to teach the Lotus Sutra.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The allure of Buddhism eventually faded in the land of its
              birth, where Hinduism was too vivid and well-established to give way to this
              more introspective ideology. But the Lotus Sutra and other key texts gradually
              took root in others lands and languages. To the raft of entertaining characters
              found in the text itself—peasants and princes, initiates and religious masters,
              the Buddha as both truth-teller and deceiver—Mr. Lopez’s book adds a cast of
              historical figures across two millennia united only by their passion for the
              book, including the 13th-century Japanese monk Nichiren, whose
              fire-and-brimstone message declaring all other Buddhist texts but the Lotus
              Sutra to be heretical earned him a long incarceration on a lonely island, and
              Gustave Flaubert.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The author focuses on two especially interesting figures,
              both of them translators. The first, the Buddhist monk Kumarajiva, lived in
              eastern India in the 4th century, and had the misfortune of being taken hostage
              by an invading Chinese general. Over long years as a prisoner, he picked up
              enough Chinese to translate the Lotus Sutra for the benefit of the Chinese
              emperor, already a devout Buddhist. Thus the Sutra took root in China, and
              spread slowly through the Far East. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Just as fascinating is the story of how the book arrived in
              the West. The Sutra was among a large cache of Buddhist manuscripts sent early
              in the 19th century to the French Sanskritist Eugène Burnouf by Brian Hodgson,
              an enterprising young officer of the British East India Company. Burnouf
              immediately set to translating it, noting among other things the book’s
              “discursive and very Socratic method of exposition.” His French version,
              published posthumously in 1852, made its way across the Atlantic, where it was
              picked up and circulated in translation by Ralph Waldo Emerson and the
              Transcendentalists, who regularly published scriptures from Asia in their
              magazine, the Dial.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Mr. Lopez’s book shows us that translators are the unsung
              heroes of religious, as much as literary, history. Here he has serviced the
              text with yet another sort of translation—this one to a general audience.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt; line-height: 107%;">The Lotus Sutra is a rejection, observes Mr. Lopez, of the
              kind of nirvana “that is a solitary and passive state of eternal peace.”
              Rather, we are all travelers on a long road, even the enlightened ones among
              us; we cannot see through to the end right from the start and must begin with
              small acts of compassion and caring. The inspiring message of the Lotus Sutra
              is that buddhahood is immanent in all of us.</span></p>
