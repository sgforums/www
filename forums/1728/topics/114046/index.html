            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>First we need to find out what is Skhandas.<br><br><blockquote>The Buddhist view is that every individual is an entity composed of five categories of phenomena or qualities that may be thought of as aggregates, skandhas in Sanskrit; sometimes translated as heaps or accumulations.<br><br><strong>The Five Skandhas, also called Formations are:<br><br>1. form  (rupa)<br>2. apperception or sensibility<br>3. perception<br>4. volition, will<br>5. consciousness</strong><br><br>1.  Form is composed of matter made up of four elements:  earth, water, fire, wind.<br><br>2.  Apperception or sensibility is derived from the sense organs:<br><br>1. eye enables sight<br>2. ear enables sound<br>3. nose enables odour<br>4. tongue enables taste<br>5. "body" enables touch<br>6. mind enables the experiences of the five organs above, but also of its own objects called, like the word for the Teachings, dharma s ('facts').<br><br>This set of pairs, ie. organ + function, is known as the Twelve (12) Bases of Consciousness.<br><br>3. Perception is a product of the six externals above:  sight, sound, etc.  It is the individual's processing of the 12 bases to 'feel' the environment.  [This skandha is sometimes referred to as 'feeling' though that word could be used in an vague way for any of the skandhas from 2 through 4.]<br><br>4. Volition [samskara] is the reaction of the will to the objects and may produce aversion, attraction, etc.  In other words, the feeling as basis for emotion.<br><br>5.  Consciousness [vijnana] grasps the qualities of the six objects.  It creates a third member of the sets in 2 above.  These are designated Visual consciousness, Auditory consciousness, and so on, ending with Mental consciousness.   The eighteen now, are called the Eighteen (1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Elements [dhatu].<br><br>These five aggregates or formations, the skandas, are not ultimate and eternal in nature but are conditioned.  They arise from causes and circumstances.  Like all phenomena, they come and go; endure and change and disappear.<br><br>Since we are composed of these, we are impermanent.  There is no part of us that is eternal.  We cannot logically say, "That is mine; I am that; that is my Self" </blockquote>So from this we know that the 5 Skhandas are the basis (conditions) for the illusion of a Self. An ignorant mind reacts to the 5 Skhandas and the illusion of "Self" arise. The persistant illusion of an independant self seems to inherent all of us.<br><br>For example, we often say "I can see you", but who and what is this "I"? Your eyes? And sometimes we may say things like, "I can hear you", but what is this "I" again? The ears? Not only are the eyes and ears not the "I", even if they are, what about the nose, mouth, tongue, limbs, body, head or hair? So what happens if you are blind and deaf? Where does this "I" go to? They are not the "I" too. Not only are all these not "I", neither are all the 5 Skhandas stated above. Since we cannot locate it, it does not seem meaningful to attach to this ego. Therefore, a Buddhism practitioner should comprehend this non-ego-form and maintain non-ego at all times. One will then realise that all forms are false (an illusion), including the ego-form. The "I" is false.<br><br>There is an instance which Buddha debated with someone who held that the 5 Skhandas are our "Selves":<br><br><blockquote>In the sutras, we find a story of a very famous ascetic-scholar named Saccaka. One day he heard that Buddha taught the anatta doctrine. Since he was a very sharp debater he decided that he would go to the Buddha and convince Him that the anatta doctrine was wrong. He was very confident; he claimed that if he were to debate with a stone pillar, that pillar would sweat from fear. He claimed that, just as a strong man takes a goat and flings it around his shoulders, so he would take hold of Gotama and fling Him around in debate.<br><br>Saccaka and his followers went to the Buddha and there exchanged greetings. He asked Buddha to explain the doctrines He taught. Buddha replied that He taught anatta.  Saccaka countered, Â“No. There is atta. The five aggregates are atta.Â” Buddha replied, Â“Do you really think that rupa (corporeality) is atta?Â” As it happened, Saccaka was very ugly, and if he said that corporeality was atta, then Buddha could counter, Â“Then why don't you make yourself more handsome!Â”<br><br>Thus Saccaka was forced to say that rupa is not atta. Here we can see Buddha striking down several characteristics that are attributed to the atta. If Saccaka had an atta, he could call upon it to exercise authority and power in order to change his appearance. After all, atta is identical to Brahman, the supreme ruler the infinite, omnipotent creator and source of all things, as explained in the Bhagavad Gita.<br><br>But, according to Buddha, there exist only the five aggregates, the five khandhas, and these are not atta because they are subject to the laws of impermanence, suffering, and no-soul. Rupa (material form) is not atta; it is not master and ruler of itself, and it is subject to affliction. The other khandhas - feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness - are also subject to the same laws. Saccaka was therefore defeated.</blockquote>When this "I" arise, <strong>mental afflictions</strong> follows. The 3 primary mental afflictions are as follows: <strong>attachment/passion, hatred/aggresion, ignorance/delusion.</strong><br><br>Enlightenment is only possible if we get rid of "I"-thinking and realising that the true reality of existence being impermanent, interdependant with no inherent existences of anything (nothing is seperated in the oneness of the universe), conditioned arisings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A good question. Anatta is important in Buddhism. In order to experience Nirvana Bliss of the Buddha, leave no trace of a 'Self'. I have gave a simple explanation above. There are many articles about Non-Self, Anatta all over the internet. Here is a <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/electronic/awakening101/noself.html" rel="nofollow">good one.</a><br><br>There are also a few good quotes that I have posted somewhere in this forum:<br><br><blockquote>"To study the Buddha Way is to study the self, to study the self is to forget the self, and to forget the self is to be enlightened by the ten thousand things."<br><br>- Master Dogen<br><br>"A human being is a part of a whole, called by us 'universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."<br><br>- Albert Einstein</blockquote></div>

On reaching it, he touched his head to the Buddha's feet and paid homage to the World-honored one. Then he stated in verse....<br><br>All Buddhas of the past, present, and future, with great compassion,<br>Accept my homage! I repent all my evil acts.<br>In the two treasures of dharma and sangha, in the same way.<br>I sincerely take refuge without any other thought.<br><br>May I, this day, make offerings to, revere,<br>And venerate the guiding master of all the world.<br>All evils I extinguish forever and will never commit;<br>To the end of my life, I will take refuge in the Tathagata's dharma.<br><br>The mara Papiyas, when he had finished stating this verse, said to the Buddha, 'O World-honored one! The Tathagata, possessing a mind of equality and nondiscrimination with regard to me and all sentient beings, is always filled with joy and with compassion and forbearance."<br><br>The Buddha said, "So it is."<br><br>Then the mara Papiyas greatly rejoined and awakened the mind of purity. Again, before the Buddha, he touched his head to the Buddha's feet in homage. He then circumambulated the Buddha three times to the right, reverently placed his palms together, and withdrew to one side, where he stood gazing at the Buddha without wearying.<br><br>From the "Great Collection Sutra (Da Ji Jing)", copied from www.shinranworks.com</div>
