              <h1>See the True Nature, then Let Go and Relax in That</h1>
              <p class="byline">An interview with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso 
              Rinpoche</p>
              <p><em>Melvin McLeod: Rinpoche, you are one of the leading teachers of 
              Mahamudra, the highest philosophy and practice of the Kagyü school of 
              Tibetan Buddhism. Would you describe the Mahamudra view of the nature of
               mind?</em></p>
              <p>Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche: In Mahamudra there are three 
              traditions: sutra Mahamudra, mantra Mahamudra and essence Mahamudra.</p>
              <p>The sutra tradition of Mahamudra encompasses both the second and 
              third turnings of the wheel of dharma [the teachings on emptiness and 
              buddhanature, respectively]. According to the second turning of the 
              wheel, the true nature of mind is beyond conceptual fabrication. That 
              means it cannot be described as being existent or nonexistent, as being 
              something or nothing, or as being permanent or impermanent. Mind cannot 
              be described or conceptualized in any of these ways: the nature of mind 
              is beyond all conceptual fabrication. Then, according to the third 
              turning of the wheel of dharma, which are the teachings on buddhanature 
              such as the <em>Uttaratantrashastra</em>,<a name="_ednref1" href="http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/spring/khenpo_tsultrim.html#_edn1">[i]</a> the true nature of mind is described as luminous clarity. This is the 
              enlightened essence of the buddhanature, completely free from any stain,
               completely free from any imperfection or flaw. This luminosity is 
              inseparable
              from emptiness. So the true nature of mind is described as the union of 
              clarity and emptiness.</p>
              <p>The mantra tradition of Mahamudra explains that the true nature of 
              mind is bliss and emptiness inseparable. This is something that one 
              meditates on after having received empowerments, <em>abhishekas</em>, to 
              do so. By receiving the empowerments and putting the methods into 
              practice, one can realize this bliss-emptiness, which is the true nature
               of mind.</p>
              <p>Finally, there is the tradition of essence Mahamudra, in which the 
              true nature of mind is called <em>thamel gyi shepa</em>, or ordinary mind.
               Ordinary mind means that one is taught that there is no need to change 
              anything about the mind. One doesn't need to fix it in any way. One 
              doesn't need to stop anything from happening or make anything new 
              happen. The true nature of mind is beyond artifice and fabrication.</p>
              <p>The essence tradition of Mahamudra does not depend on the scriptures 
              or reasonings of sutra and mantra Mahamudra. In the essence tradition, 
              the teacher points out the nature of the student’s mind, based on the 
              student's own experience and how the student is relating to appearances 
              at the time. It's a direct transmission. Just reading it in a book isn't
               enough. You have to have great faith in the teacher and then the 
              teacher can point out the nature of mind. So if somebody wants to 
              examine the nature of their mind and have it introduced to them, they 
              should request instructions from a teacher in whom they have great 
              faith. Then the lama will give them the pointing-out instruction, and 
              it's possible that they'll recognize the nature of mind.</p>
              <p>If the student develops certainty that the mind is free from coming 
              and going, free from arising, abiding and ceasing, then the student is 
              said to have recognized the nature of mind. That doesn't mean that the 
              student has direct realization experience; in this context realization 
              means to have certainty.</p>
              <p>If people read the story of Milarepa's encounter with the shepherd 
              boy, Repa Sangye Kyap [see page xx], they will have an idea of what the 
              pointing out is like between the student and the teacher.</p>
              <p><em>Besides direct transmission from teacher to student, what are the 
              methods or meditations used to realize the nature of mind?</em></p>
              <p>If people want to learn how to investigate the nature of their mind, 
              they should understand that there are different ways to do it. For 
              example, in the sutra tradition of Mahamudra, there is the way of 
              investigating the nature of mind that is in harmony with the second 
              turning of the wheel of dharma and the way that is in harmony with the 
              third turning of the wheel.</p>
              <p>If you wanted to learn about investigating the mind according to the 
              second turning, then you should read <em>The Sun of Wisdom</em>.<a name="_ednref2" href="http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/spring/khenpo_tsultrim.html#_edn2">[ii]</a> All of the methods for investigating 
              emptiness that are taught in that book can be applied to the mind. The 
              difference is that the meditation technique is in accord with Mahamudra.
               The investigations are the same, but the way you meditate once you've 
              done the investigations is in accord with the Mahamudra instructions on 
              how to meditate.</p>
              <p>When you investigate according to the third turning of the wheel of 
              dharma, what you determine is that the true nature of mind is luminous 
              clarity, free from any stain. There is a verse in the <em>Uttaratantrashastra</em>,
               the treatise on the buddhanature, which says, "The true nature of mind 
              that is luminous clarity is unchanging like space. There are fleeting 
              stains, but these are only temporary and not existent in the essence of 
              mind."</p>
              <p>That's the whole key to the third turning—to see that the basic 
              nature of mind is luminosity and emptiness, and that that is not made 
              imperfect or obscured in its essence by anything. The only things that 
              prevent us from seeing the true nature of mind are fleeting stains. They
               are not truly existent; the stains have no essence of their own and 
              therefore they can be removed.</p>
              <p>After analyzing according to either the second or third turning, the 
              way to meditate is the same: that is, to rest and relax in your own 
              basic nature. According to the second turning, you determine that the 
              true nature of mind is free from conceptual fabrications and you just 
              let go and relax within that. According to the third turning, you 
              determine that the true nature of mind is luminosity and emptiness, and 
              you just let go and relax
              within that.</p>
              <p><em>That looks quite enjoyable, if Rinpoche's expression is any 
              indication. </em></p>
              <p>If it is enjoyable, there is still no attachment to that enjoyment. 
              If there is relaxation, there is no attachment to that relaxation.</p>
              <p><em>Many Western Buddhists of all traditions have read the songs of 
              Milarepa. We've been inspired and fascinated by them, but do not 
              necessarily see them as teachings that we can apply to our own practice.
               You teach extensively on the stories and songs of Milarepa; you've even
               had them retranslated and set to Western-style music. Among all the 
              sources from the Tibetan tradition available to you, why do you 
              emphasize the teachings of Milarepa?</em></p>
              <p>Milarepa was the greatest siddha in Tibet. Out of all the
              realized masters who lived in Tibet, Milarepa was the greatest. He 
              attained
              buddhahood in one life with one body: he purified the stains of nadi, 
              prana and
              bindu<a name="_ednref3" href="http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/spring/khenpo_tsultrim.html#_edn3">[iii]</a> and attained perfect enlightenment.</p>
              <p>Milarepa was called the pandit, the learned one. What was he learned 
              about? The definitive meaning, which he expressed in his songs. So when 
              you use his songs as a basis for listening, reflecting and meditating, 
              you have a profound and subtle support for developing your knowledge.</p>
              <p>Before we used to sing individual songs, but now we sing the songs 
              together with their stories. We have about eleven or twelve chapters 
              translated, and a lot of them are about Milarepa's encounters with his 
              students, particularly his female students, who became realized 
              themselves. These chapters are all wonderful aids for our practice. 
              These days, people like to study and to meditate, but they also need 
              teachings that are concise. The great thing about these chapters is that
               they each tell the complete story of Milarepa and one particular 
              disciple or group of disciples. They give the whole path from beginning 
              to end, from when the students first meet Milarepa, describing what 
              their encounter is like, to what happens as they practice and as 
              Milarepa gives them more and more instruction. So in each chapter there 
              is a complete path. And the songs are so profound. Look at just one 
              song, like "The Authentic Portrait of the Middle Way" [see page XX], and
               see how much is actually in there. It's amazing.</p>
              <p>As we sang last night, "E ma, the phenomena of the three realms of 
              samsara, while not existing they appear, how incredibly amazing." It's 
              only two lines, but if you know the meaning of those two lines, their 
              application is vast.</p>
              <p><em>The translations of these songs and stories that we're generally 
              familiar with are couched in high philosophical language. One of the 
              things I find interesting—and effective—is that you've had them 
              translated into straightforward, colloquial language. Because when you 
              think about it, these songs were sung often to illiterate people and in 
              the popular tunes of their day.</em></p>
              <p>Yes, that's right. That's how Milarepa actually sang them, in words 
              that were easy and that people could understand. And actually singing 
              the songs gives special power, because Milarepa himself sang them. When 
              we sing
              them we are relating to them in the same way that Milarepa and his own 
              students did. That brings the power of blessing and the power of 
              connection.</p>
              <p><em>It seems to me that you are devoting yourself to trying to 
              establish a genuine and complete Buddhist yogic tradition in the West. 
              What is the essence of the path of the tantric yogi?</em></p>
              <p>The essence of the yogic tradition is that disturbing emotions and 
              suffering are not to be abandoned; rather, one should meditate on their 
              true nature. In that way, they are self-liberated, because suffering and
               the disturbing emotions are self-arisen and self-liberated. Therefore, 
              one needs to train in the understanding of what it means to be 
              self-arisen and self-liberated, in the meditation that is self-arisen 
              and self-liberated, and in the conduct that is self-arisen and 
              self-liberated. That's the whole point. Do you understand?</p>
              <p><em>No. [Laughter.] Well, the question then is how one trains in that.</em></p>
              <p>To understand the principle of self-arisen and self-liberated, you 
              must train in the profound view of Mahamudra, the profound meditation of
               Mahamudra, and then connect everything you do with that.</p>
              <p>For example, if you are very tired and your mind is heavy and dark, 
              you don't abandon that. Instead you sleep and you meditate on the true 
              nature of sleep, which is luminosity. The great siddha Lavapa meditated 
              by sleeping on the side of the road for twelve years, and in that way 
              realized Mahamudra. The whole time he was sleeping he was actually 
              meditating in luminous clarity.</p>
              <p>If you have certainty in the profound view of Mahamudra, you'll know 
              what self-arisen and self-liberated means, and you'll delight in 
              meditating. When you gain direct experience, direct realization, then 
              you are really a yogi or a yogini. Then you actually manifest as 
              self-arisen and self-liberated.</p>
              <p><em>So the principle is that there are specific techniques by which 
              every state of mind can be meditated upon and brought to the path.</em></p>
              <p>That's right. When you are skillful and use the methods, then all 
              states of mind can be your friend. All states of mind can be your friend
               in realizing that the true nature of mind is self-arisen and 
              self-liberated, that all states of mind are actually the 
              same—self-arisen and self-liberated.</p>
              <p><em>You place a strong emphasis on study, particularly on the 
              reasonings of Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti and the other philosophers of 
              Madhyamaka. How does that kind of thinking lead to realization that is 
              ultimately non-conceptual?</em></p>
              <p>One does not need to abandon thoughts. One does not need to make 
              thoughts go away, because thoughts in their essence are self-arisen and 
              self-liberated. According to the second turning of the wheel of dharma, 
              just as thoughts arise, they are nothing other than the freedom from 
              conceptual fabrications. Their true nature is beyond concept—as they 
              appear and as they are liberated, their true nature is beyond concept. 
              According to the third turning, as thoughts arise, they are the nature 
              of luminous clarity. Just as they arise and just as they are liberated, 
              they are of the nature of luminous clarity. And according to mantra 
              Mahamudra, as thoughts arise, their nature is bliss-emptiness, and as 
              they are liberated, their nature is bliss and emptiness.</p>
              <p>The mistake comes when we hear the word "nonconceptual" and think 
              there is some difference between conceptual and nonconceptual. Then you 
              think you have to eliminate thoughts, but that's a mistake. The point is
               to realize the true nature of thoughts. The point is to bring thoughts 
              to the path. Thoughts are the friend of your practice when you can 
              meditate on their essential nature. If you can't do that you're in 
              trouble, because you think you need to get into a nonconceptual state, 
              but thoughts are going to keep arising.</p>
              <p>The whole point of Mahamudra is to see the true nature of the 
              thoughts. That's what Mahamudra is—it's nothing other than the true 
              nature of thoughts. When you can see that, then thoughts are your 
              friends.</p>
              <p>Mahamudra is the practice of not abandoning thoughts, not abandoning 
              appearances, not abandoning disturbing emotions, not abandoning 
              suffering, but bringing all these to the path and realizing that their 
              true nature is self-arisen and self-liberated.</p>
              <p>When I trained in Tibet, I did so mostly in mountain retreats, in 
              caves and in charnel grounds. What I practiced when I was in charnel 
              grounds was bringing thoughts and appearances of demons to the path. 
              Sometimes at night I had thoughts of demons and saw frightening demons, 
              so I meditated on the true nature of that and that became my path. When I
               was living in the caves in the mountains, I trained in the 
              self-liberation of all thoughts. I trained in recognizing the true 
              nature of the meeting of appearance and mind. In that way, the meeting 
              of appearance and mind becomes self-liberated.</p>
              <p><em>What does "self-liberated" mean?</em></p>
              <p>The analogy is often used of a wave coming up and dissolving back 
              into the ocean. That's a good analogy, but how it actually is is 
              something you have to experience for yourself. As Drogan Sombuyagada 
              said, "When you see on a beautifully bright, clear ocean, with waves 
              coming up and going back down into the ocean, don't you know that this 
              is the lama teaching you that thoughts are dharmakaya?" Self-arisen and 
              self-liberated means that when
              the thought arises, it's like a wave coming up from the ocean of 
              luminous clarity. And it dissolves back into that luminous clarity. It 
              never leaves being of the nature of luminous clarity, just like a wave 
              never leaves the
              ocean.</p>
              <p>That means, basically, that whatever appears is always luminosity. 
              For example, your thoughts don't come from anywhere and they don't go 
              anywhere. But, at the same time, they appear and they manifest. So that 
              appearance, that arising, is called self-arising and self-liberation 
              because it's nothing other than luminosity itself that's liberated.</p>
              <p>[Sings] "Thoughts don't come from anywhere and they don't go 
              anywhere, so how could they be anything other than self-arisen and 
              self-liberated? Just like waves on the ocean." That's how it is.</p>
              <p>Milarepa said that the thoughts and appearances of demons are 
              self-arisen and self-liberated. The way he said that was, "What appears 
              as, is perceived as, and is thought of as a ghost—whenever these appear,
               from the yogi they appear, and whenever they dissolve, into the yogi 
              they dissolve."</p>
              <p><em>Fear arises in us all the time—it is a fundamental building block 
              of samsara—yet fear is not often
              addressed as a spiritual issue. How do we work with our fear?</em></p>
              <p>The way to work with fear is as follows: See that thoughts of fear 
              neither come nor go. See that thoughts of fear neither arise nor cease. 
              Then look at the essence beyond coming and going, beyond arising and 
              ceasing; look at this essence and let go and relax. When I was sleeping 
              in the charnel grounds and I was afraid of demons, I meditated on the 
              true nature of that fear. Even now I send some students to the charnel 
              grounds and I tell them to
              meditate like that. That's good.</p>
              <p>If you don't realize its true nature, fear causes lots of problems. 
              If you do realize its true nature, fear is great because it gives you a 
              very sharp awareness of the self-arisen and self-liberated. It gives you
               a wonderful opportunity to meditate on the true nature of mind.</p>
              <p>Anger is another one that is good, because anger is very strong and 
              it gives your mind a lot of power. So if you meditate on the true nature
               of anger when it arises and recognize it as self-arisen and 
              self-liberated, then your anger dissolves and you're left in the true 
              nature of anger, which is bright and clear luminosity. That's great.</p>
              <p>In Tibet, there were yogis and yoginis who lived together and they 
              fought a lot with each other. On the outside it looked like they were 
              fighting, but actually what they were doing was using their interaction 
              as a method to meditate on the true nature of anger.</p>
              <p><em>Many Western Buddhists are confused about how to react when they 
              see their spiritual leaders fighting politically, or acting in other 
              ways that don't seem to be in accord with the dharma. Your own Kagyü 
              school has been riven by political struggle in recent years, but this is
               something no community or school of Buddhism is free of. How do 
              students react to this so that their sense of devotion and faith is not 
              weakened?</em></p>
              <p>In that situation people should know that what appears is just 
              that—it's just an appearance. It's not the way things really are. In the
               true nature of reality there is no conflict. The true nature of reality
               transcends conflict, and therefore what appears is a mere 
              appearance—like a dream, like a rainbow, like a moon reflected in the 
              water. That's what people should know.</p>
              <p>The heads of the lineages in Tibetan Buddhism are emanations 
              [tulkus]. In fact, such an emanation is one of the examples the Buddha 
              gave for appearance and emptiness, because emanations are not truly 
              existent. So we should especially keep that in mind—that an emanation is
               the very example of appearance and emptiness, of an empty form.</p>
              <p>So therefore when the emanation lamas fight, or appear to fight 
              [laughs], we should know that it's just a mere appearance. Because they 
              are emanations, they don't truly exist; they are appearance and 
              emptiness. Therefore the fighting is appearance and emptiness. It is not
               real; it is dependently-arisen mere appearance.</p>
              <p>When the great lamas fight, since it is just a fight among
              emanations, know that it has no inherent nature. Know that it is a 
              superficial,
              relative reality, just a dependently-arisen mere appearance. There's 
              nothing
              else you need to think about it besides that.</p>
              <p><em>Rinpoche, thank you very much. I thought I was going to do an 
              interview, but I got a teaching on Mahamudra. Thank you.</em></p>
              <p><em>Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche was born in eastern Tibet in 
              1934. After completing his early study of Mahayana texts he roamed the 
              charnel grounds and caves of central Tibet for five years practicing 
              Chöd. He received pointing-out instructions from the Sixteenth Karmapa 
              and stayed in the caves around Tsurphu for a year, continuing his Chöd 
              practice and receiving teachings from Dilyak Drupon Rinpoche, the 
              retreat master of Tsurphu. Later, while he was in retreat south of 
              Lhasa, a group of nuns asked for his help dealing with the Chinese. 
              Subsequently he led the nuns to safety in India; many of them still 
              study with him today.</em></p>
              <p><em>In India, Khenpo Tsultrim received the khenpo degree from the 
              Karmapa and the geshe lharampa degree from the Dalai Lama, recognizing 
              his high attainment in debate and logic. In the late 1970's he traveled 
              to Europe at the request of the Karmapa, and since then he has traveled 
              and taught tirelessly, becoming renowned for his skill in debate, his 
              spontaneous songs and his ability to present the most profound teachings
               of Vajrayana Buddhism in a clear, accessible, and lively way.</em></p>
