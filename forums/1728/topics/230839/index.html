            <div class='col-md body'>Reflections on Teaching Yoga and Buddhism in Cambodia: In The Prison<br><br>Â“The practice of religion involves as a first principle a loving, compassionate heart for all creaturesÂ” - Fo-pen-hing-tsih-king Â– Chapter 12<br><br>We sometimes unwisely think of men and women in prison as being dangerous, in there for a bonafide and legitimate reason, as being lifelong criminals or getting what they deserve, as not being able to change or rehabilitate themselves, or as being ignorant and stupid. Such assumptions show more ignorance on our part then anything else.<br><br>Men and women make mistakes, sometimes ones that are very stupid, but it does not mean that they are hardened criminals, lifelong threats to society and other people, or can not change.<br><br>The conditions that men and women must live in in a Cambodian prison are quite harsh and I am sure that anyone of them would gladly embrace the opportunity to spend time in an American or western prison with all of its amenities.<br><br>Having taught Yoga and Buddhism, and more infrequently English in a local provincial prison in Cambodia on a part - time and volunteer basis over the last year has allowed this writer to grow as a human being and as both a student and teacher of Yoga and Buddhism.<br><br>Much can be taken from such an experience and if seen with understanding, balance and clarity by others, used as a springboard for cultivating greater insight within themselves.<br><br>The point is assisting others in anyway is something that makes both ourselves better and more joyful people and along the way can also bring something worthwhile, meaningful and healthy into their lives also.<br><br>We can do it in easy ways each day of our life wherever we are, such as giving a friendly and sincere smile to others, showing a sincere interest in their health and well - being and that of their family, and offering ourselves as someone who will listen to their concerns regarding life and giving them insightful responses to assist in dealing with those concerns.<br><br>Its called compassion and some of us, in our anxiety and fear, lack of balance and focus, and tendency to ill Â– will and anger have lost sight of how to live in such a way.<br><br>It is not hard at all, though for some of us it may take some painful work and changes to get it back or make changes in our life that can bring it about.<br><br>We do not have to have all of the things in life that we may selfishly or unwisely think of as being necessary to enjoy and find satisfaction in it as a prerequisite for being compassionate.<br><br>We also can not be wrapped up in or led astray by thoughts, feelings and emotions based on jealousy and envy.<br><br>The realities of life and the limitations of the body humble us all and teach us that others share the same loneliness and confusion at times that we do, and that we all share the same fate.<br><br>We should be thankful for the health, peace, work, opportunities and material and financial gifts that we have in our life instead of getting lost in those things within that create greater pain and disharmony for both ourselves and in our relationships with others.<br><br>Yoga and Buddhism both offer us a set of teachings and practices that make us more mindful about ourselves and others and allow us to act on that mindfulness in a compassionate manner.<br><br>Right Understanding, the first step and foundation for the practice of The Noble Eightfold Path of Buddhism, is a set of teachings that we are all capable of learning and understanding whether we are in a prison in Cambodia or America or a shack in India or a penthouse in New York.<br><br>The Yoga and Buddhist teachings and disciplines are both universal in scope and application and will bring benefits to all who take some time to learn and apply them.<br><br>Â©2006 John C.
