As if, venerable sir, a person were to turn face upwards what is upside down, or to uncover the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects,' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One. <strong>We, venerable sir, go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge.

Faith in the Buddha's teaching is never regarded as an end in itself nor as a sufficient guarantee of liberation, but only as the starting point for an evolving process of inner transformation that comes to fulfilment in personal insight. But in order for this insight to exercise a truly liberative function, it must unfold in the context of an accurate grasp of the essential truths concerning our situation in the world and the domain where deliverance is to be sought. These truths have been imparted to us by the Buddha out of his own profound comprehension of the human condition. To accept them in trust after careful consideration is to set foot on a journey which transforms faith into wisdom, confidence into certainty, and culminates in liberation from suffering.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">FYI,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Faith is one of the Eleven Wholesome Dharmas of the One Hundred Dharmas (see entry for latter); it is also one of the Five Faculties (faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom). </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Faith is necessary in whatever it is one does. One needs to have a sense of belief, an attitude of faith. First, one needs to have faith in oneself. What kind of faith? One needs to have faith that one certainly can become a Buddha. One has to believe that there is no difference between the Buddha and oneself. Yet that lack of difference is in one's Buddha-nature. Cultivation is still required in order to actually become a Buddha. If one cultivates, one will become a Buddha. In order to do so, one must have an initial belief in this principle. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Second, not only is it necessary to believe that one can become a Buddha oneself, but also to believe that all people can become Buddhas. Moreover, not only can all people become Buddhas, one should believe that all living beings have the Buddha-nature and are capable of becoming Buddhas. If one has that kind of faith, then one should begin by following the rules oneself. To follow the rules means to hold the moral precepts. First one holds the precepts, and then one can become a Buddha. One does it oneself and also encourages others to do so as well. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Faith must be solid, like a rock, firm and sturdy. Faith shouldn't be like a pile of ashes which seems to have some substance to it but which crumbles at the slightest disturbance. Don't be too soft. One's faith must be strong and solid." (HD 44 45) </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">THE IMPORTANCE OF FAITH </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Faith is the foundation of cultivation of the Way and the mother of merit and virtue, because it is capable of nourishing wholesome roots. The Buddhadharma is like a vast sea; only by faith can it be entered. Therefore, the single word 'faith' is the essence of escape from birth and death and is the wonderful means for returning to the source. It is a precious raft on the stream of affliction, a torch in the dark cave of ignorance, and a guide who leads us out of the path of confusion. It is a compass for those floundering in the waves on the sea of suffering, and a sagely teacher for those in the Three Paths (Arhat, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva) and Eight Difficulties ( ). It is the origin of awakening for the Four Kinds of Creatures born (from wombs, eggs, moisture, and transformation) within the Six Paths (see entry). Faith cannot be ignored. An author of ancient times said, 'If a man has no faith, I do not know what can be made of him.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"Once two <em>bhikshus</em> were travelling to see Shakyamuni Buddha, the World-Honored One. As they travelled they became extremely thirsty but could not find any water. As they walked they happened upon a human skull containing water in which some small bugs were swimming, enjoying themselves tremendously. One of the <em>bhikshus</em> picked up the water and offered some to his companion. The companion replied, 'This water contains bugs, and the moral precepts do not permit drinking such water. I would rather die of thirst than to violate the precepts in order to stay alive.' After this incident he died of thirst. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"When the <em>bhikshu</em> who had drunk the water reached the place where the Buddha was residing, he bowed and said to the Lord, 'Your disciple was travelling in the company of another <em>bhikshu</em> who perished of thirst on the road. I hope the Buddha will be compassionate and rescue him.' </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">"The Buddha said to the <em>bhikshu</em> who had drunk the water, 'Because he stringently maintained the moral precepts and was so firm in his faith that he would not violate them even in the face of death, he received the awesome power of the Buddhas and arrived here before you. He has already seen the Buddha and heard the Dharma before you. He is a <em>bhikshu</em> who has<strong> true faith</strong> in the precepts." (WM 53-54; also S42 75-76) </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Hymn of Faith </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Faith is the source of the Way; </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Faith is the mother of merit and virtue. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">As they arise by faith, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">All wholesome dharmas must by faith be nurtured. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Faith cuts the tangled web of doubt, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Escaping loves delusive flow, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">And opens wide to reveal the true and unsurpassed Nirvana's road. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Faith has no stain or mar, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Bringing the turbid mind purification, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Eradicating pride, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Of all respect and reverence the foundation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Within the Dharma Treasury </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">faith's jewel outshines the fairest gold; </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Hence every conduct our hands by faith made pure receive and surely hold. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Faith is the healing source </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">By which our faculties are cleansed and quickened. Nothing can turn its force, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The solid power of faith cannot be broken. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">And when by faith forever </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">From all affliction we depart, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The Buddha's merit will thus become the sole devotion of our hearts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">With faith the mind's unmoved, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Free from attachment to conditioned arising; </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Disasters far removed, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">In the tranquility of faith abiding. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The bliss of faith victorious! </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Among the conducts of all worlds, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">This faith alone is the one most rare and precious wish-fulfilling pearl. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Profoundly we believe: </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Trusting the Buddhas and the Buddhas' Dharma, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Treading the Bodhi-Path, </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Forever followed by all true disciples. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">And to the Great Enlightenment </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">Our thoughts are joyfully inclined: </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #888888;">The Bodhisattvas with this deep heart of faith produce the Bodhi-Mind! </span></p>

              <p>But there's one thread I posted: on the ancient birch barks which can be traced back to more than 2000 years ago... Mahayana teachings. It has significant meanings, that either Theravada, Mahayana or other schools (if exist) are complementary to each other teachings. They are supportive of each other, but no at odds or at conflict. Although some people might not agreed with it. Imagine a bush-like development of Buddhism... not a tree-like structure...</p>
              <p>Mahayana is quite... looking on bigger perspectives i would say.</p>
