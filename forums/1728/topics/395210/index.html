              <p>First of all you must understand that in any particular age, there is only one Buddha. In our current planet, and our current age, the Buddha is Shakyamuni Buddha.</p>
              <p>All mentionings of other Buddhas are either from other universes or long past or predictions of future Buddhas.</p>
              <p>As those predictions/mentions are made by the current Shakyamuni Buddha in India, it is of course being spoken in Indian.</p>

              <p>Yes. Unfortunately, we will not be able to see Maitreya attain Buddhahood in this life. It will be very very long. Maitreya is currently residing in another realm, the Tushita heaven, waiting for the ripe conditions to take human birth. Actually Maitreya does appear on Earth from time to time as a human emanation, but that is still a Bodhisattva, not a Buddha. A bodhisattva is someone on the path to Buddhahood, and for Maitreya he is very close, already 10th bhumi.</p>

              <p>Hi romanista,</p>
              <p>This is not 100% sure. But Indians are closely related to the celestial beings and they descended from there, in a sense they are a superior race by birth.  Indian is considered an Aryan race.</p>
              <p>Even now, i feel that India is a country more permeated by spirituality (not just Buddhism) than many other places.  And also, Bodhgaya is a vajra throne, meaning, it is where all Buddhas will attain enlightenment, it is a place that will not be destroyed even at the end of the eon during the fire, wind, water calamities etc.  All Buddhas will be Indians, meaning born near that area, whatever name it is called. </p>
              <p>To be born in certain kinds of countries or races is also somewhat related to one's merits.  Certain races requires higher merits to be reborn in.</p>
              <p>I think this is not going to be well-received by some people.  If so, just consider it my weird opinion.</p>

              <p>Buddha's appearance is very rare indeed. guess how long the next buddha will appear in our world between now and when he arrives? for a buddha to appear, the previous teachings of the buddha must disappear. when the world has forgotten the previous buddha's teaching, will the buddha appear. not only that, the conditions for the buddha's appearance must be right also lar.</p>

              <p>if there really other life beings at other universe, and happend
              that they also achieved enlightenment and become buddhas, then
              there will be many buddhas from other universes... but just pure
              imagination... and i am daydreaming only hahah</p>

              <p>Hi romanista,</p>
              <p>This is not 100% sure. But Indians are closely related to the
              celestial beings and they descended from there, in a sense they are
              a superior race by birth.  Indian is considered an Aryan
              race.</p>
              <p>Even now, i feel that India is a country more permeated by
              spirituality (not just Buddhism) than many other places.  And
              also, Bodhgaya is a vajra throne, meaning, it is where all Buddhas
              will attain enlightenment, it is a place that will not be destroyed
              even at the end of the eon during the fire, wind, water calamities
              etc.  All Buddhas will be Indians, meaning born near that
              area, whatever name it is called. </p>
              <p>To be born in certain kinds of countries or races is also
              somewhat related to one's merits.  Certain races requires
              higher merits to be reborn in.</p>
              <p>I think this is not going to be well-received by some
              people.  If so, just consider it my weird opinion.</p>

                      <p> </p>The only way you can do anything useful to yourself (e.g. become enlightened) or to society (in whatever ways you want - spiritual, political, whatever) is to be a human again. In Buddhism human birth is one of the most precious things.
