              <p>Gautama Buddha asked his disciple <a href="/wiki/Ananda"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ananda</span></a> to get him some drinking water from a well. Ananda, however, repeatedly told the Buddha that the well was filled with grass and chaff, and thus not drinkable. Despite this, the Buddha continuously asked Ananda for the well's water; eventually, Ananda went to the well. As Ananda walked to the well, the Buddha allegedly expelled all the grass and chaff from the well which resulted in the water becoming radiant and clean.</p>
              <h2><span id="Walking_on_water" class="mw-headline">Walking on water</span></h2>
              <p>It is recounted as one of the Miracles of Buddha that Gautama Buddha walked on water by <a title="Levitation (paranormal)" href="/wiki/Levitation_(paranormal)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">levitating</span></a> over a stream in order to convert a <a href="/wiki/Brahmin"><span style="color: #0645ad;">brahmin</span></a> to Buddhism.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
              <h2><span id="Power_over_nature" class="mw-headline">Power over nature</span></h2>
              <p>R.C. Amore recounts a miracle from the first chapter of <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Mahavagga" href="/wiki/Mahavagga"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Mahavagga</span></a></em> (Book of the Discipline, IV) where the Buddha displayed his power over nature. When an area was inundated by a flood, he commanded the waters to stand back so that he could walk between them on dry ground.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="color: #0645ad;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="The_golden_bridge" class="mw-headline"><strong>The golden bridge</strong></span></p>
              <p>During the third week after <a class="mw-redirect" title="Siddhartha Gautama" href="/wiki/Siddhartha_Gautama#Enlightenment"><span style="color: #0645ad;">The Buddha's Enlightenment</span></a>, the <a title="Deva (Buddhism)" href="/wiki/Deva_(Buddhism)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">devas</span></a> were unsure about whether Siddhartha Gautama had truly attained enlightenment or not. As proof of his enlightenment, The Buddha, using only his mind, allegedly created a golden bridge in the air, and walked up and down the bridge for an entire week.</p>
              <p><span id="Twin_miracle" class="mw-headline"><strong>Twin miracle</strong></span></p>
              <p>After the Buddha returned to his father's kingdom, uncertainty still existed about whether Gautama Buddha was really enlightened or not. In response, the Buddha allegedly displayed the Yamaka-pÄ�tihÄ�riya or the "Twin Miracle", called so because of its simultaneous production of apparently contradictory phenomena; in this case, fire and water.</p>
              <p>The twin miracle entailed Gautama Buddha producing flames from the upper part of his body and streams of water from the lower part of his body, alternating this, and doing similarly between the left and right sides of his body.</p>
              <p>Afterwards, the Buddha took three giant steps, arriving in Tavatimsa. There, he preached the <a href="/wiki/Abhidharma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Abhidharma</span></a> to his mother who had been reborn there as a <a title="Deva (Buddhism)" href="/wiki/Deva_(Buddhism)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Deva</span></a> named Santussita.</p>
              <p><span id="Brahma" class="mw-headline"><strong>Brahma</strong></span></p>
              <p>On one occasion, the Buddha allegedly flew into a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Brahma (Buddhism)" href="/wiki/Brahma_(Buddhism)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Brahma</span></a>'s world, and explained to the Brahma that all things are transient and temporary and devoid of independent existence. After being persuaded by the Buddha's words, the Brahma decided to follow The Buddha's <a href="/wiki/Dharma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Dharma</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The Brahma then requested a competition of powers between the two of them. Whenever the Brahma hid himself, the Buddha ended up pointing out where he was located. Then, the Buddha hid himself in voidness and meditation but the Brahma could not spot him. The Brahma's faith in the Buddha was increased.</p>

              <p>During the third week after <a title="Siddhartha Gautama" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Siddhartha_Gautama#Enlightenment"><span style="color: #0645ad;">The Buddha's Enlightenment</span></a>, the <a title="Deva (Buddhism)" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Deva_(Buddhism)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">devas</span></a> were unsure about whether Siddhartha Gautama had truly attained enlightenment or not. As proof of his enlightenment, The Buddha, using only his mind, allegedly created a golden bridge in the air, and walked up and down the bridge for an entire week.</p>
              <p><span><strong>Twin miracle</strong></span></p>
              <p>After the Buddha returned to his father's kingdom, uncertainty still existed about whether Gautama Buddha was really enlightened or not. In response, the Buddha allegedly displayed the Yamaka-pÄ�tihÄ�riya or the "Twin Miracle", called so because of its simultaneous production of apparently contradictory phenomena; in this case, fire and water.</p>
              <p>The twin miracle entailed Gautama Buddha producing flames from the upper part of his body and streams of water from the lower part of his body, alternating this, and doing similarly between the left and right sides of his body.</p>
              <p>Afterwards, the Buddha took three giant steps, arriving in Tavatimsa. There, he preached the <a rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Abhidharma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Abhidharma</span></a> to his mother who had been reborn there as a <a title="Deva (Buddhism)" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Deva_(Buddhism)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Deva</span></a> named Santussita.</p>
              <p><span><strong>Brahma</strong></span></p>
              <p>On one occasion, the Buddha allegedly flew into a <a title="Brahma (Buddhism)" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Brahma_(Buddhism)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Brahma</span></a>'s world, and explained to the Brahma that all things are transient and temporary and devoid of independent existence. After being persuaded by the Buddha's words, the Brahma decided to follow The Buddha's <a rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Dharma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Dharma</span></a>.</p>
              <p>The Brahma then requested a competition of powers between the two of them. Whenever the Brahma hid himself, the Buddha ended up pointing out where he was located. Then, the Buddha hid himself in voidness and meditation but the Brahma could not spot him. The Brahma's faith in the Buddha was increased.</p>

              <p>Let's say you were an empiricist, a purely rational scientist, and you 
              decided to simply test these two of many possible hypotheses:<br><br>1) 
              noting the sensations that make up world second after second on 
              intensive retreat for 16-20 hours per day for 2-4 weeks without stopping
               to do other things beyond sleeping leads to the stages of insight: yes 
              or no?<br><br>2) developing strong concentration to the point that you 
              could stay solidly with the meditation object with a relatively quiet 
              mind for 1 hour without the mind wandering can lead to the jhanas: yes 
              or no?<br><br>The empirical method would not be to reject them as they 
              don't make sense to you now, but instead would require you to do the 
              experiments. These have clear criteria, clear standards, clear 
              instructions, are exceedingly simple and very testable hypothesis that 
              the scientific method can easily prove or disprove by simply attempting 
              to reproduce the experiments that others have already done.<br><br>Rational enough for you? Reasonable enough for you? What are you waiting for?<br><br>This
               is the path of science, first and foremost, the path of confirmation by
               seeing the results for yourself, the path of the pure empiricist, the 
              path of pure investigation into whether or not these things work as 
              advertised. Dismissing these hypothesis based on a priori assumptions is
               clearly not rational nor is it good science. How to you plead?<br><br>Daniel</p>

              <p>Then at least keep an open mind that it is possible, since there

                      talked a lot about rebirth but is there any proof that we will be

                      only is there scientific evidence to support Buddhist belief in
                      rebirth, it is the only after-life theory that has any evidence to
                      support it. There is not a scrap of evidence to prove the existence
                      of heaven and of course evidence of annihilation at death must be
                      lacking. But during the last 30 years parapsychologists have been
                      studying reports that some people have vivid memories of their
                      former lives. For example, in England, a 5 year old girl said she
                      could remember her other mother and father and she talked vividly
                      about what sounded like the events in the life of another person.
                      Parapsychologists were called in and asked her hundreds of
                      questions to which she gave answers. She spoke of living in a
                      particular village, in what appeared to be Spain. She gave the name
                      of the village, the name of the street she lived in, her
                      neighbours’ names and details about her everyday life there. she
                      also tearfully spoke of how she had been struck by a car and died
                      of her injuries two days later. When these details were checked,
                      they were found to be accurate. There was a village in Spain with
                      the name the child had given. There was a house of the type she had
                      described in the street she had named. What is more, it was found
                      that a 23 year old woman living in the house had been killed in a
                      car accident five years before.</span></dd></dl>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Now
                      how is it possible for a five year old living in England who had
                      never been to Spain to know all these details? And of course, this
                      is not the only case of this type. Professor Ian Stevenson of the
                      University of Virginia’s Department of Psychology has described
                      dozens of cases of this type in his books. He is an accredited
                      scientist whose 25 year study of people who remember former lives
                      is very strong evidence for the Buddhist teaching of
                      rebirth.</span></p>

                      Thomas Huxley, who was responsible for having science introduced
                      into the 19th century British school system and who was the first
                      scientist to defend Darwin’s theories, believed that reincarnation
                      was a very plausible idea. In his famous book "Evolution and Ethics
                      and other Essays", he says:</span></dd></dl>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"In
                      the doctrine of transmigration, whatever its origin, Brahmanical
                      and Buddhist speculation found, ready to hand, the means of
                      constructing a plausible vindication of the ways of the Cosmos to
                      man....yet this plea of justification is not less plausible than
                      others; and none but very hasty thinkers will reject it on the
                      ground of inherent absurdity. Like the doctrine of evolution
                      itself, that of transmigration has its roots in the world of
                      reality; and it may claim such support as the great argument from
                      analogy is capable of supplying".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Then,
                      Professor Gust Stromberg, the famous Swedish astronomer, physicist
                      and friend of Einstein also found the idea of rebirth
                      appealing:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"Opinions
                      differ whether human souls can be reincarnated on the earth or not.
                      In 1936 a very interesting case was thoroughly investigated and
                      reported by the government authorities in India. A girl (Shanti
                      Devi from Deli) could accurately describe her previous life (at
                      Muttra, five hundred miles from Deli) which ended about a year
                      before her 'second birth'. She gave the name of her husband and
                      child and described her home and life history. The investigating
                      commission brought her to her former relatives, who verified all
                      her statements. Among the people of India reincarnations are
                      regarded as commonplace; the astonishing thing for them in this
                      case was the great number of facts the girl remembered. This and
                      similar cases can be regarded as additional evidence for the theory
                      of the indestructibility of memory".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Professor
                      Julian Huxley, the distinguished British scientist who was Director
                      General of UNESCO believed that rebirth was quite in harmony with
                      scientific thinking:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"There
                      is nothing against a permanently surviving spirit-individuality
                      being in some way given off at death, as a definite wireless
                      message is given off by a sending apparatus working in a particular
                      ways. But it must be remembered that the wireless message only
                      becomes a message again when it comes in contact with a new,
                      material structure - the receiver. So with our possible
                      spirit-emanation. It would never think or feel unless again
                      "embodied" in some way. our personalities are so based on body that
                      it is really impossible to think of survival which would be in any
                      true sense personal without a body of sorts. I can think of
                      something being given off which could bear the same relation to men
                      and women as a wireless message to the transmitting apparatus for
                      mind".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Even
                      very practical and down-to-earth people like the American
                      industrialist Henry Ford found the idea of rebirth acceptable. Ford
                      was attracted to the idea of rebirth because, unlike the theistic
                      idea or the materialistic idea, rebirth gives you a second chance
                      to develop yourself. Henry Ford says:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">"I
                      adopted the theory of Reincarnation when I was twenty six. Religion
                      offered nothing to the point. Even work could not give me complete
                      satisfaction. Work is futile if we cannot utilise the experience we
                      collect in one life in the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it
                      was as if I had found a universal plan I realised that there was a
                      chance to work out my ideas. Time was no longer limited. I was no
                      longer a slave to the hands of the clock. Genius is experience.
                      Some seem to think that it is a gift or talent, but it is the fruit
                      of long experience in many lives. Some are older souls than others,
                      and so they know more. The discovery of Reincarnation put my mind
                      at ease. If you preserve a record of this conversation, write it so
                      that it puts men’s minds at ease. I would like to communicate to
                      others the calmness that the long view of life gives to
                      us".</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">So
                      the Buddhist teachings of rebirth does have some scientific
                      evidence to support it. It is logically consistent and it goes a
                      long way in answering questions what the theistic and the
                      materialistic theories fail to . It is also very comforting. What
                      can be worse than a theory of life that gives you no second chance,
                      no opportunity to amend the mistakes you have made in this life and
                      no time to further develop the skills and abilities you have
                      nurtured in this life. But according to the Buddha, if you fail to
                      attain Nirvana in this life, you will have the opportunity to try
                      again next time. If you have made mistakes in this life, you will
                      be able to correct yourself in the next life. You will truly be
                      able to learn from your mistakes. Things you were unable to do or
                      achieve in this life may well become possible in the next life.
                      What a wonderful teaching!</span></p>
