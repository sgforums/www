            <div class='col-md body'>Ehhh i must confessed i had killed some insects before. =X<br><br>I have noticed the state of mind i had during the eliminating insects. My mind was in a state of aversion @ the moment when i aiming the pesticide @ the insects with the pesticide ( especially when focus on the killing moment ).. Does this cause a kind of karmic imprint on the mind?<br><br>I don't feel much peace seeing insects withering in pain infront of me. Using Pesticide to kill is brutal cos the insects suffer in pain and desperately trying to crawl back on their four/eight legs to live on. It touches me when i see these insects having the will to survive.. even though they are small living things.. we shouldn't ignore their right to life too.<br><br>I admire the immeasurable compassion of the sages who forget themselves and sometime sacrifice themselves to save life. I still every much lack the courage to use my hand to gently lift these insects ( Big bugs like roaches ) away. yah i have a phobia for insects. Irrational fears.<br><br>Sometime. insects buzzing around me are especially annoying. i feel peaceful when i refrain from killing and letting them go, partly i am controlling my annoyment with them.. Sometime that particular annoying feeling of Bug-bothering will just disappear soon after. suddenly the bugs disppear.. probably fly away..  like frustration, aversion etc..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> The above account is based on isis daily life encounter with bugs. The main point is that one can also learn to practise compassionate living on a everyday basis</span><br><br></div>

I couldn't reply this question cos this is relevant.  She advice, that it's okie to kill the mozzie, so that it won't go round creating more dengue patients.  I think I remembered there's one story whereby Buddha killed one bandit so that he will not go on harming the innocents.  If the intention is for the better of the rest and not for self comfort, I think it's okie to commit the kill.  Just remember to dedicate the merits to those you've killed, wither in past life or this life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also kill mosquitoes. When doing that it's best NOT to have any thought of aversion - in fact do not even have any thoughts. And later do chant and dedicate merits for the insect. The only one who I know doesnt kill mosquitoes is my dharma teacher. She got dengue fever (not from her house but somewhere outdoors she believes) about a year ago.. but when she came back, she still does not kill mosquitoes. I think there was even once she sprayed insecticide on herself because she didnt want to kill the mosquitoes. Her maid think she's gone crazy. Cant remember exactly what happened.</div>
