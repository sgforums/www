Instead, he ask ppl to 'Hu Shen' (protect life), and take up vegetarianism. This has more long term benefits. Anyway the 'fang shen' practise in ancient times may not be suitable for modern times.<br><br>As for 'Fang Shen', I think that its OK as long its done secretly <strong>provided that you are very very sure that the conditions for 'fang shen' is safe and suitable for the animals - and that the animals will not die.</strong><br><br>If you're not sure, better don't.</div>

I do feel that other than doing life releasing, life-protecting is also very important.  Acts such as abstain from consuming live seafood, be mindful of the living things around us wherever we are (even when we are walking), or not use insecticide to creatures at home etc.  These acts of compassion could be cultivated into our daily living, and not just do life releasing once a year, while enjoying consuming living animals over the rest of the year.</div>

As a learning buddhist, we ought to be mindful that whatever good that good, the intention has to be to service the sentient beings, rather and asking for any good karma or good merit.  That's cultivating compassion within self.</div>

I have similar occurence in my bathroom.  Just to share on experience, water does drown these little living creatures, and by taking a shower, I'll be killing them.  Most of the time, i'l try my best to evacuate them to the nearest grass patch, using all sorts of "tools" like tissue papers, papers etc.  Of course, by doing so, I could be committing another form of killing by introducing them to their natural predators like frogs, spiders.  My perception is that in this way, they will not die "unaturally".    For those that are killed unintentionally or intentionally, I would suggest dedication of merits to them, so that they will reborn in a higher realm because of you.  There's no way that a human will not kill, because there are many big and small creatures around us, that we breathed in, stepped on daily.  I'm sorry that I do not have a concrete solution to your problem, but I'm sure other seniors in this forum will be able to advice constructively on your difficulty.</div>
