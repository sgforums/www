Sometime, can get too caught up with your ambition and neglect what is actually important to you for eg. family and friends unknowingly.<br><br>Personally, i feel achievement are all fleeting and meaningless after i died. I can't horde all the riches when im dead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Nevertheless, im still a lay person, i still need to work to feed myself.<br><br>Mmm i used to work so hard to earn something. In the end, i don't really feel happy when i got it. I can actually be happy doing something simple.<br></div></blockquote>Yes, the more we commit, the more effort it takes to unwind.  We should not be taken away by the fleeting.  There is deep joy in clarity and being simple.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nothing is inherently satisfactory nor inherently non-satisfactory.<br><br>i feel it does help much in daily worldly life to put spiritual aspects into practice. it has a certain strength and aid for one to live through the up and down of the everchanging times. some calls such as "self development". different people have different ways to develop themselves into beings who are stable, grounded, rounded, strong, resilient regardless of the different amount of pressure stress or happniess they face.<br><br>many people have different opinions about this.<br><br>some people who face setbacks or problems in business, stocks shares, lovelife, marriage, debts, career, family issues, etc, avoid these by taking their own lives or become insane or becoming a different person - is it due to lacking the knowledge in understanding the "self and reality"?<br><br>yes i agree with you all who sees that it is a fleeting world (life's just like an illusion you see in water reflection, a dream..... of sweetdreams &amp; nightmares).....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i personally find alot of suffering and unhappiness in comparing with others. No comparision, less dissatisfaction.<br><br>But my job requires me to act 'superior', sharp and at time authoritative. Sometimes, society and work can have a binding grip on your self expression. The consolation that i have is that nothing last forever.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes agree, the consolation during the struggling times is knowing that nothing last forever....<br><br>i had a friend who used to have a sweet wonderful marriage, then slowly the marriage becomes sour and at the brink of getting divorced. she went drinking alone almost every night, just to forget her sorrows. but when she wakes up in sober, she finds that she is facing the problem again.<br><br>she told me that when she's high or drunk she felt happy. when she sober up, she felt miserable again.<br><br>she confided in me and i told her that nothing is actually permanent. not that i am so wise but it is the clear nature and fact or reality thats in front of us to see it. and she asked,"really? everything is really impermanent? even the wonderful marriage? even the thought of divorce or quarrels we have? even when i'm drunk i feel happy? even when i sober up i feel miserable again?"<br><br>i replied, "yes....."<br><br>then i saw that she became silent. i observe....<br>i see that everyone of us has those times in our lives at some point. including myself.<br><br>this sounds like in a movie but life is like a movie you watch "live" kekeee  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>and it is the first time i ever heard from someone saying to me that she didn't want to ask me or anyone she knows to go out to keep her company. because we all "reminds" her of the good times and bad times she has in personal life. she said that she only wants to see strangers, alone so as to be away from the reality she was actually facing.<br><br>ambition or no ambition, having a goal or not having any goal is also not a permanent lasting thing......<br>today we have this plan, tomorrow we have another plan, time everchanging, situation always change.<br><br>i feel that attachment can be a hindrance to actually progress further and tie us to illusion that results in great disappointment when things ripen and explode and not turn out to be what expected.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like to share a topic that I had with an inmate whom I had this conversation with last week.<br><br>He asked me, why is it doing the wrong creates so much happiness and yet doing the right creates so much frustration.<br><br>I told him, when he's doing the wrong, it's true that he experience happiness, but it's short-lived, and that short span of happiness will fuel the desire to go deeper, so as to achieve a higher level of happiness.<br><br>However, if he do the right, example study, he'll face frustration or anger, but it's short-lived.  Once he achieved the goal, he'll have a long lasting sense of contentment.<br><br>Whenever you gain something, you lose something.  So if you don't have it, you won't lose anything.<br></div>
