Sri Dhammananda:<br><br>Buddha's Advice......:<br><br>The Buddha advised people to work hard without wasting their valuable time and to earn, invest for the future, to support their families, fulfill their duties and obligations, and to spend carefully what they earned, without waste.<br><br>According to the Buddha, renunciation is not the only way to practise Buddhism. He advised lay people to practise Buddhism while fulfilling their normal duties. At the same time he had no objection to the worldly happiness enjoyed by lay people.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Buddha had explained that there are four kinds of worldly happiness that householders can experience:<br><br>1. to enjoy economic security or sufficient wealth acquired by just and righteous means (atthi-sukha);<br><br>2. to spend wealth liberally on himself, his family, his friends and relatives, and on meritorious deeds (bhoga-sukha);<br><br>3. to be free from debts (anana-sukha);<br><br>4. to live a faultless, and a pure life without committing evil in thought, word or deed (anavajja-sukha). When you come to know that you have earned something for yourself through honest means, the happiness that you gain through your accumulated wealth gives happiness which develops confidence in household life.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do not think that being ambitious is wrong.  It can horn us and serves as a form of self-actualization that matures ourselves along the way.  But sad to say, ambitions do cloud our mind (even though it is acceptable morally) and is a form of hinder for clarity to arise.  For me I think life is too precious to get ourselves lost in endless materialistic pursue; at some point in time, if we are able to put things in place, it will be good to brush aside external concerns and devote more time towards cultivation and perfection of mental clarity.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i ever thought about being ambitious is a good thing or not. like setting an intention and the mind to set forth to cultivate well spiritually or work hard and smart towards a successful business, work life, family life, social life, etc....<br><br>when we don't have an ambition or goal, it is like an aimless journey, where one is not sure where one is going. when one has ambition, one has focus in where one wish to go. when tied to the ambition, one can also easily neglect the dharma and proper cultivation or sometimes in some cases neglect about other equally important matters around them. like i used to hear this from some friends of other religion saying that they were so concerned over their careers and other materialistic and worldly stuff that they forgot about their god; and some also said that they neglected their families and even own health and concerns or they become a different person.<br><br>my thoughts are: ambitious is neither extreme wrong nor extreme correct. balance is still safer.<br><br>again, when one is cultivating spiritually, a goal to achieve enlightenment can become an ambition. this ambition becomes a hindrance. when observe and realise a little bit deeper and understand, there is nothing really needed to attain......<br><br>materialistically or spiritually, both are forms of thoughts which you can both hold and can't hold. which one or can both equally give a lasting blissfulness?<br><br>i have not yet experienced any sort of blissfulness materialistically or spiritually. but i know there are "things" i need to see it for myself as i go along.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes I do agree with most of what you said.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by paperflower:</div><div class="quote_body">when we don't have an ambition or goal, it is like an aimless journey, where one is not sure where one is going. when one has ambition, one has focus in where one wish to go.</div></blockquote>When in business, set our goals and go for it! We canÂ’t afford to be flickered minded in business.  I agree that the business world can serves as a good practice ground; just that it is easy to enter, difficult to get out when it grows.<br><br>There is this latent tendency of the mind to identify in a very subtle way that goes undetected until we are forced to confront our identifications and attachments.  I always thought I have achieved certain level of detachment but SingaporeÂ’s past 3 major recessions revealed otherwise.  Never in the past 3 recessions when attempting to save my businesses had I able to remain pure, calm and stable.  In fact many evil and unwholesome thoughts surfaced (too shame to list them all).  I am fortunate that I managed to survive these crises, they are nightmares but I do not want to roll in it till my last day; however settling these businesses can take many years.   Like karma that rolls on, we never know whether we can stop it at the correct time.<br><br>In my opinion, spirituality is more than just being healthy psychologically and having a good life in the here and now.  There is a deeper sense to it; a deeper conviction that this life is but a spark in a never ending stream.  I would not call it an ambition but it definitely starts from a deep call within to understand who we truly are.  Do leave some years for the bliss you mentioned, I wish you success.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
