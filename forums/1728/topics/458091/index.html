              The empty nature of consciousness means it is not some entity that can be pinned down anywhere - instead consciousness is non-local arising inseparable from conditions.
              
              If consciousness is not non-local, it cannot explain psychic powers (mind reading, clairvoyance, clairaudience, etc) or explain how Buddha and other practitioners is able to visit realms that may be billions of miles away or simply of another dimension, in the snap of an instant.
              
              Come to think of it: if a person is reborn from china to america, does it mean a soul needs to travel thousands of miles by foot or fly in the sky like an invisible bird for many days and nights before reaching his destination, then find the parents and enter the womb? This is silly, naÃ¯ve thinking. When the karmic condition manifest, a new instant of consciousness manifests non-locally. This is why a person can be "born" in pure lands, deva realms, etc. Consciousness is propelled by causes and conditions, not an entity, and whenever consciousness is said to "leave the body" like a soul, simply understand that to be a conventional or simplistic way of explaining. It should not be understood as such from an ultimate POV.
              
              Even when there is a mental or astral body that too is an appearance of causes and conditions, such as those who experience OBE. It is not some real entity.
              
              This video explains non-locality and teleportation and is close to the Buddhist view of emptiness, interesting video: http://awakeningtoreality.blogspot.com/2009/11/non-locality-and-teleportation.html
              
              P.s. The Buddha admonished the monk Sati with the strongest words, as he held the view that it is the "consciousness which knows" that transmigrates. He then taught him dependent origination. http://www.leighb.com/mn38.htm
              
              ........
              
              Thusness (2006):
              
              From a conventional point of view, it is. If we feel, see, hear and think in terms of entity, then it seems that there is a self leaving the body. This is because all along, we experience all phenomenon appearances as solid things existing independently. Such conventional mode of comprehending our meditative experiences masked the true character of these experiences.
              
              If we treat consciousness to be an atomic-like-particle residing in our body somewhere, then we are making it as a self too. Do not do that. The true character of Consciousness is not a thing, it does not enter, leave, reside within or outside the body. Clear Luminosity is bonded by karmic propensities, causes and conditions. There is no need for a place within. Yes, there is a mental phenomenon arising but the sensation of entering and leaving is the result of associating it with a self. Just like it is illusionary to see a self succeeding from moment to moment, an entrance and exit is equally illusionary.
              
              Mystical experiences are extremely crucial during the journey of enlightenment. Do not discard them unwisely but assign them correct places. These experiences loosen karmic bonds that latent deep down in our consciousness where it is almost impossible to break through ordinary means. It is an essential condition for the awakening of penetrating insight. The main different between non Buddhist and Buddhist practitioners is that transcendental and mystical experiences are not molded into a self but correctly understood and purified with the wisdom of emptiness. This applies true to the Luminous Clarity Knowingness that is non-dual, it is not wrongly personified into Brahman. In perfect clarity, there are no praises for radiance bright, only the Dharma is in sight. The wisdom of emptiness is so deep and profound that even if one has entered the realm of non-dual, he/she will still not be able to grasp its essence in full. This is the wisdom of the Blessed One. The second level of Presence.

              ...Next is her experience of astral traveling, if she is in a stage of absorption and then out of a sudden awareness, the eyes of awareness may allow her to witness something that is altogether different from the physical place but this does not necessary mean that consciousness has left and re-enter the body. Consciousness is propelled by causes and conditions. According to her conditions of absorption and clarity, just IS...

              <p>thanks for sharing... last time i also have this wrong view <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>a quick example to share... from King Milinda and Nagasena (ç±³å…°çŽ‹ä¸Žé¾™å†›å°Šè€…)</p>
              <p>King Milinda asked Nagasena which is faster: reborn into the Brahman worlds or Kashmir? (which is a place on earth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">)</p>
              <p>Nagasena replied both are equally same. King Milinda requested a simile. Nagasena asked King Milinda to think of Village Kalasi and then think of Kashmir.</p>
              <p>After which, he asked King Milinda which thought took longer, King Milinda replied both are equal.</p>
              <p>Nagasena used King Milinda's answer to relate to the simile, that both rebirth takes equally same amount of time to reborn, which is not affected by time and distance. Only when conditions are appropriate, rebirth takes place</p>
              <p>*edited just to add on on what i think....*</p>
              <p>that also implies consciousness canot leave and "fly" to another body. Otherwise it would be mistaken as soul, or self... once formed this idea... it means there's a eternalistic idea of soul... then suffering comes again not realizing impermanence....and nonself....</p>
