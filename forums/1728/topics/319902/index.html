              <p>   Many people in reallity just do not find how fortunate they are,even though they may be an adult but their attitude are definitely worse than a maybe 10 yr old kid?Well at least a child knows how to be grateful but not some adults.For example,you guys probably have heard b4 someone trying to keep all his/her's relative possesions all by him/herself,causing unhappiness to the whole family forever.I think that those people should be ashamed of themselves.What's the use of keeping all these money to yourself when you can't have this simple kinship anymore,you can never bring these money into your grave,so why are these people destroying their own kinship just because of these money?Why can't they be contented?Is it really worth what they have done?</p>
              <p>   Ever since,seeing these happenings everyday,I can only hope that everyone would be awake from their mistake,I believe being contented is eternal happiness...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>It is good to have such a thought at your age....but I would to share with you abit more..I try not to use buddhism as in my sharing context..I am sharing with you more on my personal experience on moral issue...</p>
              <p>As for your age, let me put it maybe not so nice..those who have not reach the age of 21 and out in the soecity to fight a living...studying age are the best, because you have less worries, less things to bark on you....contendment is important...firstly, learn to be contended with your parents...dun learn contendment over materialistic stuff...</p>
              <p>Cherish the schooling age....because the battle for survival awaits you when you out in soceity...you will get to see alot of ugly scene...but the personality of a person is shaping during his early school days..so it is good to keep in mind to shape a moral ethic way..especially in school there are alot of peer influneces now...</p>
              <p>At many times we have not reach a certain mark in the age criteria so we wouldnt understand the situation...yes sometimes the situation are pretty obvious that greed has taken control over kinship.Back to buddhism..so need to aware at all times...though ur mind is your mind, but many times we are fool by our this mind...do not get too emotion attached to what you mentioned..see it as a suffering, only when you see life is a suffering, then you would be able to be aware  of what you do and think...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes... it's a attachment/bond to a 'self'... it's all so illusory yet they are so attached. It's very sad.</p>
              <p>But most importantly... if you face such people in your life... you yourself have to be 'contented', otherwise you'll be like the 17 year old teenager on the news who burned the car and van of a relative who refused to return them $200000 or something, can't remember the exact story. He had the same problem as his relative -- all boils down to attachment to a 'self', which is an illusion in the first place. Of course in his case it was a feeling that 'justice was not served'... so he sought revenge. Even so, it's all the dream of separation, of "me" versus "you"... constructs which appears so real to the mind but isn't.</p>
              <p>We have to start from ourselves... be more concerned about our inner state than of others, because what we can do about others is quite limited. Externally we can do what we can to try to get the money back, but internally we have to have acceptance and practice non-attachment to 'self'. One day if we become Bodhisattvas, maybe we can transform the minds of others... then others can be Bodhisattvas also. A bodhisattva in the scriptures is described as being able to let others gorge out their eyes and body parts... they can feel pain but they don't suffer or feel hatred. Why? they have totally deconstructed the self-construct-identification with mind/body.</p>
              <p>He sees that 'I' and 'mine' are illusions, there have never been a 'real/solid' and 'inherently existing' self in the first place... and have totally deconstructed such views. If they have done that, the view of "I" and "mine" is similar to everything else -- including money. They let them go at any moment, piece of cake. There's a highly enlightened forummer here... he's busy earning money, but he mentioned he never had views of 'I' and 'mine' over money... he has never kept money for a thought moment.</p>
              <p>Anyway happy to learn you're 14... more young people coming to forum, fresh blood and i'm growing old.. hehe. I remember becoming the moderator of this forum when I was 14, now 18 liao.</p>

              <p>It is very wise to think something like that for such an age. Im 15 this yr and i see a lot of people i noe around me being materialistic and so on. Somehow they never seem to stop wishing for things, nor do they appreciate what they have and hope to crave more. Now to bring back the point, buddhism's saying about desire like salt water, the more u crave the more u feel thirsty, and it's certainly true.</p>
              <p>No doubt i feel buddhism contains REAL truth, though many people of my age doesnt even understand buddhism at all.</p>
