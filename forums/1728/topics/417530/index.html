              what, seeing what does the destruction of the cankers occur? 'Such is 
              material form, such is the arising of material form, such is the passing
               away of material form. Such is feeling... perception... mental 
              formations... consciousness; such is the arising of consciousness, such 
              is the passing away of consciousness' — for one who knows and sees this,
               monks, the destruction of the cankers occurs.</p>
              <p>"The knowledge of destruction with respect to destruction has a

              <p>"Just as, monks, when rain descends heavily upon some mountaintop, 
              the water flows down along with the slope, and fills the clefts, 
              gullies, and creeks; these being filled fill up the pools; these being 
              filled fill up the ponds; these being filled fill up the streams; these 
              being filled fill up the rivers; and the rivers being filled fill up the
