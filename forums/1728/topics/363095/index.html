              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Of the world’s religious masterpieces, the Buddha’s   discourse known the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> <em>Sutra</em><a name="_ednref1" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn1">[1]</a>  is perhaps the least familiar to Western   readers. Unlike such discourses as the <em>Lotus Sutra, </em>the <em>Heart Sutra</em>, and the <em>Diamond Sutra,</em> which survive in their   original Sanskrit versions, and which have been studied in the West for well   over a century, the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama </em>is
                      no longer extant in an Indic original, and the text is preserved only
                      in an eighth-century translation into Chinese. The text as we have it,
                      consisting of some 63,000 characters in ten rolls, is tersely
                      expressed, densely argued, and subtly allusive, resorting often to rare
                      characters and to transliterations of Sanskrit terms, such that even
                      devout and erudite Chinese readers are not infrequently puzzled as to
                      the meaning. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that there have been
                      few attempts at translation of this text into the European languages.<a name="_ednref2" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn2">[2]</a> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Buddhists in   the Chinese tradition, however, have long considered the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> to be of central importance. The Sutra is valued, first, for a unified
                      sequence of teachings that elucidate a series of fundamental religious
                      questions. The text first develops a philosophy of mind and of
                      perception, and then bases on that foundation a series of instructions
                      in spiritual practice, in particular in the deep mental absorption
                      known as samÄ�dhi. To this end the sutra offers in great detail a
                      precise prescription for the systematic withdrawal of the
                      sense-faculties from engagement with the physical world. Such a
                      disengagement, when carried out correctly, can result in lasting
                      illumination -- a teaching that is central to Buddhism and that appears
                      in some form in the esoteric traditions of all the other great
                      religions.<a name="_ednref3" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn3">[3]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The   philosophical density of the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> discourse is lightened by the manner of its general presentation. The
                      first two thirds of the Sutra consist of a dramatic dialogue between
                      the Buddha and his young cousin and attendant Ä€nanda. Other
                      interlocutors intervene at critical moments, each speaking in a
                      distinct voice as they give testimony to their experience with
                      spiritual practice, or as they pose a question that Ä€nanda does not yet
                      have the spiritual depth to ask. But most of the philosophical
                      argument, and the spiritual guidance that follows it, are conveyed to
                      the reader through the drama of Ä€nanda’s personal story. During the
                      long hours of his conversation with the Buddha, we see the young monk
                      seesaw between impertinence and remorse, between astonishment and
                      gratitude, between bewilderment and enlightened understanding. His
                      plucky earnestness adds to the discourse the unexpected element of
                      charm. Despite the focus on Ä€nanda, however, his story is explicitly
                      presented merely as an example; it is itself a parable. From the
                      beginning, the Buddha makes it clear that his instructions are meant
                      not only for Ä€nanda but for “beings of the future” – that is, for us.
                      Accordingly, Ä€nanda’s gradual and successful struggle to understand and
                      to awaken brings to dramatic life the struggle that can still be
                      expected by anyone who sets foot on a spiritual path.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">To the   Western reader, the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama’s</em> format suggests a similarity to the dialogues of Plato. But Plato’s
                      manner of uncovering truth through Socrates’ sly cross-examinations of
                      his hapless interlocutors is in fact very different from the pattern we
                      encounter in the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama.</em> The Buddha and Ä€nanda engage for
                      much of the Sutra in formal debate, according to the rules of what is
                      now called Buddhist logic. In the monastic universities of classical
                      India, Buddhist monks were trained in logical debate in order to
                      sharpen their minds and also to win over adherents from other schools
                      and sects. To some extent it was an intellectual sport. Buddhist debate
                      was transmitted to Tibet, where young monks are still trained in it. In
                      China it was championed by the great seventh-century translator  Xuan
                      Zang, who brought back several texts on logic from India.<a name="_ednref4" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn4">[4]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Briefly,   Buddhist logic (Skt. <em>hetu-vidyÄ�;</em> Ch. <em>yin ming</em> <span lang="ZH-TW">å› </span> <span lang="ZH-TW">æ˜Ž</span>, literally,   the clarification of causes), originally followed five steps:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">1. A   proposition that one is undertaking to prove;</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2. The   reason that the proposition is claimed to be true;</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">3. One or   more instances of the proposition at work in ordinary experience;</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">4.   Application of the instances to the proposition;</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">5.   Conclusion, usually by restatement of the proposition, now demonstrated.<a name="_ednref5" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn5">[5]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">These five   were later reduced to three, in effect leaving out the last two of the   five:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">1.   Thesis</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2.   Reason</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">3.   Examples</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">      a) positive instance</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">       b)   negative instance <a name="_ednref6" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn6">[6]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The Buddha   uses elements of both these procedures in the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em>.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It
                      was permissible, when using the five-step sequence, to omit the first
                      step, and the Buddha does so often in the Sutra. He merely hints where
                      he is headed by raising an issue in terms of a question. The result is
                      that the last two of the five steps – the application of the examples
                      and the conclusion – frequently come to Ä€nanda and the others in the
                      Buddha’s audience as a surprise, which may be accompanied by
                      astonishment, confusion, or delight in finally understanding. Here is a
                      summary of one of many instances of the “clarification of causes” in
                      the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em>:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">1.   Proposition: it is the mind, not the eyes, that see (in the text this step is   implicit rather than stated);</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">2. Reason:   our visual awareness is active even if nothing is being   seen.;</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">3.
                      Instance found in ordinary life: In the Buddha’s words, “If you asked a
                      blind man on the street, ‘Do you see anything?’ he would no doubt
                      answer, ‘All I see is darkness’.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">4.
                      Application of the instance: “Reflect upon what that might mean.
                      Although the blind man sees only darkness, his visual awareness is
                      intact.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">5.   Conclusion:  “The eyes themselves simply   reveal visible objects; it is the mind that sees, not the   eyes.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">This
                      sequence comes early in the discussion, and Buddha does not at this
                      point explain its implications. Later he will point out that since
                      seeing is actually a function of the mind, not the eyes, our visual
                      awareness is fundamentally independent of the presence of visible
                      objects. Therefore it must be possible to withdraw our visual awareness
                      from the grip of visual objects – and the same must be possible for all
                      the other senses as well. Awareness, thus freed, may become purified,
                      and may eventually be transmuted into illumination.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">One aspect   of Buddhist logic in particular lends to the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> much of its distinctive style. This is the reliance on positive and
                      negative instances as proofs of a thesis. While the positive instances,
                      like the encounter with the blind man in the street, serve to prove an
                      assertion by showing how it is at work in daily life, the negative
                      instances are given as proof that any assertion contrary to one being
                      defended would result in absurdities. Most important here is that the
                      rules of logic required that the instances be drawn not from doctrine
                      or theory, which one’s opponent in debate might find unpersuasive, but
                      rather from the experiences of ordinary life -- experiences which an
                      opponent could not plausibly discount. It is to this requirement that
                      we owe many of the glimpses that the Sutra gives us into the daily
                      routines of the monastic community and of the citizens of the nearby
                      city of ÅšrÄ�vastÄ«.<a name="_ednref7" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn7">[7]</a> We read of the monks seated with their alms-bowls, busy rolling up
                      their food into balls to be eaten with the fingers, in the Indian
                      manner. We hear of householders digging wells for new dwellings and
                      local healers holding up bowls to the full moon to collect dew that
                      they will mix inito their herbal potions. We meet a monk who has spent
                      his life repairing potholes in the public roads and a king who despairs
                      because he is growing old. However abstract or subtle the discourse may
                      frequently seem, then, it is deeply colored with a sense of time and
                      place, with the sights and sounds and people of Northern India in its
                      early classical era. This underlying Indian tint keeps seeping up into
                      the Chinese surface of the translated text -- reminding the reader that
                      the nearby river, often invoked in the flow of argument,  is not the
                      Yangzi but the Ganges.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Considered
                      as a whole, the entire edifice of the Buddha’s discourse is a
                      masterwork in the architecture of logical argumentation. Each level of
                      theory established by the Buddha elegantly supports the next level. The
                      entire discourse is girded together by cross-references, parallelisms,
                      reiterations of previous assertions, and anticipatory summaries of what
                      is to come. The present essay is a preliminary attempt to read the
                      plans of this exemplary scriptural edifice.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Many   generations of Chinese readers, Buddhist and otherwise, have admired and   esteemed one further aspect the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> <em>Sutra</em>,
                      namely, the virtuosic literary elegance of the translation itself.
                      Except for a few verses, the entire Chinese text unrolls in a sequence
                      of four-character phrases, which are in effect a metered prose. This
                      four-character pattern imbues the discourse with a vigorous and stately
                      majesty. For all these reasons, then, in China the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama   Sutra</em> has for   many centuries been the subject of written commentaries by illustrious monastic   scholars,<a name="_ednref8" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn8">[8]</a> a topic for public lectures and spoken exegeses, and the object of devout   private study, recitation, and memorization.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It should be noted, before proceeding further, that   the authenticity of the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> has been challenged by some modern scholars, who have held that, since
                      no Indic original is extant, the text is no translation at all, but
                      rather an original composition in the Chinese.<a name="_ednref9" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn9">[9]</a> The timing of the translation has been questioned, and textual
                      anomalies that might suggest the interpolation of purely Chinese
                      cultural elements have been identified. There are strong reasons to
                      believe, however, that the original text can only be Indian. It is
                      true, for example, that during Buddhism’s earliest centuries in China,
                      spurious or corrupted Buddhist texts were circulated; but by the early
                      eighth century, when the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama    </em>translation appeared,<a name="_ednref10" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn10">[10]</a> Chinese monastic scholars had become sufficiently vigilant to denounce   inauthentic texts.<a name="_ednref11" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn11">[11]</a> Further, while some details in the text do seem to arise from a Chinese
                      context, these could merely represent choices made by the translators
                      to substitute Chinese equivalents or analogues for unfamiliar Indian
                      elements that were present in the original.<a name="_ednref12" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn12">[12]</a> There are, besides, a least an equal number of details that point to an Indian   substratum beneath the Chinese surface.<a name="_ednref13" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn13">[13]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      most persuasive internal trace of a South Asian original, however, is
                      the presence of two indisputably Indian elements that play leading
                      roles in the text. One of these, already mentioned here, is the
                      “clarification of causes” in Indian Buddhist logic. The other is the
                      ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Mantra, which the Chinese text leaves untranslated, and which
                      lies at the heart of the Sutra’s instructions for spiritual practice.
                      Last, and most important of all in this dispute as to the Sutra’s
                      authenticity, is the fact that the<em> ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> has been widely
                      accepted in China as canonical for well over a thousand years. Such
                      acceptance reflects the view that a religious text’s authenticity must
                      be measured by its effectiveness as a guide to spiritual and moral
                      practice.  From this orthopraxic point of view, the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> may be correctly deemed to be authoritative simply because generations
                      of advanced practitioners have revered it, have followed its
                      instructions, and have explained it to others as a reliable
                      prescription for moral purification and spiritual advancement, even as
                      far as enlightenment.<a name="_ednref14" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn14">[14]</a> To the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama’s</em> many admirers, then, the history of the text is, in the end, of no
                      great importance, and the dispute surrounding its origin is irrelevant.<a name="_ednref15" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn15">[15]</a></p>

              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><a name="sub2"></a>2. The   Conceptual Framework of the Discourse</strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As
                      the Sutra opens, Ä€nanda, alone on the road, falls under a spell that is
                      recited by a courtesan, and he is on the brink of breaking his vow of
                      celibacy. The Buddha senses from a distance his young cousin’s
                      distress, and, having made a transfiguration of a Buddha appear above
                      his head, he recites through this transfiguration a mantra<a name="_ednref16" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn16">[16]</a> -- the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Mantra --  which defeats the courtesan’s spell. The
                      Buddha then sends a senior member of his assembly, the Bodhisattva
                      MañjuÅ›rÄ«, who in the Mahayana tradition embodies wisdom, to rescue
                      Ä€nanda and to bring both monk and courtesan before the Buddha. Amidst
                      the assembly of monks and a throng of lay adherents, Ä€nanda now finds
                      himself face to face with his teacher. Deeply mortified, he requests
                      instruction so that he can avoid further error. This is the “request
                      for Dharma” with which most of the Buddha’s discourses begin.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In
                      his answer, the Buddha makes clear that Ä€nanda’s error was not entirely
                      that he permitted sexual desire almost to overwhelm his monastic
                      resolve. Equally in error was his laxity in his practice of mental
                      concentration, a laxity that left him vulnerable to enticement by the
                      courtesan’s spell. What Ä€nanda lacked was samÄ�dhi, a concentration firm
                      enough to resist disturbance and intrusion. The Buddha proposes, then,
                      to answer Ä€nanda’s request for instruction by teaching him how to
                      perfect his samÄ�dhi. The Sutra says,</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> <em>Then
                      the World-Honored One, before the great assembly, extended his
                      golden-hued arm, [comforted Ä€nanda by]  passing his hand over the crown
                      of Ä€nanda's head, and said to Ä€nanda and to all gathered there, "There
                      is a samÄ�dhi called 'The Great and Royal ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> <em>that is
                      Proclaimed from Above the Buddha’s Head and is the Perfection of the
                      Myriad Practices.' It is a wondrous and magnificent Path, the unique
                      portal through which the Buddhas in all ten directions have passed in
                      order to transcend the conditioned world.”<a name="_ednref17" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn17"><strong>[17]</strong></a></em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha then launches a dialogue which continues on throughout most of
                      the Sutra. He begins by asking Ä€nanda to consider where his mind is
                      located. Ä€nanda offers the evident answer that his mind is to be found
                      in his body. The Buddha, however, with his superior command of logic,
                      quickly disposes of this widely held supposition, and of six more
                      possibilities that Ä€nanda offers. The young monk is left with the
                      bewildering conclusion that his mind is neither inside his body, nor
                      outside it, nor somewhere between, nor anywhere else. The Buddha then
                      compounds his cousin’s confusion by stating that there are
                      fundamentally two kinds of mind – first, the ordinary quotidian mind of
                      which we are aware and which is entangled, lifetime after lifetime, in
                      the snare of illusory perceptions and random thoughts; and, second, the
                      everlasting true mind, which is our real nature, and which is the state
                      of the Buddha.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Ä€nanda,
                      what are the two fundamentals? The first is the mind that is the basis
                      of death and rebirth and that has continued for the entirety of time,
                      which has no beginning. This mind is dependent on perceived objects,
                      and it is this that you and all beings make use of and that each of you
                      consider to be your own nature. </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>The
                      second fundamental is enlightenment, which has no beginning; it is the
                      original and pure essence of nirvana. It is the original understanding,
                      the real nature of consciousness.  All conditioned phenomena arise from
                      it, and yet it is among those phenomena that beings lose track of it.
                      They have lost track of this fundamental understanding, though it is
                      active in them all day long, and because they remain unaware of it,
                      they make the mistake of entering the various destinies.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Ä€nanda
                      will at first have none of this. Here he speaks for all who pride
                      themselves, as he does, on their discursive intelligence. When the
                      Buddha, seeing Ä€nanda’s skepticism, asks him what he takes to be his
                      mind, Ä€nanda answers,</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“The
                      [Buddha] has just now been asking me about my mind’s location, and my
                      mind is what I have been using to determine where it might be.  My mind
                      is that which has the capability of making such determinations."</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>The Buddha   exclaimed, "Ä€nanda! That is not your mind!"</em><em> </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Ä€nanda protests:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“If
                      this activity of comprehension is not the mind, then I have no mind,
                      and I am the same as a clod of earth or a piece of wood.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha reassures his cousin that there is indeed another kind of
                      awareness. It is the true mind that “original and pure essence of
                      Nirvana” just mentioned. It is given a number of other designations in
                      this discourse, among them the Buddha-nature, the Matrix of the
                      Thus-Come One (that is, of the Buddha), and the Suchness of Reality.
                      This ultimate reality is also the enlightened mind inherent in all
                      beings.  However, it has remained outside of Ä€nanda’s calculations. He
                      has simply not been aware that he is endowed with it, because he is
                      immersed in the disordered activities of his mundane thoughts and is
                      distracted by his unrelenting interactions with the sense-data that he
                      takes to be the world. Absorbed in his own drama, he cannot enter
                      samÄ�dhi, much less proceed through samÄ�dhi to awakening. In this he
                      stands in for us.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Since
                      Ä€nanda is someone who proudly identifies himself with his ability to
                      think, he is at a disadvantage in his search to awaken to his true
                      mind. One cannot think one’s way into enlightenment, because the
                      awakened mind is beyond thought. Put otherwise, what is most worth
                      understanding is beyond conception; what most needs describing cannot
                      be described. Nevertheless, the Buddha in the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> discourse is willing to take exception to this generally recognized
                      conundrum. Since words are what Ä€nanda trusts and understands, and
                      since thinking is what Ä€nanda relies on, the Buddha is willing to make
                      use of words and thought to wake his cousin up. The Buddha concludes
                      this first section of the Sutra with this promise:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“I
                      now will raise for all of you a great banner of Dharma, so that all
                      beings throughout all ten directions can gain access to what is
                      wondrous, subtle, and hidden: the pure mind that understands.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha proceeds by bringing to our attention to the simple fact that we
                      are aware. Taking visual awareness as the paradigm, he examines
                      awareness through a series of illustrative vignettes, several of them
                      involving other speakers. He demonstrates that, while things move in
                      the field of our visual awareness, our awareness itself remains still.
                      The body ages, but our awareness endures. What lies within our field of
                      awareness may be in daylight or in darkness, may be obscured or clear,
                      but our awareness itself is unchanged, no matter what conditions appear
                      within its scope. Our field of visual awareness encompasses visible
                      objects but is not itself an object; it lacks both shape and extension.
                      Still, it cannot be said to be clearly distinct from the things which
                      are in it, at the same time that it is cannot be said to be identical
                      to them. Our visual awareness is active even amidst total darkness, as
                      the Buddha shows with the already cited example of the blind man who is
                      nevertheless aware of the darkness around him.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">All
                      this applies not only to visual awareness but also to the five other
                      kinds of awareness: our awareness of sounds, of smells, of tastes, of
                      tangible objects, and of the thoughts in our minds. A plenitude of
                      sense-objects exists within each of these fields of awareness, but the
                      awareness itself is independent of them. As the Buddha says later, “The
                      essential capacity to hear is never absent, no matter whether there is
                      sound or silence.”</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Gradually
                      during this investigation, the Buddha gives hints that our capacity for
                      awareness is more central than we may have supposed. Having shown
                      Ä€nanda that his visual awareness is independent of the phenomena of
                      which it is aware, the Buddha concludes that this awareness must be at
                      least an aspect of that true mind that Ä€nanda has lost track of. “What
                      is not affected by conditions must be what you fundamentally are. If
                      that is not you, what is?” For one thing, as he gently reassures the
                      aging King Prasenajit, who is frightened at the prospect of his
                      mortality, since our visual awareness is independent of conditions, it
                      must belong to what survives the traumas of death and rebirth.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Ä€nanda,
                      surrendering to the force of the Buddha’s logic, grants, “My awareness
                      is indeed my wondrous true nature.” But, of course, it is not that
                      simple. It is the essential nature of awareness that is the enlightened
                      mind, not our ordinary awareness that we experience day after day. This
                      ordinary awareness has been distorted; it is diseased. The Buddha
                      compares us to a man who sees circles of color around a lamp because he
                      suffers from a disease of the eyes.  Yet it is possible for the man’s
                      eye-disease to be corrected, so that he can see clearly, and it is
                      possible for our distorted awareness to be purified, so that we see the
                      world as it really is.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It
                      is probably worth noting at this point that the radical skepticism
                      expressed in this ancient document is, in modern times, no longer
                      radical at all. The speculations of David Hume and Immanuel Kant – not
                      to mention the invention of the microscope and telescope and every
                      other device that sees and hears better than we do  – have long made it
                      clear that the world we see with the naked eye and hear with the
                      unaided ear is not the world as it really is. We do not hear the high
                      and low frequencies and do not see beyond the visual spectrum. Our
                      visual and aural fields are distorted by the limitations to our visual
                      and aural awareness. These limits are not merely those of scope, but of
                      value and of perspective. As the Buddha will explain to Ä€nanda later on
                      in the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama </em>discourse, we also allow ourselves to be
                      fooled in that we interpret everything we perceive as good, bad, or
                      indifferent, assigning it a value measured by what it will mean to us.
                      In this way, we distort the world by responding to it with desire or
                      revulsion. Further, we divide the contents of our experience into what
                      is us and what is not us – what is self and what is other. Everything
                      is colored by the perspective of self, just as the lamp is distorted by
                      the eye-disease of the viewer in the Buddha’s analogy</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">What,
                      then, is this enlightened mind that is the purified essence of our
                      awareness, and what might it mean to purify it? To prepare Ä€nanda for
                      an answer to these questions, the Buddha turns next to one of the
                      doctrines that is most distinctive to Buddhism – the doctrine of
                      emptiness. All the things that we perceive in this world are
                      impermanent, and, furthermore, all things are merely concatenations of
                      ingredients and circumstances. They exist, but they have no reality
                      that is their own. They are constructs; ontologically they are empty.
                      Our very selves are merely mental constructs, which – as modern
                      developmental psychology confirms – we put together as children in
                      order to navigate among our experiences. In the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Sutra,</em> the Buddha approaches this doctrine through our sense-apparatus. In a
                      series of arguments that follow the pattern of the clarification of
                      causes,  he briefly examines in turn our six senses (eyes, ears, nose,
                      tongue, skin, and mind), then the six kinds of sense-objects (visual
                      objects, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile objects, and thoughts – that
                      is, objects of mind); also the six kinds of sense-consciousnesses that
                      arise when the sense-faculties encounter sense-objects (that is,
                      seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and awareness of the
                      mental contents); and finally the elemental qualities that characterize
                      the world of sense-objects (fire, or heat; earth, or solidity; water,
                      or liquidity; wind, or movement; space; living beings’ ordinary
                      sense-awareness; and beings’ consciousness). All these, the Buddha
                      says, are illusory and unreal. They do not exist as independent natures
                      with their own being. Thus the universe of objects that we perceive is,
                      in this sense, empty.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">And
                      yet, at the same time that mind and world are empty, in that they are
                      unreal and have no independent being, one cannot say that they do not
                      exist. The universe is empty, but this emptiness is not the same thing
                      as a void. It is not only that the universe teems with all manner of
                      sentient beings and insentient things, contingent and impermanent
                      thought they may be. It is also that, at a more profound level, this
                      empty universe, and all beings in it, are suffused with an ultimate
                      reality. In the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Sutra </em>and elsewhere, the Buddha calls this   ultimate reality “the Matrix of the Thus-Come One” – in Sanskrit, the <em>TathÄ�gata-gharba</em>,  literally, the womb of the Buddha. It is from   this Matrix that the world and the mind come forth.<a name="_ednref18" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn18">[18]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Enlightenment,
                      then, brings not only an awakening of the fundamental Buddha-nature
                      within one’s own mind – that original true mind which we have
                      forgotten. It brings also an apprehension of ultimate reality, because
                      these two—the true mind and the reality of the universe – otherwise
                      named the Buddha-nature and the Matrix of the Thus-Come One – are one
                      and the same. Thus in the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama, </em>numerous terms of praise apply   equally to the true mind and to the reality of the universe: wondrous   (<span lang="ZH-TW">å¦™</span><em>miao</em>),   original (<span lang="ZH-TW">å…ƒ</span><em>yuan,</em>) fundamental (<span lang="ZH-TW">æœ¬</span><em>ben</em>), true (<span lang="ZH-TW">çœŸ</span><em>zhen</em>),   genuine <em>(</em><span lang="ZH-TW">å¯¦</span><em>shi</em>),   enlightened (<span lang="ZH-TW">è¦º</span><em>jie</em>),   illuminative understanding (<span lang="ZH-TW">æ˜Ž</span><em>ming</em>),   luminous (<span lang="ZH-TW">å…‰</span><em>guan</em>g),   unchanging (<span lang="ZH-TW">å¸¸</span><em>chang</em>),   pure (<span lang="ZH-TW">æƒ…æ·¨</span><em>qing   jing</em>),  the “suchness of reality” (<span lang="ZH-TW">çœŸå¦‚</span><em>zhen   ru</em>); and -- most important to the<em> ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> discourse -- the enlightened nature of our awareness (<span lang="ZH-TW">è¦‹æ€§</span><em>jian   xing</em>). The Buddha tells   Ä€nanda:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“In
                      the Matrix of the Thus-Come One, the nature of your visual awareness is
                      your enlightened understanding, and the essence of enlightenment is
                      your awareness that understands. Fundamentally pure, it extends
                      throughout the Dharma Realm. The extent to which beings are aware of
                      its real nature depends on the capacities of their minds. Just as the
                      awareness of one sense-faculty, the eye, extends throughout the Dharma
                      Realm, so also do the wondrous, resplendent powers of hearing,
                      smelling, tasting, tactile awareness, and mental awareness extend
                      throughout the Dharma Realm. They fill up the entirety of empty space.”</em> <a name="_ednref19" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn19">[19]</a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">How,
                      then, is it that we have lost sight of our origins in this Matrix,
                      which is it say, how is that we have forgotten our true minds? Another
                      of the Buddha’s senior disciples, PÅ«rá¹‡a-maitrÄ�yani-putra, now rises to
                      ask this question.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“World-Honored One, if in fact the skandhas,<a name="_ednref20" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn20"><strong>[20]</strong></a> as well as the twelve sites, which consist of the sense-faculties and
                      their objects, and also the eighteen capacities [for perception] and
                      the rest, are all the Matrix of the Thus-Come One, which is itself
                      fundamentally pure, then how is it that the mountains, the rivers, the
                      earth, and everything else in the world of perceived objects -- all
                      conditioned phenomena— suddenly come into being?”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha’s answer focuses on one essential event: the separation of the
                      perceiver from the perceived, of the self from the other. He describes
                      it as adding an understanding to an already existing understanding.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Although
                      nothing need be added to enlightenment, once an understanding is added,
                      that understanding must understand something. Once the category of
                      ‘something understood’ is mistakenly established, the category ‘that
                      which understands’ is mistakenly established as well.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As
                      a result, the original, enlightened awareness, which had been a single
                      unity, divides into six sense-faculties and their six objects. What is
                      now a perceived universe is further divided into the desirable, the
                      undesirable, and the neutral, and as a result there is disgust and
                      desire. Karma is now in play, and with it emerge the various levels of
                      being and the cycle of death and rebirth.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">This
                      account, summarized here, of the separation of ultimate reality into
                      subject and object is all the Buddha is willing to offer as the
                      original impetus for the coming into being of mind and world. He gives
                      us no Creation myth and imagines no Creator. If the primordial
                      separation into subject and object is our fall, it is a psychological
                      one, a rift at the foundation of consciousness, not a moral fall. There
                      is no original sin; there is only the original loss.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> While the   Buddha is willing to explain <em>how</em> this   loss comes about, he does not offer a similar explanation as to <em>why</em> it comes about. PÅ«rá¹‡a-maitrÄ�yani-putra requests that the Buddha shed   light on this mystery:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“I venture   to ask the TathÄ�gata why all beings are deluded.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha replies with a parable. In nearby ÅšrÄ�vastÄ«, a neighborhood idiot
                      named Yajñadatta thinks that the head he sees in the mirror one morning
                      is not his own. In a panic he concludes that the head he does see in
                      the mirror belongs to a ghost. He runs madly out into the street. The
                      Buddha asks PÅ«rá¹‡a:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“What do   you think? What caused this man to run madly about for no good   reason?”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>PÅ«rá¹‡a replied,   “He was clearly insane. That and nothing else was the   cause.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>The
                      Buddha said, “Wondrous enlightenment is perfect understanding, a
                      wondrous understanding that is fundamentally perfect. How then could it
                      be the basis of the delusions we have been discussing? … This, then, is
                      the cause of delusion: it arises from delusion. Merely realize that
                      your delusion has no ultimate basis, and the basis of your delusion
                      will disappear … The same may be said even more emphatically of
                      Yajñadatta. What he experienced that day in the city had no basis and
                      so was fundamentally unreal. Was there any reason for him to have
                      become afraid that he had lost his head and to have rushed madly
                      about?...The same is true of delusion. How could it be based in
                      reality? </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">There
                      can be no reason for our slipping from enlightenment into delusion.
                      First, it contradicts logic to suppose that perfect understanding could
                      be the cause of delusion; and, second, delusion would not be delusion
                      if it had a rational basis. And that is all the Buddha will give us
                      here. The Sutra does not offer an elaborate account of cosmological
                      origin. The Buddhist view is that the universe is created not by a
                      deity but by karma. Unlike the Western religions, Buddhism does not see
                      the universe in terms of a finite and linear narrative guided by the
                      purposes of an ultimate purposer. The impetus of the Buddha’s ministry
                      was simply the plain fact that we are caught up in an unsatisfactory
                      existence, and he offers nothing more nor less than a way out. Thus in
                      the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama,</em> the Buddha concludes his parable of Yajñadatta with   a prescription:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>All
                      that is needed is for you not to follow after the distinctions you make
                      concerning the … world, beings, and retribution in accord with karma.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"><a name="sub3"></a>3. Instructions in   Practice</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">“Not
                      to follow:” this prescription to declare our independence from
                      sense-objects leads us back to the occasion for the Sutra itself.
                      Ä€nanda’s lack of samÄ�dhi left him vulnerable to disaster because he
                      permitted his hearing to take in the courtesan’s spell. He shouldn’t
                      have been listening to the spell. He should have been focusing his
                      hearing inward. The <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> discourse has now reached its
                      second stage. The Buddha has erected a conceptual framework, and he is
                      ready to clothe the framework with instructions for practice. Ä€nanda
                      does not immediately perceive this, and he now speaks up to challenge
                      the Buddha’s argument that no cause can be ascribed to the primordial
                      division between self and other. Briefly the Buddha revisits the
                      parable of the foolish Yajñadatta, and then he gives Ä€nanda a sound
                      scolding:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Despite
                      your many eons of accumulated learning, you were not able to escape
                      your difficulty with the young Matanga woman [the courtesan]. Why did
                      you need me to recite the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Mantra for you? In the young
                      Matanga woman the fires of lust have been extinguished, and instantly
                      she has become a Sage who must return only once.”<a name="_ednref21" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn21"><strong>[21]</strong></a></em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In
                      other words, the courtesan has surpassed Ä€nanda in her level of
                      enlightenment. Listening to the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama discourse has lifted her
                      quickly to the third level of the Sage. Ä€nanda has long been stuck at
                      the first stage.<a name="_ednref22" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn22">[22]</a> This is sufficiently mortifying to sap the young monk’s appetite for
                      argumentation. For the remainder of the Sutra, he largely confines his
                      remarks to requests for further teaching. The young intellectual is now
                      ready to be taught how to practice the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> Samadhi. He tearfully confesses:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“The
                      Thus-Come One has also admonished me for pursuing erudition at the
                      expense of spiritual practice. Now, therefore, I am like a wanderer who
                      unexpectedly meets a celestial king, who bestows upon him a magnificent
                      house. The house is his, yet in order to go in, he will still need to
                      find a door. I only hope that the Thus-Come One will not withhold his
                      compassion from all of us in this assembly who are covered in darkness,
                      and that he will show us the road that leads from our original resolve
                      to certain attainment of the Thus-Come One’s complete nirvana.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha responds by returning to the subject of sense-perception. He
                      points out that some of the six senses have a wider range than others;
                      for example, we cannot see behind us, but our hearing is
                      omni-directional. He then reassures Ä€nanda that he needs to concentrate
                      in his practice on only one of the senses, since when one of them is
                      purified, all of them will be purified. The work of samÄ�dhi, he
                      repeats, is “not to follow.” That is, it is to learn not to allow one’s
                      attention to be distracted by sense-objects, not to allow one’s mind to
                      evaluate these objects as good, bad, or neutral, and not to allow one’s
                      emotions to respond with desire or revulsion. He says:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Extricate
                      one sense-faculty by detaching it from its sense-objects, and redirect
                      it inward so that it may return to what is original and true. Then it
                      will radiate with the light of your original understanding. This
                      brilliant light will shine forth and detach the other five
                      sense-faculties until they too are completely free of sense-objects.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      Buddha then asks his son RÄ�hula, who has joined his monastic retinue,
                      to strike the temple bell, in order to demonstrate once again that
                      hearing continues whether there is sound or silence. Finally, he asks
                      the enlightened sages in the assembly to tell Ä€nanda how they became
                      enlightened.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“When
                      you first made the commitment to realize enlightenment, which one of
                      the eighteen constituent elements of perception did you waken in order
                      to break through all obstructions? By what method did you enter
                      samÄ�dhi?”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Thus
                      begins what is perhaps the most celebrated passage in the Sutra: the
                      testimony of the twenty-five sages, of whom the last is the Bodhisattva
                      AvalokiteÅ›vara. Each sage identifies as his avenue to enlightenment one
                      of the six sense-faculties, six sense-objects, six
                      sense-consciousnesses, or seven elemental qualities (thus a total of
                      twenty-five.) Each explains how, by contemplating their awareness as
                      ultimately independent of sense-faculties and sense-objects, they broke
                      their attachment to the world of the senses. The sage GavÄ�mpati, for
                      example, testifies in part:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“My
                      contemplation was that the knowledge of flavors does not come from the
                      tongue-faculty and does not come from any object of taste… Within, I
                      let go of my mind and body, and without, I took my leave of this
                      world.  I left the three realms of existence far behind, like a bird
                      escaping from its cage. I departed from all impurity and was done with
                      all sense-objects, and my Dharma-eye became clear. So it was that I
                      became a Sage. The Thus-Come One himself verified that I needed no
                      further instruction.</em> <em>The Buddha has asked us how we broke
                      through all obstructions. I believe that turning our awareness of
                      flavor around to reflect upon itself is the best method.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">As
                      for the seven sages who focused on one of the seven elemental
                      qualities, their contemplations were of the identity of body, mind, and
                      world, and therefore the ultimate unreality of the division into
                      subject and object. The youth Moonlight testifies:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>I
                      saw too that the water inside my body was no different from the water
                      outside of my body. Even as far away as the fragrant seas of the
                      Royal-Floating-Banner Buddha-land, the fundamental nature of water is
                      one and the same…. My body vanished. Then the fundamental nature of the
                      water in my body and of all the waters of the fragrant seas in worlds
                      throughout the ten directions merged into true emptiness.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finally,   the Bodhisattva AvalokiteÅ›vara describes his practice for purification of the   ear-faculty. He says:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“First
                      I redirected my hearing inward as if to go against a stream ,and then
                      external sounds disappeared. With its direction reversed and with
                      sounds stilled, both sounds and silence cease to arise. So it was that,
                      as I gradually progressed, what I heard and my awareness of what I
                      heard came to an end. Even when that state of mind in which everything
                      had come to an end disappeared, I did not rest. My awareness and the
                      objects of my awareness were emptied, and when that process of emptying
                      my awareness was wholly complete, then even that emptying and what had
                      been emptied vanished. Coming into being and ceasing to be themselves
                      ceased to be. Then the ultimate stillness was revealed. All of a sudden
                      I transcended the worlds of ordinary beings, and I also transcended the
                      worlds of beings who have transcended the ordinary worlds. Everything
                      in the ten directions was fully illuminated.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Here   we have the esoteric teaching that is central to the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama:  </em>freeing
                      the sense-faculties from the world of sense-objects leads first to
                      “everything disappearing,” and then to “illumination.” As the
                      Bodhisattva AvalokiteÅ›vara puts it:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Once
                      perceived objects had disappeared from my mind as I turned the light of
                      my understanding inward, my body and mind and the entire Dharma-Realm
                      [that is, the universe] were as bright and translucent and flawless as
                      crystal.”<a name="_ednref23" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn23"><strong>[23]</strong></a></em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">When
                      his hearing, as he says, became all-pervasive, he was able to hear the
                      cries of beings everywhere: thus one Chinese translation of his name is
                      Guan Shi Yin (<span lang="ZH-TW">è§€ä¸–éŸ³</span>, The One Who Hears the
                      Voices of the World). He is Buddhism’s exemplar of compassion, and when
                      Buddhism traveled to East Asia, he became an object of worship and
                      petition in his feminine form. He tells the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> assembly that he is able to appear before various classes of beings in
                      their own forms, to grant their wishes, and to deliver them safely from
                      fearsome situations. The celebrated twenty-fifth chapter of the <em>Lotus Sutra</em> (“On the Universal Doorway”) similarly celebrates the Bodhisattva
                      AvalokiteÅ›vara’s salvific powers; the difference is that in the
                      ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama, he explains how those powers were gained.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Because
                      I did not listen to sounds, I was able to contemplate the listener
                      within. Now I can hear the cries of suffering beings throughout the ten
                      directions, and I can bring about their liberation.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> And,</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Once
                      sounds were so purified that they ceased being perceived objects, the
                      sense-faculty and its objects were completely interfused, so that there
                      was nothing that perceived and nothing that was perceived. Therefore, I
                      can cause beings burdened by anger and hatred to be free of their
                      enmity.”</em><a name="_ednref24" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn24"><em><strong>[24]</strong></em></a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em> </em>When
                      AvalokitÅ›vara has finished speaking, the Buddha asks the Bodhisattva
                      MañjuÅ›rÄ« to recommend one of the methods described by the twenty-five
                      sages, so that Ä€nanda and beings of the future can know which method
                      “will lead them most easily to success.”  MañjuÅ›rÄ« responds with a
                      250-line verse in summary of the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama</em> teaching and the sages’   twenty-five methods. He concludes by recommending the hearing-practice of   AvalokiteÅ›vara:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“I now   respectfully say this to the World-Honored-One --</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Who is the   Buddha that appeared here in this SÄ�ha World</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>In order   to transmit the essence of true teaching</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Meant for   this place--: it is that purity is found through hearing. </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Those who   will wish to gain a mastery of samÄ�dhi </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Will   surely find that hearing is the way to enter.</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">And a little further   on:</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“Great Assembly!   Ä€nanda! Halt the shadow-play</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Of your distorted   hearing!. Turn your hearing round and listen</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>To your true nature.   Then you’ll realize the unsurpassed</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>Enlightenment. This   is the genuine way </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>To break through all   obstructions.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em> </em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The
                      instruction of Ä€nanda is not yet quite complete, however. One crucial
                      point remains to be made. How is it possible, after all, to turn the
                      hearing around and listen to one’s true nature? How can one stake out
                      an independence from the data of the senses? The Buddha is now ready to
                      offer a frank answer to this question.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“No
                      matter how much you may practice in order to transcend the stress of
                      experiencing sense-objects, you will never transcend that stress until
                      you have freed yourself from sexual desire.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">In the Chinese the word is <em>yin </em>(<span lang="ZH-TW">æ·«</span>),
                      literally, lust: lust not only for sexual experience, but for
                      sense-experience in general. What keeps us tied to sense-objects --
                      what prevents us from being able to liberate our awareness and gain
                      illumination – is simply our desire for sense-experiences, of which
                      sexual experience is the most compelling of all. Thus the Buddha
                      returns to his initial teaching, the Four Noble Truths, which he
                      transmitted to the five ascetics in the Deer Park soon after his own
                      enlightenment. These truths tell us that this life of ours is
                      unsatisfactory and that the root of our dissatisfaction is our habit of
                      craving sensation and experience. Only by extinguishing this craving
                      can one gain freedom..</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><em>“You
                      must purge yourself of the most subtle promptings of lust, both
                      physical and mental… Then there will be hope that you may realize the
                      enlightenment of the Buddhas.”</em></p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">To
                      this the Buddha adds three other prerequisites necessary for success in
                      one’s spiritual practice. First, one must free oneself of violence,
                  
                      both in one’s actions and in one’s thoughts (included in this
                      instruction is an injunction against eating meat). Second, there must
                      be no coveting and no theft; and, lastly, one must never make prideful
                      false claims to spiritual accomplishment.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finally,
                      the Buddha offers an expedient for hastening the practitioner’s entry
                      into the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama SamÄ�dhi. This expedient is recitation of the
                      ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Mantra, that same counter-spell by which, at the outset of
                      the Sutra, the Buddha rescued Ä€nanda from what he delicately refers to
                      as “your difficulty with the Matanga woman.” The Buddha himself calls
                      the mantra “The Great White Canopy,” because it takes those who recite
                      it under its protection. At Ä€nanda’s request, the Buddha now proclaims
                      the mantra for a second time, and this time its 544 lines are given in
                      the text. The Buddha giv</p></div>

              the teaching concerning the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama Mantra, the Buddha has now
              completed his instructions for entering the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama SamÄ�dhi. The goal
              of the narrative has been gained: Ä€nanda has been granted what he needs
              to avoid further error. But the Sutra itself is not complete. Confident
              that he can at last make spiritual progress, Ä€nanda asks for an
              explanation of the various levels of enlightenment through which he
              hopes to soon begin his advance. In answer, the Buddha first backs up
              to briefly describe twelve levels of unenlightened beings, which he
              categorizes according to the manner of their being born. Next, in a
              passage of daunting terseness, he summarizes fifty-five stages of the
              Bodhisattva’s progress toward Buddhahood – a topic treated expansively
              in the <em>Avatamsaka Sutra</em>. Next, having heard about the highest
              levels of being, Ä€nanda, ever curious, asks about the lowest levels,
              that is, about the hells, of which, he says, he and his fellow monks
              are ignorant. The Buddha complies by launching into a hair-raising
              description of the tortures of the nether regions, which beings
              experience as the karma incurred by their misdeeds in their lives as
              people. The Buddha continues by summarizing the gradual ascent through
              other levels of rebirth, as ghosts, animals, people, adepts, gods, and
              beings addicted to violence (<em>asuras</em>).</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">Finally, in a lengthy and important   section that can stand alone,<a name="_ednref25" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn25">[25]</a> the Buddha warns against fifty negative states of mind in which serious
              practitioners can become trapped if they fall prey to greed, pride, or
              confusion. This last teaching serves as a warning that the ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama
              practice of entering samÄ�dhi through redirecting the senses inward
              carries with it some degree of peril. It is essential to recognize
              that, to avoid not only error but serious mental endangerment, any
              intense spiritual practice must be pursued in the context of a proper
              spiritual community, surrounded by others devoted to pure conduct,
              under the guidance of a wise and skillful teacher.</p>

              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"> </p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">It
              is perhaps appropriate for me to conclude on a personal note by
              lamenting the obscurity into which this magnificent scripture has
              fallen, while, at the same time, many lesser works have been translated
              by Western scholars and widely circulated. The charge that the <em>ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama   Sutra</em> is inauthentic and apocryphal has not been without its effect. The
              discourse is rarely if ever taught, for example. in university courses
              on Buddhism, and it is probable that the great majority of Western
              Buddhists have neither read it nor even heard of it. To speak frankly,
              it is unclear what legitimate grounds there can be for scholars who are
              not themselves Buddhist masters, or even Buddhist practitioners, to
              confidently present themselves as qualified to rule on the proper place
              that a scripture should hold in the Buddhist canon. One can only be
              puzzled by the easy but unstated assumption that uncertainties
              concerning textual history should be sufficient to diminish the immense
              religious and literary stature that a scripture has maintained for
              1,300 years in its own tradition. There is here a whiff of the Western
              cultural arrogance that Edward Said famously characterized as
              orientalism.<a name="_ednref26" href="http://dharmamirror.org/feature/221drounds.asp#_edn26">[26]</a> I can only venture to hope that the new translation being prepared by
              the team of which I am member will serve some small role in bringing the<em> ÅšÅ«raá¹…gama </em>more into the   light.</p>
