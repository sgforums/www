When someone says a very simple thing such as "The Buddha is Enlightened", you are required to state "Why does that matter? 'Buddha' is just a word. Why are you clinging to that, huh? Think about it!" This proves your mental superiority.<br><br>2 ) At every chance, call Tibetan Buddhism "Hinayana." Hinayana means "base or low vehicle" and is usually used in conjunction with Mahayana ( which means "great vehicle" ). While this even may be in the sutra you have just started reading, this will offend people. Rather than taking the high-road and calling Tibetan Buddhism Theraveda ( "the Teachings of the Elders" ), using of the word Hinayana is a wonderful way to show those following this tradition their stupidity.<br><br>3 ) At every chance, argue that the Buddha did not speak the Mahayana sutras. Say they were written by someone in the early 2nd century as if that were the consensus. Use the argument "the first written version of the sutras were discovered written at that time!" completely ignoring the fact that sutras were transmitted orally for hundreds of years. This is a sure way to cause those who follow the Mahayana to change their entire belief system and get a parade in your honor.<br><br>4 ) Call yourself a Buddhist but openly say you disbelieve in crucial tenets of Buddhism. For example, say as often as possible "rebirth is just a cultural ideosyncracy the Buddha picked up from India, it's not applicable today." This is sure to prove your open-mindedness and show all other Buddhists how wrong they were to be blind sheep ( extra points for actually calling them "blind sheep" ).<br><br>5 ) Go around talking like a monk from the sutras after the Buddha finished a very profound section. At the drop of a pin, say "I am so glad to gain what it was I never had before! In a million lifetimes, I am so lucky to have found such compassionate instruction." This will show everyone how sincere you are in your practice.<br><br>6 ) Find the person who seems to have the most wisdom in sight and see if you can get a rise out of them. Pummel them with silly questions and koans and when they don't answer the way you want, go into a tirade about how arrogant and unenlightened they are. This is one of the fastest way to prove your own Enlightenment.<br><br>7) Regurgitate a Master's teachings verbatim without quoting them. Since you realize you are not Enlightened ( which is certainly not annoying ), you must overcompensate for this by pretending to be someone else. Everyone will like you if you pretend to be someone great ( forget that the person they like it isn't you ). Emulation doesn't count - it must be verbatim.<br><br>8 ) Have no sense of humor about anything. Since your positions are the only ones that could ever be correct, when someone disagrees it is a cause for World War. Show your deep and profound understanding by realizing humor is for part-timers who have no interest in capturing the perfect and unbridled truth.<br><br>9 ) Project your own disfunction on everyone else. Since the thing we hate about other people most is what we see in ourselves but are unwilling to admit, the best way to ensure our own safety is to call out the faults of another. If you can't find the fault of another you are most worried about, find someone who is close enough and prop them up in order to tear them down ( for reference material, watch the part of Lilo and Stitch where Stitch builds the little city ). The best defense is a good offense, after all!<br><br>10 ) Worry about being annoying. We're all annoying, so don't be shy! Don't sweat the small stuff, it all comes out in the wash. So go ahead and jump right in, the water's fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote></div>

This type of chanting is not done to request or invoke the compassion of the Buddhas but is a method of meditation, the content of the chant being the object of meditation.<br>"However, there is a type of chant which is done to invoke the compassionate attention of the Buddhas. The difference between this and worshipping a god is determined by the motivation and the recognition of what one is doing.

The first, OM, is composed of three pure<br>letters, A, U, and M. These symbolize the practitioner's impure body, speech, and mind; they also symbolize the pure exalted body, speech and mind of a Buddha.<br><br>Can impure body, speech and mind be transformed into pure body, speech and mind, or are they entirely separate ?<br><br>All Buddhas are cases of being who were like ourselves and then in dependence on the path became enlightened; Buddhism does not assert that there is anyone who from the beginning is free from faults and possesses all good qualities . The development of pure body , speech , and mind comes from gradually leaving the impure states and their being transformed into the pure . How is this done ? The path is indicated by the next four syllables .<br><br>MANI , meaning jewel , symbolizes the factor of method- the altruistic intention to become enlightened , compassion , and love . Just as a jewel is capable of removing poverty , so the altruistic mind of enlightenment is capable of removing the poverty , or difficulties , of cyclic existence and of solitary peace . Similarly , just as a jewel fulfills the wishes of sentient beings , so the altruistic intention to become enlightened fulfills the wishes of sentient beings .<br><br>The two syllables , PADME , meaning lotus , symbolize wisdom . Just as a lotus grows forth from mud but is not sullied by the faults of mud , so wisdom is capable of putting you in a situation of non- contradiction where as there would be contradiction if you did not have wisdom . There is wisdom realizing impermanence , wisdom realizing that persons are empty of self-sufficient or substantial existence , wisdom that realizes the emptiness of duality (that is to say , of difference of entity between subject and object) , and wisdom that realizes the emptiness of inherent existence . Though there are may different types of wisdom , the main of all these is the wisdom realizing emptiness .<br><br>Purity must be achieved by an indivisible unity of method and wisdom , symbolized by the final syllable , HUM , which indicates indivisibility. According to the sutra system, this indivisibility of method and wisdom refers to one consciousness in which there is a full form of both wisdom affected by method and method affected by wisdom . In the mantra , or tantra vehicle , it refers to one conciousness in which there is the full form of both wisdom and method as one undifferentiable entity . In terms of the seed syllables of the five conqueror Buddhas , HUM is the is the seed syllable of Akshobhya - the immovable , the unfluctuating , that which cannot be disturbed by anything .<br><br>Thus the six syllables, OM MANI PADME HUM, mean that in dependence on the practice which is in indivisible union of method and wisdom , you can transform your impure body , speech and mind into the pure body , speech , and mind of a Buddha . It is said that you should not seek for Buddhahood outside of yourself; the substances for the achievement of Buddhahood are within .</div>

I'll always remember that man!"<br><br>I was feeling inspired by the monk's ideas, which had just expanded my view of life. "I don't think I'll ever be the same," I said.<br><br>Years later we met again. My friend still slept badly, and he asked me "Do you?" "No," I said, "my life has changed. I think it helps that I have more of a Buddhist attitude now."<br><br>"Oh, I've always remembered that monk," my friend said. "So he impressed you, too?"<br><br>"I don't really remember the monk himself," I replied, "but I've been practicing his methods."</div>

A person is `cool' when he or she is free from pressing desires (grasping) which always produce dissonant emotions (uncoolness).<br><br>An uncool person squirms with needs, waiting for the next coffee or cigarette or chance to break into the conversation, and thus is a state called "senseless agitation." On the other hand, a cool person is free of cravings and repulsions, and is thus in an empowered state of equanimity.<br><br>Being cool and detached is not being cold and uncaring. I've noticed that when I'm feeling cool and requiring nothing from the situation, it seems to clarify my thoughts, and in this state I tend to respond to other peopleÂ’s agendas more, instead of my head being full of my own agenda. Coolness means more compassion and less self-ness Â– the opposite of being heated.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Something to remind us to enjoy our path...<br><img src="http://img77.exs.cx/img77/5933/holdinghands.jpg"><br><br>A Thousand Marbles<br>"The older I get, the more I enjoy Saturday mornings. Perhaps it's the quiet solitude that comes with being the first to rise, or maybe it's the joy of not having to be at work. Either way, the first few hours of a Saturday morning are most enjoyable. A few weeks ago, I was shuffling toward the kitchen with a steaming cup of coffee in one hand and the morning paper in the other. What began as a typical Saturday morning turned into one of those lessons that life seems to hand you from time to time.<br><br>I turned the volume up on my radio in order to listen to a Saturday morning talk show. I heard an older gentlemen with a golden voice. He was talking about "a thousand marbles" to someone named "Tom." I was intrigued and sat down to listen to what he had to say. "Well, Tom, it sure sounds like you're busy with your job. I'm sure they pay you well but it's a shame you have to be away from home and your family so much. Hard to believe a young fellow should have to work sixty or seventy hours a week to make ends meet. Too bad you missed your daughter's dance recital." He continued, "Let me tell you something Tom, something that has helped me keep a good perspective on my own priorities." And that's when he began to explain his theory of a "thousand marbles." He went on to say, "You see, I sat down one day<br>and did a little arithmetic.<br><br>The average person lives about 75 years. I know, some live more and some live less, but on average, folks live about 75 years. Now then, I multiplied 75 X 52 and I came up with 3900, which is the number of Saturdays that the average person has in their entire lifetime. "It took me until I was 55 years old to think about all this in any detail," he went on, "and by that time I had lived through over 2800 Saturdays. I got to thinking that if I lived to be 75, I only had about 1,000 of<br>them left to enjoy.<br><br>"So I went to several toy stores and bought every single marble they had until I had 1,000. I took them home and put them inside of a large, clear plastic container right here in my workshop next to the radio. Every Saturday since then, I have taken one marble out and thrown it away. I found that by watching the marbles diminish, I focused more on the really important things in life. "There is nothing like watching your time here on this earth run out to help get your priorities straight.<br><br>Now let me tell you one last thing before I sign off with you and take my lovely wife out for breakfast..." "...This morning, I took the very last marble out of the container. I figure if I make it until next Saturday then Life has blessed me with a little extra time to be with my loved ones. It was nice to talk to you, Tom; I hope you spend more time with your loved ones, and I hope to meet you again someday. Have a good morning!"<br><br>You could have heard a pin drop when he finished. Even the show's moderator didn't have anything to say for a few moments. I guess he gave us all a lot to think about. I had planned to do some work that morning and then go to the gym. Instead, I went upstairs and woke my wife up with a kiss. "C'mon honey, I'm taking you and the kids to breakfast." "What brought this on?" she asked with a smile. "Oh, nothing special," I said. "It has just been a long time since we spent a Saturday together with the kids. Hey, can we stop at a toy store while we're out? I need to buy some marbles." May all your Saturdays be special and may you have many happy years after you lose all your<br>marbles.<br><br>Copyright (c) 2004 Dean Hawk Ministries All rights reserved.

            <div class='col-md body'>"After your morning meditation, have breakfast. Greeting your family in the morning is also part of Dharma practice. Many people are grumpy in the morning. They sit at the breakfast table, pouring over the newspaper or reading the back of the cereal box for the umpteenth time. When their bright-eyed children greet them, they grunt and, without looking up, keep reading. When their partner asks them a question, they don't respond, or they glance at them for a moment with a look that says, "Don't bother me." Later, they wonder why they have problems in the family!<br>.... It's easy to bark orders at your children, "Get up!" "Brush your teeth!" "Why are you wearing that? It looks terrible! Change clothes!" "Stop playing around and eat breakfast." "Hurry up and get to school. You're late." Many children will react as unruly subordinates when treated in this way. But if you greet your children with love and firmly help them navigate everything in their morning routine, they'll be happier and so will you."<br><br>A nice explanation from Taming the Mind by Thubten Chodron</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE LOST SON<br><br>"A young widower, who loved his five year old son very much, was away on business when bandits came who burned down the whole village and took his son away. When the man returned, he saw the ruins and panicked. The took the burnt corpse of an infant to be his son and cried uncontrollably. He organised a cremation ceremony, collected the ashes and put them in a beautiful little bag which he always kept with him.<br>Soon afterwards, his real son escaped from the bandits and found his way home. He arrived at his father's new cottage at midnight and knocked at the door. The father, still grieving asked: "Who is it?" The child answered, it is me papa, open the door!" But in his agitated state of mind, convinced his son was dead, the father thought that some young boy was making fun of him. He shouted: "Go away" and continued to cry. After some time, the child left.<br>Father and son never saw each other again."<br>After this story, the Buddha said: "Sometime, somewhere, you take something to be the truth. If you cling to it so much, even when the truth comes in person and knocks on your door, you will not open it."<br><br><img src="http://img131.exs.cx/img131/516/prawn13xy.jpg"></div>
