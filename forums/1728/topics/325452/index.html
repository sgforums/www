              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Before chanting:</span></p>
              <p>Point 1) I think you had answered it yourself, just rinse to make sure no food particle etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point 2) If I took meat or garlic and if the smell is strong, I will chew some mint sweets first. And about eating garlic that will pissed devas off and attract spirits, this one is what the older generation passed down, true or not I don't know. But personal experience is, once you started chanting, be it buddha/pusa-name, mantra or sutra, spirits will come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point 3) Usually my own morning puja, I just do it in singlet and shorts after I wash-up. I think not wrong to take off shirt to chant but I will feel weird if I am going to do it. On special day when I do special chanting I even put on haiqing, even if the weather is very hot. You're chanting at home what, after chanting can go for shower, so no big issue.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point 4) Examples of what?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After chanting:</span></p>
              <p>Point 1) Why not? Unless you're doing the observation of the 8 precepts or that you have certain practice of avoidance of taking meat on certain days, commonly 1st and 15th of the lunar month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point 2) 1 day, for conventional convenience would be what you had mentioned, midnight to midnight. Strictly speaking, it should be following the time that was observed during Buddha's time, which I suppose no one would have any idea how was it measured. If you follow the Chinese Mahayana tradition, you can consider following the Chinese lunar calender way. I followed that, and to me, 1 day is 11pm to 11pm (of the next day), å­�æ—¶è‡³å­�æ—¶.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Point 3) Example of what again?</p>

              <p>I see.. yes both Thusness and Longchen also told me in their experience that fasting and vegetarianism helps improve strength of non-dual clarity. Longchen now eats only one meal a day.</p>
              <p>Thusness also told me last year that meditative experience tells him that diet is very important till one point one will want to become vegetarian, and that fasting is also important. But he still isn't full vegetarian (maybe because of business, etc). He also said that the body will undergo transformation after the stabilization of non-dual experience and he guessed that's how shariras form, it's a crystal clear feeling.</p>
              <p>He also mentioned that deep sleep becomes very important especially after non-dual as it is a very deep form of samadhi,  but till a certain stage it will reduce to very few hours. I think many practitioners also experience sleep need reduced. Both Thusness and Longchen sleep about 4 hours a day, my Master also sleep about 4 hours a day if I remember correctly. Buddha sleeps only 1 hour a day.</p>

              <p>1) How do enlightened beings ( true buddhist practitioners but not monks ) living in our modern world have kids or consummate ?  when they have to discipline their minds. It is said in the sutra that consummation is only allowed in the night. . At night , true buddhist practitioner may have to chant , meditate or perform other night buddhist practises. I am puzzled how married couples can have their intimacy without clashing night buddhist practises ? </p>
              <p>2) By sleeping only 4 hours or less per day , is it because the spiritual mind is so strong that it has the ability to ignore or doesnt require mundane needs like sleeping &amp; eating. True practitioner need to fast and eat less to help them in his practice. A layman needs to sleep 8 hours and to have 3 complete meals to stay healthy , then he is able to work.</p>
              <p>May i know is it possible to explain the true practitioner's eating and sleeping habits in scientific ways ? How do we explain it ?</p>
              <p>3) Some punjas doesnt allow one to consume orange pulps on the actual day of performing punjas ? What is the rationale behind it ?</p>
              <p>4) What is the minimun status of an enlightened being ? At least an arhat ? An enlightned being doesnt have to be buddha , so what is the definition of it ?</p>
              <p>5) Not allow to wear shorts or bermudas to temples ? Only pants is allowed ?</p>
              <p>6) People we meet on the buses or along the street are actully people whom we have met in our past or many , many previous lives ?</p>
              <p>7) In a punja , supposedly we are told to repeat after the Rinpoche , to say  some vows. The Rinpoche recites  too quickly , the participants cant follow  and cant pronounce correctly , i am puzzled if the punja is consider a complete and effective one ?</p>

              <p>a few more AFAIK tips:-</p>

              <p>You can chant, meditate, or perform other things at other times. Actually it is best to chant and meditate in the morning.</p>
              <p>Also, at certain stage an enlightened being will transcend sexual desires. But as Thusness said that is only after deep insight into the arising and passing away, which is roughly the Anagami stage. The sutras also state that Anagamis (third out of four levels of enlightenment in the Hinayana path, leading to Arhathsip) and above transcended such desires. There are also certain correlations with the Bodhisattva bhumi models.</p>

              <p>Because such a person has no worries and attachment, when he sleeps he just sleeps, and sleeps very deeply and can completely let go. He enters into the deepest non-dual samadhi. As Thusness says, because one has a very deep sleep, the next day he becomes awake, clear, fresh, energetic and vibrant. The intensity is even more fantastic.</p>
              <p>This is related to the seven factors of enlightenment. One can measure in terms of clarity, vitality and luminosity. Hence, when this is continuously sustained, sleep naturally shortens.</p>
              <p>A very popular author now, Eckhart Tolle, describes this pretty well:<em><span style='font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: "MS Shell Dlg","sans-serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-SG">"You take a journey into the Unmanifested every night when you
                                                                  enter the phase of deep dreamless sleep. You merge with the Source. You draw
                                                                  from it the vital energy that sustains you for a while when you return to the
                                                                  manifested, the world of separate forms. This energy is much more vital than
                                                                  food: "Man does not live by bread alone." But in dreamless sleep, you
                                                                  don't go into it consciously. Although the bodily functions are still
                                                                  operating, "you” no longer exist in that state. Can you imagine what it
                                                                  would be like to go into dreamless sleep with full consciousness? It is
                                                                  impossible to imagine it, because that state has no content."</span></em></p>
              <p>(But due to the lack of non-dual insight, Eckhart Tolle made the mistake by thinking that <span style='font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: "MS Shell Dlg","sans-serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-SG">'<em>The Unmanifested does not liberate you until you enter it consciously.''</em> This is due to strong clinging to an unchanging Witness presence, and not realising its non-dual nature, that Presence cannot be separated from manifestation and conditions and isn't limited to consciousness. Therefore his understanding is more like the Hindu level of enlightenment. As Thusness says, </span><em><span style='font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: "MS Shell Dlg","sans-serif"; color: black;' lang="EN-SG">when one is able to let go
                          and let everything subside, even the loss of consciousness, it is a more
                          profound state instead.)</span></em></p>
              <p>As for eating habits, my guess is also it has to do with what Eckhart Tolle explained. You also notice that meditators sometimes do not eat for months in meditation. But the body's energy can be sustained even so.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Aryas/enlightened beings can refer to anyone starting from the Sotapanna stage (stream enterer, 1st out of 4 levels of enlightenment to Arhatship) or the 1st Bhumi Bodhisattva stage (1st out of 10 levels of enlightenment to Buddhahood).</p>
              <p>Even at the 1st level, the arya will have already had a intuitive insight and experience into Ultimate Reality (emptiness). But at that stage one has not achieve full liberation. So the insights have to deepen and unfold, the practitioner has to go through many more cycles of refinement and burn away the bonds and karmic propensities of the 8th consciousness.</p>
