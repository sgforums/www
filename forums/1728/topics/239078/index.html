If you do not know where your mind and eyes are, you will not be able to conquer the wearisome dust.<br>"For example, when a King's country is invaded by thieves and he sends out his troops to suppress and banish them. The troops must know where the thieves are.<br>"It is the fault of your mind and eyes that you flow and turn. I am asking you specifically about your mind and eyes: Where are they now?"<br>Ananda said to the Buddha, "World Honored One, all the ten kinds of living beings in the world alike maintain that the conscious mind dwells within the body; and as I regard the Tathagata's blue lotus-flower eyes, they too are on the Buddha's face.<br>I now observe that these prominent organs, four kinds of defiling objects, are on my face, and so, too, my conscious mind actually is within my body."<br>The Buddha said to Ananda, " You are now sitting in the Tathagata's lecture hall looking at the Jeta Grove. Where is it at present?"<br>"World Honored One, this great many-storied pure lecture hall is in the Garden of the Benefactor of the Solitary. At present the Jeta Grove is in fact outside the hall."</strong><br><br>In this section, Buddha points out slowly the need to find out the culprit of the monkey mind ,and nab it so as to held it under leash, so one will not create bad karma and leads to disaster<br><br></div>

To resolve the assemblyÂ’s disputes.<br><br>The Buddha had many disciples who were old cultivators Â– senior members of the assembly who had much more Way-virtue than Ananda. Ananda had just recently attained the fourth stage of Arhatship, while among the assembly were many who had long been fourth-stage Arhats. If Ananda had simply spoken the sutras, most of them would not have paid him due respect. But by saying Â“Thus I have heard,Â” he made it clear that what they were about to hear was not a sutra spoken by Ananda himself, but rather a sutra he heard the Buddha speak. Therefore, no one could argue. </strong></div>
