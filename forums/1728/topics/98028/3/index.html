The Buddha explains that when our world system disintegrates, as it regularly does after extremely long periods of time, the lower sixteen planes are all destroyed. Beings disappear from all planes below the seventeenth, the plane of the Abhassara gods. Whatever beings cannot be born on the seventeenth or a higher brahma plane then must take birth on the lower planes in other remote world systems.<br><br>Eventually the world starts to re-form. Then a solitary being passes away from the Abhassara plane and takes rebirth on the plane of Maha Brahma. A palace created by his kamma awaits him there: "There he dwells, mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the air, abiding in glory. And he continues thus for a long, long time." After ages pass, he becomes lonely and longs for other beings to join him. It just so happens that shortly after the brahma starts craving for company, other beings from the Abhassara plane, who have exhausted their lifespans there, pass away and are reborn in the palace of Brahma, in companionship with him.<br><br>Because these beings seemed to arise in accordance with the first brahma's wish, he becomes convinced that he is the almighty God: "I am the Great Brahma, the Vanquisher... the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Supreme Being." The other brahmas, seeing that he was already present when they took birth in his world, accept his claim and revere him as their creator.<br><br>Eventually this misconception of a Creator God spreads to the human plane. One of the other brahmas passes away and is reborn here. He develops concentration and learns to recollect his previous life with Maha Brahma, but none of his lives before that. Recollecting that existence he recalls that Maha Brahma was considered the "father of all that are and are to be... permanent, stable, eternal." As he is unable to remember further back, he believes this to be absolute truth and propounds a theistic doctrine of an omnipotent Creator God (Net 69-70, 155-66).<br><br>The Venerable Ledi Sayadaw, a highly renowned Myanmar scholar-monk of the first part of this century, gave a careful analysis of the powers of Maha Brahma in his Niyama Dipani (MB pp. 138-39). He states that although Maha Brahma can perform all sorts of transformations, he cannot actually create independent creatures, change the kammic law of cause and effect, or keep anyone from growing old or dying. Brahma can use his special powers to transport a man to the brahma plane for a short visit, but he cannot ensure that someone will be reborn there.<br><br><strong><br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why does he order such misfortune<br>And not create concord? sace hi so issaro sabbaloke<br>BrahmÃ¢ bahÃ»bhÃ»tapati pajÃ¢na.m<br>ki.m sabbaloke vidah alakkhi.m<br>ki.m sabbaloka.m na sukhi.m akÃ¢si<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Why prevail deceit, lies and ignorance<br>And he such inequity and injustice create? sace hi so issaro sabbaloke<br>BrahmÃ¢ bahÃ»bhÃ»tapati pajÃ¢na.m<br>mÃ¢yÃ¢musÃ¢vajjamadena c'api<br>loka.m adhammena kimatthakÃ¢si<br>If the creator of the world entire<br>They call God, of every being be the Lord<br>Then an evil master is he, (O Aritta)<br>Knowing what's right did let wrong prevail! sace hi so issaro sabbaloke<br>BrahmÃ¢ bahÃ»bhÃ»tapati pajÃ¢na.m<br>adhammiyo bhÃ»tapat Ari.t.tha<br>dhamme sat yo vidahi adhamma.m<br></strong><br><br>Sorry... if anyone wants to argue about this, can create new topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I am merely presenting the Buddhist views on theistic doctrines.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There's something I would like to point out...<br><br>Wisdom is not intelligence. Buddha's wisdom is different from the intelligence ordinary people have. Intelligence depends on our mental capability to think, but Buddha's wisdom arises from practice of Prajnaparamita.<br><br>Wisdom and Intelligence is different - an intelligent scientist can create a bomb to kill many people, but a wise one will use his wisdom to save many people. This is because his knowledge is immense - his mind is able to think very well in accordance to scientific laws. However, Intelligence may be influenced and deluded by Greed, Hatred, and Ignorance, Self-Centred and selfish, but Buddha's wisdom shines through all darkness of the three poisons.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not really an area which I'm good at, partly because I'm not a Tibetan Buddhist, and would like to find out more. I do ask Origami from time to time about Tibetan Buddhism, but I will try to explain as much as possible here.<br><br>I would say.. the Tibetan Buddhism is quite special as compared to other streams of Buddhism, as there are some differences to be noted of, and you need thorough understandings of it before jumping to any conclusions or slanders. Tantric is one of the paths taught by Buddha, Buddha has turned the Dharma Wheel thrice: First, is the expounding of Hinayana teachings. Second, is the expounding of Mahayana teachings, and finally, the expounding of Tantric teachings.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The Tantric path seeks to transform basic human passions of desire and aversion into spiritual growth and development. Thus, instead of denying primal sexual and sensual urges as in traditional Buddhism, the practice of Tantra accepts these urges as sacred life force energy, which is purified and transformed into wholesome and healthy forces connecting the individual with higher spiritual awareness. In order to be successful with Tantric work, one must have skill in both self-control and acceptance of self and others.</span><br><a href="http://www.thewildrose.net/tibetan_buddhism.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thewildrose.net/tibetan_buddhism.html</a><br><br>Also, have you realised those tangkas with sexual showings are not Buddhas?<br><br>Only those marked with the 32 Major Marks and 81 Minor Marks are considered "Buddhas". The rests are the Tibetan-style of deities as part of the practice, visualisation object, for a vajrayana practitioner.<br><br>No, Shakyamuni Buddha did not have sex even once ever since he has attained enlightenment. <strong>It is important to note that ALL ARHATS, BUDDHAS HAVE TRANSCENDED WORLDLY DESIRES.</strong> It is clearly stated in the Four Noble Truth expounded by the Buddha soon after his enlightenment, that <strong>Desire Causes Sufferings</strong>, and <strong>Buddha have became enlightened and transcended all his desires</strong>. It is in fact that, when Mara (the evil one, the heavenly devil) who have come to disturb Buddha's practice of Meditation, that Buddha did not get at all affected and remained in his meditational concentration. A Buddhist tantrist, tantric sex practice (doesn't exist in Singapore, I believe), is totally different from ordinary worldly sex. A Tantric Practitioner practices without Desire and lust. If he does have desire and lust, then it would not be "tantric", and will sure to bring children <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">, but not so for those who practiced according to the tantra.<br><br>Anyway, I'm not a Tibetan Buddhist. I'm sure when Origami comes here, he'll be able to answer your question much better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Higher tantric practise touches on very subtle levels of the mind. All desires and delusions are supressed. We visualise ourselves as the specific deity. The woman u see is the consort. It signifies the bliss we experience during orgasm. I once asked a sangha about this experience and was told that thru practise, it is like multple orgasms. Usually when people hear this, they start to have opinions. But understand that these sanghas are high practitioners who have supressed their desires. The feeling of bliss is different from the physical sense we experience but on a mental level, it is similar.<br><br>Usually we only practise such tantric practise on solitary deities. Only high practitioner practise with consorts. We who have not yet supressed such desires only will bring harm to ourselves. That is why whenever people see such paintings or pictures, they always get confused.</div>
