              <blockquote>
              <p>[Q]: Rinpoche I have a question and that concerns the dying bardo and organ 
              donations. Some tantric teachers say when one is dying if you give away your 
              organs it sort of interferes with the dying bardo. Is that true?<br>[A]: If you 
              are a good tantric practitioner, you have got good instructions, and you have 
              been practising for some time, then I would say, better not because you have 
              quite a good chance to to reach enlightenment there. Your organs will only help 
              one or two people. Your getting enlightenment will help billions. Having said 
              that, if you are not a good tantric practitioner but you are <em>an aspiring 
              Mahayana practitioner, a bodhisattva,</em> you can’t really do these deity practices 
              then by all means I would encourage you to give. An act of compassion is 
              priceless. Even managing to help one sentient being is worth it.</p>

              <p>I reckon he meant to create human forms for the sentient beings and teach them dharma... but i felt it's a double-edged sword... because they come to "here" and will suffer. And also, more humans mean more competition... food etc necessities.</p>
              <p>History often tells us if a country is too populated war will come... more suffering will come...  but i'm just digressing lol</p>

              <p>Relationship you dont have much choice. When it comes it comes!! The only people who have the choice is those sublime beings, those who have no more karma, no more emotions, then they can choose. Oh okay today I am going to have relationship, tomorrow I am going to pause the relationship and start day after tomorrow. For people like you and me we have no control. Sometimes you even think that I have enough of relationship or I am not going to have any relationship or even you think like I am not good or nobody is going to like me. Even if you think like that when your karmic blows relationship doesn't come out of nowhere. If there is no circumstances like that even though you are the most beautiful or good looking and you have everything and you are very confident it will be dry like a Sahara desert, nothing, no relationship. So, important about relationship is not to have too much expectations, little bit of expectation we have as human beings but thats alright. We have too strong expectations both negative and positive. Oh I am going to have or I am never going to have it. Too strong decisons and expectations always ruins the relationship. If you are a couple I think its good to think like...your attitude should be like you have checked in a hotel for few days togather and soon the guests are going to go away separate. Its a temporary thing. Like I might never see her again tomorrow, this may be our last goodbye, may be it help. It will bring preciousness of the relationship. If it comes you should not be afraid and you should have relationship. If it doesnt happen then again you should not be too hard on this.</p>

              yea, regrading "relationship" or rather 'marriage', i heard at his talk, that it's as difficult as becoming a monk or ordained. it could be like a training process in terms of taking hardship. maybe goes with raising children. just need to know impermanence in the process.
