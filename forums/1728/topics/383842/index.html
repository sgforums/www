              <h2>The future of Buddhism in a post-baby boomer world</h2>
              <p></p>
              <p>Introduction by Diana Winston</p>
              <p>In 1990, attending my first three-month meditation retreat, I had the
               dubious distinction of being one of three people—in a room of one 
              hundred—under the age of thirty-five. I felt isolated, wondering why 
              there were no others in my age range, but also a little bit proud and 
              “special.” I bemoaned missing the seventies, when all the teachers and 
              practitioners were my age—just starting out in their twenties and 
              thirties. (I also whined about missing the interesting gurus and 
              teachers who had died long before I ever started practicing.)</p>
              <p>In an earlier era, it was part of the zeitgeist to go off to Asia to 
              find oneself. But my generation (X), growing up in the Reagan years, was
               not encouraged to deviate from money-making careers. Spiritual 
              searching seemed so, well, seventies.</p>
              <p>The generation of young people after me seemed to pick up steam in 
              the dharma halls, but never quite took to it in the all-embracing way 
              you see in the sheer numbers of baby-boomers. Over the years, the dharma
               has become grayer, seeming more relevant to older generations, and 
              often intently focused on those heavenly messengers (old age, sickness, 
              and death), most of which seem a little distant from teenagers and 
              twenty-somethings. As centers age, young people often do not see their 
              experience reflected back to them. And affordability (discussed 
              significantly in the panel) has become more of an issue for young people
               as well, as dharma has become more expensive along with everything 
              else, with prices that are more appropriate to well-established older 
              people.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, there has been a small but important demographic shift.
               There are more young people at dharma centers than in the late eighties
               and nineties. Teen and young people retreats have contributed to 
              broadening the dharma, as have a series of books, websites, and 
              communities targeting young people. There is now a teacher-training 
              program at Spirit Rock where many of the trainees are under forty. Young
               people are practicing, undeniably, but as Sumi Loundon Kim points out 
              in the panel, they still account for a small percentage of the total 
              population of practitioners.</p>
              <p>So, here we are. Forty or fifty years after the big influx of dharma 
              to the West, we have a small but active and growing population of young 
              practitioners. But what of the future, when the baby boomers are gone? 
              What will become of the dharma with a relatively small number of young 
              people waiting in the wings? To increase the numbers of young students, 
              does the dharma need to become more relevant to younger people? If so, 
              what will that look like?</p>
              <p>This forum offers a dynamic and lively exploration of these questions
               by a panel that encompasses a wide age range and a diverse set of 
              experiences. It’s clear from what the panelists have to say that the 
              dharma is not dying, but it <em>is</em> morphing. The panel explores new 
              forms that dharma is taking within younger circles, forms that may 
              deviate from the style of practice in their parents’ generation, 
              including more social and environmental engagement. The panel looks at 
              questions of innovation versus tradition. Will technology draw youth in 
              or alienate them from the dharma, and how can its power be harnessed? 
              The panelists offer perspectives on dharma’s integration into the 
              American culture and what will speak loudest and most significantly to 
              youth. They question identity—are Buddhists Buddhist? And they look 
              carefully at issues of inclusivity and affordability, offering some 
              thoughtful suggestions on how to bring more youthful energy into dharma 
              practice and centers. Finally, community features big in this panel, as 
              it is here that young people are finding the most relevant applications 
              to their lives.</p>
              <p>Twenty years after my first retreat, I can say that the dharma is 
              absolutely relevant to young people, as this panel shows us. And the 
              inclusion of youth in the future of the dharma will only create a vital,
               exciting new form of Buddhism(s). The dharma is far from dying out, but
               its future expressions may take us by surprise. I can’t wait to see 
              what it looks like!</p>

              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>From my experience of working to promote Buddhism to youth, I realise that the youth are not really that into the whole business of suffering and being mindful. They do not readily reflect on the illusory and impermenant nature of life. These usually come with some age or maturity. Usually, a youth would be more interested in going for things which stimulate their senses, eg playing computer games, watching movies, playing sports, playing pool, bowling, sitting around and chill over a nice drink, nice food, shopping etc. Youths tend to look outside for stimulation. Only some would be interested in introspection.</p>
              <p>Slowly, youths also start to realise the importance of money and some would soon be too busy chasing money to care about anything. That's why, it is usually only after chasing money for sometime, becoming a little tired of the world that people start to realise the merits of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Also, from my experience, for youths, fellowship between the members, care and concern for them is really important for keeping the youths to Buddhism. They have to feel a sense of belonging in Buddhism or the Buddhist organisation. However, Buddhism being Buddhism, an introspective religion, fellowship is not something that comes easily to many. We try, but it usually falls short. To do well, we really have to get those selected individuals with such a quality in their character to hype up the fellowship. And since these kinds of people are few and far between, it would be a little difficult. And since they are few and far between, they have to do a lot of hardwork which entails burn out. The other day, I was walking past a church near my house and I spotted teenagers there playing some sport in the hall, some others were playing pool in the air-con cafe space, some others playing table soccer and even playing xbox on the big screen. And I thought to myself, "Wow, so fun, I also would like to join the church!" So if we could show the fun in Buddhism, then we probably can get more youth in.</p>
              <p>However, having said that, there are many "cannots" in Buddhism which makes it a bit irritating for the youths. Eg. cannot eat meat in temples, cannot wear shorts etc. When I see these guys playing games in the church the way it is, I wonder if it is possible for them to do so in temples. And of course, the answer is no. Why? The temple is a place for cultivation, not some place to play. However, if we reflect on the past, maybe 20-30 years ago, small kids would usually follow their parents into temples and play hide and seek etc. They also play at temples. Just a different kind of play. These kids grow up being close to temples as the temples are a welcoming environment for them. They build close yuan2 (affinity) with the temples. However, nowadays, the kids do not have such opportunity. The only opportunity they have is going there for pujas, dharma talks, dana, and of course sunday school. Well, if we think about it,  pujas, dhamma talks and dana is nothing fun for kids. Most parents have a hard time keeping the kids from running about during such activities. Sunday schools entials being forced by parents to attend a class and a class is also not soimething which is fun. So where is the fun in Buddhism? Apparently not very much, unless you are into the introspection stuff.</p>
              <p>Other than that, temples in the past used to be "community centres" where people congregate on weekends and also weekdays with kids and food. Nowadays, the community spirit in the temples is missing. Everything is so strict, pure and clean that this hardly happens. The purity is sometimes stifling. We lose our ability to relate to the community. It is my belief that religious organisations should build close relationship to the community that they are situated in and come up with ways to integrate with the community and bring help to them. That's why sometimes when I see religious organisations offering day care services, I feel that they are really doing their job for the community. I mean, other than all the cultivation stuff, I feel temples should have a role to help the community in as many ways as they can. If Buddhist organisations lose their ability to relate to the communities and other people, then soon Buddhism would be lost.</p>
              <p>In conclusion, I think that it is a constant uphill battle to get youths into Buddhism with all the sensual stimulation culture here. And if we really want to do so, we have to learn to speak their language like a native and not just try to speak their language. No matter how we develop, we cannot lose our ability to communicate with our target audience. If not all will be lost.</p>

              their language like a native and not just try to speak their
              language. No matter how we develop, we cannot lose our ability to
              communicate with our target audience. If not all will be lost.</p>

              <p>Hi Emanrohe,</p>
              <p>I have read your text and I think the youths are active, caught up or too busy with studies and play...</p>
              <p>Perhaps we can organize more English Dharma talks. Most youths prefer English I think...</p>
              <p>There is 1 book I found at our National Libraries very useful... the book have drawings of Buddha's stories and theories of Buddhism in very light, simple to understand manner. If comics can interest youth, why we can't do in the same way...? Comic stripes are like sugar coats to the introduction of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>Once the youths are interested, they can wish to progress deeper, and of course, they will expect more difficult theories of Buddhism.</p>
              <p>We cannot force the youths to take vegetarian diet, as I read in this forum vegetarian is encouraged but not a must...</p>
              <p>I also suggest if buddhist centres can be certified by some authority groups or something... so that the public can have a peace of mind that they do not go into the wrong place and got wrong informations.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>To development a thriving lay Buddhist community, we shall first look from from perspective of core and peripheral activiities The first is the cultivation of self in Buddhist principles. This is currently availiable and we should make it as accessible as possible .                                        The second, periperhal, or supporting lay community, must have relevance and substainable enough to enduring.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Possibly by using a trickle down effect by first using or  creating a functioning gathering of like minded individuals .The subsequent creation of activities and canvassing of participants.  The fundamental is the application of Buddhist insight or the "awareness of" as constant process and also belated contemplation of phenomena , eg. debriefing in a non preachy, secular manner.                                                                                                         I believe initial focus has to be family oriented activities as the family is the sole perpetuating nucleus unit. Creating activities around it will never lose relevance   Look from the parent's/ child perspective to create activities. Ground the focus into the mundane and make it interesting! </p></div>
