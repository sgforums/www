This is for projects administered by the UN Trust Fund and UNIFEM.<br> <br> Please go to <a href="http://www.saynotoviolence.org/">www.saynotoviolence.org </a>and simply sign your name.<br> <span style="color: red;">The campaign will end on 8th March 2008.</span><br> <br> So far, only 40,000 plus names collected. Pls help... cos date is nearing. Spread this message to your email friends.<br> <br> More info below:<br> <br> <br> <strong>What is the violence going on?</strong><br> Amnesty International says the torture of women was reported in every
              armed conflict it investigated between 1999 and 2000, most often in the
              form of sexual violence.<br> <br> Rape, when used as a weapon of war, is systematically employed for a
              variety of purposes, including intimidation, humiliation, political
              terror, extracting information, rewarding soldiers, and "ethnic
              cleansing," says Amnesty International. "Violence against women in
              armed conflict situations is largely based on traditional views of
              women as property, and often as sexual objects."<br> <br> <strong>Wars and conflicts still going on in parts of Africa:</strong><br> "Despite the fact the women bear much of the responsibility of taking care of many families here in Africa, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is a shame that violence against women is a menace that has persisted over the years</span>.
              Of course, this problem is not limited to Africa but is somewhat more
              common here. This would not be unconnected to wide-spread poverty and
              some bad cultural practices."<br> <br> "The new study notes that between 1990 and 2007, nearly 900 Chilean
              women were killed, mostly by their partners or ex-partners, while in
              the Bahamas in 2000, almost half of all murders committed were
              feminicides – <span style="text-decoration: underline;">women
              being killed at the hands of their partners or because of their gender
              status – and rose to 44 per cent in 2001 and 53 per cent in 2002."</span><br> <br> <strong>Where will the funds go?</strong><br> [Recipients of the Fund’s grants “are showing how to address the
              interlinkages of violence against women and HIV/AIDS, how to involve
              men and boys in ending violence against women and how to reach
              marginalized groups – such as rural indigenous women – so that they,
              too, can benefit from improved laws and policies on ending violence
              against women,”] - UNIFEM Acting Executive Director Joanne Sandler.<br> <br> <span style="color: blue;">“The more names we collect, the stronger our case to
              make ending violence against women a top priority for governments
              everywhere.” - Nicole Kidman.</span></p>
