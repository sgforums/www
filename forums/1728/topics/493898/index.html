              <p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-size: 9.0pt;">Larry Yudelson April 20,
              2017, The Jewish Standard</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Teaneck
              professor updates his book on religious violence</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              hindsight, Dr. Charles Selengut’s 2003 book, “Sacred Fury: Understanding
              Religious Violence,” didn’t talk enough about Buddhism. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">It’s
              an oversight that became increasingly clear as his book was adopted in
              classrooms around the world — and when Buddhist monks played a leading role in
              ethnic violence in Myanmar that killed 200 people in 2012. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              it’s an oversight that has been fixed in the new third edition of the book,
              which came out earlier this year.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dr.
              Selengut, who lives in Teaneck, is a professor of sociology at the County
              College of Morris. “Sacred Fury” tries to understand religious violence through
              the lenses of sociology, psychology, and theology. His thesis is that violence
              carried out in the name of religion cannot be separated from the religion
              itself.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Some
              is pure religion, some is the interplay of religion and politics, but it’s
              incorrect to say that religion has nothing to do with violence,” he said. “All
              religions have elements that encourage violence against those who disagree with
              them or challenge their theology.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“If
              someone says Islam has nothing do with religious violence or jihad, they don’t
              know what they’re talking about,” he continued. “Look at the sermons in
              mosques, and you can see how they’re encouraged to do violence.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Even
              violence not directly motivated by religion can be legitimized by it, Dr.
              Selengut said. “Think of Hinduism. Hindu nationalists want to be certain that
              India remains a Hindu country, so the masses are encouraged to take action
              against any religions that aren’t Hindu.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Ordinarily,
              Hinduism and Buddhism are viewed as religions of nonviolence. But the reality
              is there have been major killings in Hinduism and Buddhism.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">How
              is that possible?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“If
              the religion is threatened and the motivation of the violent religious people
              is not just out of anger, but is for the religion, that’s not called violence,”
              Dr. Selengut said. “The violence is reinterpreted as nonviolence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“In
              Hinduism, if someone undertakes violence to protect the Hindu gods or
              institutions from a pure motivation, not from personal anger or rage, that
              killing is considered sacred killing. That put it into an entirely other realm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It’s
              a kind of dichotomy in the religion. People in the West often don’t know about
              it. You can have people so anti-killing that they’re vegetarians, yet the same
              adherents of the religion can be very violent against those who challenge their
              beliefs.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              of course, religious violence is not coming just from Hindus and Buddhists.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">One
              addition to this edition of Dr. Selengut’s book is a discussion of ISIS.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“There
              is an international Muslim movement based on their ideology, which argues that
              Islam needs to be the leading religion all over the world, that Islam has to be
              the progenitor of morals and government authority.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Often,
              the religion’s scriptures themselves encourage violence,” he continued. You
              just have to listen to what ISIS says.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Or
              the extremist Christians who kill abortion doctors. In extreme anti-abortion
              groups this is considered legitimate theology. The Christian advocates against
              abortion doctors call it the Phineas Option. You’ll know it from Pinchas in the
              Torah. Just as in the Torah Pinchas killed Zimri” — acting zealously for God’s
              sake without a specific Divine command — “they use this as the ultimate
              religious justification.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">So
              why is this upsurge in religious violence happening now?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              wish I could answer that question,” Dr. Selengut said.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“One
              reason is the movement of globalization. As long as religions stayed in their
              own enclaves, there was no need for any interaction between different
              religions. Often religion renews itself. It goes in cycles. Religions become
              more moderate. Over time the essentials reassert themselves. We see that in
              contemporary Judaism as well. After a modernization of American Judaism, the
              internal life of Judaism moved back to the fundamentals.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">And
              religious fundamentalism leads to religious violence.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Because
              its beliefs are so strong, fundamentalism doesn’t permit pluralism or
              diversity,” Dr. Selengut said. “There is only one truth, and we must protect
              that truth. That feeling of us against them, that we are right and everybody
              else is wrong, permits the elements of a religion that do encourage violence to
              come forth. There are notions of violence in all religions but often they’re
              dormant. With fundamentalism these elements are rediscovered. That encourages
              the violent outbursts.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“We
              see that even in Judaism. In Meah Shearim recently, they beat up a soldier with
              peyos, because he was charedi but joined the army. Fundamentalism gives such
              power.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">What
              can be done to stop religious violence?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It
              has to be two-pronged,” Dr. Selengut said. “A lot of it is up to the religious
              leaders themselves. The people who know the texts, who are part of the
              tradition, have to stand up and say that violence is a misreading of the
              tradition, an exaggeration.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“All
              the statements against religious violence in the New York Times don’t mean
              anything. When an iman who has standing as a very religious and learned and
              sacred figure takes on religious violence, that would have power.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              think it’s the same thing in Judaism and Christianity. Religions can only be
              transformed internally. It can’t be transformed by outsiders who are not privy
              to the theological thinking of a religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“The
              other prong is practical. When people break the law or engage in violence,
              government authorities have to stop them.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Do
              different religions have different limitations in how violent they can get?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“There’s
              enough in each religion so that astute students of the religion can probably
              legitimate any kind of violence,” Dr. Selengut said. “In Judaism, the terrible,
              heartbreaking example would be Yigal Amir, who assassinated Prime Minister
              Yitzhak Rabin. There were those who said there was a group of rabbis who
              legitimated what he did.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“It’s
              the same thing in other religions. The vast, vast majority of Christians are
              against killing abortion doctors, but there is a subset that would define that
              as legitimate.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dr.
              Selengut said the roots of religious violence lie in the nature of religion.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“Religion
              is different than any other kind of commitment, because religion has to do with
              what is the ultimate truth,” he said. “I take it on faith. I don’t have to
              logically or rationally defend what I’m doing. What I do religiously partakes
              of another calculus, another reality, a truth beyond rational or ordinary life.
              I don’t have to consider other elements</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“For
              example, in politics, considering whether to bomb Syria or not — I have to
              think what are the consequences, politically, economically, internationally.
              It’s a rational calculation. In religion, I’m not bound by these calculations.
              I know that it’s true, I do it, and God told me to do it. I don’t have to worry
              about logical objections and rational considerations.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">Dr.
              Selengut isn’t sure what his next writing project will be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I’m
              thinking about trying to do more storytelling,” he said. “I’m thinking of doing
              a bit of memoir about my own childhood. What it meant growing up in the ‘50s.
              How the Jewish world changed.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">“I
              grew up on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. My parents were second generation
              Americans. Orthodox Jews were a minority of a minority. When I was a little
              boy, when they said Yizkor the shul was packed. People left work to say Yizkor.
              Their grandchildren wouldn’t do that.”</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">That’s
              not the only transformation Dr. Selengut has seen.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNoSpacing" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 13.0pt;">In
              high school, he studied with Rabbi Yaakov Kamenetsky, who was one of the
              leaders of American charedi Orthodox Judaism until his death in 1986, and whose
              son is a leader in that community today.</span></p>
