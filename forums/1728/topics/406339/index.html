              <p>There are many heavenly deities practicing Buddhism. They are in the heavenly realm which is also within the 6 reincarnation path, they also hope to end the rebirth cycles. So, don't be surprised that heavenly deities are also Dharma protectors.</p>
              <p>Heavenly deities ï¼ˆä»™ï¼‰need to continue to create good karma in order to stay in the heavenly realm. What I understand is many use the names of Goddess of Mercy or other Buddha's name to help earthly people. That is why you see many mediums claim to be Goddess of Mercy or Buddhas. Actually, they are heavenly deities ï¼ˆä»™) or some other spirits who hope to have good karma. Of course, these are genuine mediums who wish to help but there are many others who are con man or evil spirits.</p>
              <p>When the mediums (who are in trance) pass by a Buddha statue, they will also bow to Buddha 3 times. I had seen it many times.</p>

              Hi Knightlll
              
              As not much detail has been given, so is rather hard to pinpoint if that particular deity is a dharma protector. 
              
              Basically, in buddhism anyone can be a dharma protector, a god and even a demon who has repent from their evil away. A dharma protector is a being who choose to protect the correct Buddhist teaching and its practitioners. 
              
              Most of these protector looks fierce as it was said to ward off evil spirits. However, on the other hand it also symbolize the tremendous effort a practitioner need to undertakes to overcome his 3 poisons namely greed, ignorance and hatred in his own life.

              <p>I mean is the deity statue that I see, a bodhisattva ?</p>
              <p>Cos' I search online the deity is called ' Chao Gong Ming '. He is a wealth deity, one of the deities under the feng shen bang.</p>
              <p><a href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/30033.htm">http://baike.baidu.com/view/30033.htm</a></p>
              <p>The most famous one is the Story ofè¶™å…¬æ˜Ž Zhao Gong Ming {Tio Kong Beng} which was written inå°�ç¥žæ¦œ Feng Shen Bang (List of Gods’ Bestowal). It was told in Feng Shen Bang as follows:</p>
              <p>Emperor Zhou Wang {Tiu Ong} from Shang Kingdom ordered Wen Zhong {Bun Tiong} his well-known general, to attack Xi Chi, a defending basis of Wen Wang {Bun Ong} troops. To achieve that purpose, Wen Zhong asked for help from 6 sick people to form row formation called Shi Jue Zhen {Si Ciap Tin} – Ten Rows of Destroyers. Butå§œå­�ç‰™ Jiang Zi Ya succeeded to destroy 6 of them. Watching his defeat, Wen Zhong asked Zhao Gong Ming’s help which was at that time was living as a hermit at the cave of Lou Fu Dong, E Mei Shan {Go Bi San} Mountain.</p>
              <p>Zhao Gong Ming stated his readiness/ willingness to help. When he came down from the mountains, a big tiger attacked. That tiger couldn’t do anything under accusation of his 2 fingers. Then he rode the tiger that was tied its neck with angkin (a kind of cloth). On the forehead of the tiger was stuck a sheet of Hu (amulet letter). Afterward that tiger became his vehicle &amp; surrendered to his instruction.</p>
              <p>By riding the tiger, Zhao Gong Ming fought with Jiang Zi Ya. After several steps, Zhao Gong Ming took out his supernatural sharp weapon &amp; beat up Jiang Zi Ya until collapsed &amp; killed. But, Guang Cheng Zi {Kong Sheng Cu} came and then helped Zi Ya so that he lived again. Huang Long Zhen Ren {Wi Liong Cin Jin} got out and fought with Zhao Gong Ming, but he was captured by magic power rope of Zhao Gong Ming. Chi Jing Zi AND Cheng Zi were also knocked down by such hermit with many supernatural powers.</p>
              <p>Then Jiang Zi Ya obtained help from Xiao Sheng, a supernatural man from Wu Yi Shan Mountain. All last will and testament from Zhao Gong Ming were grabbed successfully. Since being ashamed, Zhao Gong Ming escaped to San Xian Dao Island (Island of 3 Gods) to meet Yun Xiao Niang Niang, a supernatural female hermit. Zhao Gong Ming borrowed a magic power scissors to Yun Xiao Niang Niang to retake his last will and testament seized by the enemies.</p>
              <p>It is found that that magic power scissors were 2 dragons that have changed their appearances, with extraordinary abilities. Many supernatural Gods from the circle of Jiang Zi Ya were cut into 2 parts &amp; killed due to these magic power scissors. Jiang Zi Ya was nervous, his soldiers also became fear. At this critical moment, arrived a Taoist from Gun Lun Shan {Kun Lun San} Mountain named Lu Ya. Lu Ya asked Jiang Zi Ya to create a doll made of grasses. On such grass-made doll body was put a piece of paper written the name of Zhao Gong Ming. In the head &amp; feet of doll were installed a little oil lamp. In the front of the said Zhao Gong Ming doll was performed worship for 21 days consecutively. Jiang Zi Ya, upon advice of Lu Ya, prayed there several days. He kept praying until one day Zhao Gong Ming felt his heart beat, his body was felt uncertain hot-cold. His spirit &amp; energy disappeared. On the 21st day, after washing his hair, Jiang Zi Ya stretched out an arch &amp; directed arrows to the left eye of the said grass-made doll. Zhao Gong Ming who was in the side of Shang troops, suddenly felt his left eye was severe ill &amp; then became blind. The next Jiang Zi Ya’s arrow was aimed at the right eye of Zhao Gong Ming’s doll &amp; the third arrow was aimed at its heart. Finally sick Zhao Gong Ming was killed by the arrow of Jiang Zi Ya.</p>
              <p>After Wen Wang successful in destroying Shang Troops &amp; established Zhou, Jiang Zi Ya Dynasties to perform the instructions of their Master in order to inaugurate the angles. Zhao Gong Ming was awarded the title Jin Long Ru Yi Zheng Yi Long Hu Xuan Tan Zhen Jun that in short was calledæ­£ä¸€çŽ„å£‡çœŸå�› Zheng Yi Xuan Tan Zhen Jun {Ceng It Hian Than Cin Kun}. Xuan Tan Zhen Jun had 4 escorts called è²¡ç¥žä½¿è€… Cai Shen Shi Zi, Envoy to God of Wealth, namely:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>æ‹›å¯³å¤©å°Šè•­å�‡Zhao Bao Tian Zun Xiao Sheng (Angle for Calling Magic Jewel)</li>
              <li>ç´�ç��å¤©å°Šéœ‡å¯³Na Zhen Tian Zun Zen Bao (Angle for Collecting Valuables)</li>

              <li>åˆ©å¸‚ä»™å®˜å§šå°‘å�¸Li Shi Xian Guan Yao Shao Si (Official of God of Benefit)</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Xuan Tan Zhen Jun together with his 4 escorts were often showed together in the form of picture &amp; called Wu Lu Cai Shen {Ngo Lo Cai Sin} – God of Wealth from Five Streets.</p>
              <p>This God of Wealth was often showed as a cruel faced- warlord with complete war attires, 1 hand clutched a sharp weapon &amp; other hand brought a chunk of gold, rode a black tiger. It constituted a description based on such Feng Shen Bang Book.</p>

              <p>personally my view is yes. </p>
              <p>the motif of all religions is to do good, and spread goodness so that others follow in that ideal direction. Be it a simple act or a great act of saving a person's life or even his country...but the real test comes with the ultimate question: Is killing justified to save another? </p>
              <p>On the surface, the answer is definitely no...and no one would agree with that openly. This question may seem so direct, but it is sadly ironical when one is faced with such a daunting situation i.e. euthanasia etc, which is a controversial topic that found no answers. However, one has to think very carefully and when it is decided that that is the best course, usually it follows an extremely painful and perhaps guilty aftermath on his or her life forever. <span style="font-size: 15.9722px;"> </span></p>
              <p>That much we can help but for all that we could...All too human....life is filled with too many such grey lines</p>

                      borrowed a magic power scissors to Yun Xiao Niang Niang to retake
                      his last will and testament seized by the enemies.</p>
              <p>It is found that that magic power scissors were 2 dragons that
                      have changed their appearances, with extraordinary abilities. Many
                      supernatural Gods from the circle of Jiang Zi Ya were cut into 2
                      parts &amp; killed due to these magic power scissors. Jiang Zi Ya
                      was nervous, his soldiers also became fear. At this critical
                      moment, arrived a Taoist from Gun Lun Shan {Kun Lun San} Mountain
                      named Lu Ya. Lu Ya asked Jiang Zi Ya to create a doll made of
                      grasses. On such grass-made doll body was put a piece of paper
                      written the name of Zhao Gong Ming. In the head &amp; feet of doll
                      were installed a little oil lamp. In the front of the said Zhao
                      Gong Ming doll was performed worship for 21 days consecutively.
                      Jiang Zi Ya, upon advice of Lu Ya, prayed there several days. He
                      kept praying until one day Zhao Gong Ming felt his heart beat, his
                      body was felt uncertain hot-cold. His spirit &amp; energy
                      disappeared. On the 21st day, after washing his hair, Jiang Zi Ya
                      stretched out an arch &amp; directed arrows to the left eye of the
                      said grass-made doll. Zhao Gong Ming who was in the side of Shang
                      troops, suddenly felt his left eye was severe ill &amp; then became
                      blind. The next Jiang Zi Ya’s arrow was aimed at the right eye of
                      Zhao Gong Ming’s doll &amp; the third arrow was aimed at its heart.
                      Finally sick Zhao Gong Ming was killed by the arrow of Jiang Zi
                      Ya.</p>
              <p>After Wen Wang successful in destroying Shang Troops &amp;
                      established Zhou, Jiang Zi Ya Dynasties to perform the instructions
                      of their Master in order to inaugurate the angles. Zhao Gong Ming
                      was awarded the title Jin Long Ru Yi Zheng Yi Long Hu Xuan Tan Zhen
                      Jun that in short was calledæ­£ä¸€çŽ„å£‡çœŸå�› Zheng Yi Xuan Tan Zhen Jun {Ceng

              <p>This God of Wealth was often showed as a cruel faced- warlord

                      other hand brought a chunk of gold, rode a black tiger. It

His name was Guan Yu (Guan Gong). He played a significant role in the civil war that led to the collapse of the Han Dynasty and the establishment of the Kingdom of Shu, of which Liu Bei was the first emperor.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.7em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6em; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;">During his years as General under Liu Bei’s reign, General Guan Yu had fought many battles and defeated many great warriors during the Three Kingdoms era. Then, near the end of the Three Kingdoms period, General Guan Yu lost his battle due to a surprised attack by Lu Meng’s forces from the rear. He was captured and beheaded by Sun Quan, lord of the Wu Kingdom. His spirit roamed the land, crying “Give me back my head!” Thus he came to Yuquan Hill outside Dangyang County (present day city of Dangyang, Hubei), where he met the same monk who saved his life at the temple outside Sishui Pass many years ago during his journey to reunite with Liu Bei. The monk said to Guan Yu’s spirit, “Now you ask for your head, but from whom should Yan Liang, Wen Chou, the guardians of the five passes and many others ask for theirs?” The spirit was enlightened and dissipated. It henceforth often manifested itself around the hill and protected the people in nearby villages. A temple was then built by the people on the hill to worship him.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.7em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6em; text-align: justify; padding: 0px;">During the last decade of the 6th century, during the Sui Dynasty, a temple named Yuquan Temple was built. Accordingly, it was to the first reverence of the Yuquan Temple, the spirit of General Guan Yu manifested itself and requested entrance into Buddhism. One of the temple halls, named Sangharama Hall, is dedicated to General Guan Yu.</p>
